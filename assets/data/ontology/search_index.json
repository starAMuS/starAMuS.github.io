Any description of the intentional act which is not covered by more specific FEs, including secondary effects (quietly, loudly), and general descriptions comparing events (the same way). In addition, it may indicate salient characteristics of an Agent that also affect the action ( deliberately, eagerly, carefully). An entity directed by the Agent that serves to bring about the Purpose of the Agent. An Instrument that has a function associated with it. The Outcome is the failure or success of the Agent's using the Instrument to achieve their Purpose. An event within which the Agent uses the Instrument. Often, the Containing_event will also give an indication of the Agent's Purpose. This frame element is defined as the number of times an event occurs per some unit of time. A Frequency expression answers the question 'how often.' This role modifies a clause with an iterative interpretation, which may be signified by the simple present tense on the main verb. Circumstances describe the state of the world (at a particular time and place) which is specifically independent of the event itself and any of its participants. This role describes a participant of the state of affairs introduced by the target as being in some state during the action. The depicted state does not necessarily or usually facilitate or cause the state of affairs reported by the target. The Explanation denotes a proposition from which the main clause (headed by the target) logically follows. This often means that the Explanation causes the target's proposition, but not in all cases. This role identifies the population within which the Using event occurs. This frame element selects some gradable attribute of the Instrument or the Using act and modifies the expected value for it. Duration denotes the length of time from the beginning of a continuous situation to its end. In many cases, the continuous situation is a dynamic action which is ongoing, while in others it is simply an undifferentiated state.","ancestors":["Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"descendants":["Attempt_means","Detonate_explosive","Expend_resource","Operating_a_system","Operate_vehicle","Use_firearm"]},{"id":"Vehicle_landing","frame_name":"Vehicle_landing","frame_definition":"A flying Vehicle comes to the ground at a Goal in a controlled fashion, typically (but not necessarily) operated by an operator.","core_roles":["Vehicle","Goal","Time","Place"],"all_roles":["Vehicle","Source","Path","Goal","Manner","Means","Mode_of_transportation","Cotheme","Time","New_situation","Depictive","Period_of_iterations","Circumstances","Purpose","Degree","Event_description","Re-encoding","Frequency","Place"],"role_definitions":"The Vehicle comes to the ground, usually (but not necessarily) under the control of an operator. Source is any expression which implies a definite starting-point of motion. While Source expressions are possible in this frame, they are relatively infrequent. Path is any description of a trajectory of motion which is neither a Source nor a Goal. In this frame, Path expressions almost always have a via-sense. Goal is any expression that tells where the Vehicle ends up, or would end up, as a result of the motion. A Manner expression describes a property of landing which is not directly related to the trajectory of motion. Descriptions of speed, steadiness, grace, means of motion, and other things count as Manner expressions. This role identifies the Means by which a Vehicle lands. The Mode_of_transportation expresses how the motion of the Vehicle is effected, by its body or by a vehicle which holds and conveys the Vehicle.
