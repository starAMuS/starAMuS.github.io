She has been collecting them for years , finding them in various books and corners of the internet and then saving them in her ever growing collection , which she shares through social media . Her current favorite \u2014 \u201c Law is written for the rich , punishment for the poor \u201d \u2014 is more than fitting for the novelist , poet , and activist , who strives to highlight those standing at the margins of society , whether through her novels or the various campaigns she has organized as a staff member of the grassroots social justice and anti-war movement , CODEPINK : Women for Peace . Born in Watertown , Massachusetts , Kricorian has received praise for her novels Zabelle ( 1998 ) , described as \u201c haunting and convincing \u201d by the New Yorker , and Dreams of Bread and Fire ( 2003 ) , in which we follow protagonist Ani Silver as she comes of age through romance and college , as well as through her family`s tragic past during the Armenian Genocide . \u201c Kricorian does for young women what James Joyce did for middle aged men , \u201d the Los Angeles Times Book Review swooned , \u201c she allows us to scramble safely amid the debris of new love , rejection , sex , and identity . \u201d Kricorian`s newest book , All the Light There Was , published in 2013 , tells the story of an Armenian family during the Nazi occupation of 1940s Paris , with fourteen - year - old Maral Pegorian vividly narrating . The heroine takes us deep into life during war in the neighborhood of Belleville , describing her brother`s involvement in the Resistance and her romance with Zaven , her brother`s close friend and neighbor . But as Zaven flees to avoid conscription , the war invades Maral`s life in ways she had n`t prepared for . Unlike her previous two novels , which drew on autobiographical inspiration , All The Light There Was represents new territory for the author , who threw herself into the Pegorians ' world so vividly that it began to invade her own reality . I spoke to Kricorian from her home in New York City , as she was deep in researching for her next novel , set in Beirut during the Civil War , whose characters , as you might have guessed , are Armenian . \u201c It `s the community I came from ; it`s what I know , \u201d Kricorian says of her concentration on the Armenian experience . \u201c It also has to do with my very deep concern for human rights , social justice , and truth telling , and I feel like there is still so much to be explored in the Armenian Diaspora experience . It ties in with all of my political concerns . \u201d Liana Aghajanian ( LA ) : Your novels all deal with some aspect of being Armenian , and more specifically , diasporan Armenian . What attracts you to writing in this specific cultural theme ? Nancy Kricorian ( NK ) : I grew up in the Armenian community . I grew up in a two - family house in Watertown , Massachusetts ; on the block where I grew up half the families were Armenian . I went to the Armenian church , and a third of my classmates at school were Armenian . I really was in the community and then I desperately wanted to get out of there , I wanted to get away , so when I went to college I thought , you know , \u201c I`m escaping , \u201d but then somehow it ended up that that is somewhere my imagination went . I ended up in this \u201c home \u201d place . LA : You go through this change and transformation and then at some point circle back to that . NK : But you come back in a different place ; you`re choosing how to be involved in that community and you are choosing . It 's not that you come full circle and come exactly back to the same place . It is that you come back to the themes and the concerns with a new set of tools that you have assembled after having left . LA : Your latest piece of work , All the Light There Was , took ten years to write and research . What was that process like ? NK : That was really , really long , but there were a couple of factors . The first two books were based on family experience and stories . With this one , my family was not in France during the occupation and I had to do extensive research . I know that different writers have different processes , but I really have to make sure that I have all the facts straight . It drives me crazy that I would have some anachronistic thing happening in the book , so I really wanted it to be as factually accurate as possible . And then the other two pieces were my kids . It turns out it is harder to have space in your head for your writing when your kids are going from the ages of seven to seventeen . When they`re younger , they are more physically exhausting , so you have more space in your head for your work , and then I found as they were older , they were more intellectually demanding . Also , in the meantime , I was working with CODEPINK . I was working thirty hours a week for this anti-war women`s organization , so that cut into it too . LA : You actually spent time in Paris . You wanted to experience what your characters were experiencing . Why was that so important for you ? NK : I had to build the whole place in my head . I had to have the apartment , the streets , the lyc\u00e9e , the park where she met with the guy she was seeing . Going to Paris was to help do that , reading voluminously about Belleville throughout the occupation , memoirs , letters , to actually build it in my head , so that when I was working on it , I went there . I only have probably two solid hours of writing in my head a day . It `s not like its twenty - four / seven for ten years ; it was more like Monday through Friday for two hours of the day I was in Paris during the occupation , and there were bits and pieces sort of flowing up off and on during the rest of the week . LA : During the writing process , you also thought your characters were coming alive ; at one point you were stockpiling your pantry . NK : I was thinking things like : \u201c Oh poor Maral , she has no soap , \u201d and then I look \u2014 I would stockpile all this soap , thinking , \u201c Well , if war ever came here , we would n`t have soap either . I better be saving the soap . \u201d [ laughs ] People have told me when they are reading the book that they feel hungry reading it and feel cold reading it , and I really felt that when I was working on it . The thing I was saying about building the place and going to it ? I was really in it , and so that sort of spilled over into this worry about cold and hungry and not having soap in my life here . When I told my husband my next book was going to be on Armenians in Beirut during the civil war , he said : \u201c Great , are you going to start collecting shell casings ? \u201d LA : How did you go about choosing a very young girl as your main character , and how did you transition from speaking in her voice rather than in an adult voice ? NK : I feel that it is told from the girl , but it`s really Maral as an adult , at least fifteen years after the war . It goes from when she`s age fourteen to age twenty - one . I think in addition to being interested in the Armenian diaspora experience , I am also deeply a feminist , and I`m really interested in a woman`s experience \u2014 it has to do with wanting to tell untold stories and also wanting to tell things from a woman`s point of view . There were books and films written about Missak Manouchian and the Armenian involvement in the French Resistance , but I didn`t want it to be heroic , where people were blowing things up and assassinating Nazis . I really wanted it to be how did an ordinary girl survive and live through this experience , and how do you stay humane and how do you live your daily life ? LA : The one word that I often use to describe what the collective Armenian experience is , is \u201c resilience . \u201d To have gone through everything \u2014 war , genocide , forced migration , and more \u2014 and to somehow survive all of that , \u201c resilience \u201d feels appropriate . How do you sum up the experience ? NK : The thing that I love about it is the sort of humor and sadness , but the word resilience is really a key word . I think what I have been thinking about a lot now , I keep thinking of Armenians as birds . Think about all the birds that are important to Armenians : there are songs and poems about them , like the crane and swallow . You just think about Armenians as birds who build nests that get knocked down again and again and again , and they just keep rebuilding them ; they move to another place and rebuild . I find that really fascinating and really inspiring . LA : I remember reading a piece you wrote about a talk you gave on a panel about the transmission of trauma . It involved an incident with a Turkish psychologist who denied the existence of any genocide . You said you weren`t someone who clings to victimhood as identity , yet the truth couldn`t be stolen from you in the name of dialogue . You`re the granddaughter of genocide survivors \u2014 can you explain the transmission of trauma ? NK : It `s this idea that you grow up with these stories that are being told to you \u2014 you grow up with these traumatic experiences and a lot of them are unspoken \u2014 that are somehow transmitted to the next generation . There`s a line in Zabelle where Zabelle says something like : \u201c we did n`t speak of those times , but they were like dead and rotting animals behind the walls of our house . \u201d So it is this idea that there is this terrible smell that is somehow permeating the air , and you don`t even have to talk about it , but it is transmitted and it is felt and it is known . LA : You got involved with CODEPINK : Women for Peace right before the war in Iraq started . You have attended demonstrations and organized local and national campaigns \u2014 there are a lot of great photos of you holding signs that say \u201c Love troops , not the War \u201d \u2014 and coordinating the Stolen Beauty Campaign , which boycotts Ahava Cosmetics , whose products come from natural resources in the West Bank . What has your experience been like with CODEPINK ? NK : One of the things that CODEPINK has done successfully is amplifying the voices of women who have come from places where US wars and occupations are taking place . So we have brought women over from Iraq and Afghanistan . We helped organize a book tour for Afghan parliamentarian Malalai Joya ( for her book A Woman Among Warlords ) , where I hosted her at our apartment for a few nights . We have worked with Jewish Voice for Peace in organizing a tour for two young Israeli women who had been jailed for refusing service in the Israeli army ; we hosted them and went to a number of their events and they were houseguests too . I loved doing that , being around them hearing their stories and amplifying their voices , which you don`t hear in the mainstream media .","annotations":[{"text":"Nancy Kricorian","span":[0,14],"token_span":[0,1],"role":"Self_mover","label":"Self_mover","role_definition":"Self_mover is the living (or self-directed) being which moves under its own power."},{"text":"the Armenian community","span":[2804,2825],"token_span":[536,538],"role":"Source","label":"Source","role_definition":"Source is used for any expression which implies a definite starting-point of motion."},{"text":"Watertown , Massachusetts","span":[2866,2890],"token_span":[550,552],"role":"Source","label":"Source","role_definition":"Source is used for any expression which implies a definite starting-point of motion."},{"text":"college","span":[3167,3173],"token_span":[613,613],"role":"Path","label":"Path","role_definition":"Path is used for any description of a trajectory of motion involving a landmark which is neither a Source nor a Goal.

DKIM uses public-key cryptography to sign email with a responsible party 's private key as it leaves a sending server ; recipient servers then use a public key published to the DKIM 's domain to verify the source of the message , and that the parts of the message included in the DKIM signature have n't changed since the message was signed . Once the signature is verified with the public key by the recipient server , the message passes DKIM and is considered authentic . What is a DKIM record ? # A DKIM record is a specially formatted DNS TXT record ; it stores the public key the receiving mail server will use to verify a message 's signature . A DKIM record is formed by a name , version , key type , and the public key itself , and is often made available by the provider that is sending your email ( for example , Postmark . That 's us \ud83d\udc4b ) . Why is DKIM important ? # While DKIM is n't required , having emails that are signed with DKIM appear more legitimate to your recipients and are less likely to go to Junk or Spam folders . Spoofing email from trusted domains is a popular technique for malicious spam and phishing campaigns , and DKIM makes it harder to spoof email from domains that use it . DKIM is compatible with existing email infrastructure and works with SPF and DMARC to create multiple layers of security for domains sending emails . Mail servers that do n't support DKIM signatures are still able to receive signed messages without any problems . It 's an optional security protocol , and DKIM is not a universally adopted standard . Even though it 's not required , we recommend you add a DKIM record to your DNS whenever possible to authenticate mail from your domain . We use it to sign messages at Postmark , and ISPs like Yahoo , AOL , and Gmail use it to check incoming messages . We 've done testing that proved messages are more likely to be delivered when they use these security protocols . An additional benefit of DKIM is that ISPs use it to build a reputation on your domain over time . As you send email and improve your delivery practices ( low spam and bounces , high engagement ) , you help your domain build a good sending reputation with ISPs , which improves deliverability . While it 's important to understand what DKIM does , it 's also important to be clear about what it does n't solve . Using DKIM will make sure your message has n't been altered , but it does n't encrypt the contents of your message . Many ESPs use opportunistic TLS to encrypt messages as they move between sender and recipients , but it 's still possible to send unencrypted messages if an email server refuses a TLS connection . Once a message has been delivered , the DKIM signature will remain in the email headers but wo n't encrypt the content of the message in any way . Now that we 've described what DKIM does , let 's move on to how it protects your domain 's email . How do DKIM records work ? # DKIM uses two actions to verify your messages . The first action takes place on a server sending DKIM signed emails , while the second happens on a recipient server checking DKIM signatures on incoming messages . The entire process is made possible by a private / public key pair . Your private key is kept secret and safe , either on your own server or with your ESP , and the public key is added to the DNS records for your domain to broadcast it to the world to help verify your messages . Let 's dive a little deeper into how DKIM works on servers that are sending and receiving email . Sending a signed DKIM message # If you run your own mail server , you can generate this pair on your own . Any time you use a service like Google Apps , Campaign Monitor , Postmark , or other email providers that support DKIM they 'll normally generate the key for you . To give you an idea of how DKIM works , let 's explain the process on Postmark . We keep your private key securely stored on our servers and sign each message as it is sent . When a message is sent we create a hash from the content of the message headers and then use your private key to sign the hash . This signature carries everything a recipient server needs to validate the message and looks like this : DKIM - Signature : v=1 ; a=rsa-sha1 ; c=relaxed / relaxed ; s=20130519032151 pm ; d=postmarkapp.com ; h= From : Date: Subject :MIME-Version:Content-Type:Content-Transfer-Encoding : To:Message-ID ; i=support@postmarkapp.com ; bh=vYFvy46eesUDGJ45hyBTH30JfN4 = ; b=iHeFQ+7rCiSQs3DPjR2eUSZSv4i/Kp+sipURfVH7BGf+SxcwOkX7X8R1RVObMQsFcbIxnrq7Ba2QCf0YZlL9iqJf32V+baDI8IykuDztuoNUF2Kk0pawZkbSPNHYRtLxV2CTOtc+x4eIeSeYptaiu7g7GupekLZ2DE1ODHhuP4I= Here 's what each part of the header means : DKIM - Signature : The header registered for DKIM signed messages . v=1 ; The version of DKIM being used by the sending server . a=rsa- sha1 ; The algorithm used to generate the hash for the private / public key . There are two officially supported signature algorithms for this hash , rsa-sha 1 and rsa-sha256 . c=relaxed / relaxed ; Sets the canonicalization posture for the sending domain . This regulates whitespace and text wrapping changes in a message . There are two canonicalized postures . ` Simple` does n't allow any changes , and `relaxed ` allows common changes to whitespace and header line - wrapping . Canonicalization in the header and body can be managed individually and uses a header / body format . s=20130519032151 pm ; Used as a selector for the public DKIM key for verification . Domains can have multiple public DKIM keys , and the selector value makes sure recipient servers are using the correct public key . d=postmarkapp.com ; The email domain that signed the message . It 's important that your DKIM signature use your domain name here because this bolsters your domain 's reputation with ISPs as you send valid email , regardless of the Email Service Provider you use .

This entry is treated as an empty string during the verification process . This signature is computed and added to the outgoing email headers . The message is now ready for a recipient server to verify the message has n't been modified in transit . Verifying a signed DKIM message # Mail systems start DKIM verification by making sure the version number meets the DKIM specification , the identity of the sender 's domain matches the domain set in the signature , and the \u201c h= \u201c tag contains the From header field . Once the signature has been validated , the recipient server tries to retrieve the public key for the sending domain . The server uses the \u201c d = \u201c tag to look up the DNS records for the sending domain , and the \u201c s= \u201c tag to select the correct DKIM key .

The receiving mail server then computes its own hash . If the two matches , the message is let through . How does DKIM prevent domain spoofing ? # DKIM alone does not prevent domain spoofing . It 's possible to sign a message using a DKIM key linked to a different domain than the one specified in the \" From \" header . However , if you have a DMARC policy set for your domain , the receiving mail server will check that the DKIM key used to sign the message matches the From domain when determining DMARC compliance . How does DKIM improve deliverability ? # ISPs like Gmail , Yahoo , and AOL use DKIM as a signal when determining whether a message is legitimate or not . Our testing has found that using email authentication methods like SPF and DKIM is critical to good deliverability . What do SPF and DMARC have to do with DKIM ? # While DKIM ensures messages are n't altered in transit between the sending and recipient servers , SPF validates that the sending server is authorized to send messages using a domain in the first place . DMARC gives domain owners a mechanism for communicating how they 'd like unauthenticated messages to be handled by receivers . It uses DKIM and SPF to determine if a message is legitimate and whether it should be delivered to the recipient or blocked . How do I add a DKIM record to my domain ? # No matter which ESP or mail server you use , the general setup for DKIM is the same . You need a private key stored somewhere safe , and you need to share a public key in your domain 's DNS records . Similar to SPF , DKIM also uses DNS TXT records with a special format . It 's considered best practice to periodically rotate your DKIM keys . The DKIM standard recommends rotating your keys every quarter , and it also recommends you revoke your old DKIM keys as part of this rotation . The best way to manage this is by adding your new keys , and a few days later removing your old keys DNS records for your domain . Postmark is one of the only ESPs that make it easy to manage this rotation because we keep your old private key active while your new public key propagates . We have some helpful videos that go in - depth on how to add a DKIM and CNAME records to various DNS providers that can be viewed here . The very best approach to securing your domain 's email is to layer DKIM with SPF and DMARC . Do n't miss our other guides on these protocols to learn more about how they work together to protect your domain . How can I test if I set up DKIM correctly ? # Once you 've set up DKIM for an email service , send a message to an email address you manage and examine the DKIM - Signature and Authentication - Results headers to ensure DKIM passed successfully . How can I read message headers ? You can also use DMARC reports to check that the messages sent using your domain are correctly authenticated with DKIM and SPF .

Born on December 17 1921 , Sarah was the eldest daughter of the Marquess of Blandford ( later the 10th Duke of Marlborough ) and his wife , Hon Mary Cadogan . Had she been born a man , she would have become - and perhaps should have been - the 11th Duke of Marlborough . She was christened Sarah Consuelo , her second name reflecting her position as the eldest grandchild of Consuelo Vanderbilt , by then Madame Jacques Balsan , from whom she inherited a substantial fortune , including her fabulous jewellery . At the time of her birth , Blenheim Palace was occupied by her grandfather , the 9th Duke , married in the same year as Sarah 's birth to his second wife , Gladys Deacon . Blenheim was not a happy home and became increasingly less so , as Duke and Duchess grew to despise one another . Sarah 's childhood memories of the place were brief visits from Lowesby Hall , where the Blandfords then lived . The children enjoyed clutching the Blenheim spaniels as much as the 9th Duke hated them . In the 1930s , the Duke moved out of the palace , leaving his wife a virtual recluse there , surrounded by her dogs . Eventually , in 1933 , the Duke sacked the staff and closed the palace down . Only after his death in 1934 , could Sarah look on Blenheim as home . It was at Blenheim in the last pre-war season that Lady Sarah came out , with a magnificent ball given by her parents in July 1939 . The palace , lake and terraces were floodlit and the trees in the garden decorated with Japanese lanterns . Don Carlos and His Strolling Players walked about in Tyrolean costumes , singing , and in the ballroom the guests danced to Ambrose and his band . The Duke and Duchess of Kent , Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden were among the 900 guests , and the evening echoed the atmosphere of the Duchess of Richmond 's Ball before Waterloo . Consuelo Balsan was there , once more enjoying the palace , while her husband , Jacques Balsan , who had profited all too well from monkey gland injections , was a figure of some alarm to his grand-daughters . Chips Channon , one of the guests , wondered : \" Shall we ever see the like again ? \" and noted \" literally rivers of champagne \" . Within a month , war was declared . Blenheim housed a school during the Second World War . Lady Sarah eschewed the world of society and racing to work for a year in the Morris Metal Works munitions factory at Cowley , travelling from Blenheim in an old Ford , and calling herself \" Sally Churchill \" . She made shell fuses , and once injured her hand in a jig seriously enough to have to go to the Radcliffe Infirmary . In 1943 , Lady Sarah married Lieutenant Edwin ( Ed ) Russell , USNR , a good looking and charming American , whose parents lived at Beverly Hills . He became a publisher with Vogue in New York , and they settled in Oyster Bay . They had four daughters , one of whom is married to the British politician , Neil Balfour . During the marriage , Lady Sarah invested \u00a3 500,000 in a television company , affiliated to NBC , showing educational programmes . The Russells also lived part of the year in Jamaica , in a house overlooking Montego Bay . Lady Sarah soon became a popular port of call for many winter holidaymakers from among her wide circle of friends . When not entertaining , she threw herself energetically into local politics and also oversaw a number of farms and a boutique selling antiques in the former Masonic Hall . Lady Sarah 's marriage to Russell was dissolved in 1966 , and she then married two men in quick succession . The first was a peripatetic Chilean playboy called Guy Burgos ( who later escorted Dewi Sukarno for a time ) . Burgos became her partner in an art gallery in New York . When they married , she was 44 and he was 28 . The Burgos marriage was swiftly dissolved in Mexico after less than a year . Sarah 's final husband was an ochre -skinned 27 - year - old Greek , Theodorus ( Theo ) Roubanis , variously described as a penniless merchant seaman , actor and film producer . Guests recalled Roubanis playing the guitar in the evenings and singing melancholy Greek songs , for which he had a talent . This marriage in 1967 survived until they divorced in 1981 , amid a barrage of complicated settlement claims . The Roubanises were especially considerate to Sarah 's step -mother , Laura , the 10th Duke 's second wife , when she was widowed soon after marrying him in 1972 .

Born on December 17 1921 , Sarah was the eldest daughter of the Marquess of Blandford ( later the 10th Duke of Marlborough ) and his wife , Hon Mary Cadogan . Had she been born a man , she would have become - and perhaps should have been - the 11th Duke of Marlborough . She was christened Sarah Consuelo , her second name reflecting her position as the eldest grandchild of Consuelo Vanderbilt , by then Madame Jacques Balsan , from whom she inherited a substantial fortune , including her fabulous jewellery . At the time of her birth , Blenheim Palace was occupied by her grandfather , the 9th Duke , married in the same year as Sarah 's birth to his second wife , Gladys Deacon . Blenheim was not a happy home and became increasingly less so , as Duke and Duchess grew to despise one another . Sarah 's childhood memories of the place were brief visits from Lowesby Hall , where the Blandfords then lived . The children enjoyed clutching the Blenheim spaniels as much as the 9th Duke hated them . In the 1930s , the Duke moved out of the palace , leaving his wife a virtual recluse there , surrounded by her dogs . Eventually , in 1933 , the Duke sacked the staff and closed the palace down . Only after his death in 1934 , could Sarah look on Blenheim as home . It was at Blenheim in the last pre-war season that Lady Sarah came out , with a magnificent ball given by her parents in July 1939 . The palace , lake and terraces were floodlit and the trees in the garden decorated with Japanese lanterns . Don Carlos and His Strolling Players walked about in Tyrolean costumes , singing , and in the ballroom the guests danced to Ambrose and his band . The Duke and Duchess of Kent , Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden were among the 900 guests , and the evening echoed the atmosphere of the Duchess of Richmond 's Ball before Waterloo . Consuelo Balsan was there , once more enjoying the palace , while her husband , Jacques Balsan , who had profited all too well from monkey gland injections , was a figure of some alarm to his grand-daughters . Chips Channon , one of the guests , wondered : \" Shall we ever see the like again ? \" and noted \" literally rivers of champagne \" . Within a month , war was declared . Blenheim housed a school during the Second World War . Lady Sarah eschewed the world of society and racing to work for a year in the Morris Metal Works munitions factory at Cowley , travelling from Blenheim in an old Ford , and calling herself \" Sally Churchill \" . She made shell fuses , and once injured her hand in a jig seriously enough to have to go to the Radcliffe Infirmary . In 1943 , Lady Sarah married Lieutenant Edwin ( Ed ) Russell , USNR , a good looking and charming American , whose parents lived at Beverly Hills . He became a publisher with Vogue in New York , and they settled in Oyster Bay . They had four daughters , one of whom is married to the British politician , Neil Balfour . During the marriage , Lady Sarah invested \u00a3 500,000 in a television company , affiliated to NBC , showing educational programmes . The Russells also lived part of the year in Jamaica , in a house overlooking Montego Bay . Lady Sarah soon became a popular port of call for many winter holidaymakers from among her wide circle of friends . When not entertaining , she threw herself energetically into local politics and also oversaw a number of farms and a boutique selling antiques in the former Masonic Hall . Lady Sarah 's marriage to Russell was dissolved in 1966 , and she then married two men in quick succession . The first was a peripatetic Chilean playboy called Guy Burgos ( who later escorted Dewi Sukarno for a time ) . Burgos became her partner in an art gallery in New York . When they married , she was 44 and he was 28 . The Burgos marriage was swiftly dissolved in Mexico after less than a year . Sarah 's final husband was an ochre -skinned 27 - year - old Greek , Theodorus ( Theo ) Roubanis , variously described as a penniless merchant seaman , actor and film producer . Guests recalled Roubanis playing the guitar in the evenings and singing melancholy Greek songs , for which he had a talent . This marriage in 1967 survived until they divorced in 1981 , amid a barrage of complicated settlement claims . The Roubanises were especially considerate to Sarah 's step -mother , Laura , the 10th Duke 's second wife , when she was widowed soon after marrying him in 1972 . She stayed with them in a beautiful house they had built outside Athens . Sarah had a yacht and made expeditions to the Greek islands . In January 1977 , Lady Sarah was the victim of an attack at her Jamaican home . Masked intruders , high on drugs , broke into her house , assaulted her and held her captive for several hours . At one point she was slung over the shoulder of one of the thieves and carried into her maid 's room . She escaped by punching her attacker and fleeing in her blood - stained nightdress .

Constance Spry opened her first florists in 1929 . Spry came to prominence in the 1930s providing flowers for the weddings of the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor . These commissions began a long relationship with royal ceremonies and events and she went on to provide flowers for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 . Spry worked closely with Victor Stiebel and provided the flower arrangements for his fashion house on Bruton Street and for his twice yearly fashion shows . Stiebel and Spry shared a love of unusual colour combinations and a sense of drama .

Marcos in 1972 . But even to senior citizens like me , the memories are still crystal clear . I was a probinsyano at that time , teaching journalism at Silliman University , Dumaguete City , the first journalism school outside Metro Manila . I recall vividly that historic day Martial Law was announced \u2013 September 23 , 1972 , a Saturday . Dumaguete City woke up early as usual , expecting another of those unruffled , unhurried mornings that this \u201c City of Gentle People \u201d was famous for . Then the 6 o'clock newscast over DYSR , the popular local radio station at that time located on campus , that hit like a thunderbolt : \u201c Martial Law Declared ! \u201d This was also the headline that Saturday morning of the local newspaper which my journalism faculty and I published , The Negros Express . In the face of \u201c anarchy and dissident threat to the existence of the Republic , \u201d according to the newscast , President Ferdinand Marcos had declared martial law on September 21 , for the first time in history . But Marcos had delayed the announcement by two days to give him time to round up the opposition leaders and prominent journalists . Silliman University , thanks to DYSR , got the news ahead of the people in Manila and most parts of the country . DYSR was able to monitor Radio Australia , which got its information from one of the international wire agencies in Manila before they were closed down by the military and before DYSR itself was closed down later that day . On the morning DYSR monitored the Radio Australia newscast on Martial Law , the Manila mass media were silent . It was only towards noon that the government radio and television stations in Manila \u2013 the Voice of the Philippines ( VOP , operated by the National Media Production Center ) and the stations of the Philippine Broadcasting Service \u2013 went on air with President Marcos ' Proclamation 1081 , read by then Information Secretary Francisco Tatad . State of shock The country was in a state of shock that day , ears glued to radio sets . Shock and disbelief later gave way to fear , as people heard over DZPI and VOP that hundreds of political leaders \u2013 led by Liberal Party senators Benigno Aquino and Jose Diokno , Manila Times publisher Joaquin \u201c Chino \u201d Roces , Manila Chronicle publisher Eugenio Lopez Jr , and Philippines Free Press publisher Teodoro M. Locsin Sr \u2013 were arrested . When Martial Law was announced on September 23 , some faculty members and many students of Dumaguete schools , majority from Silliman , were rounded up by the local Philippine Constabulary ( PC ) for interrogation and detention . Silliman University offices , like the School of Journalism and Communications and the office of the student paper , the Weekly Sillimanian , were raided by the Philippine Constabulary . I remember that day very well . Shortly after the announcement , a group of PC officers came to my office , the School of Journalism . My secretary , face ashen white , came to my inner office to say , \u201c Sir , the PC are here . \u201d I asked the officers what they were looking for . They did not look like they knew , but they were polite , opened a couple of cabinets and left promptly . The following day , Sunday , the military knocked at the door of the Negros Express editor , Roberto Pontenila . They brought him to the PC stockade . Aside from Pontenila , two faculty and staff members and some 40 students ( one of them Dionisio Baseleres , editor of the student paper ) , ended up in detention for one to 6 months , no charges filed . All schools , including Silliman , were closed effective September 23 , 1972 , and nobody knew when they were going to reopen , if at all . The next few days were tense . No one in Silliman felt safe as the PC continued to pick up people for questioning , and to raid offices for presence of alleged subversive literature . Students went into hiding and faculty and staff were burning whatever books and materials they had that only faintly smelled of subversion . The campus and the city were deathly quiet . On October 14 , President Marcos authorized all schools to reopen except the now infamous 4 \u2013 University of the Philippines units , including its Institute of Mass Communication , the Philippine College of Commerce , the Philippine Science High School , and Silliman University . UP was the center of student activism in the Philippines . At the height of student activism , the UP activists barricaded the campus and set up a \u201c Diliman Republic \u201d that defied the Metropolitan Police for days . The president of Philippine College of Commerce ( PCC ) , Dr Nemesio Prudente , was noted for his staunchly nationalistic and radical political views and himself led student activism in his school . The Philippine Science High School was an acknowledged hotbed of activism . Silliman campus activism had caught the attention of Malaca\u00f1ang Palace no less . President Ferdinand Marcos himself \u201c scolded the university during a speech in Dumaguete , noting that members of the opposition , including Senators Jovito Salonga , Juan Liwag , and Benigno Aquino Jr , were invited to speak on campus . \u201d He warned Silliman University , \u201c Do not engage in partisan politics because you are supposed to be an academic institution . You may regret it . \u201d Did we ever regret it . Plundering the nation \u201c The plunder of the nation began the moment martial law was declared . Unprecedented looting of the country 's natural resources and wealth ensued . Marcos and his cronies exerted a vise over the national economy until it came under their total control \u2026 Every major economic activity was controlled by the First Family , their relatives , or cronies . This was the start of crony capitalism , \u201d according to Ricardo Manapat in his meticulously researched 615 - page book , Some Are Smarter Than Others ( 1991 ) . Award - winning American journalist Sterling Seagrave in another well researched 485 - page book in 1988 , The Marcos Dynasty , added : \u201c Under Martial Law , the Philippines entered a grim period of human rights abuses .

But on Tuesday , for the fourth time since 1956 , Portland voters rejected a plan to fluoridate the city 's drinking water . As Slate 's Jake Blumgart asks , \" What 's the matter with Portland ? \" The vote was n't even close : The anti-fluoride side won 60 percent to 40 percent . This despite the pro-fluoride side out - raising opponents $ 850,000 to $ 270,000 ( including cash and in - kind donations ) . \" There 's a libertarian component to Oregon politics , \" Oregon State University political scientist Bill Lunch tells The Oregonian , \" a kind of opposition to what the establishment might want . \" Portland has a long history with resisting fluoride , explains Ryan Kost in The Oregonian : In the 1950s , residents considered the question of fluoridation about the same time many of the nation 's other large metro areas were adopting the practice as a way of fighting tooth decay . Portland voters bucked the trend and rejected the proposal . They said no again in 1962 . It seemed Portlanders had come around to the idea in 1978 when they approved a fluoridation plan . But two years later , they reversed course and voted to scrap it . Since then , fluoridation has remained a constant political issue , on par with mandatory gas station attendants . [ Oregonian ] In September , the Portland City Council quickly voted to finally add fluoride to the city 's water , starting in March 2014 . \" The revolt was instantaneous , \" says Aaron Mesh at Willamette Week . Opponents gathered more than 33,000 signatures to put the measure on the ballot , and here we are . Half of the anti-fluoride money came from out of state , \" including Tea Party supporters in Kansas and Utah , and a controversial alternative physician outside Chicago , \" but the \" no \" vote seems to be \" rooted in Portland 's organic ethos . \" The names of the groups involved in the fluoride battle gives a pretty good sense of each side 's argument : Healthy Kids , Healthy Portland on the pro side , Clean Water Portland heading up the opposition . The opponents were angry that the City Council approved the measure with a vote , but the biggest factor in their favor \" was simply the the high quality and treasured reputation of the city 's Bull Run water supply , \" says Jeff Mapes at The Oregonian . Portland 's water has always indeed been sold as largely untreated and literally fresh from the Bull Run watershed , which is protected from logging . So when opponents dubbed themselves \" Clean Water Portland \" and complained of putting chemicals in the water , they had a more receptive audience than they would in cities where most people would just as soon skip drinking water from the tap . [ Oregonian ] What did the fluoride proponents have ? For starters , \" the endorsement of the massed forces of rationality and medical authority , \" says Slate 's Blumgart . But like the pro-fluoride campaigners before them , they underestimated the passion and organization of their opponents . They thought science and the well - documented benefits to dental health would be enough . In short , says Blumgart , they \" brought policy papers to a gun fight . \" While there are surely conspiracy theorists and anti-government militants among the ranks of today 's Clean Water Portland , the organization 's spokespeople and supporters generally do not express the conservative rhetoric ( such as invoking \" socialized medicine \" ) that defines fluoride opposition elsewhere . Such tactics would never work in this liberal city . Instead , opponents rely on attachment to the environment and natural health care , as well as the current mistrust of pretty much all institutions .... Clean Water Portland insists that emerging science supports its claims , but most of them consist of data cherry - picked from limited research and studies that actually conclude in favor of fluoridation . Politically , that has n't really mattered . It 's easy to sow fear about chemicals being dumped in a pure , natural resource . [ Slate ] There are lots of Portland - specific elements to this fight , says Joel Millman in The Wall Street Journal . For example , several brewers argued against polluting their craft beer with fluoride , and \" even some of the city 's famed indie-rock musicians are taking sides . \" The Dandy Warhols joined what their singer [ Zia McCabe ] called the Public Water / Public Vote music festival soon after the city council 's 2012 decision to fluoridate , drawing bands with names like Guantanamo Baywatch and the Sexy Water Spiders , and creating enough buzz to gather the 20,000 signatures required to put fluoride on the ballot .... Pro-fluoriders have their own rock- band supporters . Among them , apparently , is Colin Meloy , member of Portland 's revered alternative band , The Decemberists . \" How can you hate on the GOP for being creationist science deniers and then go on about how vaccines and fluoridation are poison , \" reads a January post on his Twitter account , which is linked from the website colinmeloy.com . In April , the account tweeted disdain for the anti-fluoride documentary , \" An Inconvenient Tooth . \" [ Wall Street Journal ] But the Rose City is hardly alone , says Sarah Kliff at The Washington Post : \" Forty - four cities around the world \u2014 largely in the United States , Australia , and Canada \u2014 have passed anti-fluoridation policies this year . \" Portland will stay the largest fluoride - free city in the U.S. for now , but in this long - running \" fluoridation war , \" and the anti-fluoride side is losing , says Kliff . Americans living in areas with fluoridated water increased from 62 percent in 1992 to 69 percent in 2006 , the most recent year for which data is available . The American Dental Association now estimates that 72.5 percent of Americans live in areas with fluoridated drinking water . [ Washington Post ] The 900,000 people served by the Bull Run reservoir wo n't be among those fluoridated Americans , for now . But both sides expect Portland 's long - running fluoride war to flare up again .","annotations":[{"text":"in March 2014","span":[1864,1876],"token_span":[341,343],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the gathering event occurs, if specified.

[ Oregonian ] In September , the Portland City Council quickly voted to finally add fluoride to the city 's water , starting in March 2014 . \" The revolt was instantaneous , \" says Aaron Mesh at Willamette Week . Opponents gathered more than 33,000 signatures to put the measure on the ballot , and here we are . Half of the anti-fluoride money came from out of state , \" including Tea Party supporters in Kansas and Utah , and a controversial alternative physician outside Chicago , \" but the \" no \" vote seems to be \" rooted in Portland 's organic ethos . \" The names of the groups involved in the fluoride battle gives a pretty good sense of each side 's argument : Healthy Kids , Healthy Portland on the pro side , Clean Water Portland heading up the opposition . The opponents were angry that the City Council approved the measure with a vote , but the biggest factor in their favor \" was simply the the high quality and treasured reputation of the city 's Bull Run water supply , \" says Jeff Mapes at The Oregonian . Portland 's water has always indeed been sold as largely untreated and literally fresh from the Bull Run watershed , which is protected from logging . So when opponents dubbed themselves \" Clean Water Portland \" and complained of putting chemicals in the water , they had a more receptive audience than they would in cities where most people would just as soon skip drinking water from the tap . [ Oregonian ] What did the fluoride proponents have ? For starters , \" the endorsement of the massed forces of rationality and medical authority , \" says Slate 's Blumgart . But like the pro-fluoride campaigners before them , they underestimated the passion and organization of their opponents . They thought science and the well - documented benefits to dental health would be enough . In short , says Blumgart , they \" brought policy papers to a gun fight . \" While there are surely conspiracy theorists and anti-government militants among the ranks of today 's Clean Water Portland , the organization 's spokespeople and supporters generally do not express the conservative rhetoric ( such as invoking \" socialized medicine \" ) that defines fluoride opposition elsewhere . Such tactics would never work in this liberal city . Instead , opponents rely on attachment to the environment and natural health care , as well as the current mistrust of pretty much all institutions .... Clean Water Portland insists that emerging science supports its claims , but most of them consist of data cherry - picked from limited research and studies that actually conclude in favor of fluoridation . Politically , that has n't really mattered . It 's easy to sow fear about chemicals being dumped in a pure , natural resource . [ Slate ] There are lots of Portland - specific elements to this fight , says Joel Millman in The Wall Street Journal . For example , several brewers argued against polluting their craft beer with fluoride , and \" even some of the city 's famed indie-rock musicians are taking sides . \" The Dandy Warhols joined what their singer [ Zia McCabe ] called the Public Water / Public Vote music festival soon after the city council 's 2012 decision to fluoridate , drawing bands with names like Guantanamo Baywatch and the Sexy Water Spiders , and creating enough buzz to gather the 20,000 signatures required to put fluoride on the ballot .... Pro-fluoriders have their own rock- band supporters . Among them , apparently , is Colin Meloy , member of Portland 's revered alternative band , The Decemberists . \" How can you hate on the GOP for being creationist science deniers and then go on about how vaccines and fluoridation are poison , \" reads a January post on his Twitter account , which is linked from the website colinmeloy.com . In April , the account tweeted disdain for the anti-fluoride documentary , \" An Inconvenient Tooth . \" [ Wall Street Journal ] But the Rose City is hardly alone , says Sarah Kliff at The Washington Post : \" Forty - four cities around the world \u2014 largely in the United States , Australia , and Canada \u2014 have passed anti-fluoridation policies this year . \" Portland will stay the largest fluoride - free city in the U.S. for now , but in this long - running \" fluoridation war , \" and the anti-fluoride side is losing , says Kliff . Americans living in areas with fluoridated water increased from 62 percent in 1992 to 69 percent in 2006 , the most recent year for which data is available . The American Dental Association now estimates that 72.5 percent of Americans live in areas with fluoridated drinking water . [ Washington Post ] The 900,000 people served by the Bull Run reservoir wo n't be among those fluoridated Americans , for now . But both sides expect Portland 's long - running fluoride war to flare up again .","annotations":[{"text":"Opponents","span":[1952,1960],"token_span":[359,359],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"Agent is the person who gathers Individuals."},{"text":"more than 33,000 signatures","span":[1971,1997],"token_span":[361,364],"role":"Individuals","label":"Individuals","role_definition":"This role identifies the entities that come together to form an Aggregate."},{"text":"March 2014","span":[1867,1876],"token_span":[342,343],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the gathering event occurs, if specified.

Anne Johnstone finds out why the Coll-based author did n't want to write it Changed days : for better or for worse , Mairi Hedderwick 's latest book , Katie Morag and the New Pier , transforms the way of life on the island of Struay once and for all making it more realistic and bringing it up to date . IF YOU count yourself a friend of Katie Morag , brace yourself . The enterprise culture is about to hit the island of Struay . As Scotland 's island communities join the fierce debate on the impact of development in general and tourism in particular the imaginary island of Struay is also confronting the stark choice : modernise or die . And Katie Morag , daughter of the island 's postmistress , is in the thick of it . It 's more than five years since the last Katie Morag book and in the interim she has become one of the biggest success stories in primary age fiction . And yet more than once , her creator Mairi Hedderwick has said she has finished with the character . Now under much pressure from her fans and publishers , Katie Morag is back but her native Struay is changing for ever the cosy world where Mrs McColl sticks shells on to table lamps and a kilted boatman collects the occasional visitor from the once - a- week ferry . By the end of her latest story ( Katie Morag and the New Pier ) , the McColls are running a bistro and the redundant ferryman , now sporting yellow Bermudas , is offering tourists trips round the bay . '' This could be Katie Morag down the tubes because she got modernised , '' admits Hedderwick . Unlikely . The first four books were loosely based on Mairi 's experience of bringing up her own family on the island of Coll in the sixties . Recently she moved back after what she terms ' 'a period of exile on the mainland '' . And realised she was n't facing up to the realities of what is happening on the islands . '' I did n't want to present an outdated image that was romanticised and false . '' Instead she has opted to bring Struay up to date with a bang but in such a way that presents questions about over - reliance on tourism as the lever for development . Like Grannie Island , a central character in all the books , Hedderwick feels ambivalent about the changes she is witnessing in the Hebrides and , after some nail - biting deliberation , has turned down a proposal from Argyll and Bute Enterprise Company to use Katie Morag as a marketing device to boost tourism in their area . Her biggest fear is of jeopardising her position on Coll and feeling forced to leave . She says she feels happier and more settled now than for many years . Her daughter and two - year - old grand - daughter also live on the island . Having bought back the house she sold in 1973 , she has started a small book business . It was in the same house , festooned with her beautiful watercolours , that she once entertained a woman she had met on the beach . Her impromptu guest turned out to be an editor at MacMillan 's and the encounter led to a contract to illustrate children 's books , primarily those of veteran Scottish author Jane Duncan . When Jane died , Mairi decided to write her own texts , though the draft of her first book , Katie Morag Delivers the Mail , went through three publishers before Bodley Head took it up in 1984 . As Mairi says : '' We all drove tractors on Coll , '' so it had n't occurred to her that the tractor-fixing dungaree - clad grannie in the book would be taken up by the feminist lobby as an excellent example of non-sexist children 's fiction . Her depiction in the sequel of Katie Morag 's other grannie ( a dainty little lady who flutters her eyelids and is keen on hats and perfume ) was a joke at their expense . This second book , Katie Morag and the Two Grannies , has gone into several foreign editions and currently features on the required reading list for all English primary schools ( because of its depiction of an ethnic minority ( sic ) ! ) . THIS very success makes each sequel more difficult to write . '' People expect so much now . '' Add to this the need to reproduce the wealth of tiny detail and all the little witty sub-plots from previous titles and you start to understand why Hedderwick hates her work so much . '' I have to drive myself to it . When I start polishing the electric kettle , I know I 'm stalling . Each Katie Morag takes about six months and I get very low when I 'm working on them . '' Reading these books , you would never guess that and this latest story retains all the discreet charm and gentle humour of its predecessors . Are more in store ? Just now she 's working on a follow - up to her successful toddler book , Peedie Peebles ' Summer or Winter Book , but other Katie Morag books are on the back burner . Could we soon see another family moving to Struay ? Will wedding bells ring for Neilly Beag and Grannie Mainland ? More I ca n't say or Grannie Island will be after me and you know what she 's like when her hackles are raised . * Katie Morag and the New Pier , by Mairi Hedderwick , published by Bodley Head , # 8.99 .

Like Grannie Island , a central character in all the books , Hedderwick feels ambivalent about the changes she is witnessing in the Hebrides and , after some nail - biting deliberation , has turned down a proposal from Argyll and Bute Enterprise Company to use Katie Morag as a marketing device to boost tourism in their area . Her biggest fear is of jeopardising her position on Coll and feeling forced to leave . She says she feels happier and more settled now than for many years . Her daughter and two - year - old grand - daughter also live on the island . Having bought back the house she sold in 1973 , she has started a small book business . It was in the same house , festooned with her beautiful watercolours , that she once entertained a woman she had met on the beach . Her impromptu guest turned out to be an editor at MacMillan 's and the encounter led to a contract to illustrate children 's books , primarily those of veteran Scottish author Jane Duncan . When Jane died , Mairi decided to write her own texts , though the draft of her first book , Katie Morag Delivers the Mail , went through three publishers before Bodley Head took it up in 1984 . As Mairi says : '' We all drove tractors on Coll , '' so it had n't occurred to her that the tractor-fixing dungaree - clad grannie in the book would be taken up by the feminist lobby as an excellent example of non-sexist children 's fiction . Her depiction in the sequel of Katie Morag 's other grannie ( a dainty little lady who flutters her eyelids and is keen on hats and perfume ) was a joke at their expense . This second book , Katie Morag and the Two Grannies , has gone into several foreign editions and currently features on the required reading list for all English primary schools ( because of its depiction of an ethnic minority ( sic ) ! ) . THIS very success makes each sequel more difficult to write . '' People expect so much now . '' Add to this the need to reproduce the wealth of tiny detail and all the little witty sub-plots from previous titles and you start to understand why Hedderwick hates her work so much . '' I have to drive myself to it . When I start polishing the electric kettle , I know I 'm stalling . Each Katie Morag takes about six months and I get very low when I 'm working on them . '' Reading these books , you would never guess that and this latest story retains all the discreet charm and gentle humour of its predecessors . Are more in store ? Just now she 's working on a follow - up to her successful toddler book , Peedie Peebles ' Summer or Winter Book , but other Katie Morag books are on the back burner . Could we soon see another family moving to Struay ? Will wedding bells ring for Neilly Beag and Grannie Mainland ? More I ca n't say or Grannie Island will be after me and you know what she 's like when her hackles are raised . * Katie Morag and the New Pier , by Mairi Hedderwick , published by Bodley Head , # 8.99 .

Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama took their campaigns to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico on Saturday in an effort to woo voters before the June 1 primary . There are 55 Democratic delegates up for grabs , though voters cannot take part in the general election in November . Obama campaigned early Saturday at the University of Puerto Rico in Bayamon , where he praised the nation 's veterans before Memorial Day . \" It 's fitting to be here today , not just because Memorial Day is around the corner but because Puerto Ricans are such an important part of the United States military . On this island and in Puerto Rican neighborhoods across America , you can go into almost any home and find a veteran living there or a photograph of a loved one in uniform hanging on the wall , \" he said . Obama also took aim at Republican Sen. John McCain over his opposition to an update of the GI Bill . The legislation passed the Senate on Thursday afternoon by a 75 - 22 vote and passed the House this month by a similar margin . It proposes to essentially provide a full scholarship to in - state public universities for members of the military who have served for at least three years . \" I do n't understand why John McCain would side with George Bush and oppose our plan to make college more affordable for our veterans . ... Putting a college degree within reach for our veterans is n't being too generous ; it 's the least we can do for our heroes , \" Obama said . Shortly after Obama 's remarks , the McCain campaign hit back . \" Barack Obama talks about helping veterans , but when the choice came between delivering for our military men and women and playing partisan politics , he decided politics was more important , \" McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said Saturday . Later Saturday , Obama marched along a street in San Juan , shaking hands with supporters as he walked in front of a banner that said \" Puerto Rico Con Obama . \" This event was referred to as a \" caminata , \" a traditional parade for a candidate . Obama remarked to the crowd , \" I will never forget the support and the friendship that I 've seen here in Puerto Rico . ... I am absolutely confident that if that we keep on working hard , there 's no reason why we ca n't win here in Puerto Rico , and if we win Puerto Rico , we will win the nomination . \" Clinton hosted a \" Solutions for Puerto Rico 's Families \" town hall meeting in Aguadilla on Saturday . The former first lady may not have understood the language during her first campaign stop in Puerto Rico , but she certainly understood the politics . Before a crowd of a few hundred Puerto Ricans in a muggy high school gym , Clinton pledged to make it a \" personal priority \" to resolve the statehood issue before the end of her first term . She also vowed to clean up the former Navy testing ranges on Vieques , fund the famous Arecibo radio telescope , use federal dollars to put more cops on the streets and extend tax breaks to Puerto Rican companies . Clinton made each of those promises in English , abandoning a translator early on , despite the growing din among distracted audience members who could n't understand the full content of her stump speech . Still , enthusiastic supporters hoisted signs like \" Puertorriquenos con Hillary \" and \" Hillary Presidenta \" while chants of \" Hillary ! Hillary ! \" filled the room . Despite in the language barrier , Clinton seemed to be on familiar ground . She recalled a visit she made to the island in 1998 on behalf of her husband to inspect damage from Hurricane Georges . She also reminded the audience that she represents more than one million Puerto Ricans in New York ; this week in Florida , she jokingly referred to herself as \" the senator from Puerto Rico . \" Clinton has done well among Hispanic voters in this year 's primaries , and she is expected to have similar success in Puerto Rico . On Thursday , Clinton sent daughter Chelsea to campaign in Puerto Rico , a sign that she is refusing to give up the race despite the delegate math in favor of her rival . According to CNN 's latest estimate , Obama leads Clinton in total delegates , 1,969 to 1,779 . However , Obama does not have enough delegates to secure the nomination outright . He has 1,962 delegates , including superdelegates , short of the 2,026 needed to secure the nomination , according to CNN estimates . Obama was in Florida on Friday courting the Cuban vote , a bloc that has tended to vote Republican in past elections . With a 70 percent turnout rate , Cuban - Americans have been a powerful force in Florida and thus , because of Florida 's role as a swing state , national politics . He told Florida 's Cuban -American community Friday that his Cuba policy would be based on liberty and freedom for the island nation 's people . Watch more of Obama 's comments \u00bb \" My policy toward Cuba will be guided by one word : ' libertad , ' \" he said , using the Spanish word for liberty at an event celebrating Cuban Independence Day in Miami , Florida .

Shortly after Obama 's remarks , the McCain campaign hit back . \" Barack Obama talks about helping veterans , but when the choice came between delivering for our military men and women and playing partisan politics , he decided politics was more important , \" McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said Saturday . Later Saturday , Obama marched along a street in San Juan , shaking hands with supporters as he walked in front of a banner that said \" Puerto Rico Con Obama . \" This event was referred to as a \" caminata , \" a traditional parade for a candidate . Obama remarked to the crowd , \" I will never forget the support and the friendship that I 've seen here in Puerto Rico . ... I am absolutely confident that if that we keep on working hard , there 's no reason why we ca n't win here in Puerto Rico , and if we win Puerto Rico , we will win the nomination . \" Clinton hosted a \" Solutions for Puerto Rico 's Families \" town hall meeting in Aguadilla on Saturday . The former first lady may not have understood the language during her first campaign stop in Puerto Rico , but she certainly understood the politics . Before a crowd of a few hundred Puerto Ricans in a muggy high school gym , Clinton pledged to make it a \" personal priority \" to resolve the statehood issue before the end of her first term . She also vowed to clean up the former Navy testing ranges on Vieques , fund the famous Arecibo radio telescope , use federal dollars to put more cops on the streets and extend tax breaks to Puerto Rican companies . Clinton made each of those promises in English , abandoning a translator early on , despite the growing din among distracted audience members who could n't understand the full content of her stump speech . Still , enthusiastic supporters hoisted signs like \" Puertorriquenos con Hillary \" and \" Hillary Presidenta \" while chants of \" Hillary ! Hillary ! \" filled the room . Despite in the language barrier , Clinton seemed to be on familiar ground . She recalled a visit she made to the island in 1998 on behalf of her husband to inspect damage from Hurricane Georges . She also reminded the audience that she represents more than one million Puerto Ricans in New York ; this week in Florida , she jokingly referred to herself as \" the senator from Puerto Rico . \" Clinton has done well among Hispanic voters in this year 's primaries , and she is expected to have similar success in Puerto Rico . On Thursday , Clinton sent daughter Chelsea to campaign in Puerto Rico , a sign that she is refusing to give up the race despite the delegate math in favor of her rival . According to CNN 's latest estimate , Obama leads Clinton in total delegates , 1,969 to 1,779 . However , Obama does not have enough delegates to secure the nomination outright . He has 1,962 delegates , including superdelegates , short of the 2,026 needed to secure the nomination , according to CNN estimates . Obama was in Florida on Friday courting the Cuban vote , a bloc that has tended to vote Republican in past elections . With a 70 percent turnout rate , Cuban - Americans have been a powerful force in Florida and thus , because of Florida 's role as a swing state , national politics . He told Florida 's Cuban -American community Friday that his Cuba policy would be based on liberty and freedom for the island nation 's people . Watch more of Obama 's comments \u00bb \" My policy toward Cuba will be guided by one word : ' libertad , ' \" he said , using the Spanish word for liberty at an event celebrating Cuban Independence Day in Miami , Florida .

Red Bull KTM Ajo 's Oliveira pulled off a sensational last - lap victory at the Shell Malaysian Motorcycle Grand Prix to ensure that the 2015 Moto3 \u2122 World Championship battle will go down to the wire . In an incredibly dramatic finish , his title rival Danny Kent ran wide at the last corner and crossed the line in 7th , which means the Brit was denied the title but he will take a 24 - point lead into the final round at Valencia . Oliveira 's teammate Brad Binder and Estrella Galicia 0,0's Jorge Navarro completed the podium . Starting from third on the gird , Oliveira was involved in an excellent battle at the front between Binder , Navarro , Niccolo Antonelli ( Ongetta - Rivacold ) , Romano Fenati ( Sky Racing Team VR46 ) , Francesco Bagnaia ( Mapfre Team Mahindra ) and Jakub Kornfeil ( Drive M7 SIC ) . Kent on the other hand , after his three - place grid penalty relegated him to ninth at the start , dropped down to 16th in the opening laps and looked to be struggling . Slowly but surely and despite a number of riders crashing in front of him \u2013 including his two teammates Hiroki Ono and Efren Vazquez - Kent started to make his way through the field and by lap 9 he was on the back wheel of the seventh placed Antonelli . As the laps ticked down , the lead swapped hands repeatedly at the front due to the slipstream effect down the two long straights at the Sepang International Circuit . Kent knew he just had to finish in fifth and even if Oliveira won , he would be crowned the first British World Champion Since Barry Sheene won the 500cc title in 1977 . With three laps to go , Bagnaia crashed out and Kent was up to 6th . Then , on the penultimate lap Kent made a move on Antonelli to secure fifth , and at this point the title looked to be his . As the started the final lap , Kent made a move on Fenati at turn 1 , but left himself exposed to Antonelli who re-took the vital fifth place . Kent fought back at turn 4 , but Antonelli responded at turn 9 . It was all going to comedown to the final two straights and the infamous turn 15 . This was the point when Oliveira timed it perfectly to make his move for the race win on his teammate Binder at the very last corner . Would Kent get past Antonelli to become champion ? The answer was incredibly no . Kent ran wide at the final corner and eventually crossed the line in seventh , missing out on the title . Now the championship will be decided in Valencia . Oliveira 's victory was his third in the last 5 races , during which he has n't finished lower than second . In the same 5 races , Kent has two sixth placed finishes , one seventh and two DNF's . Binder rode superbly to claim his fourth podium of the year , ahead of Navarro who was on the podium for the third time in the last four races . Antonelli made it back - to - back fourth places , while Romano Fenati pulled off his best result since Aragon in fifth . Kornfeil kept the fans happy by crossing the line in sixth at his team 's home grand prix , with Championship leader Kent missing out on his third chance to the lift the title this season in seventh . It was Kent 's worst finish since he achieved the same result at Brno . Enea Bastianini ( Gresini Racing Team Moto3 ) led home the chasing group , over four seconds behind Kent in 8th . SAXOPRINT RTG teammates Alexis Masbou and John McPhee completed the podium . In the Moto3 \u2122 standings Kent now has 253 points to Oliveira 's 229 , which means Kent needs just two points at Valencia to become champion even if Oliveira wins .

What breed of pedigreed cat can trace its lineage back to the one common ancestor of all present day cats in this breed \u2013 and we know her name ? What cat has been likened to an owl , a Teddy Bear and a breed of rabbit ? And finally , what breed of cat recently had a member receive a full page tribute in People magazine ? The wonderful , lovable Scottish Fold , of course ! The first documented and recognized ancestor of all Scottish Folds is \u201c Susie , \u201d a folded - ear barn cat found on the McRae farm at Coupar Angus in the Tayside Region of Scotland . There are earlier references to folded - ear cats , however . Recently there was a beautiful antique Oriental wall hanging depicting a folded - ear cat and her kittens on an internet auction site . While Jean Grimm was doing research for an upcoming article on Folds , she found the following information which I thought was so interesting that I asked if I could include it here . The 1975 Guide to the Cats of the World by Loxton includes the statement , \u201c The idea of a drop-eared Chinese breed was a persistent one . \u201d The first known written reference to these cats appears in 1796 in the Universal Magazine of Knowledge in which folded - ear cats were mentioned as wild cats in China . Guide to the Cats of the World continues , \u201c A century later a sailor returned from China with a drop-eared cat \u2026 . \u201d There is no more documented evidence of these cats until 1938 when a second cat was found with these characteristics . At that time the rare mutation was thought to be restricted to white longhaired cats . Is it just coincidence that the first Folds in Scotland were white as the previously mentioned ones were and that the Oriental art also depicts white drop-eared cats ? We cannot be certain , but sailors did roam the seas . These stories do persist and the idea of a natural mutation appearing from time to time is not without merit . The pedigrees of all Scottish Fold cats today can be traced back to the McRae 's Susie , a unique fact in the pedigreed cat world . Mary and William Ross , British Shorthair breeders who fell in love with Susie , were promised one of her kittens . In 1963 the Rosses were given a folded - ear ( Fd ) white female they named \u201c Snooks , \u201d who was bred with an unknown red tabby male . Her first litter produced one male kitten , \u201c Snowball , \u201d who was bred to a white British Shorthair , \u201c Lady May , \u201d and their litter produced five Fd kittens . Thus begins the lineage of the Folds . In 1969 Snooks delivered her third litter of two Fd kittens \u2013 Denisla Hester and Denisla Hector , which , along with Snowball and Lady May 's kittens , became the foundation for the future . The Rosses registered their cattery as Denisla ( a combination of the two rivers , the Den and the Isla , which flowed by their cottage ) . With the help of English geneticist Peter Dyte , they started a breeding program using British Shorthairs and farm cats . Originally called \u201c lops \u201d after the lop-ear rabbits , this new breed became known as Scottish Folds in 1966 . They were bred in Europe for one purpose \u2013 to preserve a rare mutation . While several people became interested in developing and preserving Scottish Folds , some problems were beginning to concern the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy ( GCCF ) in England . Accepted for showing originally in 1966 , by 1971 registration of Scottish Folds was closed . Concerned over the possible increase in ear mite infestation and deafness ( both concerns later proved to be unfounded ) , the GCCF also became concerned about possible genetic difficulties . With this growing concern , the GCCF decided to ban further registration of Scottish Folds in England . The last Fold to be registered there was Denisla Morag . No longer popular in the European / English cat fancy , the Scottish Fold \u201c set sail for the Colonies . \u201d In 1970 Dr. Neil Todd , a New England geneticist , brought three Scottish Folds to The Carnivore Genetics Research Center in Newtownville , MA : Denisla Judy , Denisla Joey , and Denisla Hester ( three of Snooks 's daughters ) . Dr. Todd was assembling a colony of cats for \u201c scientific inspection of mutations , \u201d and these cats were never intended for the cat fancy . Under his care Joey and Judy produced two litters . When Dr. Todd discontinued the Fold research project shortly thereafter , the cats went to various homes . Salle Wolf Peters , a well - known Manx breeder , acquired Hester from Lynn Lamoreux , a doctoral student of Dr. Todd's . Thus , the first Scottish Fold breeder started her long involvement with the Folds . In 1972 one of her kittens went to an English couple in Utah where the female Fold Martina Shona was first shown . At that CFA show , Briony Sivewright ( owner of Martina Shona ) met Ann Kimball and Karen Votava . Martina Shona eventually made her way to Salle and produced more lovely Scottish Folds . Karen Votava acquired Mr. Morgan LeFaye , a handsome cameo tabby male who , with Doonie Lugs , became the foundation stock for Bryric Cattery . Bryric is one of the earliest catteries on any Fold pedigree , and until recently was still producing wonderful cats . As more and more breeders became interested in this charming cat , the move to have them recognized by CFA began . In 1974 Bobbie Graham ( Bobette ) , Salle Wolf Peters ( Wyola ) , Karen Votava ( Bryric ) and others set about meeting the requirements for what was then called \u201c experimental registration . \u201d These requirements were met after many questionnaires were completed by veterinarians and scientists studying Folds . Careful records were kept and reported on each cat and litter of kittens . Little was known at this time about the natural mutation which results in the folded ear . In the early 1970s Dr. Oliphant Jackson , an English geneticist , released a report stating that the breed carried a bone problem . The decision was made , the report stated , that changes and the vital use of outcrosses were needed to restore the original health of Folds . About this time , x-rays of Folds started showing bone lesions . According to Dr. Jackson 's report , there had been no previous mention of associated skeletal deformity before the ' 70s . Scientists and breeders wondered whether these were being caused by in - breeding early in the history of the Folds rather than by the Fd gene itself . Originally , many Folds had foreshortened tails which were inflexible . Dr. Rosemond Peltz , who served as the first genetic consultant for the American Scottish Fold breeders , offered the opinion that \u201c in generations to come the undesirable defect may be diminished by extremely careful breeding . \u201d With the knowledge from the Jackson study , breeders began to use more outcrossing and the gene pool increased . This produced longer , more flexible tails and the bone lesions and foreshortened tails began to disappear . In January 1976 the stud book closed to all outcrosses except the American Shorthair and the British Shorthair . Today outcrossing remains a fundamental part of Scottish Fold breeding programs . Without the help and generosity of American and British Shorthair breeders who share their beautiful cats with Fold breeders , this breed might well be lost to the cat fancy and all those who love the \u201c Foldie . \u201d More points are placed on the tail of the Fold than in any other breed 's standard . Our standard reads that the tail must be flexible , with long and tapering preferred . One of the first questions a prospective owner should ask a breeder is \u201c is the tail flexible ? \u201d Careful breeding practices , Fold Ears ( Fd ) to Straight Ears ( fd ) or to an allowed outcross , virtually eliminates the stiff tail . It is believed that the gene which causes folding of the ears is an incomplete dominant . From the time of the first study done by Oliphant Jackson , Ph.D. , the mandate to breed only Fd to fd or outcrosses has been strongly stressed , and this remains true today . With the problems arising from the GCCF ban and Dr. Jackson 's study in 1975 , the Scottish Fold breeding program was rapidly declining in England . Mary Ross sent a plea to ISFA ( International Scottish Fold Association ) saying only one other cat lover beside herself was actually breeding them . Folds were in danger of being lost in England and Mrs. Ross asked for help from breeders in the United States . The response was quick and in the late 1970s , several people took up the cause of the Folds . Jean Grimm ( Furrytails ) , Lois and Clark Jensen ( Jensen ) , Pat Dreifuss ( Beachmor ) , Shirley Norquist ( Kangaroo ) , to name a few , started working on breeding programs . In May 1977 Scottish Folds were given provisional status in CFA . A look at those early pedigrees shows that several breeds were originally used to increase the gene pool and return the cats to their original barn cat \u201c hale and hearty \u201d state . The Scottish Folds of today lead long , healthy lives , often up to and past the age of 19 years , and several Folds have been active in the ring over the age of ten . The popular misconception that Folds become crippled as they age is just that \u2013 a misconception . The year 1978 was a banner year for Folds \u2013 they received Championship status ! Jensen Minnie Pearl became the first Scottish Fold Grand Champion in 1979 . \u201c Minnie \u201d was the first Scottish Fold to make it into the top 20 and was , of course , also the first Best of Breed . When Kitty Angell acquired two females from Karen Votava , Bryric Fanny Folderol of Kitjim and CH Bryric Patchwork , DM , more groundbreaking followed . \u201c Patchwork \u201d was the first Fold to become a CFA Distinguished Merit cat in 1985 , and Patchwork 's daughter , GC , NW Kitjim 's Briarpatch , DM , became the second . Patchwork appears on the pedigree of over 3,600 Scottish Folds . In 1993 Scottish Fold Longhairs were recognized for Championship status . This effort was successful in large part due to the diligent work of Sue Thompson , Scottish Fold Breed Secretary , and her husband Bruce . Two years later in 1995 , Junerose Wilkerson showed a beautiful white Longhair , GC , NW B4 Snow B-Ear - Y of Sweetums . Bred by Sharon Knight and Ken Burke and owned by Sharon Knight , Ken Burke and Junerose Wilkerson , he placed as 10th Best Cat nationally . Another cat belonging to Junerose has an impressive legacy . GC , GP Kitjim 's Buckwheat of Sweetums , a sire for three years , produced 20 CFA registered cats , and of those only 12 were placed in breeding programs . Within three generations his offspring produced 57 Grand Champions and Grand Premiers , 112 Champions and Premiers , 15 Regional Winners and two National Winners . Bred by Kitty Angell , \u201c Buckwheat \u201d can certainly be counted among the foundation cats of this breed . The year 1999 saw another first for a descendant of Kitjim Cattery . GC , RW Beebop Duke of Earle of Beepafold became the first Scottish Fold male Distinguished Merit cat . \u201c Beeper \u201d was bred by Becky Enzor ( Beebop ) and is owned by Patricia Garrighan ( Beepafold ) . Kitjim has been in the forefront of groundbreaking from the first . In 1991 GC , NW Kitjim 's Bonny Too of Q-T Cats , owned by Marcia and Leon Samuels , became the first Fold to earn two national wins in one year . The list of dedicated breeders who took this beautiful cat from the first examples sent to this country for research to the seventh most popular cat in CFA contains names known throughout the cat fancy . Salle Wolfe Peters , Lois and Clark Jensen , Karen Votava , Kitty Angell , Gay Turner ( Scottish ) , Nancey Abbott ( Catquea ) , and Jean Grimm ( Furrytails ) are some of the early ones . Bill and Patti Brubaker ( LaPlume ) , Junerose Wilkerson ( Sweetums ) , Mary Auth and Chuck Payne ( Whiteiron ) and Donna Jean Thompson ( Jeanel ) \u2013 the list goes on and there are many more who come to mind . Without these dedicated cat lovers and their persistence and faith in Scottish Folds we , the current breeders and exhibitors , would be hard pressed to show and produce the beautiful cats we proudly place in the show ring . Thank you one and all . Breeding and showing Folds is not for those who covet rosettes . Since one of a breeding pair must not have folded ears ( Fd ) , the chances of producing a Fd kitten in a litter is 50 % over a period of time . That is to say , not every litter will produce 50 % Fd kittens . Some are all straight ears ( fd ) or perhaps only one will fold and then be a single fold and really not suitable for the show ring . This is not a breed for the impatient either . After the litter is born it takes 21 days for the ears to fold \u2013 or not . Sometimes the ears will look as though they are going to fold , only to go \u201c up . \u201d We now recognize that these kittens must be treated as though the ears had folded . This phenomenon is becoming more widely accepted as contributing to possible skeletal malformations . In the past , these kittens were labeled straight ears ( fd ) if that is the way the ear tip pointed . We are now looking to the day when we will identify the genetic marker for the Fold ( Fd ) gene and be able , with a simple blood or saliva test , to identify once and for all the Fd gene . The straight ears play an important part in any breeding program , make wonderful pets and are goodwill ambassadors for the breed . This is a breed for those who love the gentle open look , sweet disposition and gentle calm nature of the Scottish Fold . Oh , yes , let 's not forget the tribute in People magazine . In the May 31 , 1999 issue there is a full page tribute to \u201c Norton , \u201d the most famous Scottish Fold yet . Norton was the constant companion of Peter Gathiers , author of two best selling books about their travels in Europe ( The Cat Who Went to Paris and Cat Abroad ) . I had the privilege of meeting Peter at a book signing along with his \u201c owner \u201d Norton , a wonderful cat and a top-notch advertisment for our breed \u2013 not bad for a kitty whose ancestors were barn cats .

What breed of pedigreed cat can trace its lineage back to the one common ancestor of all present day cats in this breed \u2013 and we know her name ? What cat has been likened to an owl , a Teddy Bear and a breed of rabbit ? And finally , what breed of cat recently had a member receive a full page tribute in People magazine ? The wonderful , lovable Scottish Fold , of course ! The first documented and recognized ancestor of all Scottish Folds is \u201c Susie , \u201d a folded - ear barn cat found on the McRae farm at Coupar Angus in the Tayside Region of Scotland . There are earlier references to folded - ear cats , however . Recently there was a beautiful antique Oriental wall hanging depicting a folded - ear cat and her kittens on an internet auction site . While Jean Grimm was doing research for an upcoming article on Folds , she found the following information which I thought was so interesting that I asked if I could include it here . The 1975 Guide to the Cats of the World by Loxton includes the statement , \u201c The idea of a drop-eared Chinese breed was a persistent one . \u201d The first known written reference to these cats appears in 1796 in the Universal Magazine of Knowledge in which folded - ear cats were mentioned as wild cats in China . Guide to the Cats of the World continues , \u201c A century later a sailor returned from China with a drop-eared cat \u2026 . \u201d There is no more documented evidence of these cats until 1938 when a second cat was found with these characteristics . At that time the rare mutation was thought to be restricted to white longhaired cats . Is it just coincidence that the first Folds in Scotland were white as the previously mentioned ones were and that the Oriental art also depicts white drop-eared cats ? We cannot be certain , but sailors did roam the seas . These stories do persist and the idea of a natural mutation appearing from time to time is not without merit . The pedigrees of all Scottish Fold cats today can be traced back to the McRae 's Susie , a unique fact in the pedigreed cat world . Mary and William Ross , British Shorthair breeders who fell in love with Susie , were promised one of her kittens . In 1963 the Rosses were given a folded - ear ( Fd ) white female they named \u201c Snooks , \u201d who was bred with an unknown red tabby male . Her first litter produced one male kitten , \u201c Snowball , \u201d who was bred to a white British Shorthair , \u201c Lady May , \u201d and their litter produced five Fd kittens . Thus begins the lineage of the Folds . In 1969 Snooks delivered her third litter of two Fd kittens \u2013 Denisla Hester and Denisla Hector , which , along with Snowball and Lady May 's kittens , became the foundation for the future . The Rosses registered their cattery as Denisla ( a combination of the two rivers , the Den and the Isla , which flowed by their cottage ) . With the help of English geneticist Peter Dyte , they started a breeding program using British Shorthairs and farm cats . Originally called \u201c lops \u201d after the lop-ear rabbits , this new breed became known as Scottish Folds in 1966 . They were bred in Europe for one purpose \u2013 to preserve a rare mutation .

Introduction The falx cerebri is a sickle - shaped structure formed from the invagination of the dura mater into the longitudinal fissure between the cerebral hemispheres . The falx cerebri is anchored posteriorly to the internal occipital protuberance , travels superiorly to the corpus callosum , and anchors anteriorly to the crista galli forming a sail - like structure between the cerebral hemispheres . The falx cerebri contains blood vessels , nerves , and is a common site of falcine meningiomas and age -related calcification . [ 1 ] Structure and Function The brain is enveloped by three membranes , the pia mater , arachnoid mater , and dura mater . These three membranes are collectively called the meninges . The dura mater is the strong , fibrous outermost membrane which provides a double layer of protection within the cranial cavity . The two layers of dura mater within the neurocranium are the periosteal layer which adheres directly to the inner neurocranium and meningeal layer which surrounds the brain tissue along with the arachnoid and pia mater . The meningeal dura mater invaginates between brain regions to form dural partitions - the falx cerebri , falx cerebelli , tentorium cerebelli , and sellar diaphragm . The falx cerebri separates the cerebral hemispheres and provides channels , known as dural sinuses , for blood and cerebral spinal fluid to drain . The falx cerebri is a sail - like structure which is anchored posteriorly at the internal occipital protuberance , superiorly to the periosteal dura mater , and anteriorly to the crista galli which sits above the ethmoid bone . [ 2 ] The superior and inferior sagittal sinuses form from spaces between the meningeal dura mater folds which make up the falx cerebri . The superior sagittal sinus follows the superior margin of the falx cerebri and the inferior sagittal sinus follows the free margin of the falx cerebri above the corpus callosum . These sinuses receive cerebral spinal fluid from the arachnoid granulation and blood from meningeal and bridging veins which drain from the dura and neural tissue . The blood from the superior sagittal sinus and inferior sagittal sinus eventually drain into the internal jugular veins and finally into the systemic circulation . [ 3 ] Embryology The three meningeal layers derive from the meninx primitiva , which is meningeal mesenchyme . The arachnoid and pia form from the leptomenix and the dura mater from the pachymeninx . While the pia mater and arachnoid mater originate from neural crest cells , the dura mater develops from the mesoderm . The dura mater forms a single layer of protection around the developing spinal cord but forms a double layer around the skull , eventually forming the periosteal and meningeal dural membranes . The process is similar to how the parietal and visceral layers of the peritoneum form in the abdominal cavity . The dura mater is a continuous membrane that forms a double layer membrane by folding in on itself where two layers of cells form in the peripheral mesenchyme - the thicker forms the periosteal dura and the thinner , the meningeal dura . As the brain develops , the meningeal dural layer invaginates between the brain regions forming dural partitions . Interruptions in brain development such as semi-lobar holoprosencephaly can prevent the dural partitions from forming appropriately . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Blood Supply and Lymphatics The falx cerebri receives its blood supply primarily from two vessels . The anterior portion of the falx receives its blood supply from the anterior meningeal artery , also known as the anterior falx artery or anterior falcine artery , which arises from the anterior ethmoidal artery . [ 6 ] The posterior falx receives its blood supply from the posterior meningeal artery , which is a branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery . The lymphatic drainage of the falx cerebri occurs via the meningeal lymphatic vessels which run parallel to the dural sinuses . These lymphatic vessels drain primarily along a similar path as the dural sinuses eventually exiting the jugular foramen and emptying into the deep cervical lymph nodes . A minority of lymph from the falx cerebri drains anteriorly through the cribriform plate into the lymphatics of the nasal mucosa . Lymphatic of the meninges differs from the lymphatics of the systemic system in a couple of ways . First , the lymphatics mostly lack valves which , in the body , prevent the retroactive flow of lymph because lymphatics are a low- pressure system . Second , the lymphatics are thinner and follow closely with the venous drainage of the meninges with few branch points . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Nerves The falx cerebri receives its innervation from all three branches of the trigeminal nerve and receives sympathetic fibers predominantly from the superior cervical ganglia . Additionally , the falx may receive additional innervation from the dorsal rami of cervical nerves 1,2 , and 3 , the hypoglossal nerve , and recurrent branches of the vagus nerve . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Muscles There are no muscle attachments to , or within the falx cerebri . The only muscle cells associated with the meninges are the smooth muscle cells of the vasculature which run within the meninges . Physiologic Variants Agenesis of the falx cerebri has been documented and usually correlates with other developmental complications . Falx cerebri agenesis in individuals without other neural symptoms is exceptionally rare . Additionally , a persistent falcine sinus occurs in patients where the straight sinus fails to form during development or is thrombosed . [ 12 ] Surgical Considerations The falx cerebri is a significant surgical landmark for neurosurgeons accessing the lateral ventricles via an interhemispheric transcallosal approach . Agenesis or partial agenesis of the falx cerebri allows the cerebral hemispheres to adhere and prevent midline transcallosal surgical access to the ventricles . [ 13 ] Clinical Significance In addition to the pathologies that affect all of the dural structures ( e.g. , bacterial meningitis ) , the falx cerebri is clinically significant in two common scenarios . First , the falx cerebri is the site of falcine meningiomas which account for approximately ~ 8.5 % of intracranial meningiomas . These meningiomas are benign and form well - circumscribed , usually round masses attached to the dura . Meningiomas primarily arise from arachnoidal cap cells and can cause seizures . Headaches , nausea , and vomiting are common manifestations due to increased intracranial pressure following its significant growth . Biopsy findings will show tumor cells depending on the grade of the tumor and also showing syncytial nests , which may calcify into psammoma bodies . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Symptomatic meningiomas are often removed surgically with occasional preoperative embolization to reduce its size and intraoperative bleeding . Practitioners can follow the principle of adequate exposure , devascularisation , intracapsular decompression , and then followed by complete excision . Damage to the sagittal sinus , thereby leading to bleeding and air embolism and malignant brain edema due to venous infarction is the main intraoperative concern . Therefore , study regarding the patency of the sinus , its probable invasion by the tumor and the status of the collateral vessels is of paramount importance while formulating the management plan of these tumors especially for tumors attached to the middle and posterior third of the superior sagittal sinus . The second common clinical scenario occurs in traumatic brain injury leading to a substantial anterior cranial fossa extradural hematoma or the frontal contusions . They can cause significant mass effect forcing the ipsilateral cingulate gyrus to herniate under the falx cerebri leading to subfalcine herniation . [ 16 ] References - 1 . - WELIKALA AH .

The superior sagittal sinus follows the superior margin of the falx cerebri and the inferior sagittal sinus follows the free margin of the falx cerebri above the corpus callosum . These sinuses receive cerebral spinal fluid from the arachnoid granulation and blood from meningeal and bridging veins which drain from the dura and neural tissue . The blood from the superior sagittal sinus and inferior sagittal sinus eventually drain into the internal jugular veins and finally into the systemic circulation . [ 3 ] Embryology The three meningeal layers derive from the meninx primitiva , which is meningeal mesenchyme . The arachnoid and pia form from the leptomenix and the dura mater from the pachymeninx . While the pia mater and arachnoid mater originate from neural crest cells , the dura mater develops from the mesoderm . The dura mater forms a single layer of protection around the developing spinal cord but forms a double layer around the skull , eventually forming the periosteal and meningeal dural membranes . The process is similar to how the parietal and visceral layers of the peritoneum form in the abdominal cavity . The dura mater is a continuous membrane that forms a double layer membrane by folding in on itself where two layers of cells form in the peripheral mesenchyme - the thicker forms the periosteal dura and the thinner , the meningeal dura . As the brain develops , the meningeal dural layer invaginates between the brain regions forming dural partitions . Interruptions in brain development such as semi-lobar holoprosencephaly can prevent the dural partitions from forming appropriately . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Blood Supply and Lymphatics The falx cerebri receives its blood supply primarily from two vessels . The anterior portion of the falx receives its blood supply from the anterior meningeal artery , also known as the anterior falx artery or anterior falcine artery , which arises from the anterior ethmoidal artery . [ 6 ] The posterior falx receives its blood supply from the posterior meningeal artery , which is a branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery . The lymphatic drainage of the falx cerebri occurs via the meningeal lymphatic vessels which run parallel to the dural sinuses . These lymphatic vessels drain primarily along a similar path as the dural sinuses eventually exiting the jugular foramen and emptying into the deep cervical lymph nodes . A minority of lymph from the falx cerebri drains anteriorly through the cribriform plate into the lymphatics of the nasal mucosa . Lymphatic of the meninges differs from the lymphatics of the systemic system in a couple of ways . First , the lymphatics mostly lack valves which , in the body , prevent the retroactive flow of lymph because lymphatics are a low- pressure system . Second , the lymphatics are thinner and follow closely with the venous drainage of the meninges with few branch points . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Nerves The falx cerebri receives its innervation from all three branches of the trigeminal nerve and receives sympathetic fibers predominantly from the superior cervical ganglia . Additionally , the falx may receive additional innervation from the dorsal rami of cervical nerves 1,2 , and 3 , the hypoglossal nerve , and recurrent branches of the vagus nerve . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Muscles There are no muscle attachments to , or within the falx cerebri . The only muscle cells associated with the meninges are the smooth muscle cells of the vasculature which run within the meninges . Physiologic Variants Agenesis of the falx cerebri has been documented and usually correlates with other developmental complications . Falx cerebri agenesis in individuals without other neural symptoms is exceptionally rare . Additionally , a persistent falcine sinus occurs in patients where the straight sinus fails to form during development or is thrombosed . [ 12 ] Surgical Considerations The falx cerebri is a significant surgical landmark for neurosurgeons accessing the lateral ventricles via an interhemispheric transcallosal approach . Agenesis or partial agenesis of the falx cerebri allows the cerebral hemispheres to adhere and prevent midline transcallosal surgical access to the ventricles . [ 13 ] Clinical Significance In addition to the pathologies that affect all of the dural structures ( e.g. , bacterial meningitis ) , the falx cerebri is clinically significant in two common scenarios . First , the falx cerebri is the site of falcine meningiomas which account for approximately ~ 8.5 % of intracranial meningiomas . These meningiomas are benign and form well - circumscribed , usually round masses attached to the dura . Meningiomas primarily arise from arachnoidal cap cells and can cause seizures . Headaches , nausea , and vomiting are common manifestations due to increased intracranial pressure following its significant growth . Biopsy findings will show tumor cells depending on the grade of the tumor and also showing syncytial nests , which may calcify into psammoma bodies . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Symptomatic meningiomas are often removed surgically with occasional preoperative embolization to reduce its size and intraoperative bleeding . Practitioners can follow the principle of adequate exposure , devascularisation , intracapsular decompression , and then followed by complete excision . Damage to the sagittal sinus , thereby leading to bleeding and air embolism and malignant brain edema due to venous infarction is the main intraoperative concern . Therefore , study regarding the patency of the sinus , its probable invasion by the tumor and the status of the collateral vessels is of paramount importance while formulating the management plan of these tumors especially for tumors attached to the middle and posterior third of the superior sagittal sinus . The second common clinical scenario occurs in traumatic brain injury leading to a substantial anterior cranial fossa extradural hematoma or the frontal contusions . They can cause significant mass effect forcing the ipsilateral cingulate gyrus to herniate under the falx cerebri leading to subfalcine herniation . [ 16 ] References - 1 . - WELIKALA AH .

The Mediterranean region is the major olive growing area and accounts for 98 % of the olive tree plantations in the world . The olive fruits are consumed as olive oil or table olives . About 90 % of the annual olive production is used for olive oil . The olive fruit is harvested at the green stage ( ' green olive ' ) , or left to ripen to a dark purple colour ( ' black olive ' ) . The oil content of the olive fruit lies between 12 - 30 % , depending on the variety . Olive fruits are naturally bitter due to the presence of the polyphenol oleuropein , and therefore need to be processed before consumption . Traditional methods use the natural microflora on the fruit and procedures that bring about fermentation of the fruit . This fermentation leads to the leaching out and breakdown of oleuropein and phenolic compounds , the formation of lactic acid and of a complex of flavours . Three main processing methods are distinguished : the Spanish style , the Californian style , and the Greek style . The Spanish - style green olives are treated with sodium hydroxide ( Na OH ) , and fermented in brine ( sodium - chloride solution , NaCl ) for several months . Californian - style olives are preserved in brine or acidified liquids during several months for fermentation to occur . Then , fruits are repeatedly treated with NaOH , and in between the alkaline treatments the olive fruits are suspended in water through which air is bubbled . Greek - style olives are not treated with NaOH . They are harvested when fully ripe , and fermented and canned in brine . There are a several thousand of different olive cultivars distinguished . Some economically important cultivars are : Manzanillo ( world ) , Picual ( Spain ) , Arbequina ( Spain ) , Kalamata ( Spain ) , Frantoio ( Italy ) , Leccino ( Italy ) , Koroneiki ( Greece ) and Pecholine ( France ) . Olive oil has become more and more popular as nutritional oil in the last decade , due to its taste and nutritional properties . It is often recommended for frying . In heating , it preserves largely its nutritional value , because of its antioxidants and its high levels of oleic acid . Whereas industrial classification distinguishes ' ( extra ) virgin olive oil ' ( physical extraction ) , ' refined olive oil ' ( chemically treated to improve taste ) , and ' pomace olive oil ' ( chemical extraction from olive pomace , the by-product remaining after physical extraction of the oil from the fruits ) , retail classification is different . In stores , olive oils are classified as ' extra - virgin olive oil ' ( first pressing ) , ' virgin olive oil ' , ' pure olive oil ' ( mixture of refined olive oil and ( extra - ) virgin olive oil ) , or ' olive - pomace oil ' ( blend of refined pomace olive oil and virgin olive oil ) . Currently , most data on polyphenols are available for ( extra - ) virgin olive oils . Olives contain a great number of compounds of which some are typical for this food ( hence the name of the compound oleuropein ) . Polyphenols in olives contribute to colour , taste and texture , and enhance auto-oxidative and thermo-oxidative stability of the oil ( 365 ) . Strong correlations have been found between the dialdehydic forms of the oleuropein aglycones , ligstroside aglycones , and the aldehydic forms of oleuropein aglycones , and the bitterness intensity of virgin olive oil ( 366 ) . Total polyphenol contents , as measured by the Folin method , are 117 mg / 100 g in black olives and 161 mg / 100 g in green olives . For the analysis of polyphenol contents in olives , only data on olive flesh ( the fruit without the inner stone ) have been retained . In extra virgin and virgin olive oil total polyphenol contents are 55 and 21 mg / 100 g. Olive fruits contain several types of polyphenols , mainly tyrosols , phenolic acids , flavonols and flavones , and for black olives , anthocyanins . The most abundant polyphenols are tyrosols , containing in their structure either tyrosol itself ( 2 - ( 4-hydroxyphenyl ) ethanol or p-HPEA ) or hydroxytyrosol ( 2 - ( 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ) ethanol or 3,4-DHPEA ) . These tyrosols are also secoiridoid glycosides , as the tyrosol moiety is most often esterified to a monoterpene of the secoiridoid class , the most common being elenolic acid or elenoic acid derivative ; this secoiridoid is itself often glucosylated as in oleuropein , the most common tyrosol in olives . The contents of oleuropein and its aglycone are respectively 72 and 82 mg / 100g in black olives , and 56 and 59 mg / 100 g in green olives . Ligstroside , glucopyranosyl coupled to elenolic acid ( oleoside ) which is esterified to tyrosol , is present in young olive fruits , however decreases as the fruit develops ( 367 ) . Only traces are present in black olive fruits ( 368 ) . Free hydroxytyrosol is also a major polyphenol in olive fruits ( 66 and 56 mg / 100 g in resp . black and green olives ) . Content values of demethyloleuropein are 23 and 13 mg / 100 g in black and green olives respectively . Hydroxytyrosol-elenolate ( 3,4-DHPEA - EA ) , a derivative of oleuropein-aglycone , is present in amounts of 9 and 18 mg /100g in respectively black and green olives . Content values of tyrosol are 14 and 7 mg /100g in black and green olives respectively . Other tyrosol -derivatives detected in olives are hydroxytyrosol - 1 - glucoside and hydroxytyrosol - 4-glucoside ( 369 , 370 ) , as well as oleoside - methylester . 3,4-DHPEA -EDA , the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein aglycone , has been detected in olive fruits , but this compound and its comparable structures are more abundant in olive oils ( see below ) ( 368 , 371 ) . Verbascoside , the caffeoylrhamnosylglucoside of hydroxytyrosol , is a phenolic acid derivative present in olives . Concentrations are 68 mg / 100 g in black olives and 17 mg / 100 g in green olives . Verbascoside levels depend on olive type and colour ( 372 , 373 , 374 ) . Black and green olives also contain other phenolic acids : sinapic acid ( 10.8 and 44 mg /100 g respectively ) , m-coumaric acid ( 12.5 and 8 mg /100 g respectively ) , syringic acid ( 33.1 and 6 mg /100 g respectively ) and o-coumaric acid ( 0.50 and 10 mg /100 g respectively ) . Other phenolic acids present in olive fruits are protocatechuic acid , p-coumaric acid , 4-hydroxybenzoic acid , p-hydroxyphenylpropanoic acid , 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid , 3 - methoxy - 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid , ferulic acid and caffeic acid . Black olives contain the anthocyanins cyanidin 3 - O-rutinoside and cyanidin 3 - O-glucoside , in amounts of respectively 72 and 11 mg / 100 g . The contents of flavonols vary among olive varieties . Quercetin 3 - O-rutinoside values in black olives are 45 mg / 100 g and quercetin 3 - O-rhamnoside values are 4.1 mg /100g . Flavones are also present in olive fruits . Luteolin 7 - O-glucoside is the most important one ( 15 mg / 100 g in black olives ) . Luteolin , luteolin 6 - C-glucoside , apigenin 7 - O-glucoside , and apigenin 7 - O-rutinoside have also been detected . Trace amounts of lignans are present in olive fruits . Two phenolic compounds identified in olives , but not quantified , are the methyl acetal of the aglycone of ligstroside , and the \u00df-hydroxytyrosol ester of methyl malate ( 375 ) . In olive oils , tyrosols are also the most abundant polyphenols . The major tyrosols in olive oil are : 3,4-DHPEA-EDA ( hydroxytyrosol linked to a dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid ) , 3,4-DHPEA -EA ( monoaldehydic form of oleuropein aglycone ) , p-HPEA - EDA ( dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid ) and p-HPEA - EA ( monoaldehydic form of ligstroside aglycone ) . Because of keto-enolic tautomeric equilibria involving the ring opening of the secoiridoid , two aldehyde groups are present in the elenolic acid moiety of the oleuropein aglycone . The favoured structure of the decarboxymethyl aglycones is the dialdehydic form ( 3,4-DHPEA -EDA and p-HPEA - EDA ) , whereas the monoaldehydic form is favoured for oleuropein and ligstroside aglycones ( 3,4-DHPEA - EA and p-HPEA - EA ) ( 376 ) . During the crushing , kneading and extraction of olive fruits to obtain olive oil , the glycosidic oleuropein , demethyloleuropein and ligstroside are hydrolyzed by endogenous \u03b2-glucosidases , to form aldehydic aglycones . The aglycones become soluble in the oil phase , whereas the glycosides remain in the water phase . The content values of 3,4-DHPEA-EDA , 3,4-DHPEA-EA , p-HPEA -EDA and p-HPEA -EA in extra virgin olive oil are 25 , 7.2 , 14 and 3.8 mg /100 g respectively . Tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol are present in minor amounts ( 1.1 and 0.8 mg /100 g respectively ) . Oleuropein , ligstroside , and the oleuropein- and ligstroside - aglycones have been detected in olive oil , as well as their dialdehydic aglycone forms , and the decarboxymethyl oleuropein-aglycone . The lignans 1 - acetoxypinoresinol and pinoresinol are present in olive oil ( 0.67 and 0.42 mg /100 g in extra virgin olive oil ) . The flavones apigenin and luteolin are also detected ( 1.2 and 0.4 mg / 100 g in extra virgin olive oil ) . The phenolic acids p-coumaric acid , vanillic acid , 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid , syringic acid , caffeic acid , cinnamic acid and ferulic acid are present in low amounts in olive oil . Also vanillin , protocatechuic acid , 4-hydroxybenzoic acid , 3 - methoxy - 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid , and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol have been measured in small amounts . In contrast to olive fruits , olive oil contains neither anthocyanins nor flavonols . The polyphenol composition of olive fruits varies during fruit ripening . In the growth phase of the olive fruit the oleuropein content increases . In most varieties oleuropein levels are highest in the spotted olives just before they turn black , and then decrease in black olives . Anthocyanins are responsable for the colour of black olives ( 373 , 377 , 378 , 379 ) . Oleuropein content reaches concentrations up to 14 % on a dry weight basis in young Picholine olives ( 378 , 380 ) . As oleuropein declines with fruit maturity , the demethyloleuropein content increases , however this is strongly variety - dependent ( 373 , 380 , 381 ) . Verbascoside was not detectable in young olive fruits , but increases considerably during growing , before its levels fall sharply during ripening and maturation ( 378 ) . Hydroxytyrosol contents increase during maturation , as well as tyrosol contents , correlating with the hydrolysis of the components with higher molecular weights ( 382 ) . Olive ripening lasts several months and ripening processes vary according to growing area , variety , water availability , temperature , and farming practices ( 377 ) . Polyphenol contents , especially of tyrosols , increase in water - deficit stressed olives ( 383 , 384 ) . Lignans , vanillic acid and vanillin however increase in more irrigated olive trees , compared to water - stressed olive trees ( 370 ) . Fermentation has a great impact on the polyphenol concentration , and final polyphenol composition depends on the type of fermentation used . During Spanish - style fermentation , hydrolysis of oleuropein into hydroxytyrosol and elenolic acid glycosides occurs through the treatment with NaOH . By leaving the olives in brine , hydroxytyrosol diffuses from the fruits into the brine solution . In the Californian way of fermentation , ripe olives are immediately stored in brine for fermentation to occur . Hydrolysis of oleuropein results in an increase of hydroxytyrosol . Because of the presence of acetic acid in the brines , hydroxytyrosol - acetate and tyrosol - acetate are formed . Cyanidin 3 - O-glucoside and cyanidin 3 - O-rutinoside contents decrease by about 95 % during brining . After washing to remove the brining salts all compounds show a marked decrease ( 385 , 386 , 387 , 388 ) . Different olive cultivars show very different polyphenol contents ( 374 ) , but the polyphenol profiles are rather similar ( 389 ) . Polyphenol composition of olive oils differs significantly from that of olive fruits due to selective effects of the process on the different polyphenols . Large proportions of water - soluble compounds are lost in the waste water during the extraction of the olive oil . Furthermore , during olive oil production modifications take place as a consequence of cellular destruction and the mixing of cellular contents , like the hydrolysis of glycosides . When comparing the different types of olive oils , the total polyphenol and tyrosol contents appear to be highest in extra-virgin olive oil , and then in descendent order in virgin olive oil and refined olive oil ( 390 , 391 ) . Olive - pomace oil and pure olive oil had a total polyphenol content respectively 15 % and 30 % lower than that of virgin olive oils . Apart from these differences in polyphenol content , the polyphenol profiles of the different olive oils are similar , although some minor differences have been reported such as the presence of 4- ethylphenol in olive - pomace oils but not in virgin olive oils ( 392 ) . The most common ways of domestic heating of olive oil are frying ( 180\u00b0C ) , microwave heating , and boiling with water . During heating of olive oil , changes in polyphenol composition occur . These changes depend on the way of heating . The frying of olive oil provokes a decrease in the contents of hydroxytyrosol , tyrosol and other tyrosol derivatives . Hydroxytyrosol , 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and 3,4-DHPEA -EA in virgin olive oil are reduced by 40 - 50 % after 10 minutes frying at 180\u00b0C , and by about 90 % after six frying operations . Tyrosol , p-HPEA -EDA and p-HPEA -EA however are much more stable . Their contents are only reduced by 20 % during up to 12 frying operations . Lignan content remains largely constant ( 393 , 394 ) . Microwave heating provokes only minor losses of polyphenols . The boiling of olive oil and water results in the hydrolysis of the secoiridoid aglycones and the release of hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol . These simple phenols then migrate from the oil into the water phase . Also contents of these polyphenols strongly decrease in the oil . Hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol in the water phase were further degraded particularly at sufficiently acidic pH ( pH 4 and 5 ) ( 394 ) . Storage of olive oil leads to an increase of hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol likely explained by the breakdown of secoiridoids , because the contents of 3,4-DHPEA-EDA , p-HPEA-EDA , 3,4-DHPEA -EA , and 3,4-DHPEA - AC decrease in the mean time ( 377 ) . Total polyphenol contents are lower after storage of olive oil . Lignans are stable during storage . The use of olive oil in cooking is very common in the Mediterranean area . When 60 g of virgin olive oil is used for the preparation of a 4 - person meal , about 15g olive oil is consumed per person . This meal will provide about 9.6 mg of tyrosols per person , of which 2.7 mg 3,4-DHPEA -EDA . Rape seed and rape seed oil Rape seed ( Brassica napus L. ) is a member of the family Brassicaceae . The closely related Brassica campestris is sometimes included within Brassica napus L.. Rapeseed is grown for the production of vegetable oil for human consumption . Processing of rape seed for oil production provides rapes eed animal meal as a by-product . The leading producers are Europe , Canada , the USA , Australia , China and India . In India , it is grown on 13 % of the cropped land . According to the United States Department of Agriculture , rapeseed is the third most important oilseed crop in worldwide oilseed production . The Brassica rapa variety is called turnip rapeseed . A winter and summer variant exist , sown respectively in late summer or early spring on Northern hemispheres . Yields , as well as fatty acid profiles differ between oil rape seed and turnip rapeseed . Rapeseed oil contains erucic acid , which is mildly toxic to humans in large doses . However , it is used as a food additive in minor doses . Canola , derived from ' CANadian Oilseed , Low - Acid ' is the trade name for a rapeseed variety low in erucic acid . This variety is also called ' Double low ( 00 ) ' . A rather large amount of data exists on polyphenols in rapeseed meal . However , not much content data are available on polyphenols in the oil extracted from the rapeseeds . After the extraction of oil from the rape seeds , most polyphenols remain in the dry meal . Total polyphenol content in rape seed oil is about 18 mg / 100 g , with large variations between trace amounts and 106 mg / 100 g. Polyphenol content in turnip rape seed oil appears to be low ( 0.37 mg /100 g ) ( 395 ) . The main polyphenols in rapes eed oil are 4- vinylsyringol , sinapine ( O-sinapoylcholine ) and sinapic acid . 4 - Vinylsyringol is a decarboxylation product of sinapic acid , and content values are 14 mg / 100 g rape seed oil . Contents of sinapic acid and sinapine in rape seed oil , measured without hydrolysis , are 0.83 and 0.64 mg /100 g respectively . After hydrolysis , sinapine is hydrolysed into sinapic acid . It is not clear to what extent polyphenols present in rape seeds are transferred into the oil during oil extraction processes . Rape seed oil is usually expelled from the seed at high temperatures . Refining removes most of the non-triacylglycerol components , including many sinapic acid derivatives . Polyphenol contents decrease with an increasing degree of refining ( 396 ) . Sesame seed and sesame oil Sesame ( Sesamum indicum L. ) is an oilseed crop from the Pedaliaceae family grown in various tropical and subtropical regions of the world . Sesame seeds are very rich in oil , 50 percent of seed weight , compared to 20 % of seed weight for soybeans . Sesame seeds exist in two basic types , white and black . The paler varieties of sesame tend to be more valued in the West and Middle East . The black varieties are of preference in the Far East . Sesame seeds are used in breads , bagels and buns , crackers and cakes . The bakery and confectionary industry usually uses dehulled sesame seeds . Also , sesame seeds are added to snacks and sushi foods . Ground and processed , the hulled sesame seeds are used for tahini ( sesame paste ) and halva ( a sweet confection ) . Black sesame seeds are used for making the flavouring gomashio . Sesame oil ( with a pale yellow colour ) is extracted from the sesame seeds for nutritional use . Salad oil is extracted by an expeller and refined by alkaline treatment , water washing , bleaching with acid clay , and lastly a deodorizing process . Sesame oil and seeds are used in salads . Oils made from roasted or unroasted sesame seeds are used for cooking . The total polyphenol content , as measured by the Folin method , is about 3 times higher in black sesame meal than in white sesame meal ( 397 ) ; this difference is more pronounced in the sesame hulls as , , like in cereal grains , sesame hulls contain higher concentrations of polyphenols than their endosperm . The major polyphenols in sesame seeds are the lignans . The most abundant lignan is sesamin , with content values in sesame meal of 538 mg / 100 g. Another major lignan in sesame is sesamolin ( 134 mg / 100 g in sesame meal ) . Sesaminol , pinoresinol and matairesinol are present with content values of 103 , 8.0 and 0.11 mg / 100 g in sesame meal . Lignan glycosides are present in sesame meal and have been detected after basic hydrolysis ( not able to release the aglycon from the glycosides ) , sesaminol triglucoside being the most abundant ( 68 mg / 100 g in sesame meal ) . Furthermore , sesaminol diglucoside and sesaminol monoglucoside are found in sesame meals with contents of 11.6 and 8.3 mg /100 g respectively . Other minor lignans ( detected after hydrolysis ) are lariciresinol ( 11 mg /100 g ) , 7-hydroxymatairesinol ( 7.2 mg /100 g ) , medioresinol ( 4.2 mg / 100 g ) and todolactol A ( 2.5 mg / 100 g ) . Trace values of other lignans have been found in sesame meal . Amongst them are secoisilariciresinol , iso-hydroxymatairesinol , cyclolariciresinol , conidendrin , syringaresinol and oxomatairesinol . The oil content of white seeded sesame varieties is higher than that of black seeded varieties ( 398 , 399 ) . Sesame oil contains 421 mg / 100 g sesamin . Sesaminol and sesamolin contents are 305 and 243 mg / 100 g oil respectively . Sesamolinol is found in lower amounts in oil ( 56 mg / 100 g ) . Other lignans , episesamin , episesaminol and sesamol , have also been detected in sesame oils . Next to lignans , sesame contains phenolic acids . Both ester and insoluble - bound forms of caffeic acid , p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid are found in sesame meal , the ester forms being more abundant . The proportion of esterified to insoluble bound phenolic acids in defatted sesame meal ( DW ) is 4:1 ( 341 ) . Roasted sesame oil contains minor amounts of benzaldehyde . Volatile compounds in roasted sesame seeds are guaiacol , 3 - acetylanisole , acetophenone , benzenemethanol and 2 - methoxy - 5 - ( 1 - propenyl ) phenol . Oil extracted from light - roasted sesame seeds is richer in these volatile compounds than oil extracted from deep-roasted seeds . Black sesame seeds are richer in sesaminol than white sesame seeds . Conversely , white sesame seeds are richer in sesamin compared to black sesame seeds . No difference was found between black and white sesame seeds in sesamolin and sesamolinol contents ( 398 ) . During the processing of sesame oil the sesaminol content increases . This occurs especially during the bleaching process ( 400 ) . Furthermore , the heating of sesame seeds to produce oil , and its storage , leads to degradation of sesamolin , and in minor amounts sesamin . This effect is more pronounced in oil from dehulled sesame seeds compared to oil from hulled sesame seeds ( 401 ) . In use as a cooking oil , lignan contents remain unchanged after short heating ( < 4 min . ) . After prolonged heating ( > 20 min . ) sesamol contents increase and sesamolin and sesamol contents decrease ( 402 ) . Sunflower seed and sunflower oil Sunflower ( Helianthus annuus ) belongs to the Asteraceae family . Russia . Argentina , the European Union , China , India , Turkey and South Africa are all significant producers of sunflower . There are two types of sunflowers . The first is the oilseed type . It has small black seeds that are high in oil content and processed into sunflower oil and meal . The second type is the confectionery sunflower . This is a larger black and white striped seed . Sunflower whole seeds still contain their hull . They are sold as a snack food after roasting . The edible kernel is obtained by ( mechanical ) removal of the hull . Sunflower oil , extracted from the seeds , is used for cooking . There are three types of sunflower oil depending on their fatty acid profiles : linoleic ( the original sunflower oil ) , ' mid-oleic ' sunflower oil and ' high oleic ' sunflower oil . Not much data on polyphenol contents in sunflower seeds and oils are yet available . Sunflower oil was found to contain 1 mg / 100 g of total polyphenols ( Folin assay ) ( single data source ) . More data are available on the defatted dry meal of sunflower seeds . Sunflower seeds contain phenolic acids in free , esterified and insoluble - bound forms . Esterified forms are much more abundant than insoluble - bound forms . The major phenolic acid is caffeic acid . 4 - Hydroxybenzoic acid , ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid are also present . Minor amounts of syringic acid and vanillic acid have also been detected . No lignans were detected in sunflower oil . However , matairesinol , lariciresinol , pinoresinol and secoisolariciresinol have been detected in sunflower seeds .","annotations":[{"text":"olive fruits","span":[8444,8455],"token_span":[1559,1560],"role":"Patient","label":"Patient","role_definition":"The Patient is the entity which undergoes the change brought about by the Grinder or Grinding_cause."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"Phytochemicals The polyphenol composition of olive fruits varies during fruit ripening and during processing by fermentation when olives are immersed whole in brine or crushed to produce oil .

The Mediterranean region is the major olive growing area and accounts for 98 % of the olive tree plantations in the world . The olive fruits are consumed as olive oil or table olives . About 90 % of the annual olive production is used for olive oil . The olive fruit is harvested at the green stage ( ' green olive ' ) , or left to ripen to a dark purple colour ( ' black olive ' ) . The oil content of the olive fruit lies between 12 - 30 % , depending on the variety . Olive fruits are naturally bitter due to the presence of the polyphenol oleuropein , and therefore need to be processed before consumption . Traditional methods use the natural microflora on the fruit and procedures that bring about fermentation of the fruit . This fermentation leads to the leaching out and breakdown of oleuropein and phenolic compounds , the formation of lactic acid and of a complex of flavours . Three main processing methods are distinguished : the Spanish style , the Californian style , and the Greek style . The Spanish - style green olives are treated with sodium hydroxide ( Na OH ) , and fermented in brine ( sodium - chloride solution , NaCl ) for several months . Californian - style olives are preserved in brine or acidified liquids during several months for fermentation to occur . Then , fruits are repeatedly treated with NaOH , and in between the alkaline treatments the olive fruits are suspended in water through which air is bubbled . Greek - style olives are not treated with NaOH . They are harvested when fully ripe , and fermented and canned in brine . There are a several thousand of different olive cultivars distinguished . Some economically important cultivars are : Manzanillo ( world ) , Picual ( Spain ) , Arbequina ( Spain ) , Kalamata ( Spain ) , Frantoio ( Italy ) , Leccino ( Italy ) , Koroneiki ( Greece ) and Pecholine ( France ) . Olive oil has become more and more popular as nutritional oil in the last decade , due to its taste and nutritional properties . It is often recommended for frying . In heating , it preserves largely its nutritional value , because of its antioxidants and its high levels of oleic acid . Whereas industrial classification distinguishes ' ( extra ) virgin olive oil ' ( physical extraction ) , ' refined olive oil ' ( chemically treated to improve taste ) , and ' pomace olive oil ' ( chemical extraction from olive pomace , the by-product remaining after physical extraction of the oil from the fruits ) , retail classification is different . In stores , olive oils are classified as ' extra - virgin olive oil ' ( first pressing ) , ' virgin olive oil ' , ' pure olive oil ' ( mixture of refined olive oil and ( extra - ) virgin olive oil ) , or ' olive - pomace oil ' ( blend of refined pomace olive oil and virgin olive oil ) . Currently , most data on polyphenols are available for ( extra - ) virgin olive oils . Olives contain a great number of compounds of which some are typical for this food ( hence the name of the compound oleuropein ) . Polyphenols in olives contribute to colour , taste and texture , and enhance auto-oxidative and thermo-oxidative stability of the oil ( 365 ) . Strong correlations have been found between the dialdehydic forms of the oleuropein aglycones , ligstroside aglycones , and the aldehydic forms of oleuropein aglycones , and the bitterness intensity of virgin olive oil ( 366 ) . Total polyphenol contents , as measured by the Folin method , are 117 mg / 100 g in black olives and 161 mg / 100 g in green olives . For the analysis of polyphenol contents in olives , only data on olive flesh ( the fruit without the inner stone ) have been retained . In extra virgin and virgin olive oil total polyphenol contents are 55 and 21 mg / 100 g. Olive fruits contain several types of polyphenols , mainly tyrosols , phenolic acids , flavonols and flavones , and for black olives , anthocyanins . The most abundant polyphenols are tyrosols , containing in their structure either tyrosol itself ( 2 - ( 4-hydroxyphenyl ) ethanol or p-HPEA ) or hydroxytyrosol ( 2 - ( 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ) ethanol or 3,4-DHPEA ) . These tyrosols are also secoiridoid glycosides , as the tyrosol moiety is most often esterified to a monoterpene of the secoiridoid class , the most common being elenolic acid or elenoic acid derivative ; this secoiridoid is itself often glucosylated as in oleuropein , the most common tyrosol in olives . The contents of oleuropein and its aglycone are respectively 72 and 82 mg / 100g in black olives , and 56 and 59 mg / 100 g in green olives . Ligstroside , glucopyranosyl coupled to elenolic acid ( oleoside ) which is esterified to tyrosol , is present in young olive fruits , however decreases as the fruit develops ( 367 ) . Only traces are present in black olive fruits ( 368 ) . Free hydroxytyrosol is also a major polyphenol in olive fruits ( 66 and 56 mg / 100 g in resp . black and green olives ) . Content values of demethyloleuropein are 23 and 13 mg / 100 g in black and green olives respectively . Hydroxytyrosol-elenolate ( 3,4-DHPEA - EA ) , a derivative of oleuropein-aglycone , is present in amounts of 9 and 18 mg /100g in respectively black and green olives . Content values of tyrosol are 14 and 7 mg /100g in black and green olives respectively . Other tyrosol -derivatives detected in olives are hydroxytyrosol - 1 - glucoside and hydroxytyrosol - 4-glucoside ( 369 , 370 ) , as well as oleoside - methylester . 3,4-DHPEA -EDA , the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein aglycone , has been detected in olive fruits , but this compound and its comparable structures are more abundant in olive oils ( see below ) ( 368 , 371 ) . Verbascoside , the caffeoylrhamnosylglucoside of hydroxytyrosol , is a phenolic acid derivative present in olives . Concentrations are 68 mg / 100 g in black olives and 17 mg / 100 g in green olives . Verbascoside levels depend on olive type and colour ( 372 , 373 , 374 ) . Black and green olives also contain other phenolic acids : sinapic acid ( 10.8 and 44 mg /100 g respectively ) , m-coumaric acid ( 12.5 and 8 mg /100 g respectively ) , syringic acid ( 33.1 and 6 mg /100 g respectively ) and o-coumaric acid ( 0.50 and 10 mg /100 g respectively ) . Other phenolic acids present in olive fruits are protocatechuic acid , p-coumaric acid , 4-hydroxybenzoic acid , p-hydroxyphenylpropanoic acid , 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid , 3 - methoxy - 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid , ferulic acid and caffeic acid . Black olives contain the anthocyanins cyanidin 3 - O-rutinoside and cyanidin 3 - O-glucoside , in amounts of respectively 72 and 11 mg / 100 g . The contents of flavonols vary among olive varieties . Quercetin 3 - O-rutinoside values in black olives are 45 mg / 100 g and quercetin 3 - O-rhamnoside values are 4.1 mg /100g . Flavones are also present in olive fruits . Luteolin 7 - O-glucoside is the most important one ( 15 mg / 100 g in black olives ) . Luteolin , luteolin 6 - C-glucoside , apigenin 7 - O-glucoside , and apigenin 7 - O-rutinoside have also been detected . Trace amounts of lignans are present in olive fruits . Two phenolic compounds identified in olives , but not quantified , are the methyl acetal of the aglycone of ligstroside , and the \u00df-hydroxytyrosol ester of methyl malate ( 375 ) . In olive oils , tyrosols are also the most abundant polyphenols . The major tyrosols in olive oil are : 3,4-DHPEA-EDA ( hydroxytyrosol linked to a dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid ) , 3,4-DHPEA -EA ( monoaldehydic form of oleuropein aglycone ) , p-HPEA - EDA ( dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid ) and p-HPEA - EA ( monoaldehydic form of ligstroside aglycone ) . Because of keto-enolic tautomeric equilibria involving the ring opening of the secoiridoid , two aldehyde groups are present in the elenolic acid moiety of the oleuropein aglycone . The favoured structure of the decarboxymethyl aglycones is the dialdehydic form ( 3,4-DHPEA -EDA and p-HPEA - EDA ) , whereas the monoaldehydic form is favoured for oleuropein and ligstroside aglycones ( 3,4-DHPEA - EA and p-HPEA - EA ) ( 376 ) . During the crushing , kneading and extraction of olive fruits to obtain olive oil , the glycosidic oleuropein , demethyloleuropein and ligstroside are hydrolyzed by endogenous \u03b2-glucosidases , to form aldehydic aglycones . The aglycones become soluble in the oil phase , whereas the glycosides remain in the water phase . The content values of 3,4-DHPEA-EDA , 3,4-DHPEA-EA , p-HPEA -EDA and p-HPEA -EA in extra virgin olive oil are 25 , 7.2 , 14 and 3.8 mg /100 g respectively . Tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol are present in minor amounts ( 1.1 and 0.8 mg /100 g respectively ) . Oleuropein , ligstroside , and the oleuropein- and ligstroside - aglycones have been detected in olive oil , as well as their dialdehydic aglycone forms , and the decarboxymethyl oleuropein-aglycone . The lignans 1 - acetoxypinoresinol and pinoresinol are present in olive oil ( 0.67 and 0.42 mg /100 g in extra virgin olive oil ) . The flavones apigenin and luteolin are also detected ( 1.2 and 0.4 mg / 100 g in extra virgin olive oil ) . The phenolic acids p-coumaric acid , vanillic acid , 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid , syringic acid , caffeic acid , cinnamic acid and ferulic acid are present in low amounts in olive oil . Also vanillin , protocatechuic acid , 4-hydroxybenzoic acid , 3 - methoxy - 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid , and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol have been measured in small amounts . In contrast to olive fruits , olive oil contains neither anthocyanins nor flavonols . The polyphenol composition of olive fruits varies during fruit ripening . In the growth phase of the olive fruit the oleuropein content increases . In most varieties oleuropein levels are highest in the spotted olives just before they turn black , and then decrease in black olives . Anthocyanins are responsable for the colour of black olives ( 373 , 377 , 378 , 379 ) . Oleuropein content reaches concentrations up to 14 % on a dry weight basis in young Picholine olives ( 378 , 380 ) . As oleuropein declines with fruit maturity , the demethyloleuropein content increases , however this is strongly variety - dependent ( 373 , 380 , 381 ) . Verbascoside was not detectable in young olive fruits , but increases considerably during growing , before its levels fall sharply during ripening and maturation ( 378 ) . Hydroxytyrosol contents increase during maturation , as well as tyrosol contents , correlating with the hydrolysis of the components with higher molecular weights ( 382 ) . Olive ripening lasts several months and ripening processes vary according to growing area , variety , water availability , temperature , and farming practices ( 377 ) . Polyphenol contents , especially of tyrosols , increase in water - deficit stressed olives ( 383 , 384 ) . Lignans , vanillic acid and vanillin however increase in more irrigated olive trees , compared to water - stressed olive trees ( 370 ) . Fermentation has a great impact on the polyphenol concentration , and final polyphenol composition depends on the type of fermentation used . During Spanish - style fermentation , hydrolysis of oleuropein into hydroxytyrosol and elenolic acid glycosides occurs through the treatment with NaOH . By leaving the olives in brine , hydroxytyrosol diffuses from the fruits into the brine solution . In the Californian way of fermentation , ripe olives are immediately stored in brine for fermentation to occur . Hydrolysis of oleuropein results in an increase of hydroxytyrosol . Because of the presence of acetic acid in the brines , hydroxytyrosol - acetate and tyrosol - acetate are formed . Cyanidin 3 - O-glucoside and cyanidin 3 - O-rutinoside contents decrease by about 95 % during brining . After washing to remove the brining salts all compounds show a marked decrease ( 385 , 386 , 387 , 388 ) . Different olive cultivars show very different polyphenol contents ( 374 ) , but the polyphenol profiles are rather similar ( 389 ) . Polyphenol composition of olive oils differs significantly from that of olive fruits due to selective effects of the process on the different polyphenols . Large proportions of water - soluble compounds are lost in the waste water during the extraction of the olive oil . Furthermore , during olive oil production modifications take place as a consequence of cellular destruction and the mixing of cellular contents , like the hydrolysis of glycosides . When comparing the different types of olive oils , the total polyphenol and tyrosol contents appear to be highest in extra-virgin olive oil , and then in descendent order in virgin olive oil and refined olive oil ( 390 , 391 ) . Olive - pomace oil and pure olive oil had a total polyphenol content respectively 15 % and 30 % lower than that of virgin olive oils . Apart from these differences in polyphenol content , the polyphenol profiles of the different olive oils are similar , although some minor differences have been reported such as the presence of 4- ethylphenol in olive - pomace oils but not in virgin olive oils ( 392 ) . The most common ways of domestic heating of olive oil are frying ( 180\u00b0C ) , microwave heating , and boiling with water . During heating of olive oil , changes in polyphenol composition occur . These changes depend on the way of heating . The frying of olive oil provokes a decrease in the contents of hydroxytyrosol , tyrosol and other tyrosol derivatives . Hydroxytyrosol , 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and 3,4-DHPEA -EA in virgin olive oil are reduced by 40 - 50 % after 10 minutes frying at 180\u00b0C , and by about 90 % after six frying operations . Tyrosol , p-HPEA -EDA and p-HPEA -EA however are much more stable . Their contents are only reduced by 20 % during up to 12 frying operations . Lignan content remains largely constant ( 393 , 394 ) . Microwave heating provokes only minor losses of polyphenols . The boiling of olive oil and water results in the hydrolysis of the secoiridoid aglycones and the release of hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol . These simple phenols then migrate from the oil into the water phase . Also contents of these polyphenols strongly decrease in the oil . Hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol in the water phase were further degraded particularly at sufficiently acidic pH ( pH 4 and 5 ) ( 394 ) . Storage of olive oil leads to an increase of hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol likely explained by the breakdown of secoiridoids , because the contents of 3,4-DHPEA-EDA , p-HPEA-EDA , 3,4-DHPEA -EA , and 3,4-DHPEA - AC decrease in the mean time ( 377 ) . Total polyphenol contents are lower after storage of olive oil . Lignans are stable during storage . The use of olive oil in cooking is very common in the Mediterranean area . When 60 g of virgin olive oil is used for the preparation of a 4 - person meal , about 15g olive oil is consumed per person . This meal will provide about 9.6 mg of tyrosols per person , of which 2.7 mg 3,4-DHPEA -EDA . Rape seed and rape seed oil Rape seed ( Brassica napus L. ) is a member of the family Brassicaceae . The closely related Brassica campestris is sometimes included within Brassica napus L.. Rapeseed is grown for the production of vegetable oil for human consumption . Processing of rape seed for oil production provides rapes eed animal meal as a by-product . The leading producers are Europe , Canada , the USA , Australia , China and India . In India , it is grown on 13 % of the cropped land . According to the United States Department of Agriculture , rapeseed is the third most important oilseed crop in worldwide oilseed production . The Brassica rapa variety is called turnip rapeseed . A winter and summer variant exist , sown respectively in late summer or early spring on Northern hemispheres . Yields , as well as fatty acid profiles differ between oil rape seed and turnip rapeseed . Rapeseed oil contains erucic acid , which is mildly toxic to humans in large doses . However , it is used as a food additive in minor doses . Canola , derived from ' CANadian Oilseed , Low - Acid ' is the trade name for a rapeseed variety low in erucic acid . This variety is also called ' Double low ( 00 ) ' . A rather large amount of data exists on polyphenols in rapeseed meal . However , not much content data are available on polyphenols in the oil extracted from the rapeseeds . After the extraction of oil from the rape seeds , most polyphenols remain in the dry meal . Total polyphenol content in rape seed oil is about 18 mg / 100 g , with large variations between trace amounts and 106 mg / 100 g. Polyphenol content in turnip rape seed oil appears to be low ( 0.37 mg /100 g ) ( 395 ) . The main polyphenols in rapes eed oil are 4- vinylsyringol , sinapine ( O-sinapoylcholine ) and sinapic acid . 4 - Vinylsyringol is a decarboxylation product of sinapic acid , and content values are 14 mg / 100 g rape seed oil . Contents of sinapic acid and sinapine in rape seed oil , measured without hydrolysis , are 0.83 and 0.64 mg /100 g respectively . After hydrolysis , sinapine is hydrolysed into sinapic acid . It is not clear to what extent polyphenols present in rape seeds are transferred into the oil during oil extraction processes . Rape seed oil is usually expelled from the seed at high temperatures . Refining removes most of the non-triacylglycerol components , including many sinapic acid derivatives . Polyphenol contents decrease with an increasing degree of refining ( 396 ) . Sesame seed and sesame oil Sesame ( Sesamum indicum L. ) is an oilseed crop from the Pedaliaceae family grown in various tropical and subtropical regions of the world . Sesame seeds are very rich in oil , 50 percent of seed weight , compared to 20 % of seed weight for soybeans . Sesame seeds exist in two basic types , white and black . The paler varieties of sesame tend to be more valued in the West and Middle East . The black varieties are of preference in the Far East . Sesame seeds are used in breads , bagels and buns , crackers and cakes . The bakery and confectionary industry usually uses dehulled sesame seeds . Also , sesame seeds are added to snacks and sushi foods . Ground and processed , the hulled sesame seeds are used for tahini ( sesame paste ) and halva ( a sweet confection ) . Black sesame seeds are used for making the flavouring gomashio . Sesame oil ( with a pale yellow colour ) is extracted from the sesame seeds for nutritional use . Salad oil is extracted by an expeller and refined by alkaline treatment , water washing , bleaching with acid clay , and lastly a deodorizing process . Sesame oil and seeds are used in salads . Oils made from roasted or unroasted sesame seeds are used for cooking . The total polyphenol content , as measured by the Folin method , is about 3 times higher in black sesame meal than in white sesame meal ( 397 ) ; this difference is more pronounced in the sesame hulls as , , like in cereal grains , sesame hulls contain higher concentrations of polyphenols than their endosperm . The major polyphenols in sesame seeds are the lignans . The most abundant lignan is sesamin , with content values in sesame meal of 538 mg / 100 g. Another major lignan in sesame is sesamolin ( 134 mg / 100 g in sesame meal ) . Sesaminol , pinoresinol and matairesinol are present with content values of 103 , 8.0 and 0.11 mg / 100 g in sesame meal . Lignan glycosides are present in sesame meal and have been detected after basic hydrolysis ( not able to release the aglycon from the glycosides ) , sesaminol triglucoside being the most abundant ( 68 mg / 100 g in sesame meal ) . Furthermore , sesaminol diglucoside and sesaminol monoglucoside are found in sesame meals with contents of 11.6 and 8.3 mg /100 g respectively . Other minor lignans ( detected after hydrolysis ) are lariciresinol ( 11 mg /100 g ) , 7-hydroxymatairesinol ( 7.2 mg /100 g ) , medioresinol ( 4.2 mg / 100 g ) and todolactol A ( 2.5 mg / 100 g ) . Trace values of other lignans have been found in sesame meal . Amongst them are secoisilariciresinol , iso-hydroxymatairesinol , cyclolariciresinol , conidendrin , syringaresinol and oxomatairesinol . The oil content of white seeded sesame varieties is higher than that of black seeded varieties ( 398 , 399 ) . Sesame oil contains 421 mg / 100 g sesamin . Sesaminol and sesamolin contents are 305 and 243 mg / 100 g oil respectively . Sesamolinol is found in lower amounts in oil ( 56 mg / 100 g ) . Other lignans , episesamin , episesaminol and sesamol , have also been detected in sesame oils . Next to lignans , sesame contains phenolic acids . Both ester and insoluble - bound forms of caffeic acid , p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid are found in sesame meal , the ester forms being more abundant . The proportion of esterified to insoluble bound phenolic acids in defatted sesame meal ( DW ) is 4:1 ( 341 ) . Roasted sesame oil contains minor amounts of benzaldehyde . Volatile compounds in roasted sesame seeds are guaiacol , 3 - acetylanisole , acetophenone , benzenemethanol and 2 - methoxy - 5 - ( 1 - propenyl ) phenol . Oil extracted from light - roasted sesame seeds is richer in these volatile compounds than oil extracted from deep-roasted seeds . Black sesame seeds are richer in sesaminol than white sesame seeds . Conversely , white sesame seeds are richer in sesamin compared to black sesame seeds . No difference was found between black and white sesame seeds in sesamolin and sesamolinol contents ( 398 ) . During the processing of sesame oil the sesaminol content increases . This occurs especially during the bleaching process ( 400 ) . Furthermore , the heating of sesame seeds to produce oil , and its storage , leads to degradation of sesamolin , and in minor amounts sesamin . This effect is more pronounced in oil from dehulled sesame seeds compared to oil from hulled sesame seeds ( 401 ) . In use as a cooking oil , lignan contents remain unchanged after short heating ( < 4 min . ) . After prolonged heating ( > 20 min . ) sesamol contents increase and sesamolin and sesamol contents decrease ( 402 ) . Sunflower seed and sunflower oil Sunflower ( Helianthus annuus ) belongs to the Asteraceae family . Russia . Argentina , the European Union , China , India , Turkey and South Africa are all significant producers of sunflower . There are two types of sunflowers . The first is the oilseed type . It has small black seeds that are high in oil content and processed into sunflower oil and meal . The second type is the confectionery sunflower . This is a larger black and white striped seed . Sunflower whole seeds still contain their hull . They are sold as a snack food after roasting . The edible kernel is obtained by ( mechanical ) removal of the hull . Sunflower oil , extracted from the seeds , is used for cooking . There are three types of sunflower oil depending on their fatty acid profiles : linoleic ( the original sunflower oil ) , ' mid-oleic ' sunflower oil and ' high oleic ' sunflower oil . Not much data on polyphenol contents in sunflower seeds and oils are yet available . Sunflower oil was found to contain 1 mg / 100 g of total polyphenols ( Folin assay ) ( single data source ) . More data are available on the defatted dry meal of sunflower seeds . Sunflower seeds contain phenolic acids in free , esterified and insoluble - bound forms . Esterified forms are much more abundant than insoluble - bound forms . The major phenolic acid is caffeic acid . 4 - Hydroxybenzoic acid , ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid are also present . Minor amounts of syringic acid and vanillic acid have also been detected . No lignans were detected in sunflower oil . However , matairesinol , lariciresinol , pinoresinol and secoisolariciresinol have been detected in sunflower seeds .","annotations":[{"text":"olive fruits","span":[8444,8455],"token_span":[1559,1560],"role":"Patient","label":"Patient","role_definition":"The Patient is the entity which undergoes the change brought about by the Grinder or Grinding_cause."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-1065-431-frame-Grinding","frame":"Grinding","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"In this frame a Grinder or Grinding_cause causes a Patient to be broken into smaller pieces.","frame_ancestors":["Transitive_action","Objective_influence","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Although long thought to be a coffee mill , experimentation with some of the few survivors suggests the grinder is ill-suited for coffee .

In lieu of the address , pasted on the face of the envelope was a ' Believe It or Not ' cartoon sketch of the novel rifle . The only indication as to where the letter was to go was in a subtitle that indicated that one of the coffee grinder guns was at the Armory museum . It was delivered with apparently no trouble by the Post Office . Receipt of the letter sent officials at the plant to Museum Historian Christopher Dvarecka who came up with some facts about probably the most unique gun in our history . According to Dvarecka , during the Civil War era , the soldier was issued coffee beans as regular ration . Because the bean is useless unless pulverized , the soldiers adopted the habit of using the butt end of their rifles to make the bean into powder . This procedure have have led to quick and tasty coffee , but unfortunately it no only jarred the precision mechanism of the arm out of line but also cut down on the life expectancy of the weapon not to mention a careless soldier . The Army sought a way out and the Sharps Model 1860 rifle was made as the answer . Only 50 of these priceless weapons were made for trial purposes . The stock of the gun had a little hole large enough to admit the bean and a little crank which the foot soldier was to crank as the first step in satisfying his hunger . For some reason no more than 50 prototype guns were made and possession of one of them now represents considerable value . The Omaha businessmen sent his novel communication to Springfield to determine for himself , if the cartoon had its facts correct . \" Notes : During the cleaning of this arm by the National Park Service coffee grounds were actually found in the grinder . While we would like to think these coffee grounds were from a civil war soldier , the fact is the coffee grinder was once demonstrated by the former director of the Springfield Armory Museum , Mr. Robert Murphy . Evidently Mr. Murphy did not remove all the coffee grounds from the grinder after the demonstration . Mr. Murphy is pictured demonstrating the grinder in William B. Edwards ' CIVIL WAR GUNS on page 300 . \" ... This weapon ( without the crank ) was one of the most desirable arms issued during the Civil War . easily get off 10 rounds in a minute . ( 2 . ) If you guessed that the crank plays a role in increasing the soldier 's rate of fire you would be wrong . When the crank and its internal mechanism is removed from the butt stock , it becomes immediately apparent that this attachment is a grinding device of some sort . It has an input port in the upper end of the plate on the lower edge of the butt stock . The plate opposite the crank has an output slot . The question is , just what is suppose to come out of that slot ? In his privately published volume entitled FULLER GUN NOTES , the title of Mr. Fuller 's entry for this gun read : ' Sharps Breech - Loading Carbine . New Model 1863 with Coffee Mill . ' ( 3 . ) Early on , however , I read accounts which cast doubt on its function as a coffee grinder . ( 4 . ) CHCH park historian Jim Ogden ground a few coffee beans in the gun ( just prior to shipping it off for treatment ) . He reported disappointing results , stating that it would take an excessive number of beans to make a decent cup of coffee using the built - in grinder . Other authors reported similar disappointing results , ( 5,6 ) and one logically speculated that '... coffee was more of luxury ( for Civil War era soldiers ) , it is more likely that the ' coffee mill ' was originally a grain mill , ' presumably for converting foraged grains into meal or flour . ( 7 . ) In looking further into the matter it soon became clear that the Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Co. was not responsible for this adaptation . ( 8 . ) The question as to who was responsible seemed to have several answers . Here is a sampling : ' During the Civil War a workmen employed at the St. Louis Arsenal devised a plan to incorporate a coffee mill on the butt stock of the gun . ' ( 9,10 ) ' The coffee mill part was added ... by James McMurphy of Camden , New Jersey on contract for the Ordnance Department . ( 11 . ) ' The Coffee Mill attachment , located in the stock where the patch box is usually placed , was added to a few of these carbines by a contractor in S ( sic ) Saint Louis , Mo . The idea being to issue one to a company . ' ( 12 . ) ' The theory was that the mill would be useful for grinding corn and other grain ... as well as the issue coffee . ' ( 13 . ) While there may be elements of truth in all of these assertions - the only solid answer came to my attention just before this article was due . Mr. Howard Madaus , curator of the Cody Firearms Museum , thought I would find an authoritative article in the quarterly journal published by the Company of Military Historians . He was quite right . In a brief article on the origin and purpose of the Sharps mill gun , it author quotes directly from the January 6 , 1865 , report of an inspection board charged with inspecting and reporting about this modification ( and other improvements ) to the Adjutant General of the Army , Lorenzo Thomas . The board included an Assistant Inspector General for the Cavalry Bureau , a senior officer from the Subsistence Department , and its presiding officer was a general officer from the Quartermaster Department . ( 14 . ) The inventor was Lt. Col. Walter King who was ' detached service ' from the 4th Missouri State Militia Cavalry for all of 1864 and 1865 until he was mustered out on AprThe board 's report was not encouraging . They felt that if there were grain available to be foraged , there would also be mills nearby for its processing . They expressed doubt that grain found in the field would be dry enough to be successfully ground into meal or flour . They also objected to adding more weight to the cavalryman 's equipage when recent experience had shown that their first priority should be to see that the soldier is able to carry as much ammunition as possible . They also pointed out that the mill could not be universally installed , and in particular would not work on the more recently adopted Spencer repeating carbine - because its seven-round magazine runs right down the middle of its butt stock . Allowing that others might disagree with their findings , the board recommended that Lt. Col . King be permitted to conduct a ' fair trial in the field , ' and ( at his own expense ) be allowed to outfit a squadron of up to 100 men with the permission of the unit 's commanding officer . ( 15 . ) At present it is not known if the field trial ever took place . In fact , much more research is needed to determine with documented certainty even the basic facts about this gun . Did Lt. Col . King intend for every mounted soldier to be issued his own ' raiding equipments , ' or would they be spread out among the troops ? How many Sharps were actually adapted to include a mill , and from what arsenal were they issued ? Did Col . King have to purchase them himself or were they on loan and subsequently returned to the issuing armory ? Who actually installed the mills and where ? How were the guns finally disposed of ? Did Congressman King use influence to get his son a hearing for his inventions and permission to conduct a field trial ? The ' Coffee Mill ' Sharps carbine is one of the rarest guns collected . I know of four . It is often said that eight genuine examples exist . Others have estimated their being between 50 and 100 . Much remains a mystery , and research will continue in order to ' tie up ' the loose ends and one day to publish a more expanded article on this most peculiar firearm . Notes : 1 .

During the Civil War a workman empl \" While this device has been incorporated with several models ( 1859 , 1863 ) , it is more commonly known by collectors as The Coffee Mill Sharps . During the Civil War it was customary to issue whole coffee beans to the troops in the field ; the grinding or pulverizing of these beans was then left up to the individual . The beans were usually crushed between rocks or smashed against a rock by blows from the buttstock of the arm carried . It would not have been practical to issue a coffee- mill to the now over- loaded soldier . One solution to this problem was brought forward by a highly imaginative employee at the government arsenal at Saint Louis , Missouri . His suggestion was to incorporate a coffee mill with an article a soldier always has with him - his rifle , of course . Made up towards the end of the Civil War in 1865 , they were originally intended to be issued on the basis of one to a company , with the cavalry being the first branch of the army to test them . This somewhat impractical device did not prove to be of significant value and was promptly discontinued . Examination of the milling device , with the inclusion of the handle and cover plates definitely prove these parts to have been made out of cast iron . In an earlier publication , it appeared to the author that the mill was incapable of grinding coffee , as the lead - in grooves of the burr mill are not large enough to accept a whole coffee bean . The actual grinding of full size beans has been accomplished by one of the illustrated specimens . While this is a most slow and arduous process , the weapon may still hold title to being called a Coffee Mill .... Inasmuch as quantity of manufacture go , there have been five different reports made ranging upwards from six to a total of fifty . Which amount is the most probably correct is a rather doubtful guess at the very best ; but the guess would be more inclined to lean towards a figure somewhere between these totals . The idea has also been put forward that none of these arms are genuine , but were just a big joke on the part of some individual . Let us all hope that this is not the case , but this is another aspect that would have to be left up to the collector to decide for himself .... These arms , the most highly prized and difficult of all the Martial Sharps to secure , are virtually unobtainable on the present day market . Should the reader ever be fortunate to encounter a genuine specimen for sale he will find that it will command an extremely high price . \" - Hopkins \" Cavalry ' Raiding Equipment ' : The ' Coffee Mill ' Sharps Carbine Question . Most students of the American Civil War are familiar with the ' Coffee Mill ' Sharps Carbine if only from having seen illustrations of it in the ' Bannerman ' Catalogs . However , little was known about its origins and exact purpose . It was quite by chance that I came across several documents about this weapon . All of them are quoted below and are self - explanatory , except for the brief description included by Fellow Harold L. Peterson in his The Treasury of the Gun ( page 175 ) . 38 . A Board of Officers , to consist Brig. Genl. D.H. Rucker , Quartermasters Department , Lieut . Col. G. Bell , Subsistence Department , Maj. W.R. Price , Asst. Inspector Genl. Cav. Bureau . will assemble in this city , on the 6th day of January , 1865 , or as soon thereafter as practicable , to examine and report upon the merits of the Cavalry Raiding Equipments , invented by Lieut . Colonel Walter King , 4th Missouri Cavalry .... ' By Order of the Secretary of War , ( Sgt . ) E.D. Townsend , Asst. Adjt . Genl . But as others may differ as to the utility of the invention , and all improvements should ' The Board met in accordance with above order at Washington , D.C. Jan. 6 , 1865 , all the members being present , proceeded to carefully examine the Cavalry Raiding Equipments submitted by Lt. Col. Walter King , 4th Cavalry Missouri State Militia . The main features of the Equipment consist of a small mill , ingeniously arranged in the stock of a Carbine , with which corn or wheat is ground into meal suitable for cooking purposes . Of a leather case , about seven inches square , containing cooking utensils , and a canteen , slung over the shoulder , and coming under the left arm , and of four bags on the saddle , capable of containing rations of sugar , coffee and salt for sixty days . While the Board highly commend the ingenuity of the inventor and think the Equipment might be desirable in the hands of scouts or small parties on the frontier service they submit the following reasons why , in their opinion they could not be made of great practical utility to the Government , or adopted for the entire Cavalry Service . 1st . It has been the desire and aim of all Cavalry Officers to greatly reduce the present weight of Equipments . In all the large movements of the Cavalry in the armies of the Potomac Shenandoah and Division of the Mississippi the first consideration has always been , how to carry the largest amount of ammunition and forage the subsistence for the men being the least important . The ' Raiding Equipment ' assumes to find wheat or corn in the country and to grind it with the mill in the carbine . In this country wherever there is wheat there are generally grist mills . Further , the mill of Col. King , would , in the opinion of the board , be of little or no use in grinding grain which was not very dry and hard , and therefore would be of no service in converting into meal or flour any grain which might be found standing in the field or which had been lately gathered . This equipment leaves no adequate space for carrying forage , the room on the pommel and cantel of the saddle being occupied with rations of the men , 20 lbs . or forage is , and always should be carried on the saddle . The cooking utensils are also large and cumbersome and in the way of carrying a sufficient amount of ammunition . 2nd The mill which is the essential part of this equipment can not be applied to Spencers Repeating Carbine , ( which is now largely , and will eventually in the judgement of the board be universally used by all good Cavalry in the service ) as the cartridge magazine occupies all the space of the stock . 3rd In the opinion of the board , it is also thought that the accumulation of rust on the machinery and the action of the weather on the stock of the gun would render the mill inoperative , probably just at a time when it could be made of service . ' 1 . The well - known firearms expert , Arnold M. Chernoff , states in an article in the February 1975 issue of Gun Report that he knows of only eight of these carbines in existence today . ( In this same article , Mr. Chernoff states that Mr. Andrew Lustyik , a well - known Civil War carbine expert , has experimented in grinding various sizes of coffee beans in the carbine grinder and that the grinder proved unsuited for that purpose . ) .... 2 . It is appropriate here , to include a short biography of the inventor , Col. Walter King . During the Mexican War he served as a private in the 1st Regiment Missouri Mounted Volunteers from 24 June 1846 to 22 June 1847 . In the Civil War he received a Commission as Colonel of the 3rd Missouri State Militia Cavalry to date from 27 April 1862 . On 18 March 1863 he became Lieutenant Colonel in the 4th Missourthe board - for a troop or squadron , since the purpose was to field test the ' Raiding Equipment ' . This would account for their extreme rarity today . 3 . We realize that this article does not answer all questions concerning this odd weapon . However , we hope that it will lead to further , definitive research on the subject . The author would be glad to hear from any member who has additional information . ' - Roger D. Sturcke 1 .

' Gun of the Month : The Sharps ' Coffee Mill ' ( ? ) Carbine . ' 3 . National Archives : R.G. 94 Military Service Record of Col. Walter King . \" - Journal of CMA , Winter , 1979 . 1241 - \" How many of the Sharps Carbines , complete with buttstock milling devices , were actually made up ? My own educated guess would be around one dozen which would coincide with the mention made by Frank M. Sellers . I would think that carbines with this device installed were probably nut used to any extent , were possibly retained by Lt. Col . King , if he paid for them or , stored in arsenals ( s ) until sold by the U.S. Government . Considered rather novel down through the years , they were apparently kept rather than discarded by owners , so perhaps the attrition rate was extremely low . One very serious carbine collector of the 1950 's period , and still my close personal friend , owned a Sharps New Model 1863 , Serial Number 99730 and had a list ( his carbine included ) of eight ( 8 ) Sharps Carbines with ' milling device ' installed , along with the models and serial numbers , which he knew of and felt were genuine . Having disposed of his entire collection around 1960 , the apparently was lost . I have a lost of most of those serial numbers , but will not list all of them here inasmuch as I personally examined only several of the carbines .... And whoever ( Bannerman ? ) originally came up with the bright idea that the mill was a ' coffee grinder , ' without knowing the actual facts ? I have maintained for the past fifty ( 50 ) years that a mill capable of suitably grinding coffee beans could n't be easily incorporated into a Sharps , or other carbine buttstock . The stock dimensions just would not accept either the width or diameter of a suitable mill . And if the width ( diameter ) were scaled down , then it would have to be deeper and of course this is not physically possible . The grinding or milling grooves would be smaller and the depth of such a mill could not be incorporated into a buttstock and remain flush with the stock thickness and contours . Although Walter King never reaped a profit his carbine buttstock , wheat and corn milling device , present -day dealers and collectors who , on rare occasions , put one of these carbines on the market , usually make a handsome profit . \" - Lustytik \" Name : Walter King Regiment Name : 4 Missouri Side : Union Company : F&S Soldier 's Rank In : Lt.

In lieu of the address , pasted on the face of the envelope was a ' Believe It or Not ' cartoon sketch of the novel rifle . The only indication as to where the letter was to go was in a subtitle that indicated that one of the coffee grinder guns was at the Armory museum . It was delivered with apparently no trouble by the Post Office . Receipt of the letter sent officials at the plant to Museum Historian Christopher Dvarecka who came up with some facts about probably the most unique gun in our history . According to Dvarecka , during the Civil War era , the soldier was issued coffee beans as regular ration . Because the bean is useless unless pulverized , the soldiers adopted the habit of using the butt end of their rifles to make the bean into powder . This procedure have have led to quick and tasty coffee , but unfortunately it no only jarred the precision mechanism of the arm out of line but also cut down on the life expectancy of the weapon not to mention a careless soldier . The Army sought a way out and the Sharps Model 1860 rifle was made as the answer . Only 50 of these priceless weapons were made for trial purposes . The stock of the gun had a little hole large enough to admit the bean and a little crank which the foot soldier was to crank as the first step in satisfying his hunger . For some reason no more than 50 prototype guns were made and possession of one of them now represents considerable value . The Omaha businessmen sent his novel communication to Springfield to determine for himself , if the cartoon had its facts correct . \" Notes : During the cleaning of this arm by the National Park Service coffee grounds were actually found in the grinder . While we would like to think these coffee grounds were from a civil war soldier , the fact is the coffee grinder was once demonstrated by the former director of the Springfield Armory Museum , Mr. Robert Murphy . Evidently Mr. Murphy did not remove all the coffee grounds from the grinder after the demonstration . Mr. Murphy is pictured demonstrating the grinder in William B. Edwards ' CIVIL WAR GUNS on page 300 . \" ... This weapon ( without the crank ) was one of the most desirable arms issued during the Civil War . easily get off 10 rounds in a minute . ( 2 . ) If you guessed that the crank plays a role in increasing the soldier 's rate of fire you would be wrong . When the crank and its internal mechanism is removed from the butt stock , it becomes immediately apparent that this attachment is a grinding device of some sort . It has an input port in the upper end of the plate on the lower edge of the butt stock . The plate opposite the crank has an output slot . The question is , just what is suppose to come out of that slot ? In his privately published volume entitled FULLER GUN NOTES , the title of Mr. Fuller 's entry for this gun read : ' Sharps Breech - Loading Carbine . New Model 1863 with Coffee Mill . ' ( 3 . ) Early on , however , I read accounts which cast doubt on its function as a coffee grinder . ( 4 . ) CHCH park historian Jim Ogden ground a few coffee beans in the gun ( just prior to shipping it off for treatment ) . He reported disappointing results , stating that it would take an excessive number of beans to make a decent cup of coffee using the built - in grinder . Other authors reported similar disappointing results , ( 5,6 ) and one logically speculated that '... coffee was more of luxury ( for Civil War era soldiers ) , it is more likely that the ' coffee mill ' was originally a grain mill , ' presumably for converting foraged grains into meal or flour . ( 7 . ) In looking further into the matter it soon became clear that the Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Co. was not responsible for this adaptation . ( 8 . ) The question as to who was responsible seemed to have several answers . Here is a sampling : ' During the Civil War a workmen employed at the St. Louis Arsenal devised a plan to incorporate a coffee mill on the butt stock of the gun . ' ( 9,10 ) ' The coffee mill part was added ... by James McMurphy of Camden , New Jersey on contract for the Ordnance Department . ( 11 . ) ' The Coffee Mill attachment , located in the stock where the patch box is usually placed , was added to a few of these carbines by a contractor in S ( sic ) Saint Louis , Mo . The idea being to issue one to a company . ' ( 12 . ) ' The theory was that the mill would be useful for grinding corn and other grain ... as well as the issue coffee . ' ( 13 . ) While there may be elements of truth in all of these assertions - the only solid answer came to my attention just before this article was due . Mr. Howard Madaus , curator of the Cody Firearms Museum , thought I would find an authoritative article in the quarterly journal published by the Company of Military Historians . He was quite right . In a brief article on the origin and purpose of the Sharps mill gun , it author quotes directly from the January 6 , 1865 , report of an inspection board charged with inspecting and reporting about this modification ( and other improvements ) to the Adjutant General of the Army , Lorenzo Thomas . The board included an Assistant Inspector General for the Cavalry Bureau , a senior officer from the Subsistence Department , and its presiding officer was a general officer from the Quartermaster Department . ( 14 . ) The inventor was Lt. Col. Walter King who was ' detached service ' from the 4th Missouri State Militia Cavalry for all of 1864 and 1865 until he was mustered out on AprThe board 's report was not encouraging . They felt that if there were grain available to be foraged , there would also be mills nearby for its processing . They expressed doubt that grain found in the field would be dry enough to be successfully ground into meal or flour . They also objected to adding more weight to the cavalryman 's equipage when recent experience had shown that their first priority should be to see that the soldier is able to carry as much ammunition as possible . They also pointed out that the mill could not be universally installed , and in particular would not work on the more recently adopted Spencer repeating carbine - because its seven-round magazine runs right down the middle of its butt stock . Allowing that others might disagree with their findings , the board recommended that Lt. Col . King be permitted to conduct a ' fair trial in the field , ' and ( at his own expense ) be allowed to outfit a squadron of up to 100 men with the permission of the unit 's commanding officer . ( 15 . ) At present it is not known if the field trial ever took place . In fact , much more research is needed to determine with documented certainty even the basic facts about this gun . Did Lt. Col . King intend for every mounted soldier to be issued his own ' raiding equipments , ' or would they be spread out among the troops ? How many Sharps were actually adapted to include a mill , and from what arsenal were they issued ? Did Col . King have to purchase them himself or were they on loan and subsequently returned to the issuing armory ? Who actually installed the mills and where ? How were the guns finally disposed of ? Did Congressman King use influence to get his son a hearing for his inventions and permission to conduct a field trial ? The ' Coffee Mill ' Sharps carbine is one of the rarest guns collected . I know of four . It is often said that eight genuine examples exist . Others have estimated their being between 50 and 100 . Much remains a mystery , and research will continue in order to ' tie up ' the loose ends and one day to publish a more expanded article on this most peculiar firearm . Notes : 1 .

During the Civil War a workman empl \" While this device has been incorporated with several models ( 1859 , 1863 ) , it is more commonly known by collectors as The Coffee Mill Sharps . During the Civil War it was customary to issue whole coffee beans to the troops in the field ; the grinding or pulverizing of these beans was then left up to the individual . The beans were usually crushed between rocks or smashed against a rock by blows from the buttstock of the arm carried . It would not have been practical to issue a coffee- mill to the now over- loaded soldier . One solution to this problem was brought forward by a highly imaginative employee at the government arsenal at Saint Louis , Missouri . His suggestion was to incorporate a coffee mill with an article a soldier always has with him - his rifle , of course . Made up towards the end of the Civil War in 1865 , they were originally intended to be issued on the basis of one to a company , with the cavalry being the first branch of the army to test them . This somewhat impractical device did not prove to be of significant value and was promptly discontinued . Examination of the milling device , with the inclusion of the handle and cover plates definitely prove these parts to have been made out of cast iron . In an earlier publication , it appeared to the author that the mill was incapable of grinding coffee , as the lead - in grooves of the burr mill are not large enough to accept a whole coffee bean . The actual grinding of full size beans has been accomplished by one of the illustrated specimens . While this is a most slow and arduous process , the weapon may still hold title to being called a Coffee Mill .... Inasmuch as quantity of manufacture go , there have been five different reports made ranging upwards from six to a total of fifty . Which amount is the most probably correct is a rather doubtful guess at the very best ; but the guess would be more inclined to lean towards a figure somewhere between these totals . The idea has also been put forward that none of these arms are genuine , but were just a big joke on the part of some individual . Let us all hope that this is not the case , but this is another aspect that would have to be left up to the collector to decide for himself .... These arms , the most highly prized and difficult of all the Martial Sharps to secure , are virtually unobtainable on the present day market . Should the reader ever be fortunate to encounter a genuine specimen for sale he will find that it will command an extremely high price . \" - Hopkins \" Cavalry ' Raiding Equipment ' : The ' Coffee Mill ' Sharps Carbine Question . Most students of the American Civil War are familiar with the ' Coffee Mill ' Sharps Carbine if only from having seen illustrations of it in the ' Bannerman ' Catalogs . However , little was known about its origins and exact purpose . It was quite by chance that I came across several documents about this weapon . All of them are quoted below and are self - explanatory , except for the brief description included by Fellow Harold L. Peterson in his The Treasury of the Gun ( page 175 ) . 38 . A Board of Officers , to consist Brig. Genl. D.H. Rucker , Quartermasters Department , Lieut . Col. G. Bell , Subsistence Department , Maj. W.R. Price , Asst. Inspector Genl. Cav. Bureau . will assemble in this city , on the 6th day of January , 1865 , or as soon thereafter as practicable , to examine and report upon the merits of the Cavalry Raiding Equipments , invented by Lieut . Colonel Walter King , 4th Missouri Cavalry .... ' By Order of the Secretary of War , ( Sgt . ) E.D. Townsend , Asst. Adjt . Genl . But as others may differ as to the utility of the invention , and all improvements should ' The Board met in accordance with above order at Washington , D.C. Jan. 6 , 1865 , all the members being present , proceeded to carefully examine the Cavalry Raiding Equipments submitted by Lt. Col. Walter King , 4th Cavalry Missouri State Militia . The main features of the Equipment consist of a small mill , ingeniously arranged in the stock of a Carbine , with which corn or wheat is ground into meal suitable for cooking purposes . Of a leather case , about seven inches square , containing cooking utensils , and a canteen , slung over the shoulder , and coming under the left arm , and of four bags on the saddle , capable of containing rations of sugar , coffee and salt for sixty days . While the Board highly commend the ingenuity of the inventor and think the Equipment might be desirable in the hands of scouts or small parties on the frontier service they submit the following reasons why , in their opinion they could not be made of great practical utility to the Government , or adopted for the entire Cavalry Service . 1st . It has been the desire and aim of all Cavalry Officers to greatly reduce the present weight of Equipments . In all the large movements of the Cavalry in the armies of the Potomac Shenandoah and Division of the Mississippi the first consideration has always been , how to carry the largest amount of ammunition and forage the subsistence for the men being the least important . The ' Raiding Equipment ' assumes to find wheat or corn in the country and to grind it with the mill in the carbine . In this country wherever there is wheat there are generally grist mills . Further , the mill of Col. King , would , in the opinion of the board , be of little or no use in grinding grain which was not very dry and hard , and therefore would be of no service in converting into meal or flour any grain which might be found standing in the field or which had been lately gathered . This equipment leaves no adequate space for carrying forage , the room on the pommel and cantel of the saddle being occupied with rations of the men , 20 lbs . or forage is , and always should be carried on the saddle . The cooking utensils are also large and cumbersome and in the way of carrying a sufficient amount of ammunition . 2nd The mill which is the essential part of this equipment can not be applied to Spencers Repeating Carbine , ( which is now largely , and will eventually in the judgement of the board be universally used by all good Cavalry in the service ) as the cartridge magazine occupies all the space of the stock . 3rd In the opinion of the board , it is also thought that the accumulation of rust on the machinery and the action of the weather on the stock of the gun would render the mill inoperative , probably just at a time when it could be made of service . ' 1 . The well - known firearms expert , Arnold M. Chernoff , states in an article in the February 1975 issue of Gun Report that he knows of only eight of these carbines in existence today . ( In this same article , Mr. Chernoff states that Mr. Andrew Lustyik , a well - known Civil War carbine expert , has experimented in grinding various sizes of coffee beans in the carbine grinder and that the grinder proved unsuited for that purpose . ) .... 2 . It is appropriate here , to include a short biography of the inventor , Col. Walter King . During the Mexican War he served as a private in the 1st Regiment Missouri Mounted Volunteers from 24 June 1846 to 22 June 1847 . In the Civil War he received a Commission as Colonel of the 3rd Missouri State Militia Cavalry to date from 27 April 1862 . On 18 March 1863 he became Lieutenant Colonel in the 4th Missourthe board - for a troop or squadron , since the purpose was to field test the ' Raiding Equipment ' . This would account for their extreme rarity today . 3 . We realize that this article does not answer all questions concerning this odd weapon . However , we hope that it will lead to further , definitive research on the subject . The author would be glad to hear from any member who has additional information . ' - Roger D. Sturcke 1 .

' Gun of the Month : The Sharps ' Coffee Mill ' ( ? ) Carbine . ' 3 . National Archives : R.G. 94 Military Service Record of Col. Walter King . \" - Journal of CMA , Winter , 1979 . 1241 - \" How many of the Sharps Carbines , complete with buttstock milling devices , were actually made up ? My own educated guess would be around one dozen which would coincide with the mention made by Frank M. Sellers . I would think that carbines with this device installed were probably nut used to any extent , were possibly retained by Lt. Col . King , if he paid for them or , stored in arsenals ( s ) until sold by the U.S. Government . Considered rather novel down through the years , they were apparently kept rather than discarded by owners , so perhaps the attrition rate was extremely low . One very serious carbine collector of the 1950 's period , and still my close personal friend , owned a Sharps New Model 1863 , Serial Number 99730 and had a list ( his carbine included ) of eight ( 8 ) Sharps Carbines with ' milling device ' installed , along with the models and serial numbers , which he knew of and felt were genuine . Having disposed of his entire collection around 1960 , the apparently was lost . I have a lost of most of those serial numbers , but will not list all of them here inasmuch as I personally examined only several of the carbines .... And whoever ( Bannerman ? ) originally came up with the bright idea that the mill was a ' coffee grinder , ' without knowing the actual facts ? I have maintained for the past fifty ( 50 ) years that a mill capable of suitably grinding coffee beans could n't be easily incorporated into a Sharps , or other carbine buttstock . The stock dimensions just would not accept either the width or diameter of a suitable mill . And if the width ( diameter ) were scaled down , then it would have to be deeper and of course this is not physically possible . The grinding or milling grooves would be smaller and the depth of such a mill could not be incorporated into a buttstock and remain flush with the stock thickness and contours . Although Walter King never reaped a profit his carbine buttstock , wheat and corn milling device , present -day dealers and collectors who , on rare occasions , put one of these carbines on the market , usually make a handsome profit . \" - Lustytik \" Name : Walter King Regiment Name : 4 Missouri Side : Union Company : F&S Soldier 's Rank In : Lt.

Pink eye , also known as conjunctivitis , involves inflammation of the conjunctiva , the thin , clear tissue that lines the inside of the eyelid and covers the white part of the eye , or sclera . The inflammation makes blood vessels more visible , giving the eye a pink or reddish appearance . The affected eye (s ) may be painful , itchy or have a burning sensation .

Other signs or symptoms that may accompany pink eye include : - Swelling of the conjunctiva - Feeling like a foreign body is in the eye ( s ) - Sensitivity to bright light - Enlargement and / or tenderness of the lymph node in front of the ear . This enlargement may feel like a small lump when touched . ( Lymph nodes act as filters in the body , collecting and destroying viruses and bacteria . ) - Contact lenses that do not stay in place on the eye and / or feel uncomfortable due to bumps that may form under the eyelid What causes pink eye ? Pink eye is most often caused by bacterial or viral infections . Allergic reactions or exposure to irritants can also cause pink eye . Pinpointing the cause may be difficult because the signs and symptoms tend to be similar regardless of the underlying cause . Viral conjunctivitis is caused by a wide variety of viruses , but adenovirus and herpesvirus are the most common viruses that cause pink eye . Viral conjunctivitis may also occur along with an upper respiratory tract infection , cold , or sore throat . Bacterial conjunctivitis is caused by infection of the eye with bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus pneumonia , or Haemophilus . It is a common reason for children to stay home sick from day care or school . Allergic conjunctivitis can be caused by allergies to pollen , dust mites , molds , or animal dander . Irritants such as contact lenses and lens solutions , chlorine in a swimming pool , smog or cosmetics may also be an underlying cause of conjunctivitis . How is pink eye diagnosed ? Conjunctivitis can be diagnosed with an eye examination by a healthcare provider . In some cases , the type of conjunctivitis can be determined by assessing the person 's signs , symptoms , and recent health history ( such as whether the person has recently been exposed to someone with conjunctivitis or has a pattern of seasonal allergy ) . Most cases resolve with time , and there is usually no need for treatment or laboratory tests , unless the person 's history suggests bacterial conjunctivitis . Viral Conjunctivitis Viral conjunctivitis is often diagnosed based on a person 's history and symptoms . It tends to occur in both eyes and often accompanies a common cold or respiratory tract infection . Laboratory tests usually are not needed to diagnose viral conjunctivitis ; however , testing may be done if a more severe form of viral conjunctivitis is suspected . More severe causes include herpes simplex virus ( which usually involves blisters on the skin ) , varicella - zoster virus ( chickenpox and shingles ) , rubella or rubeola ( measles ) . This testing is performed using a sample of the discharge from an infected eye . Bacterial Conjunctivitis Bacterial conjunctivitis tends to occur in one eye and may accompany an ear infection . A sample of the discharge from the affected eye may be obtained for laboratory tests to determine which type of bacteria is causing the pink eye and how best to treat it . Allergic Conjunctivitis Allergic conjunctivitis tends to occur in both eyes and often accompanies allergy symptoms , such as an itchy nose , sneezing , and scratchy throat . Allergic conjunctivitis may occur seasonally when pollen counts are high , and it can cause the person 's eyes to itch intensely . A detailed health history may help determine the source of the allergic reaction . How is pink eye treated ? Most cases of pink eye are mild and will resolve on their own without prescription treatment . In many cases , symptom relief can be achieved by using artificial tears for the dryness and cold packs for the inflammation . ( Artificial tears can be purchased without a doctor 's prescription . ) However , you should seek medical attention if you have any of following symptoms : - Moderate to severe pain in the eye ( s ) - Vision problems , such as sensitivity to light or blurred vision , that do not improve when any discharge present is wiped from the eye (s ) - Intense redness in the eye ( s ) - Symptoms that become worse or persist when severe viral conjunctivitis is suspected Also seek medical attention if you have signs of conjunctivitis and you have a weakened immune system from HIV infection , cancer treatment , or other medical conditions or treatments . Viral Conjunctivitis Most cases of viral conjunctivitis are mild and will clear up in 7\u201314 days without treatment and without any long - term consequences . In some cases , however , viral conjunctivitis can take two or more weeks to resolve , especially if complications arise . Antiviral medication can be prescribed by a physician to treat more serious forms of conjunctivitis , such as those caused by herpes simplex virus or varicella- zoster virus . Antibiotics will not improve viral conjunctivitis as these drugs are not effective against viruses . Bacterial Conjunctivitis Mild bacterial conjunctivitis may get better without antibiotic treatment and without causing any severe complications . Antibiotics can help shorten the illness and reduce the spread of infection to others . Your healthcare provider may prescribe antibiotic eye drops or ointment , which should resolve the infection within several days . Consult your healthcare provider if you have been given antibiotics for bacterial conjunctivitis and symptoms have not improved after 24 hours of treatment . Allergic Conjunctivitis Conjunctivitis caused by an allergy usually improves by eliminating or significantly reducing contact with the allergen ( such as pollen or animal dander ) . Allergy medications and certain eye drops can also provide relief . Conjunctivitis caused by an irritant often clears up by eliminating the irritant . If you develop conjunctivitis and you wear contacts , stop using them temporarily until the conjunctivitis resolves . In some cases , your healthcare provider may also prescribe drug treatments to improve symptoms . What steps can I take to prevent pink eye ? Viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are highly contagious and can be easily spread from person to person . Allergic conjunctivitis is not contagious . If you or someone around you has infectious ( viral or bacterial ) conjunctivitis , limit its spread by following these steps : - Wash your hands often with soap and warm water . And wash up immediately if you 've touched an affected person 's eyes , linens or clothes ( for example , when caring for a child who has pink eye ) . If soap and water are not available , use an alcohol - based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol . - Avoid touching or rubbing your eyes . - If you have conjunctivitis , wash any discharge from around the eyes several times a day . - Do not use the same eye drop dispenser / bottle for infected and non-infected eyes \u2014 even for the same person . - Avoid sharing articles like towels , blankets , and pillowcases . - Clean your eyeglasses . - Clean , store , and replace your contact lenses as instructed by your eye health professional . - Do not share eye makeup , face makeup , makeup brushes , contact lenses or containers , or eyeglasses . There are also steps you can take to avoid re-infection once the infection goes away : - Throw away any eye or face makeup or applicators you used while infected . - Throw away contact lens solutions you used while infected . - Throw away contact lenses and cases you used . - Clean your eyeglasses and cases . Can newborns get pink eye ? Newborns can develop pink eye , which is called neonatal conjunctivitis , or less commonly , ophthalmia neonatorum . Common symptoms include eye discharge and puffy , red eyelids within one day to two weeks after birth . Newborn conjunctivitis may be caused by infection , irritation , or a blocked tear duct . A mother can pass on infectious conjunctivitis to her newborn during childbirth , even she has no symptoms herself , because she may carry bacteria or viruses in the birth canal . When caused by an infection , neonatal conjunctivitis can be very serious . The most common types of neonatal conjunctivitis include : - Chlamydial ( or inclusion ) conjunctivitis is caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis and can cause swelling of the eyelids with purulent ( pus ) discharge . Symptoms often appear 5 - 12 days after birth but may present at any time during the first month of life . - Gonococcal conjunctivitis is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae , the bacterium that causes gonorrhea . Gonococcal conjunctivitis causes pus discharge and swelling of eyelids , which may appear 2 - 4 days after birth . - Chemical conjunctivitis can be caused by eye drops or ointment given to newborns to help prevent bacterial eye infections . Symptoms include red eyes and eyelid swelling , and usually resolve in 24 - 36 hours . Most hospitals are required by state law to put drops or ointment in a newborn 's eyes to prevent disease . The benefits of preventing a more serious type of conjunctivitis are thought to outweigh the risks of chemical conjunctivitis . - Other bacteria and viruses can also cause conjunctivitis in a newborn . Bacteria that normally live in a woman 's vagina and that are not sexually transmitted can cause neonatal conjunctivitis . The viruses that cause genital and oral herpes can also cause neonatal conjunctivitis and severe eye damage . Such viruses may be passed to the baby during childbirth . How is pink eye treated in newborns ? Bacterial conjunctivitis may be treated with topical antibiotic eye drops and ointments , oral antibiotics , or intravenous ( given through a vein ) antibiotics . A combination of topical and oral , or topical and intravenous treatments are sometimes used at the same time . A saline solution may be prescribed for rinsing the baby 's eye (s ) to remove pus , if necessary . - Chlamydial conjunctivitis in newborns is usually treated with oral antibiotics such as erythromycin . Parents are usually treated as well . - Gonococcal conjunctivitis in newborns is usually treated with intravenous antibiotics . If untreated , this condition can lead to corneal ulcers and blindness . - Other types of bacterial and viral conjunctivitis are usually treated with antibiotic eye drops or ointments . A warm compress to the eye may also help relieve swelling and irritation . - Blocked tear ducts may cause conjunctivitis . If a tear duct is blocked , a gentle warm massage between the eye and nasal area may help . If the blocked tear duct is not cleared by one year of age , surgery may be required . - Chemical Conjunctivitis usually resolves in 24 - 36 hours without treatment . Research NIH supports a spectrum of research on eye diseases , including studies aimed at developing new treatments for conjunctivitis , as well as basic science studies to better understand the biological factors that contribute to conjunctivitis . For example , researchers are looking at a layer of diverse microscopic life forms ( known as the microbiome ) that live on the surface of the eye to see if it plays a role in conjunctivitis and other eye disorders . Other studies are looking at how certain cell types involved in the immune response might contribute to allergic conjunctivitis . One study is exploring the unusual properties of the bacterium that cause pneumonia , S. pneumoniae . Although there are effective vaccines for pneumonia , these vaccines do n't prevent the bacterium from causing conjunctivitis . By identifying how the bacterium infects the eye and triggers inflammation in the eye researchers hope to make the existing vaccine effective for preventing eye infections .

Bell ringing is an ancient Vedic ritual and one can see multiple bells hanging over the domes in many Indian shrines . It is said that the devotees knock God 's entrance to ask permission upon entering his holy sanctum . What is a bell ? Ghanta is the Sanskrit word for bell . Bell is a musical instrument made up of bronze or brass . It has a hollow interior and has a tang in it which creates sound . A temple bell or ghantais symbolic of antarala , the gap between sky and earth . Kansyaghanta , tala , ghatika , jayaghantika , kshudraghanta and krama are the types of bell mentioned in the Sanskrit literature . Bells are mainly classified into two broad categories ; one which can be hung on the hook . This type of bellcan be seen in the temples . The otherone is a small hand bell which can be rung by holding in the palm . This type of bell is normally used in the home sanctum . Religious Importance The bell is the spiritual abode of all Gods and Goddesses and it also acts as an instrument of many deities . \u201c Sarvavadyamayighantasarvadevamayiyatahtasmatsarvaprayatnenaghantanadamtukarayet \u201d ( Bell is said to be the embodiment of all Gods and musical instruments , hence it should be sounded . ) The bell which has a handle in the shape of Vajra is known as Vajraghanta . In Buddhist monastery , the bell which has a Stupa shaped handle is used for prayers . Interestingly , the bell with a sign of an eagle removes sorrows arising from snakes , fire and lightning . It is believed that this bell is much dearer to Lord Vishnu . Ghanta is sounded before the actual puja and worship begins . A well - designed Ghanta or bell produce long strains of the sound OM or Aum . A bell is rung in a Hindu temple , during the waving of light in front of the deity , while bathing the deity and while offering food . Hindu devotees on entering the temple also hit the ghanta hanged in front of the sanctum sanctorum . A Temple bell is another scientific phenomena ; it is not just your ordinary metal . It is made of various metals including cadmium , lead , copper , zinc , nickel , chromium and manganese . The proportion at which each one of them mixed is real science behind a bell . Each of these bells is made to produce such a distinct sound that it can create unity of your left and right brain . The moment you ring that bell , bell produces sharp but lasting sound which lasts for minimum of seven seconds in echo mode good enough to touch your seven healing centers or chakras in your body . There is an art and science of making bells to produce the requisite sounds . There are bells specially made to produce the long strains of the sound OM . The handle of a ghantadi signifies pr\u00e3na \u2013 the vital force in the form of Hanumanji , Garud , Nandi or Chakra . During Garud sth\u00e3panvidhi , the handle is offered pujan . A bell without a handle in one of these forms is forbidden in rituals , since it may augur misfortune . The body of the bell is said to represent the divinity of time ( \u00c3gama - Kosha 1992 VI:99 ) . The moment bell sound happens your brain is emptied of all thoughts . Invariably you will enter state of Trance state where you are very receptive . This trance state is the one with awareness . You are so occupied in mind that only way to awaken you is with a Shock ! And trust me Bell works as antidote to your mind . Before you enter temple \u2013 to awake you and prepare you for taste of awareness is the real reason behind temple bell . In other words \u201c it helps to ring to wake yourself up ! \u201d . To an extent fragrant generators , low light lamps etc form ecosystem to create awareness . So one of the purpose of ringing temple bell is to disconnect you from the worldly thoughts so that you are ready from within to invoke the divinity inside you . Ideally while ringing the bell you should remember the deity intensely . so that the vacuum ( no -mind state ) created by bell is filled with the thoughts of the deity . That is why most hindus chant the name of god ( like jai sri ram or har har mahadev ) while ringing the bell . The purpose is to bring your attention towards the god . The most widespread belief is that the ghanta is sounded to invite the deity to accept the worship and prayers . Another belief is that it is to drive away the evil forces . The sound made from a well - designed Ghanta is uninterrupted , reverberating , deep and sonorous . Symbolically , the body of the bell represents time \u2013 Ananta . The tongue of the bell symbolically represents Goddess Saraswathi . The handle of the Ghanta is considered to be the vital principle ( Prana Shakti ) and symbolically represents Hanuman , Garuda , Nandi or Chakra . Even while doing the ritualistic aarati , we ring the bell . It is sometimes accompanied by the auspicious sounds of the conch and other musical instruments . An added significance of ringing the bell , conch and other instruments is that they help drown any inauspicious or irrelevant noises and comments that might disturb or distract the worshippers in their devotional ardour , concentration and inner peace . As we start the daily ritualistic worship ( pooja ) we ring the bell , chanting the following verse from Aagma Shastra : \u201c Aagamaarthamtu devaanaam gamanaarthamtu rakshasaam Kurve ghantaaravam tatra devataahvaahna lakshana m \u201d Translation : I ring this bell indicating the invocation of divinity , So that virtuous and noble forces enter ( my home and heart ) ; and the demonic and evil forces from within and without , depart . According to the Skandpuran , the ringing of temple bells absolves man from sins committed over hundred births . Let us now see how the energy is emitted from the bell and what exactly happens with the help of a subtle drawing . The dome shaped body of the bell and the clapper when strike with each other create circles of chaitanya which are projected in the atmosphere . The sound generated simultaneously also emits frequencies of chaitanya predominant in Akash tattva ( absolute ether element ) . The stroke of clapper emits divine energy rays . The divine energy and chaitanya generated by the sound of bell drives away the negative energies . The number of times the bell should be sounded depends on the number of letters in the mantra ; accordingly the bell should be sounded 8,16 , 24 , or 32 times . In \u0100gama Shastra it is mentioned that bell should be made of pancha lauha \u2013 five metals , namely , copper , silver , gold , brass and iron . These 5 metals represent the pancha bhoota . Associated Legends of Bells in Temples 1 . Lord Krishna saved the inhabitants of Gokul from the anger of Indra , during the time of Govardhana puja , by lifting the Govardhana Mountain . After this incident , the bell which was tied to the neck of Iravata , elephant of Indra , was gifted by Him to Krishna . The same is mentioned in the following verse , Athopavahyadaya ghantam airavatad gajat \u2013 ( Brahma P. 188.36 ab ) This is considered as the beginning of the use of a bell in deity worship . 2 . Before the battle of Mahabharata , Lord Krishna , who was supporting the Pandavas , went to meet King Jarasan for his support in the war . The King was a Brahmin and he believed that it was his duty to fulfill every wish that falls on his ears while performing rituals during sunset . So , to stop people from exploiting this rule ( niyam ) , he appointed a guard who would not allow anyone to enter his room at the time of the rituals . Lord Krishna , knowing all this , went to meet the King at the time of sunset . The guard stopped him saying that nobody ( even Krishna ) was allowed to enter the room at that hour . Krishna , attempting to persuade the guard to let him in , offered to fulfill the guard 's one wish in return of this . The guard asked Krishna , \u201c Let me be your guard then . No disciple of yours should be allowed to meet you without my consent . \u201d And the guard 's consent is believed to be signaled by the ringing of the bell . He considered being Lord Krishna 's guard a very honourable thing . Krishna granted the guard his wish and the guard allowed him to the King . Krishna put forward his wish in front of the King which he could n't refuse and thus he supported the Pandavas in the war .

Bell ringing is an ancient Vedic ritual and one can see multiple bells hanging over the domes in many Indian shrines . It is said that the devotees knock God 's entrance to ask permission upon entering his holy sanctum . What is a bell ? Ghanta is the Sanskrit word for bell . Bell is a musical instrument made up of bronze or brass . It has a hollow interior and has a tang in it which creates sound . A temple bell or ghantais symbolic of antarala , the gap between sky and earth . Kansyaghanta , tala , ghatika , jayaghantika , kshudraghanta and krama are the types of bell mentioned in the Sanskrit literature . Bells are mainly classified into two broad categories ; one which can be hung on the hook . This type of bellcan be seen in the temples . The otherone is a small hand bell which can be rung by holding in the palm . This type of bell is normally used in the home sanctum . Religious Importance The bell is the spiritual abode of all Gods and Goddesses and it also acts as an instrument of many deities . \u201c Sarvavadyamayighantasarvadevamayiyatahtasmatsarvaprayatnenaghantanadamtukarayet \u201d ( Bell is said to be the embodiment of all Gods and musical instruments , hence it should be sounded . ) The bell which has a handle in the shape of Vajra is known as Vajraghanta . In Buddhist monastery , the bell which has a Stupa shaped handle is used for prayers . Interestingly , the bell with a sign of an eagle removes sorrows arising from snakes , fire and lightning . It is believed that this bell is much dearer to Lord Vishnu . Ghanta is sounded before the actual puja and worship begins . A well - designed Ghanta or bell produce long strains of the sound OM or Aum . A bell is rung in a Hindu temple , during the waving of light in front of the deity , while bathing the deity and while offering food . Hindu devotees on entering the temple also hit the ghanta hanged in front of the sanctum sanctorum . A Temple bell is another scientific phenomena ; it is not just your ordinary metal . It is made of various metals including cadmium , lead , copper , zinc , nickel , chromium and manganese . The proportion at which each one of them mixed is real science behind a bell . Each of these bells is made to produce such a distinct sound that it can create unity of your left and right brain . The moment you ring that bell , bell produces sharp but lasting sound which lasts for minimum of seven seconds in echo mode good enough to touch your seven healing centers or chakras in your body . There is an art and science of making bells to produce the requisite sounds . There are bells specially made to produce the long strains of the sound OM . The handle of a ghantadi signifies pr\u00e3na \u2013 the vital force in the form of Hanumanji , Garud , Nandi or Chakra . During Garud sth\u00e3panvidhi , the handle is offered pujan . A bell without a handle in one of these forms is forbidden in rituals , since it may augur misfortune . The body of the bell is said to represent the divinity of time ( \u00c3gama - Kosha 1992 VI:99 ) . The moment bell sound happens your brain is emptied of all thoughts . Invariably you will enter state of Trance state where you are very receptive . This trance state is the one with awareness . You are so occupied in mind that only way to awaken you is with a Shock ! And trust me Bell works as antidote to your mind . Before you enter temple \u2013 to awake you and prepare you for taste of awareness is the real reason behind temple bell . In other words \u201c it helps to ring to wake yourself up ! \u201d . To an extent fragrant generators , low light lamps etc form ecosystem to create awareness . So one of the purpose of ringing temple bell is to disconnect you from the worldly thoughts so that you are ready from within to invoke the divinity inside you . Ideally while ringing the bell you should remember the deity intensely . so that the vacuum ( no -mind state ) created by bell is filled with the thoughts of the deity . That is why most hindus chant the name of god ( like jai sri ram or har har mahadev ) while ringing the bell . The purpose is to bring your attention towards the god . The most widespread belief is that the ghanta is sounded to invite the deity to accept the worship and prayers . Another belief is that it is to drive away the evil forces . The sound made from a well - designed Ghanta is uninterrupted , reverberating , deep and sonorous . Symbolically , the body of the bell represents time \u2013 Ananta . The tongue of the bell symbolically represents Goddess Saraswathi . The handle of the Ghanta is considered to be the vital principle ( Prana Shakti ) and symbolically represents Hanuman , Garuda , Nandi or Chakra . Even while doing the ritualistic aarati , we ring the bell . It is sometimes accompanied by the auspicious sounds of the conch and other musical instruments . An added significance of ringing the bell , conch and other instruments is that they help drown any inauspicious or irrelevant noises and comments that might disturb or distract the worshippers in their devotional ardour , concentration and inner peace . As we start the daily ritualistic worship ( pooja ) we ring the bell , chanting the following verse from Aagma Shastra : \u201c Aagamaarthamtu devaanaam gamanaarthamtu rakshasaam Kurve ghantaaravam tatra devataahvaahna lakshana m \u201d Translation : I ring this bell indicating the invocation of divinity , So that virtuous and noble forces enter ( my home and heart ) ; and the demonic and evil forces from within and without , depart . According to the Skandpuran , the ringing of temple bells absolves man from sins committed over hundred births . Let us now see how the energy is emitted from the bell and what exactly happens with the help of a subtle drawing . The dome shaped body of the bell and the clapper when strike with each other create circles of chaitanya which are projected in the atmosphere . The sound generated simultaneously also emits frequencies of chaitanya predominant in Akash tattva ( absolute ether element ) . The stroke of clapper emits divine energy rays . The divine energy and chaitanya generated by the sound of bell drives away the negative energies . The number of times the bell should be sounded depends on the number of letters in the mantra ; accordingly the bell should be sounded 8,16 , 24 , or 32 times . In \u0100gama Shastra it is mentioned that bell should be made of pancha lauha \u2013 five metals , namely , copper , silver , gold , brass and iron . These 5 metals represent the pancha bhoota . Associated Legends of Bells in Temples 1 . Lord Krishna saved the inhabitants of Gokul from the anger of Indra , during the time of Govardhana puja , by lifting the Govardhana Mountain . After this incident , the bell which was tied to the neck of Iravata , elephant of Indra , was gifted by Him to Krishna . The same is mentioned in the following verse , Athopavahyadaya ghantam airavatad gajat \u2013 ( Brahma P. 188.36 ab ) This is considered as the beginning of the use of a bell in deity worship . 2 . Before the battle of Mahabharata , Lord Krishna , who was supporting the Pandavas , went to meet King Jarasan for his support in the war . The King was a Brahmin and he believed that it was his duty to fulfill every wish that falls on his ears while performing rituals during sunset . So , to stop people from exploiting this rule ( niyam ) , he appointed a guard who would not allow anyone to enter his room at the time of the rituals . Lord Krishna , knowing all this , went to meet the King at the time of sunset . The guard stopped him saying that nobody ( even Krishna ) was allowed to enter the room at that hour . Krishna , attempting to persuade the guard to let him in , offered to fulfill the guard 's one wish in return of this . The guard asked Krishna , \u201c Let me be your guard then . No disciple of yours should be allowed to meet you without my consent . \u201d And the guard 's consent is believed to be signaled by the ringing of the bell . He considered being Lord Krishna 's guard a very honourable thing . Krishna granted the guard his wish and the guard allowed him to the King . Krishna put forward his wish in front of the King which he could n't refuse and thus he supported the Pandavas in the war . So the bell is believed to be held by the guard and that Lord will pay attention to the prayers of his disciple only after the bell has been rung . Conclusion Bells or Ghantas continue to be an important part of our temples from time immemorial . It is always interesting to know that scientific reasons exist behind such rituals which started centuries ago and continues to be performed by us .","annotations":[{"text":"the deity","span":[1869,1877],"token_span":[359,360],"role":"Patient","label":"Patient","role_definition":"The patient is the person who gets washed."},{"text":"a Hindu temple","span":[1787,1800],"token_span":[342,344],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"Where the event takes place."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-1175-503-frame-Grooming","frame":"Grooming","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"In this frame, an Agent engages in personal body care by grooming either a Patient or a Body_part.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Many swimmers also shave areas of exposed skin before end - of - season competitions to reduce friction in the water .

Most notably , Hoskins spent more time on the pitch for Bristol Rovers than any other club . His goal - scoring record for the Gas was more impressive than at any other club , too , scoring 18 goals in 45 appearances . The striker has gradually declined through the leagues since his move to Oxford United in 2014 with just 12 appearances to his name at Oxford United and Exeter City . Hoskins was noticed as a talent from an early age where he began his career at Notts County 's School of Excellence . As a youngster , Hoskins impressed with his talents and signed for Rotherham on a full - time basis at the age of 17 . He announced his arrival with a brace at Wigan Athletic in a 1 - 2 win back in 2003 . However , the striker had a stop-start early career in senior football . Under the management of Ronnie Moore and then Mick Harford , the striker started just once for Rotherham . With such an underwhelming start to his career at Rotherham , Hoskins was pleased to be under the management of ex-youth coach Alan Knill by the 2005/06 season . Knill showed faith in the youngster as many expected and rewarded Hoskins with 12 starts throughout the season . With such faith restored , Hoskins repaid his gratitude to Knill in the following season . He had his most impressive season for the Miller . Although he was never able to establish a fellow striking partner , Hoskins was able to produce a good goal return with 15 goals in 22 appearances . His performances were recognised outside of the Yorkshire club , too \u2013 being awarded Player of the Month award in October . Watford Hoskins ' performances were rewarded with a chance to join Premier League outfit Watford in the 2007 January transfer window . He took his opportunity , signing for Watford and rejecting a contract extension at Rotherham . His arrival at Watford was estimated to be approximately \u00a3 1 million with the London club clearly valuing his services . At the age of 20 , Hoskins was thought to be a hot prospect at Watford . His \u00a3 1 million price - tag in combination with his clear talent made his move to the Premier League an exciting time for the young forward . In 2007 , he made his Premier League debut against Liverpool at Vicarage Road in a 0 - 3 defeat . Despite his price - tag , Hoskins failed to make an impact at Watford . He scored just seven times in his 51 appearances for Watford once they had been relegated to the Championship in the season he joined the club . A loan spell at Millwall from September 2007 saw him score four times in 12 matches for the League One side . Injury - ridden time Hoskins was loaned out to Nottingham Forest just a year after he had joined the club for \u00a3 1 million in 2007 . His time at Forest , though , was plagued with injury . He had a frustrating time at the County Ground with a back injury . Hoskins eventually returned to Watford exactly two months after he had left Vicarage Road , playing just twice for Nottingham Forest . During his time at the Memorial Stadium , impressive goal - scoring spells were unfortunately plagued by injury . He suffered an ankle injury in early November which disrupted a good start to his career at Rovers . Similarly , Hoskins ' move to Brighton & Hove Albion in the summer of 2011 started with some early goal - scoring form . However , when loaned out to Sheffield United , Hoskins suffered a hernia problem which side - lined the striker for the near future . Hoskins ' injury track - record hit a climax in February 2013 when he suffered knee ligament damage during a draw with Blackburn Rovers . The injury ruled him out for the remainder of the 2012/13 season , much to the frustration of the striker . The injury restricted Hoskins from playing any part in the 2013/14 season . His time at Brighton came to a swift end when he made the permanent move to Oxford United in 2014 . Shorts spells at both Oxford United and Exeter City in the following two seasons resulted in just 18 appearances across a two - year spell at the respective clubs . Where is Hoskins now ? After coming onto the football scene at such a young age , it feels as if Hoskins should be much older than 31 . And , despite a torrid time with injury , he is still playing . Admittedly , playing in the National League South with Hemel Hempstead Town probably is n't where he expected to be when he made the \u00a3 1 million move to the Premier League at the age of 20 . His time in the Football League showed much promise \u2013 perhaps most notably at Bristol Rovers where he boasted his best minutes to goal ratio . However , Hoskins ' career should be a reminder that the career of a footballer can often be dependent on fortune with regard to injury .

His time in the Football League showed much promise \u2013 perhaps most notably at Bristol Rovers where he boasted his best minutes to goal ratio . However , Hoskins ' career should be a reminder that the career of a footballer can often be dependent on fortune with regard to injury . Currently playing at Hemel Hempstead Town in the National League South , let 's hope that Hoskins can enjoy the final years of his footballing career injury - free .","annotations":[{"text":"Will Hoskins","span":[30,41],"token_span":[4,5],"role":"Individual","label":"Individual","role_definition":"The person who is greeted at their arrival by the Communicator."},{"text":"a brace","span":[955,961],"token_span":[178,179],"role":"Medium","label":"Medium","role_definition":"The symbol-containing artifact whereby a Communicator heralds."},{"text":"2003","span":[1004,1007],"token_span":[191,191],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the Communicator heralds."},{"text":"Wigan Athletic","span":[966,979],"token_span":[181,182],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the place where the Communicator heralds."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-0008-2751-frame-Heralding","frame":"Heralding","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Communicator announces (linguistically or non-linguistically) the imminent arrival of an Individual or the occurrence of an Event.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"The Oregon Student Association ( OSA ) , a non-profit organization , was established in 1975 to represent , serve and protect the collective interests of students in post-secondary education in the U.S. state of Oregon .

By : Robert Seitzinger ASPSU 's controversial OSA proposal that would alter the internal structure of the student- interest lobbying group may get a closer look if the organization approves a committee to discuss its merits Friday . Rudy Soto , ASPSU president , said ASPSU will ask the Oregon Student Association at its meeting this Friday to create an eight - member committee to discuss the proposal . \" We want this committee to take a serious look at the proposal , and we do n't want members who would stall the proposal , \" Soto said , who wrote the proposal along with his senior policy adviser Ryan Klute . Soto and Klute submitted the proposal to the Oregon Student Association , a statewide student - interest lobbying organization , in January . The proposal would create a new board , called the General Assembly , which would operate alongside OSA 's current Board of Directors . Under the proposal , the General Assembly would recommend lobbying issues to the Board of Directors , have the power to set membership dues that all OSA schools pay , and elect officers to the OSA Board of Directors . The Board of Directors currently carries all of these responsibilities . Under the proposal , the power would shift to the General Assembly . Some OSA board members and students statewide have complained that the proposal would give more voting power to larger universities like PSU and less to smaller schools . The Board of Directors is made up of two members from each school , but the General Assembly would include one voting member per every 2,500 full - time students at a university . PSU , the University of Oregon and Oregon State University would have five , six , and seven votes , respectively . The six other OSA schools would have a single vote on the new assembly . OSA lobbies for student issues every other year to the Oregon legislature . It was heralded in 2007 for helping bringing hundreds of millions of dollars more in higher education funding to Oregon . Nine schools , including PSU , community colleges and rural colleges pay dues to OSA . Who would serve on the new committee ? Klute , who is also OSA board of director 's vice chair , said the recommended eight - member committee that would examine ASPSU 's proposal would include two members from the Board of Directors and two members from OSA 's two - affiliate boards , the Oregon Student Equal Rights Alliance and the Oregon Students of Color Coalition . Another requirement , Soto said , would be that the committee be comprised of at least one member from a large Oregon university , one from a regional university and one from a community college . He said this requirement would ensure a diverse look at the General Assembly proposal . Klute said no specific students have been suggested for the recommended committee , but he hopes that members would be appointed as soon as possible if OSA approves the recommendation . He said both he and Soto would like to serve on the new committee . Emily McClain , OSA board chair and UO student body president , said the committee may be approved at Friday 's meeting . If a decision is not reached , she said the issue would be revisited at a meeting in April . McClain , who has previously spoken out against the proposal , said the decision to create the General Assembly is up to the current OSA Board of Directors . The next OSA meeting will be held on the Oregon Health and Sciences University campus , located at 3181 S.W. Sam Jackson Park Road . It will take place at 4 p.m. this Friday , in the Old Library Auditorium building . What the ASPSU proposal means for OSA Klute said that the General Assembly , according to his and Soto 's proposal , would work alongside the OSA Board of Directors to determine which issues are selected for OSA research during a board member 's retreat in August . Ten issues are selected during the retreat and put on a student survey . The surveys are used to narrow the list to five issues , and three issues are then set on the OSA research agenda for the next year . The issue selection process takes place during non-legislative years -- years when Oregon Legislature does not meet -- so that OSA can research and prepare what issues to discuss with Legislature when it does meet . Under the ASPSU proposal , the General Assembly would pick 10 issues , and the OSA board would still narrow the list to five and eventually three , as it has in the past .

The wood from The Dipper was salvaged and was first used following the dismantling of The Dipper to build a small warehouse on SE 22nd and Division where Mr. T's Bakery is located and there are now new condos . A developer tore down the warehouse and sent the wood to the Rebuilding Center where Ken Forkish acquired it about 4 years ago for building booths , tables and chairs for Ken's Artisan Pizza at 304 SE 28th Avenue near Pine Street . Buildings at Jantzen Beach were razed to build a shopping center . The Pumping System from the swimming pools is used to pump drinking water to residents of Hayden Island . The C.W. Parker Carousel is reportedly in storage awaiting relocation at the Jantzen Beach Shopping Center .

Background : The Agency has hired 366 New Entry Professionals ( NEPs ) since the program began in 1999 . In 2004 a redesigned International Development Intern ( IDI ) program began and to date 49 IDIs have been hired . The retention rate for these two programs has been approximately 90 % . The original plan was to run the NEP program for a five - year period to ' fill the gap ' at the mid-level of the Foreign Service ( FS ) . The NEPs now make up 36 % of the overall FS and considering the number of Foreign Service Officers ( FSOs ) overseas ( 700 ) the NEPs make up a little less than 52 % of the FSOs assigned overseas . USAID reinstituted the IDI recruitment program in 2004 to attract entry - level junior officers into the FS . However , the restrictive requirements for eligibility under the program resulted in a limited number of qualified candidates . To address these issues , the NEP and IDI programs will be phased out to allow for the development of a new FS hiring program that attracts people with more experience than the current IDI program but does not require the experience of the NEP program . Career Candidate diversity will remain a recruitment focus . II . Description of the JO Program : A number of elements from both the NEP and IDI programs will be incorporated into the JO program with a greater emphasis on the IDI program elements . The JO program will be used to recruit all entry - level career candidates into the FS . The program will seek the best qualified junior professional candidates who are willing to make a long - term commitment to the FS and international development . Agency policy is to recruit and select the best candidates available for FS appointments , without regard to race , gender , sexual orientation , color , age , religion , ethnic origin , disability , marital status , or political affiliation . The JO program is designed to prepare Foreign Service Officers ( FSOs ) for tenure through an individually adapted training program . The total training program will be approximately three years with six to 18 months in Washington D.C. and approximately 24 months of broad - based training through rotational assignments at an overseas office . All JOs must meet USAID foreign language tenuring requirements before departing for assignment overseas . Tenure criteria includes three years as a career candidate in the FS , at least 18 months of overseas service with USAID , foreign language proficiency at an Foreign Service Institute ( FSI ) tested level of S3 / R3 ( French , Spanish , Portuguese ) or S2/ R1 in all other languages qualifying for USAID tenure , a top-secret security clearance , level one medical clearance and certification of availability for worldwide service . All FSOs must achieve tenure within five years of there entry on duty date . JOs will be considered for graduation from the program at the end of their first overseas tour of duty ( 24 months overseas ) or their three - year anniversary , which ever comes first . III . General Qualifications and Requirements The JO Program will require an advanced degree in the appropriate technical area . Relevant international professional experience is desirable . USAID plans to recruit in a wide range of professional areas , e.g. , agriculture , economics , environment , administration , contracting , financial management , health , political science , etc . JOs must be at least 18 years of age and not more than 59 years of age ( see section 812 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 , as amended ) , a U.S. citizen at time of application , available for worldwide assignment and service , medically cleared for worldwide assignment and service , and registered with the Selective Service ( for male applicants ) . In addition , all applicants selected for USAID positions are subject to drug testing . IV . The Recruitment / Selection Process : Based on assessments of present and projected personnel resources and organizational and programmatic needs , USAID plans to recruit two classes of approximately 30 JOs per year ; one class approximately in January and one in September . Classes are contingent upon availability of funds for hiring and organizational priorities . These classes consist of various occupational categories such as Agriculturalists , Environmentalists , Contract Officers , Controllers , Health , Family Planning , etc. Specific technical and administrative JO Program openings are advertised periodically . The qualified applicants are rated and ranked based on a paper review by a Technical Selection Panel ( TSP ) . The TSP conducts an on-site candidate assessment of the highest ranking applicants . The on-site assessment consists of a written exercise , group discussion exercise and an individual interview conducted by the TSP . Candidates are then rated and ranked based on established criteria . Candidates recommended for hiring will undergo additional reference checks and pre-employment processes , e.g. , medical and security clearances . In general , the Agency is seeking to hire Candidates as JOs at the FS - 06 level with a salary range from $ 35,265 to $ 51,788 without locality pay and $ 41,436 to 60,851 with locality pay . Career Candidates may be hired at the FS-05 and 04 levels on an exceptional basis determined by occupational category to address critical skill needs that may arise at any given time . USAID follows Federal Salary setting guidelines . Three factors are used to set salary : professional training , years of relevant experience and salary history . V. Training and Promotion Candidates entering the FS through the JO program are in training for approximately three - years . At the end of the three - year period , the JO will be reviewed by a graduation panel to determine whether the candidate is ready for graduation based on annual performance evaluations and the recommendations of Bureau , Office or Mission management . JO training is guided by an Individual Development ( training ) Plan ( IDP ) , which is a framework and tool to detail training needs . The knowledge , skills and abilities to be developed are in line with the Foreign Service skills matrix that applies to all FSOs at USAID . The skills matrix is the basis for annually determining whether an employee is performing at or above grade and is the basis for promotions . At the FS- 06 level , a set of related competencies have been defined as the basis for establishing the IDPs . These competencies cover a range of behavioral , occupational and professional skills deemed critical to the successful functioning of entry - level FSOs . During the training time in USAID / Washington , each JO will have a supervisor of record who is responsible for overseeing the development of the IDP , mentoring and evaluating annual performance . Each JO is also assigned a coach to help develop a training plan , learn about working in USAID , and help with the transition into the FS and the first assignment overseas . Coaches are retired FSOs that serve as a confidant and advisor supporting JOs as they navigate through the USAID culture . The IDP is based on the JO 's supervisor and coach 's assessment of the JO 's previous experience and training and its relationship to required skills and competencies . Training will be designed to provide the JO with the skills necessary for his or her first overseas assignment in the shortest possible time . To develop the necessary skills , each JO will attend formal and informal training sessions , carry out work in his / her home offices and perform on - the - job training in other Washington offices and temporary duty ( TDY ) overseas under rotational supervisors . During the three - year training period , JOs will be considered for two promotions via an administrative process linked to the JO Program . Each JO will have an initial performance review after the first 11 months and second performance review 12 months after the initial review . Administrative promotions will be recommended after each satisfactory review . Timing of the first two JO performance reviews is determined by the JO 's Entry on Duty ( EOD ) date and is therefore not consistent with the April through March FS Annual Evaluation cycle . For example , an EOD date in March 2006 would result in an initial evaluation period of March 2006 through January 2007 ( 11 months ) . The second evaluation will cover a period from February 2007 to January 2008 ( 12 months ) . For both the initial and second annual performance review , the JO 's supervisor will solicit 360 input from rotational supervisors and others , but must not include the JO 's coach as part of the Annual Evaluation Form ( AEF ) process . Using 360 input , the JO 's self assessment of performance , and his / her own independent assessment , the supervisor will prepare a written appraisal of the JO 's performance against work objectives and performance measures for the rating period . In order to be promoted administratively , JO 's must demonstrate satisfactory performance , i.e. , they must meet the standards of their class . Accomplishing work objectives and demonstrating requisite skills proficiency meets the class standards . Administrative promotion decisions will be made by a review panel . The JO Review Panel will be established by M/HR / POD at appropriate intervals for each JO class , prior to the first anniversaries of EOD . The Panel will consist of four members . Chaired by the Chief of the Personnel Operations Division ( M/HR / POD ) or designee , the Panel will also include an Assignment and Performance Counselor ( APC ) , the M/HR / POD Special Programs Team Leader and one senior FSO from outside of HR with expertise in the JO backstops under review . The JO Review Panel will determine which JOs meet or fail to meet the standards of their class . Individuals who meet ( or exceed ) the standards of the class will be recommended for administrative promotion to the next FS grade / class . Those who are determined by a JO Review Panel not to meet the class standards will not be recommended for promotion and will be issued a counseling letter from the JO Review Panel outlining corrective actions to improve their performance . This letter will not be included in the JO 's performance file . However , JOs who have been determined by the Review Panel not to be meeting the standards of their class will have their evaluation files referred to the next regularly scheduled FS Performance Boards . Those who were not recommended for promotion by the Panel may be so recommended by the Boards . JOs who appear to the Performance Board to be failing to meet the standards of their class will be referred to the Tenure Board rather than the Performance Standards Board . The Tenure Board may recommend one of two actions for pre-tenure eligible career candidates : - Return the recommendation to the Performance Board noting non-concurrence with recommendation ( the determination giving specifics regarding the Board 's decision ) . - Terminate the JO from service . Where an administrative promotion is recommended from FS- 06 to FS- 05 , upon approval by the Director of Human Resources , the effective date will be the anniversary of the JO 's EOD date . Second administrative promotions from FS- 05 to FS - 04 will , upon approval , be effective on the second anniversary of the JO 's EOD date . VI . Initial Overseas Assignment The Office of Human Resources will direct all initial assignments of JOs . JOs , Supervisors , Coaches , Bureaus and Missions will be consulted and to the extent possible their views will be taken into consideration . However , it should be noted that all FSOs are required to be worldwide available and assignments are ultimately the prerogative of Agency management . Individual progress consistent with the time frame and content of the IDP will be the basis for determining when a JO is likely to be ready for his / her initial overseas assignment . Based on projected completion of IDP competencies , HR will begin the process of identifying an overseas assignment . This process requires a review of available positions during the annual position validation process ( late summer each year ) . Several times during the year ; the Agency will conduct this consultative assignment process to make JO assignments . HR will attempt to place JOs in missions where : ( First Preference ) there will be a senior officer ( Supervisor ) in the JO 's technical area and / or ( Second Preference ) in a position where the JO can overlap with the incumbent for up to 12 months , for training purposes . However , this is not always possible . The Agency will make every effort to arrange an appropriate initial assignment , which matches the needs and abilities of the JO with those of available positions . Initial assignments of JOs will be facilitated through a number of existing placement authorities . The preference would be to have JOs placed in existing ongoing positions funded by missions and meeting the preferences above . In addition to these opportunities , JO placements will be facilitated using the Junior Officer Placement Authority ( JOPA , Section 577 ( g ) of the Foreign Operations , Export Financing , and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 2006 ) and supported ceilings . The JOPA will be most effective if the JO 's salary is paid from USAID / W Operating Expense ( OE ) funds . JOPA allows USAID to use program funds to pay overseas support costs for FSOs ranked FS - 04 and below . These funds can be used to pay indirect costs such as housing and transportation - costs routinely paid from program funds for USPSCs . Supported ceilings would provide an additional $ 150,000 in OE funds to missions accepting a JO assignment .

Last August Professor Jay 's report into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham described how vulnerable children have been repeatedly failed by a council paralysed by : - complacency - institutionalised political correctness - blatant failures of political and officer leadership With such serious documented failures , I told the House last September that it was clearly in the public interest to order a statutory inspection of Rotherham council . I appointed Louise Casey to undertake a formal best value inspection of the council . Today her inspection report has been laid before the House and published . I would like to thank Louise Casey and her inspection team for their hard work in producing this thorough report . This report presents a disturbing picture of a council failing in its duty to protect vulnerable children and young people from harm . It reveals the council 's failures - both past and present - to accept , understand and combat the crimes of child sexual exploitation . It concludes this culture of denial is intrinsic and has resulted in a lack of support for victims and insufficient action against known perpetrators . It also confirms a complete failure of political and officer leadership in Rotherham . Let me outline some of the reports conclusions : - poor governance is deeply seated throughout the council - there is a pervading culture of bullying , sexism , suppression and misplaced political correctness which has cemented the council 's failures - both members and officers lack the confidence to tackle difficult issues for fear of being seen as racist or upsetting community cohesion - the council is currently incapable of tackling its weaknesses , without a sustantial intervention - the council lacks political leadership - it is directionless and is not clear what kind of organisation it wants to be , and how it will get there - it is clear that the political leadership of the council is unable to hold officers to account , and there is an inability of all members to properly represent the interests of local people Some councillors , have not lived up to the high standards expected of those in public life or their positions of responsibility . For example the council goes to lengths to cover up and silence whistle - blowers . It has created an unhealthy climate where people fear to speak out because they have seen the consequences of doing so : - management is ineffective - there is no cohesive senior leadership team and no permanent chief executive - there is a poorly directed tier of middle managers , some of whom do not demonstrate that they have the skills , drive and ability necessary to turn the organisation around - there is a history of poor performance and a tolerance of failure in Children 's Services Strategies and action plans sit on the shelf and do n't get translated into change . In short , the report concludes : - Rotherham council has failed its citizens - is failing to comply with the statutory best value duty - it needs a fresh start As a consequence of this conclusion , and in terms of the statute , I am satisfied that the council is failing to comply with its best value duty . That is failing in its duty to deliver quality local services for all and value for money to local taxpayers . I will therefore need to consider exercising my powers of intervention to secure compliance with the duty . To that end , in line with procedures laid down in the Local Government Act 1999 , I am today ( 4 February 2015 ) writing to the council to ask them if they wish to make representations on Louise Casey 's report and on the intervention package I am proposing . My proposals are designed to give the council the new start it needs and to put an immediate end to the council 's on - going service and governance failure . To give that new start , I am seeking to make an order under the Local Government Act 2000 to move Rotherham council to holding all - out elections in 2016 and every fourth year thereafter . The 2016 elections will be an opportunity for the people of Rotherham to renew the membership of their council , and to elect those they have confidence in . In the immediate term I am minded to appoint commissioners who will provide new leadership , taking over the roles of the current wholly dysfunctional cabinet . I am proposing they will therefore initially exercise all the functions currently exercised by the cabinet \u2013 that is all the council 's executive functions . Their responsibilities will thus include children 's and young peoples ' services , and adult care services . I am also proposing that the commissioners will exercise other functions of the council where there can be no confidence in the council 's ability to act responsibly . Louise Casey 's report uncovered serious weaknesses in the council 's taxi licensing where sufficient steps to ensure only fit and proper persons are permitted to hold taxi licenses have not been , and are not being undertaken . There can be no confidence in the council 's Licensing Committee . I am thus minded that the commissioners will take control of all the council 's licensing functions . And I am proposing that the commissioners have the functions of appointing the chief executive , chief finance officer and monitoring officer , and of nominating members to other bodies . In exercising all these responsibilities , I expect the commissioners to have appropriate regard to any views the council 's members may have on those matters . It is because the council is so seriously failing the people of Rotherham , and particularly some of the most vulnerable in that borough , that I am proposing to take this wholly exceptional step of putting all these responsibilities for a time in the hands of commissioners appointed and accountable to me . My aim will be to return these responsibilities to local democratic control as rapidly as possible . From day 1 the commissioners will have the role of considering and reporting to me what functions can be rolled back to the council , but only when they are confident the functions will be exercised properly . And every quarter I am proposing that the commissioners review and report to me what functions then can be rolled back to ensure there is a phased roll back of functions over the duration of the intervention . My hope and expectation is that this roll - back can soon begin and after the 2016 elections major services will be able to be returned , with the council resuming full responsibility for its range of services within 4 years . In addition to giving the commissioners these roles of exercising the council 's functions , they will oversee and drive forward the service and governance improvements the council will be required to undertake to comply with the statutory best value duty . To fulfil these roles , I propose to place a team of 5 commissioners who will jointly or severally exercise functions . The team will comprise : - a lead commissioner to provide overall leadership and direction to the intervention - a commissioner with a \u201c managing director \u201d role to lead the oversight of overall service and governance improvement , driving performance - a children 's commissioner appointed by my right honourable Friend the Education Secretary responsible for driving improvement on children 's services - and 2 further commissioners to support the work of the Commission Finally , I also propose to end tax - payer funded reward for failure by requiring the council to stop special responsibility allowances for cabinet members without functions while commissioners are in post . The council now has 14 days to make representations to me on the report and on my proposed intervention package . I shall then carefully consider any representations made and decide how to proceed . If I decide to intervene along these lines , I will make the necessary statutory directions under the Local Government Act 1999 and appoint commissioners . I will also make the order under the 2000 Act . Any directions I make will be without prejudice to my making further directions if required . I will update the House on my conclusions in due course . Mr Speaker , it is with a real heavy heart that I am having to resort to such central intervention . The coalition government is committed to strengthening local government per se and local government accountability . But the voices of the victims have to be clearly heard . The crimes committed against children is so appalling , the council 's remedy is so utterly inadequate , that the government cannot , in good conscious , turn a blind eye . These are exceptional circumstances that justify Whitehall 's intervention so we can make the council address its failings and prevent this ever happening again . I believe the public both in Rotherham and across the country would expect nothing less . The intervention package I am proposing is broad and wide ranging . It would only be justified in the most exceptional case . Rotherham is I believe such a case , a truly rare case where the children of Rotherham have so badly been let down by those elected to serve them . Councils across England on the whole have a good record of service and are looking after their local communities . They are the heart of localism . This is something to protect and cherish . The action I am proposing today is to restore good local governance to Rotherham , where all can have confidence again in their council and they can take great pride in their borough .","annotations":[{"text":"I","span":[31,31],"token_span":[6,6],"role":"Employer","label":"Employer","role_definition":"The person (or institution) that takes on an Employee, giving them Compensation in return for the performance of an assigned Task."},{"text":"into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham","span":[120,162],"token_span":[22,27],"role":"Field","label":"Field","role_definition":"The Field that the Employee is going to work in for their Employer."},{"text":"last September","span":[422,435],"token_span":[66,67],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time when an Employer hires the Employee."},{"text":"Louise Casey","span":[547,558],"token_span":[87,88],"role":"Employee","label":"Employee","role_definition":"The person whom the Employer takes on as an Employee, obligating them to perform some Task in order to receive Compensation."},{"text":"to undertake a formal best value inspection of the council","span":[560,617],"token_span":[89,98],"role":"Task","label":"Task","role_definition":"The action that the Employee is taken on by the Employer to do."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"The Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal was unearthed during Pickles ' tenure , and in February 2015 he announced a strategy to implement commissioners at Rotherham Council in the wake of the Casey Report , which had been commissioned in 2014 to investigate child sex abuse in Rotherham .

It was , however , also a place where humanising experiments in penal reform were conducted . KAVHA is located on the southern side of Norfolk Island , which lies 1,600 kilometres to the east-north-east of Sydney . Set on the Kingston coastal plain and bounded by hills , it comprises a large group of buildings from the convict era , some of which have been modified during the Pitcairn period ( from 1856 to the present ) , substantial ruins and standing structures , archaeological remains , landform and landscape elements . KAVHA 's aesthetic qualities have been recognised since the earliest days of the first settlement . It is outstanding for its picturesque setting , historic associations , part ruinous configuration and subsequent lack of development . Early Polynesian presence Europeans were not the first people to inhabit Norfolk Island . Stone tools have been found at both Emily and Slaughter bays within KAVHA . Archaeological investigations have revealed evidence of landscape modifications in the Emily Bay area including artefact assemblages and structural remains that have been interpreted as a rudimentary marae , a religious structure characteristic of East Polynesian culture . Radiocarbon dating indicates Polynesian settlement of the area occurred between AD 1200 and AD 1600 . The first European settlement Discovered by Captain James Cook RN in 1774 , Norfolk Island was settled on 6 March 1788 , six weeks after the First Fleet landed in Sydney . Cook reported the island had rich soils , tall pines suitable for ships masts and spars , and native flax that could be used for making canvas . Governor Philip had instructions to settle and secure the island as soon as possible to secure its potential naval supplies . Arriving on the Supply , Lieutenant Philip Gidley King RN and a party of nine male and six female convicts and seven staff established a settlement named Kingston . Crops were sown in the adjoining valley , Arthurs Vale , and , unlike the experience in Sydney , the Kingston crops flourished . To relieve the food pressures in the infant colony of New South Wales , Governor Philip relocated around one - third Sydney 's population to Kingston . Extensive clearing followed and both convicts and free settlers farmed small holdings of land . The rising land behind Kingston was cleared for surveillance and to ensure there was no cover for escaping convicts . The first settlement 's population peaked at 1156 in May 1792 . By 1804 the free settlers on the island significantly outnumbered the convicts who represented 23 percent of the total population of 1084 . On its abandonment in 1814 the settlement 's buildings were destroyed . The second settlement In response to the report by Commissioner Bigge ( 1822 - 23 ) on the effectiveness of transportation , the Colonial Secretary Lord Bathurst instructed Governor Brisbane in 1824 to re-occupy the island as a ' great hulk or penitentiary ' to provide secondary punishment . Secondary punishment was designed to revive the fear of transportation and deter crime in Britain and the colonies , and was a sentence applied to transported convicts who re-offended in the colony . Norfolk Island was re-occupied on 6 June 1825 by Captain Turton as commandant , with a party of 50 soldiers , 57 convicts , six women and six children . The settlement was again located around Kingston and the remains of some first settlement buildings were rebuilt , old agricultural areas rehabilitated and new areas cleared . But it was to be of an entirely different character to the first settlement . The second settlement on Norfolk Island was designed to be the extreme in convict degradation and the came to stand for worst of the transportation system . KAVHA 's major buildings include : - the 1829 Government House , one of the earliest and most intact remaining government house buildings in Australia , with its commanding views of the settlement - the Old Military Barracks and officers quarters constructed between 1829 - 1834 which are surrounded by high walls giving it an appearance of a military fortress - the New Military Barracks , commenced in 1836 which follows a similar fortress - like design - the Commissariat Store , dating from 1835 which is the finest remaining colonial ( pre 1850 ) military commissariat store in Australia - the elegant Quality Row houses that provided quarters for military and civil officers . To optimise surveillance , the military complexes are elevated in order to oversight the convict precinct located closer to the water and at a lower elevation . Also to be found at KAVHA are the archaeological remains of the two convict gaols , and the perimeter walls and archaeological remains of the prisoners ' barracks ( 1828 - 48 ) with the Protestant chapel . These show the development of penal philosophies during the period of the settlements operation , with the original gaol built for barrack accommodation while the remains of the new prison and its perimeter walls ( 1836 - 40 , 1845 - 57 ) provides a rare representation of a radial design . Other archaeological remains include the blacksmith 's shop ( 1846 ) , lumber yard , water mill , the crankmill ( 1827 - 38 ) , the remains of the only known human powered crankmill built in Australia before 1850 , the salt house ( 1847 ) , the windmill base ( 1842 - 43 ) , lime kilns ; the landing pier ( 1839 - 47 ) and sea wall , two of the earliest remaining large scale engineering works in Australia . The role of religion in reform is evident in the Protestant and Catholic clergyman 's quarters . Hell on earth Convicts worked from sunrise to sunset . Agricultural work was done with hoes and spades , and no ploughs or working cattle were used . Convict accommodation was cramped and unsanitary and this , combined with their poor diet of one meal every 48 hours , resulted in poor health and many deaths . The harshness and degradation of the treatment metered out to the convicts was intended to break them . Floggings were common , even for trivial offences , and sentences could be extended . The worst of the convict population from both New South Wales and Van Diemen 's Land were sent to Norfolk Island ; men who had become so brutalised by the system that ever increasing levels of punishment only served to make them more recalcitrant . The prospect of punishment by death was no deterrent . The ruthless men charged with running Norfolk Island and controlling its convict population were themselves part of a brutal system . A number of the commandants , including Captain James Morisset , Major Joseph Childs and John Price , were particularly cruel . Mutinies and uprisings were not uncommon and invariably led to floggings and hangings . It was during Morisset 's period as commandant ( 1829 - 34 ) , which was noted for his extensive use of the lash , that Norfolk Island became renowned as ' hell on earth ' and by 1833 the island 's fearsome reputation was well known in Britain . A new prison philosophy Only one commandant of Norfolk Island , Alexander Maconochie , brought a humanising regime of reform to the second settlement period through four of its 30 years . He introduced the Merits System of Penal Discipline , which worked on the principle that the prisoner could secure freedom if they were industrious and well behaved . For a number of reasons , including the fact that his superiors disapproved of his reformist actions , his reforms failed . Under Maconochie 's humanitarian influence the conditions for prisoners had improved . They rapidly deteriorated , however , under the next commandant , Major Joseph Childs . The final years The latter stages of the second settlement saw prisoners arriving direct from Britain to serve the first stage of their punishment under the new probation system introduced in 1843 . The severity of the place continued and in his report to the British Parliament in 1847 , Catholic Bishop Robert Wilson detailed the appalling conditions on Norfolk Island . His report helped bring an end to the island 's use as a penal settlement . It was gradually closed between 1847 and 1855 with some convicts having been released on tickets of leave , while others were taken to Port Arthur where they served out their sentences . An Order in Council made on 29 December 1853 , repealed all previous orders making Norfolk Island a penal settlement . A small party remained on the island to care for the farms and livestock and to handover to the incoming settlers from Pitcairn Island , who constituted the third settlement phase of the island 's history . Third settlement As the Pitcairn Island descendents of the Bounty mutineers had outgrown their island home , the British government chose to resettle them on Norfolk Island . The whole Pitcairn community landed at Kingston Pier on 8 June 1856 . Their descendents , who today comprise nearly a third of Norfolk Island 's population , still speak the Pitcairn language . For them KAVHA is a place of special significance because it has been continually and actively used since their arrival as a place of residence , work , worship and recreation . KAVHA is uncommon as a place where a distinctive Polynesian / European community has lived and practised their cultural traditions for over 150 years .","annotations":[{"text":"Area","span":[93,96],"token_span":[14,14],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"This role identifies the entity, concrete or abstract."},{"text":"on Norfolk Island","span":[110,126],"token_span":[19,21],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies where the event takes place."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"\" .. the best surviving examples of large - scale convict transportation and the colonial expansion of European powers through the presence and labour of convicts . \" UNESCO 's World Heritage \" Australian Convict Sites \" webpages Accessed 2 August 2010 The Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area ( KAVHA ) , on Norfolk Island , is of outstanding significance to the nation as a convict settlement spanning the era of transportation to eastern Australia between 17881855 .

Pre-Historic Archeological Assets Pre-historic archeological assets relate to Native American settlement and tend to date prior to about 1700 . \u00c2 According to the Maine Historic Preservation Commission ( MHPC ) , there are two known pre-historic archeological sites in Hallowell . \u00c2 Both are located in developed areas ( their exact locations are undisclosed ) and may no longer survive . \u00c2 Limited archaeological surveying has been accomplished along the Kennebec River , with no sites found . \u00c2 The MHPC recommends future archaeological surveys in two archaeologically sensitive areas : along Vaughn Brook and around the small ponds in the western portion of the City . Historic Archeological Assets Historic archeological assets were created after European settlement . \u00c2 The MHPC identifies four historic archeological sites in Hallowell . They are : The exact locations of these sites is undisclosed . Historic Assets Historic assets date after widespread European settlement and include villages , historic districts , buildings , cemeteries , bridges , and other similar resources . The National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) is the nation\u00e2s official list of preserved historic resources . \u00c2 The National Register helps communities identify , evaluate , and protect historic and archeological resources . \u00c2 It also provides guidelines for renovation and development within the designated buildings and districts . \u00c2 Districts , sites , buildings , structures and objects can all be listed . \u00c2 Listings are federally recognized and protected from adverse impacts by projects funded , licensed , or executed by the federal government ; they are also eligible for federal rehabilitation tax credits . \u00c2 The following properties located in Hallowell are listed on the National Register of Historic Places : Along with the Row House and the Vaughn Homestead , \u00c2 both of which are listed on the National Register , 54 additional historic sites in Hallowell are identified as locally historically significant in the brochure , \u00e2 Historic Hallowell Maine : A Guide to Historic Homes and Places of Interest , \u00e2 produced by the Row House , Inc , a non-profit organization dedicated to historic preservation in Hallowell .. Two of the Hallowell residences listed in the \u00e2 Historic Hallowell Maine\u00e2 brochure , the former Jacob Abbott House ( 61 Winthrop Street ) and the Governor Bodwell House have been on Maine Preservation\u00e2s Most Endangered Historic Properties list since 2000 . \u00c2 The Hallowell Freight Shed , a historic railroad building , was added to the list in 2008 . \u00c2 \" Most Endangered \" status does not ensure the protection of a site or provide funding , but is designed to raise local awareness and helps focus rescue efforts . \u00c2 Criteria for inclusion on the endangered list include demonstrating the property\u00e2s historic significance , identifying threats to the site , and a strong commitment to invest time , energy and money to rescue the historic property . \u00c2 Also listed in the brochure is the Hubbard Library , Maine\u00e2s oldest standing free public library , which is in need of major roof , electrical , and other building improvements . Historic Organizations and Resources Local non-profit organizations play an important role in the identification and preservation of historic resources . Hallowell has several historic non-profits : Row House , Inc. is a non- profit , membership organization dedicated to preserving Historic Hallowell . \u00c2 The organization has been in existence for more than thirty - five years , and was recently a key partner in the renovation and restoration of the City Hall building . \u00c2 It produces the brochure , \u00e2 Historic Hallowell Maine : A Guide to Historic Homes and Places of Interest\u00e2 ( see Historic Assets , above ) . Row House , Inc and the Hallowell Area Board of Trade have come together to develop Hallowell\u00e2s Museum in the Streets , a walking tour that will include photographs , illustrations and information about important people , events , and historical sites throughout the City . \u00c2 The project will feature two large maps showing the location of twenty informational signs throughout the City . \u00c2 Museum in the Streets was recently accepted as a Maine Historical Society\u00e2s Maine Community Heritage Project ; the Heritage Project\u00e2s mission is to help pilot communities gather historic material and create a prominent place on the World Wide Web where people in the communities will be able to access and use it . \u00c2 Part of the project\u00e2s work with the Museum in the Street will include an interactive web site located at mainemeory . net and a take - home map describing the initiative . Additional resources regarding Hallowell\u00e2s historic assets include an inventory of the historic buildings on Second St. located at the Maine Preservation Commission ; a number of 1964 historic photos located at the Hubbard Free Library in Hallowell ; and a 1992 historic survey ( property type , architectural data , age , location , and historical data ) of Hallowell located at the Maine State Library . Protection for Historic and Archeological Resources Neglect and inappropriate development are the greatest threats to historic and archeological resources . \u00c2 Protection from these can be provided at the local , state , and federal levels . Federal and State Level Protection Numerous federal and state laws and regulations govern the treatment of historic and archaeological resources in Maine . \u00c2 They are focused on protecting cultural resources that may be threatened by projects funded or permitted by the federal or state governments \u00c2 Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act requires Federal agencies to review all federally funded , permitted , or licensed projects which may affect a property listed on the National Register of Historic Places or eligible for such listing . \u00c2 Section 106 review is a routine part of the planning process for all federally - assisted projects . \u00c2 The review does not guarantee that the property will not be affected or even demolished , but it does ensure that there will be an opportunity to consider the effects of the project before it occurs . \u00c2 The Maine Historic Preservation Commission currently reviews 3000 - 3500 projects under this law every year . \u00c2 Maine 's Site Location of Development Law requires consultation from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission on impacts resulting from large - scale developments that may not come under Section 106 jurisdiction , including projects occupying more than 20 acres , metallic mineral and advanced exploration projects , large structures and subdivisions , and oil terminal facilities . \u00c2 The Commission reviews roughly 300 - 500 projects per year under this law . \u00c2 The protection of historic properties at federal and state levels is limited to projects of significant size , or those funded , licensed , or permitted by federal and state agencies . \u00c2 For all other projects , the only comprehensive protection for historic properties is legislation at the local level . Local Protection Hallowell\u00e2s current zoning ordinance includes a Historic District Overlay Zone ( HD ) . \u00c2 Overlay zones impose additional requirements to the zoning requirements already established for the area as designated . \u00c2 For example , a parcel along the Kennebec River might be subject to the requirements of the Shoreland District , the Floodplain Management District , and the Historic District . Building , remodeling and demolition permits for properties within Hallowell\u00e2s Historic District , as well as any properties designated by the City Council as a Historic Landmark ( such as the Powder House at High Street ) , may not be issued without Planning Board approval . \u00c2 Property owners must submit a \u00e2 Historic District Certificate of Appropriateness Form\u00e2 to gain project and material approval . \u00c2 The zoning ordinance outlines the criteria for Planning Board approval based on the U.S. Secretary of the Interior\u00e2s Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings . \u00c2 These guidelines are very specific and can be costly for homeowners . The Planning Board has enforced general guidelines regarding building development , additions , and integrity with existing forms and dimensions . \u00c2 However , specific guidelines have sometimes not been fully enforced , such as the types of materials used for replacement or updating of windows and siding . \u00c2 There is concern that by not fully meeting the national requirements , the Historic District\u00e2s National Registry Listing may be at risk . \u00c2 Lack of enforcement mechanisms is also a significant issue . \u00c2 If a property owner in the Historic District has not obtained approval for building renovations regulated by the ordinance , the Code Enforcement Officer currently has no enforcement mechanism other than sending a letter informing a property owner that their actions are not consistent with City requirements . \u00c2 This is not always enough to encourage compliance .

Pre-Historic Archeological Assets Pre-historic archeological assets relate to Native American settlement and tend to date prior to about 1700 . \u00c2 According to the Maine Historic Preservation Commission ( MHPC ) , there are two known pre-historic archeological sites in Hallowell . \u00c2 Both are located in developed areas ( their exact locations are undisclosed ) and may no longer survive . \u00c2 Limited archaeological surveying has been accomplished along the Kennebec River , with no sites found . \u00c2 The MHPC recommends future archaeological surveys in two archaeologically sensitive areas : along Vaughn Brook and around the small ponds in the western portion of the City . Historic Archeological Assets Historic archeological assets were created after European settlement . \u00c2 The MHPC identifies four historic archeological sites in Hallowell . They are : The exact locations of these sites is undisclosed . Historic Assets Historic assets date after widespread European settlement and include villages , historic districts , buildings , cemeteries , bridges , and other similar resources . The National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) is the nation\u00e2s official list of preserved historic resources . \u00c2 The National Register helps communities identify , evaluate , and protect historic and archeological resources . \u00c2 It also provides guidelines for renovation and development within the designated buildings and districts . \u00c2 Districts , sites , buildings , structures and objects can all be listed . \u00c2 Listings are federally recognized and protected from adverse impacts by projects funded , licensed , or executed by the federal government ; they are also eligible for federal rehabilitation tax credits . \u00c2 The following properties located in Hallowell are listed on the National Register of Historic Places : Along with the Row House and the Vaughn Homestead , \u00c2 both of which are listed on the National Register , 54 additional historic sites in Hallowell are identified as locally historically significant in the brochure , \u00e2 Historic Hallowell Maine : A Guide to Historic Homes and Places of Interest , \u00e2 produced by the Row House , Inc , a non-profit organization dedicated to historic preservation in Hallowell .. Two of the Hallowell residences listed in the \u00e2 Historic Hallowell Maine\u00e2 brochure , the former Jacob Abbott House ( 61 Winthrop Street ) and the Governor Bodwell House have been on Maine Preservation\u00e2s Most Endangered Historic Properties list since 2000 . \u00c2 The Hallowell Freight Shed , a historic railroad building , was added to the list in 2008 . \u00c2 \" Most Endangered \" status does not ensure the protection of a site or provide funding , but is designed to raise local awareness and helps focus rescue efforts . \u00c2 Criteria for inclusion on the endangered list include demonstrating the property\u00e2s historic significance , identifying threats to the site , and a strong commitment to invest time , energy and money to rescue the historic property . \u00c2 Also listed in the brochure is the Hubbard Library , Maine\u00e2s oldest standing free public library , which is in need of major roof , electrical , and other building improvements .

[ CDATA [ The Waterloo Ceremony . An elaborate gesture performed annually by the Duke of Wellington , as he pays the rent on his grand stately home in Hampshire to the British Monarch . This symbolic ceremony is held every year on 18th June , the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo . The origin of the Waterloo Ceremony dates back to the early 19th century . In 1815 , Arthur Wellesley , 1st Duke of Wellington , led the British army into battle against a formidable enemy \u2013 the French . The armies met at Waterloo , where Napoleon was defeated , bringing an end to nearly 23 years of war in Europe . The Duke of Wellington returned to England , victorious . Returning to an extremely grateful nation in 1817 , the nation bought Stratfield Saye House in Hampshire in order to give it to The Duke of Wellington . The Duke 's original plans were to tear down the house and build a magnificent Waterloo Palace in its place , but when this turned out to be too expensive , he took up residence in Stratfield Saye House itself . The house has served as the home of all the subsequent Dukes of Wellington , and all but the 1st and 6th Dukes are buried on the estate . The current Duke is Arthur Valerian Wellesley , 8th Duke of Wellington . Every year , His Grace travels to Windsor Castle to pay the rent on Stratfield Saye House . However , this rent is purely symbolic , and no money actually changes hands . Instead , the Duke of Wellington presents The Queen with a French tricolour , to signify the victory over the French at Waterloo . The flag is made of silk , with gold embroidery , and a new one is made each year . The year in which it was used in the ceremony is printed on the corner of the flag in gold lettering . When The Duke of Wellington comes in Her Majesty 's presence , he kneels before her and offers her the tricolour . She accepts his rent , upon which the flag is handed over to the Castle Superintendent , who takes it to the Guard Chamber . A marble bust of the 1st Duke of Wellington stands on a pedestal in this chamber , and the French tricolour is hung over it .

[ CDATA [ The Waterloo Ceremony . An elaborate gesture performed annually by the Duke of Wellington , as he pays the rent on his grand stately home in Hampshire to the British Monarch . This symbolic ceremony is held every year on 18th June , the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo . The origin of the Waterloo Ceremony dates back to the early 19th century . In 1815 , Arthur Wellesley , 1st Duke of Wellington , led the British army into battle against a formidable enemy \u2013 the French . The armies met at Waterloo , where Napoleon was defeated , bringing an end to nearly 23 years of war in Europe . The Duke of Wellington returned to England , victorious . Returning to an extremely grateful nation in 1817 , the nation bought Stratfield Saye House in Hampshire in order to give it to The Duke of Wellington . The Duke 's original plans were to tear down the house and build a magnificent Waterloo Palace in its place , but when this turned out to be too expensive , he took up residence in Stratfield Saye House itself . The house has served as the home of all the subsequent Dukes of Wellington , and all but the 1st and 6th Dukes are buried on the estate . The current Duke is Arthur Valerian Wellesley , 8th Duke of Wellington . Every year , His Grace travels to Windsor Castle to pay the rent on Stratfield Saye House . However , this rent is purely symbolic , and no money actually changes hands . Instead , the Duke of Wellington presents The Queen with a French tricolour , to signify the victory over the French at Waterloo . The flag is made of silk , with gold embroidery , and a new one is made each year . The year in which it was used in the ceremony is printed on the corner of the flag in gold lettering . When The Duke of Wellington comes in Her Majesty 's presence , he kneels before her and offers her the tricolour . She accepts his rent , upon which the flag is handed over to the Castle Superintendent , who takes it to the Guard Chamber . A marble bust of the 1st Duke of Wellington stands on a pedestal in this chamber , and the French tricolour is hung over it . The Duke of Wellington retires to his home for another year , his rent paid . photo credit : rich. tee via photopin cc ] ] > <! [ CDATA [ The Waterloo Ceremony .

On the Wikimania talk page , others detailed instances of the Egyptian government censoring the Internet and accused Wikimedia of taking \" a step backwards in its core philosophy . \" One person summed up the objections : \" Why hold a conference of a foundation that is based entirely on FREE media when that country and the government do n't even support free speech ? \" The nonprofit Reporters Without Borders indicates some of the accusations are n't far from the truth . It reports that ... ...a blogger named Abdel Nabil Suleiman was sentenced to four years in prison for inciting hatred of Islam ; a blogger named Abdul Moneim - Mahmud was also imprisoned , likely for posting text and photos exposing torture . Some called on Wikipedians to boycott the conference . Others encouraged participants to protest or speak out against Egypt 's human rights record while in Alexandria . Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales promised to speak about freedom of speech , human rights and free culture at the conference in response to the concerns . Wikimedia spokesman Jay Walsh said that about 600 people will be attending the conference this year : a bit fewer than usual . High airfares and the economy are likely to blame . But is it evidence of a massive boycott ? Maybe , but not necessarily for the reasons mentioned above , said Andrew Lih , who is currently writing a book about Wikipedia and online collaboration . He suggests low attendance is less of a boycott and more of a \" malaise in the community . \" Participation in the English -language version of Wikipedia is flat , and people do n't seem as excited as they do in the early stages , he said . At the conference , he 'll be talking about whether Wikipedia is a \" community in crisis . \" We 've written in the past about Wikipedia 's growing pains , but it looked like the nonprofit was getting back on track , hiring a major gifts officer and head of community giving and hoping to actually make some money . Executive Director Sue Gardner has said she hoped this is the year Wikimedia will grow up and become a sustainable organization . Perhaps by the next Wikimania , things will have settled down , especially if volunteers pick a less controversial place for a conference .

On the Wikimania talk page , others detailed instances of the Egyptian government censoring the Internet and accused Wikimedia of taking \" a step backwards in its core philosophy . \" One person summed up the objections : \" Why hold a conference of a foundation that is based entirely on FREE media when that country and the government do n't even support free speech ? \" The nonprofit Reporters Without Borders indicates some of the accusations are n't far from the truth . It reports that ... ...a blogger named Abdel Nabil Suleiman was sentenced to four years in prison for inciting hatred of Islam ; a blogger named Abdul Moneim - Mahmud was also imprisoned , likely for posting text and photos exposing torture . Some called on Wikipedians to boycott the conference . Others encouraged participants to protest or speak out against Egypt 's human rights record while in Alexandria . Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales promised to speak about freedom of speech , human rights and free culture at the conference in response to the concerns . Wikimedia spokesman Jay Walsh said that about 600 people will be attending the conference this year : a bit fewer than usual . High airfares and the economy are likely to blame . But is it evidence of a massive boycott ? Maybe , but not necessarily for the reasons mentioned above , said Andrew Lih , who is currently writing a book about Wikipedia and online collaboration . He suggests low attendance is less of a boycott and more of a \" malaise in the community . \" Participation in the English -language version of Wikipedia is flat , and people do n't seem as excited as they do in the early stages , he said . At the conference , he 'll be talking about whether Wikipedia is a \" community in crisis . \" We 've written in the past about Wikipedia 's growing pains , but it looked like the nonprofit was getting back on track , hiring a major gifts officer and head of community giving and hoping to actually make some money . Executive Director Sue Gardner has said she hoped this is the year Wikimedia will grow up and become a sustainable organization . Perhaps by the next Wikimania , things will have settled down , especially if volunteers pick a less controversial place for a conference .

It boasts a host of luxury apartments that has celebrities flocking . But behind the glitz and glamour of Dubai often lies a murky world of exploitation and an immigrant work force living on the breadline . Hit by the credit crunch , Dubai 's economy has taken a turn for the worse reliant as it is on tourism , financial services and real estate . For those labouring to make the Dubai dream a reality , building the homes for the rich and famous , are facing greater pressures than ever . Ben Anderson investigates the working conditions for some construction workers But despite the slump , the pressure on would - be buyers is still healthy . A Panorama reporter posing as a potential buyer and kitted out with a secret camera , met with a company endorsed by celebrities . Footballer Michael Owen is a paid ambassador along with England cricketer Freddie Flintoff and golfer Sam Torrance . A sales representatives from The First Group said now was a great time to buy property . She also allayed any concerns about the wellbeing of the company 's construction workers . Offering a purchase that would see a \u00a3 438,000 apartment rise to \u00a3 1.33 m in just 10 years , the sales reps also said they believed the workers were happy to be there . \" It 's much more difficult to earn some money in Pakistan or India , so people actually save by living for free in proper housing , eating for free in the canteen , using the transport and sending something to their families , \" she said . It is the promise of a land of opportunity that has brought an estimated one million migrant workers to Dubai . Most come from areas of extreme poverty in the Indian sub - continent where they are easy prey for recruitment agents . Paying up to \u00a3 2,000 to make the trip , the sum often has to be borrowed or family land sold in the belief that within 18 months the debt can be repaid . 30p overtime Instead on arriving in Dubai they are met with shanty town conditions hidden from public view . In a country that penalises journalists reporting stories which negatively reflect the economy or insult the government with massive fines and even imprisonment , it was important to maintain a low profile . | | Ambassadors for a development : Freddie Flintoff and Michael Owen In secret , we followed a group of workers home from work . Employed by The First Group 's sub-contractors United Engineering Construction , they were working on a development due to be finished in June ready for England striker Michael Owen to move in . Back at the worker 's camp we were soon rumbled and asked to leave . Returning over the next few days we managed to speak to some of the men living there on condition of anonymity . They told a grim tale . None had been paid the money they were promised by the recruitment agencies , and many said they could n't afford to eat properly , living on a diet of potatoes , lentils and bread . Average salaries are often no more than \u00a3 120 a month . This for a six -day week , often working up to 12 - hour shifts . One company paid approximately 30p an hour for overtime . UNEC said that its minimum basic salary and overtime rate were significantly higher and that employees only worked 12 hour days in exceptional circumstances . It said its workers were fully aware of their proposed terms of employment before travelling to Dubai and that it \" wholly disapproved \" of workers paying recruitment agents . It said it only recruited through one agency in India , but the workers we spoke to came from elsewhere . The First Group said its own checks had confirmed that the pay and conditions at the camp were legal . One of Dubai 's biggest new developments is The Jumeirah Golf Estates , which will host the climax of the European Golf championship in November . The main developer is Leisurecorp , which also owns the championship golf course at Turnberry in Scotland , and has a stake in Troon . Jumeirah Golf Estates has attracted an incredible array of celebrities who are named as ambassadors on its website , including TV chef Jamie Oliver and golfers Greg Norman , Vijay Singh and Sergio Garcia . Camp overcrowding Once again we followed workers back to their accommodation . This time they were employed by one of Dubai 's biggest construction firms Arabtec , to work on a part of the development that had been sold to a sub-developer , but the picture was familiar . After an hour - long journey back to their gated and guarded labour camp , the men agreed to speak to us if their identities were kept secret . \" The latrines are so filthy we cannot use them , we are so disgusted . The roads are full of garbage and waterlogged . Living and moving about here is a great problem . We suffer greatly , \" one of the workers told us . We decided to find out for ourselves . Armed with a secret camera we sneaked into the camp to be met with the smell of raw sewage . Sewage had leaked out all over the camp , and workers had to create a network of stepping stones to cross it and get back to their accommodation blocks . One toilet block had no water supply and the latrines were filled with piles of raw faeces . Documents obtained by us showed that a month previous to our visit , the Dubai authorities described the sewage situation at the site as critical . Arabtec had been fined 10,000 dirhams , approximately \u00a3 2,000 , for allowing sewage to overflow into workers ' accommodation . Downturn The authorities also reported that the camp was overcrowded with 7,500 labourers sharing 1,248 rooms with poor ventilation . But with the downturn in the economy , the workers feel less able to complain as the consequences are graver . \" They are telling , now that you have come , you stay and work . If we find any mistake in your work then finish - back to Bangladesh . We will no longer keep you , \" one Arabtec worker told us . Earning just \u00a3 140 a month for a six day week , he has n't told his family at home about the reality of his situation . \" We have not told them because if we do , our wives and our children will start crying , so we have told them we are doing well . \" The Dubai Municipal government said regular inspections are carried out of migrant workers ' living conditions and fines levied for substandard housing . Arabtec said it did not accept that there were unsanitary conditions at any of its camps ' toilets . It blamed the workers , saying , despite training , their \" standards of cleanliness and hygiene are not up to your or our standards \" and that the toilet block we had filmed in may have been a block that was meant to be closed . It now says it is concerned about the situation , and despite originally blaming the problems on a nearby sewage plant , admitted sewage in the camp was a constant problem it was battling to resolve . They said the camp was a temporary one and all workers will be moved out in eight months . It said that its wage levels were the Dubai norm and the basic working week was 48 hours and overtime was paid for any hours over that . In a statement to Panorama , Jamie Oliver Enterprises said they were disturbed by the issues raised : \" When we started work with our partner in Dubai , we were informed of their strict contractual guidelines which are in place with sub-developers to protect the rights of migrant workers and provide for good living and working conditions . While we are satisfied that the sub-contractors employed directly by our partner to work on Jamie Oliver projects meet the regulatory requirements and are fair , we have been given further assurances that the claims made by employees working on a sub-developer 's project will be investigated . \" Panorama has also been told that Jamie Oliver now wants to come up with more accurate wording to describe his business relationship with Jumeirah Golf Estates . In the meantime , the celebrity chef 's name has been removed from the list of ambassadors on the company 's website . Here is a selection of your comments . I 've lived in Dubai and now live in Doha and the situation is really depressing . All the workers are so low paid , the construction workers get the worst of it but cab drivers , shop and restaurant workers and service people get a bad deal too . I 've spoken to many who were tricked into coming to the Middle East and are now trapped due to visa regulations and sponsorship laws ( as well as not being able to afford a flight home ) . Businesses here totally take advantage , yet everything costs about the same as in the West - how does that add up ? Jill , Doha , Qatar I totally agree , being an expat here in Dubai for the past three years , I must say I agree completely . Dubai is a brilliant place for the rich but the poor have very little to reap from it . The poverty gap in Dubai is massive , and I myself am quite disgusted in how the public treat the low pay workers . For instance , there are security guards constantly asking the labourers to leave the public beach when it is crowded by tourists . I find this totally unacceptable as a public beach should be accessible to all . The bottom line is , I find that Dubai is so concerned about creating this \" fairy - tale \" image and you will find this place to be very materialistic and pretentious - do n't get me wrong , a bit of bling in a city is fun - but when it is at the expense of others it gets ugly . Sue , Dubai , UAE Unfortunately none of this is necessary new . All over the world , and throughout history , it has been the hard work of underpaid , exploited and desperate people i.e. ( modern ) slaves that raised skyscrapers and built big cities for the enjoyment of a few selected people . This is yet another proof of modern slavery . However , I do wonder which actions the so called celebrities will take to tackle this issue , now that they know for sure what 's really going on under the radars ? Simon B , Bedford I am a Sri Lankan , My father was the head of foreign employment bureau in Sri Lanka . My experience was sitting in his office as a child and the complaints I used to hear people make . Thousands of house maids employed in middle eastern countries never get paid what they are promised . And a large proportion of them return home with no payment . Either they have been unreasonably penalised for minor mistakes they have done or blatantly told to get lost because they asked for money . Dr Channa Hewamadduma , UK , Sheffield The CEOs of companies where their labour force is used and abused should be placed firmly behind bars or worse - live in the conditions provided in the labour camps . Shiraz , Dubai , UAE Facts and figures are worse than highlighted in the story . It 's not only Dubai , but the same story is everywhere in the country . It is good for the BBC to highlight such things , local media can not highlight these issues . Naveen Kumar , Dubai UAE So why ca n't the celebrities who are ambassadors do something about this by not endorsing these projects . or are we living in a very selfish world , where the life of the downtrodden does not matter to us ? Ayesha , Chennai Well , being born and bought up in India , we have always seen numerous cases of such sad stories . Selling the house / farmland / jewellery and leaving behind the family - going to Gulf countries to work as a cleaner and other low-profile labour jobs . Living in a small rooms which have satellite TV connections for Indian regional channels , eating basic self - made Indian food - saving every penny and sending it back to home . There are still many families out there living happily thinking with pride that their family member is working in a foreign country . It is nice to know BBC is trying to uncover such stories and make Western countries know of their pitiable state . Ram , Bath , UK A friend of mine recently returned from Dubai having quit her job there in disgust at the way that the poorer immigrant workers were treated . According to her , it is not only the big corporations who exploit said workforce : the expat Britpack is not without criticism , employing such workers as servants for the most meagre of pittances - wage slavery by any other name . The Brits there even have a derogatory quasi-racist nickname for these immigrants : they call them \" Yik - Yaks \" , and treat them with contempt and disdain . Simon , Southampton Having lived and worked in Dubai , everyone out there knows that Dubai is built on the modern day equivalent of slave labour . It is not a secret , is not hidden , and anyone who tells you different is lying . Whether you choose to ignore it or not is up to you , but do not pretend not to be complicit , when their poor wages subsidise your lavish lifestyle , gas guzzling car , swimming pool , school fees etc etc Hopefully now with the recession even the Brits are realising it is no longer the safe haven cash - cow that they think they are entitled to , by luck of birth . Anon , Glasgow I have been a frequent recent visitor to Dubai and to Sharjah . There are certainly the conditions you describe . Further , there is also the issue of the \" servant class \" - mainly made up of young girls where some of the stories and experiences can be shocking . Important too is the fact that similar conditions / experiences also exist in their home countries . However , I have seen examples in Sharjah of companies having a very different attitude to their workers . Accommodation camps with proper amenities , the provision of computing and internet facilities , medical care and more . There the workers ( mainly South Asian ) are able to keep in touch with family , get paid visits to return home and are treated in a humane way including better salaries than are available elsewhere .

It boasts a host of luxury apartments that has celebrities flocking . But behind the glitz and glamour of Dubai often lies a murky world of exploitation and an immigrant work force living on the breadline . Hit by the credit crunch , Dubai 's economy has taken a turn for the worse reliant as it is on tourism , financial services and real estate . For those labouring to make the Dubai dream a reality , building the homes for the rich and famous , are facing greater pressures than ever . Ben Anderson investigates the working conditions for some construction workers But despite the slump , the pressure on would - be buyers is still healthy . A Panorama reporter posing as a potential buyer and kitted out with a secret camera , met with a company endorsed by celebrities . Footballer Michael Owen is a paid ambassador along with England cricketer Freddie Flintoff and golfer Sam Torrance . A sales representatives from The First Group said now was a great time to buy property . She also allayed any concerns about the wellbeing of the company 's construction workers . Offering a purchase that would see a \u00a3 438,000 apartment rise to \u00a3 1.33 m in just 10 years , the sales reps also said they believed the workers were happy to be there . \" It 's much more difficult to earn some money in Pakistan or India , so people actually save by living for free in proper housing , eating for free in the canteen , using the transport and sending something to their families , \" she said . It is the promise of a land of opportunity that has brought an estimated one million migrant workers to Dubai . Most come from areas of extreme poverty in the Indian sub - continent where they are easy prey for recruitment agents . Paying up to \u00a3 2,000 to make the trip , the sum often has to be borrowed or family land sold in the belief that within 18 months the debt can be repaid . 30p overtime Instead on arriving in Dubai they are met with shanty town conditions hidden from public view . In a country that penalises journalists reporting stories which negatively reflect the economy or insult the government with massive fines and even imprisonment , it was important to maintain a low profile . | | Ambassadors for a development : Freddie Flintoff and Michael Owen In secret , we followed a group of workers home from work . Employed by The First Group 's sub-contractors United Engineering Construction , they were working on a development due to be finished in June ready for England striker Michael Owen to move in . Back at the worker 's camp we were soon rumbled and asked to leave . Returning over the next few days we managed to speak to some of the men living there on condition of anonymity . They told a grim tale . None had been paid the money they were promised by the recruitment agencies , and many said they could n't afford to eat properly , living on a diet of potatoes , lentils and bread . Average salaries are often no more than \u00a3 120 a month . This for a six -day week , often working up to 12 - hour shifts . One company paid approximately 30p an hour for overtime . UNEC said that its minimum basic salary and overtime rate were significantly higher and that employees only worked 12 hour days in exceptional circumstances . It said its workers were fully aware of their proposed terms of employment before travelling to Dubai and that it \" wholly disapproved \" of workers paying recruitment agents . It said it only recruited through one agency in India , but the workers we spoke to came from elsewhere . The First Group said its own checks had confirmed that the pay and conditions at the camp were legal . One of Dubai 's biggest new developments is The Jumeirah Golf Estates , which will host the climax of the European Golf championship in November . The main developer is Leisurecorp , which also owns the championship golf course at Turnberry in Scotland , and has a stake in Troon . Jumeirah Golf Estates has attracted an incredible array of celebrities who are named as ambassadors on its website , including TV chef Jamie Oliver and golfers Greg Norman , Vijay Singh and Sergio Garcia . Camp overcrowding Once again we followed workers back to their accommodation . This time they were employed by one of Dubai 's biggest construction firms Arabtec , to work on a part of the development that had been sold to a sub-developer , but the picture was familiar . After an hour - long journey back to their gated and guarded labour camp , the men agreed to speak to us if their identities were kept secret . \" The latrines are so filthy we cannot use them , we are so disgusted . The roads are full of garbage and waterlogged . Living and moving about here is a great problem . We suffer greatly , \" one of the workers told us . We decided to find out for ourselves . Armed with a secret camera we sneaked into the camp to be met with the smell of raw sewage . Sewage had leaked out all over the camp , and workers had to create a network of stepping stones to cross it and get back to their accommodation blocks . One toilet block had no water supply and the latrines were filled with piles of raw faeces . Documents obtained by us showed that a month previous to our visit , the Dubai authorities described the sewage situation at the site as critical . Arabtec had been fined 10,000 dirhams , approximately \u00a3 2,000 , for allowing sewage to overflow into workers ' accommodation . Downturn The authorities also reported that the camp was overcrowded with 7,500 labourers sharing 1,248 rooms with poor ventilation . But with the downturn in the economy , the workers feel less able to complain as the consequences are graver . \" They are telling , now that you have come , you stay and work . If we find any mistake in your work then finish - back to Bangladesh . We will no longer keep you , \" one Arabtec worker told us . Earning just \u00a3 140 a month for a six day week , he has n't told his family at home about the reality of his situation . \" We have not told them because if we do , our wives and our children will start crying , so we have told them we are doing well . \" The Dubai Municipal government said regular inspections are carried out of migrant workers ' living conditions and fines levied for substandard housing . Arabtec said it did not accept that there were unsanitary conditions at any of its camps ' toilets . It blamed the workers , saying , despite training , their \" standards of cleanliness and hygiene are not up to your or our standards \" and that the toilet block we had filmed in may have been a block that was meant to be closed . It now says it is concerned about the situation , and despite originally blaming the problems on a nearby sewage plant , admitted sewage in the camp was a constant problem it was battling to resolve .

Their blend of rock and R&B produced a string of hits throughout the next decade . At age 40 , ' Listen to the Music ' remains a classic rock radio staple and the Doobies -- with founding members Tom Johnston and Patrick Simmons -- still maintain a busy tour schedule . Johnston , who wrote ' Listen to the Music , ' told Ultimate Classic Rock that the musicians around the San Francisco Bay Area helped mold the band 's sound . What was the influence of the Bay Area on your music in 1969 ? The music scene , by the time I got up to San Jose , was centered around the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane and to an extent Moby Grape and the other bands that had pretty much started to fade . Grateful Dead was still a force to be reckoned with , and still is for that matter , because they had such a huge cult following , but the other bands were on their way out . I played with a lot of guys who were in the Santa Cruz Mountains , a lot of jam sessions , and I also met Skip Spence from Moby Grape early on . Jammed with him quite a bit ; he was responsible for putting me together with John Hartman , who was the original drummer in the Doobie Brothers . He put us together because John had come out from Washington , DC looking for people for a Moby Grape reunion . Moby Grape had a cult following as well , and I was one of the cult . And so was John and so was Pat and so was Tiran [ Porter , Doobies ' bassist ] and so was everybody else I knew . What was the influence of the Grape on the Doobies ' music ? They had three - part harmonies , they had guys that were able to fingerpick , they had a driving drummer , they had all these facets that nobody else had . The songs were really good , well - crafted , well - thought - out songs . I love their lyrics , they 're incredible . They were n't just dumb-headed lyrics . Unfortunately they burned out really fast but in the small snippet of time they were around , they put out a couple of albums that were just phenomenal . The first one to me has yet to be equaled . I played the grooves off of that one . What are some of the songs where a listener can hear the Grape influence ? I would say ' Neal 's Fandango ' is one of them . That song jumps out at me right off the bat because that has a real Moby Grape flavor to it . What is your writing process ? Do you write the music first or the lyrics ? The music is always first for me . People that can write words first and then write music , they 're beyond me . I do n't know how they do it . I 've had ideas of a lyric but then I still have to go write the track and see how I can fit that lyric into it . How did you come up with the ' chunka- chunka ' strumming style ? It was just a way to drive a song . It was a way to have a drummer without a drummer being present . With that kind of strumming , you 're playing drums while you 're playing the rhythm part . I had my foot doin ' the kick drum , the snare drum was in the downbeat on the rhythm and then the rhythmical part was really a cross between all the influences of R&B players I 'd listened to for years . ' Listen to the Music . ' How did you come to write that ? The chord structure of it made me think of something positive , so the lyrics that came out of that were based on this utopian idea that if the leaders of the world got together on some grassy hill somewhere and either smoked enough dope or just sat down and just listened to the music and forgot about all this other bulls --- , the world would be a much better place . It was very utopian and very unrealistic ( laughs ) . It seemed like a good idea at the time . War was raging , the Cuban Missile Crisis , marches , there was a lot of stuff going on then . This was my way of saying , \" Really , come on guys , what if you just brought it down a couple of notches and just try to get along ? \" My version of Rodney King , I guess . The guitar riff that opens the song is immediately identifiable . Was that the first thing you wrote ? Yes it is , that strumming part that opens the song is just exactly how I wrote it . That is one song , probably the only song , that I did n't change at all once we got it in the studio . I had all the lyrics , I had all the chord changes . I called Ted [ Templeman , producer ] up at three in the morning , blazing away on guitar and said , \" You gotta hear this . This song is a hit . \" It 's the only one I 've ever been right about . That one I flat said , \" This is a single . \" What was Ted Templeman 's contribution as a producer ? Ted gave us tremendous ideas . He was a very creative producer . He had great drum ideas in particular ' cause he was a drummer but he would also come up with good singing ideas . The same thing with lyrics . Most of his stuff was about embellishing what was already there . He would say , what if we put , for example , strings on ' Dark Eyed Cajun Woman ' or ' Take Me in Your Arms , ' something like that . Or he took ' Black Water ' and had Novi [ Novog ] play that incredible viola part on that . Patrick comes in to sing the bridge on ' Listen to the Music . ' It was unusual for the time to have a second lead . That was Teddy 's idea . I think he wanted to change up . He wanted a difference because in the breakdown , you 've got the drums that go away from the regular rhythm of the song and so he said , \" What if you had Pat sing that part ? \" I said , \" OK , go , it 'll be great . \" We tried that and it worked really well . So these are the kinds of things that Ted was good for , helping make a song more than it was when he walked in the door . Do you remember where you were when you first heard it on the radio ? Yeah , I was in my Volkswagen , driving down the road in San Jose . And I remember pulling over and going , \" Jesus Christ , that 's us . \" It was a big deal at that time ' cause we 'd never had any hits , we had n't done anything . That was our first song that got notoriety . We followed that up with ' Rockin ' Down the Highway ' and ' Jesus Is Just Alright ' on that album . Next album we had ' China Grove ' and ' Long Train Runnin ' . ' It changed your life financially , I guess . Yeah , it changed your life financially , it also took your life away ( laughs ) . That 's when you entered the whole era of you gotta have a studio album every year and you could be on the road the rest of the time ( laughs ) . That 's the way everybody did it in those days , I mean , that was just the way it was . I 'd like to ask about two of the songs that followed . What went into writing ' China Grove ' ? I looked up China Grove , it 's not really a Chinatown . Not at all , no . All it has is an ice house and feed store ( laughs ) . It is exactly where it 's written about in the song , it 's right outside of San Antonio . As far as the whole Oriental cast to it , that was all based around a piano lick by Billy Payne . I still had n't written the lyrics at that point . We laid the track down , which was unusual back then . We had this great track and he came in and put all the keyboards on it . And when he did that , I went , \" Bingo ! Oh man , what if \u2026 \" and then I went off on this whole wackadoodle thing about sheriffs with a samurai sword . In ' 72 we were touring in Winnebagos . We did play in San Antonio so the highway going into San Antonio has a sign along there that says ' City of China Grove . ' I did n't remember seeing it but I think subconsciously I saw it and I think that 's where I got the title . ' Long Train Runnin ' . ' What was your inspiration for writing it ? See , I never thought of that song as being a single . That was a jam song for us . We played that song in late ' 70 , early ' 71 . And I would make up different words to it every night . And it was called ' Rosie Pig Moseley , ' it was called ' Parliament , ' it was called all this other stuff , but it never had a name . Teddy heard us playing it and he said , \" God , we should record that . \" I said , \" Really ? It 's just a jam song . \" I really did n't think it was any big deal . We got in the studio , laid the track down pretty much like we 'd played it live , the cool part being that it had the rhythm structure and had pickin ' over the top of it . More so than probably any of those songs that we did that involved those two styles . The words were written at the absolute last minute . I wrote them in the bathroom at Amigo Studios . Ted said , \" Write something about a train . \" I said , \" OK ! That 's a great idea \" ( laughs ) . So I went in -- I used to do that a lot , it 's just a great place to go get away from everything and if you had a singing idea , it had a great natural reverb in there , tile all over the walls . And you 'd just sit down and write , just come up with these ideas . And so I wrote the words right there , about Miss Lucy losin ' her family and all that kind of stuff . It just all kind of gelled in that one time and place , which is how a lot of creative things happen . You 've got the rhythm part , the ' chunka- chunka ' thing on electric . Then you 've got the combination with Pat playing that picking acoustic part over the top of it . ' Listen to the Music ' is similar ; Pat had a picking banjo part on it . How do you explain the longevity of ' Listen to the Music ' ? I can only give you what I think because I do n't really know . It gets played , number one . Number two , people can very easily sing along with it . And do . We can play that song anywhere , anyplace , any country , and people sing along with the chorus . Even if they do n't speak English , does n't matter . In the old days , you had to have a hook , which was \" Wo , wo , listen to the music , \" as simple as that sounds . And you had to have either a chord change or a groove or both that would grab people . The rhythm pattern was new at that time , not now obviously , but I think that 's one of the things that set it aside .

Their blend of rock and R&B produced a string of hits throughout the next decade . At age 40 , ' Listen to the Music ' remains a classic rock radio staple and the Doobies -- with founding members Tom Johnston and Patrick Simmons -- still maintain a busy tour schedule . Johnston , who wrote ' Listen to the Music , ' told Ultimate Classic Rock that the musicians around the San Francisco Bay Area helped mold the band 's sound . What was the influence of the Bay Area on your music in 1969 ? The music scene , by the time I got up to San Jose , was centered around the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane and to an extent Moby Grape and the other bands that had pretty much started to fade . Grateful Dead was still a force to be reckoned with , and still is for that matter , because they had such a huge cult following , but the other bands were on their way out . I played with a lot of guys who were in the Santa Cruz Mountains , a lot of jam sessions , and I also met Skip Spence from Moby Grape early on . Jammed with him quite a bit ; he was responsible for putting me together with John Hartman , who was the original drummer in the Doobie Brothers . He put us together because John had come out from Washington , DC looking for people for a Moby Grape reunion . Moby Grape had a cult following as well , and I was one of the cult . And so was John and so was Pat and so was Tiran [ Porter , Doobies ' bassist ] and so was everybody else I knew . What was the influence of the Grape on the Doobies ' music ? They had three - part harmonies , they had guys that were able to fingerpick , they had a driving drummer , they had all these facets that nobody else had . The songs were really good , well - crafted , well - thought - out songs . I love their lyrics , they 're incredible . They were n't just dumb-headed lyrics . Unfortunately they burned out really fast but in the small snippet of time they were around , they put out a couple of albums that were just phenomenal . The first one to me has yet to be equaled . I played the grooves off of that one . What are some of the songs where a listener can hear the Grape influence ? I would say ' Neal 's Fandango ' is one of them . That song jumps out at me right off the bat because that has a real Moby Grape flavor to it . What is your writing process ? Do you write the music first or the lyrics ? The music is always first for me . People that can write words first and then write music , they 're beyond me . I do n't know how they do it . I 've had ideas of a lyric but then I still have to go write the track and see how I can fit that lyric into it . How did you come up with the ' chunka- chunka ' strumming style ? It was just a way to drive a song . It was a way to have a drummer without a drummer being present . With that kind of strumming , you 're playing drums while you 're playing the rhythm part . I had my foot doin ' the kick drum , the snare drum was in the downbeat on the rhythm and then the rhythmical part was really a cross between all the influences of R&B players I 'd listened to for years . ' Listen to the Music . ' How did you come to write that ? The chord structure of it made me think of something positive , so the lyrics that came out of that were based on this utopian idea that if the leaders of the world got together on some grassy hill somewhere and either smoked enough dope or just sat down and just listened to the music and forgot about all this other bulls --- , the world would be a much better place . It was very utopian and very unrealistic ( laughs ) . It seemed like a good idea at the time . War was raging , the Cuban Missile Crisis , marches , there was a lot of stuff going on then . This was my way of saying , \" Really , come on guys , what if you just brought it down a couple of notches and just try to get along ? \" My version of Rodney King , I guess . The guitar riff that opens the song is immediately identifiable . Was that the first thing you wrote ? Yes it is , that strumming part that opens the song is just exactly how I wrote it . That is one song , probably the only song , that I did n't change at all once we got it in the studio . I had all the lyrics , I had all the chord changes . I called Ted [ Templeman , producer ] up at three in the morning , blazing away on guitar and said , \" You gotta hear this . This song is a hit . \" It 's the only one I 've ever been right about . That one I flat said , \" This is a single . \" What was Ted Templeman 's contribution as a producer ? Ted gave us tremendous ideas . He was a very creative producer . He had great drum ideas in particular ' cause he was a drummer but he would also come up with good singing ideas . The same thing with lyrics . Most of his stuff was about embellishing what was already there . He would say , what if we put , for example , strings on ' Dark Eyed Cajun Woman ' or ' Take Me in Your Arms , ' something like that . Or he took ' Black Water ' and had Novi [ Novog ] play that incredible viola part on that . Patrick comes in to sing the bridge on ' Listen to the Music . ' It was unusual for the time to have a second lead . That was Teddy 's idea . I think he wanted to change up . He wanted a difference because in the breakdown , you 've got the drums that go away from the regular rhythm of the song and so he said , \" What if you had Pat sing that part ? \" I said , \" OK , go , it 'll be great . \" We tried that and it worked really well . So these are the kinds of things that Ted was good for , helping make a song more than it was when he walked in the door . Do you remember where you were when you first heard it on the radio ? Yeah , I was in my Volkswagen , driving down the road in San Jose . And I remember pulling over and going , \" Jesus Christ , that 's us . \" It was a big deal at that time ' cause we 'd never had any hits , we had n't done anything . That was our first song that got notoriety . We followed that up with ' Rockin ' Down the Highway ' and ' Jesus Is Just Alright ' on that album . Next album we had ' China Grove ' and ' Long Train Runnin ' . ' It changed your life financially , I guess . Yeah , it changed your life financially , it also took your life away ( laughs ) . That 's when you entered the whole era of you gotta have a studio album every year and you could be on the road the rest of the time ( laughs ) . That 's the way everybody did it in those days , I mean , that was just the way it was . I 'd like to ask about two of the songs that followed . What went into writing ' China Grove ' ? I looked up China Grove , it 's not really a Chinatown . Not at all , no . All it has is an ice house and feed store ( laughs ) . It is exactly where it 's written about in the song , it 's right outside of San Antonio . As far as the whole Oriental cast to it , that was all based around a piano lick by Billy Payne . I still had n't written the lyrics at that point . We laid the track down , which was unusual back then . We had this great track and he came in and put all the keyboards on it . And when he did that , I went , \" Bingo ! Oh man , what if \u2026 \" and then I went off on this whole wackadoodle thing about sheriffs with a samurai sword . In ' 72 we were touring in Winnebagos . We did play in San Antonio so the highway going into San Antonio has a sign along there that says ' City of China Grove . ' I did n't remember seeing it but I think subconsciously I saw it and I think that 's where I got the title . ' Long Train Runnin ' . ' What was your inspiration for writing it ? See , I never thought of that song as being a single . That was a jam song for us . We played that song in late ' 70 , early ' 71 . And I would make up different words to it every night . And it was called ' Rosie Pig Moseley , ' it was called ' Parliament , ' it was called all this other stuff , but it never had a name . Teddy heard us playing it and he said , \" God , we should record that . \" I said , \" Really ? It 's just a jam song . \" I really did n't think it was any big deal . We got in the studio , laid the track down pretty much like we 'd played it live , the cool part being that it had the rhythm structure and had pickin ' over the top of it . More so than probably any of those songs that we did that involved those two styles . The words were written at the absolute last minute . I wrote them in the bathroom at Amigo Studios . Ted said , \" Write something about a train . \" I said , \" OK ! That 's a great idea \" ( laughs ) . So I went in -- I used to do that a lot , it 's just a great place to go get away from everything and if you had a singing idea , it had a great natural reverb in there , tile all over the walls . And you 'd just sit down and write , just come up with these ideas . And so I wrote the words right there , about Miss Lucy losin ' her family and all that kind of stuff . It just all kind of gelled in that one time and place , which is how a lot of creative things happen . You 've got the rhythm part , the ' chunka- chunka ' thing on electric . Then you 've got the combination with Pat playing that picking acoustic part over the top of it . ' Listen to the Music ' is similar ; Pat had a picking banjo part on it . How do you explain the longevity of ' Listen to the Music ' ? I can only give you what I think because I do n't really know . It gets played , number one . Number two , people can very easily sing along with it . And do . We can play that song anywhere , anyplace , any country , and people sing along with the chorus . Even if they do n't speak English , does n't matter . In the old days , you had to have a hook , which was \" Wo , wo , listen to the music , \" as simple as that sounds . And you had to have either a chord change or a groove or both that would grab people . The rhythm pattern was new at that time , not now obviously , but I think that 's one of the things that set it aside . In the era we 're livin ' in , there 's not a lot of positive things goin ' on , so I have to say that that 's probably one of the things too . Anything that 's positive , people gravitate to . It 's a feel good song . You can play it anywhere and people are gonna respond to it , ' cause it got all the sunshine . That 's the one that people all know .","annotations":[{"text":"the leaders of the world","span":[3507,3530],"token_span":[739,743],"role":"Ingestor","label":"Ingestor","role_definition":"The Ingestor ingests the Substance."},{"text":"dope","span":[3600,3603],"token_span":[755,755],"role":"Substance","label":"Substance","role_definition":"The Substance is the drug or other substance that is ingested by the Ingestor."},{"text":"some grassy hill somewhere","span":[3548,3573],"token_span":[747,750],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place where the Ingestor ingests the Substance."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-1500-248-frame-Ingest_substance","frame":"Ingest_substance","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"In this frame an Ingestor takes a Substance into his or her body.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":["Ingestion"],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"The mechanisms responsible for decreased absorption appear to be chelation and an increase in gastric pH. ...

J Postgrad Med 1987;33:117 The significance of food - drug interaction as a variable in bioavailability of drugs is now recognised . Food intake has been reported to increase the absorption of some drugs like sulphadimidine and griseofulvin while decreasing the absorption of others like penicillin and cephalexin . [ 6 ] Food may influence drug absorption as a result of many factors such as gastric emptying time , hepatic blood flow or physical and chemical interaction between particular food components and the drug molecules . Different constituents of food have also been shown to affect drug absorption in varying ways . [ 3 ] Tetracycline antibiotics are used for the treatment of a variety of infections . Doxycycline has the advantages of nearly complete absorption and long duration of action , and is therefore one of the most commonly used tetracyclines . As opposed to tetracycline , absorption of doxycycline is reported to be unaffected by food . [ 5 ] The present study was carried out to assess the effect of standard breakfast on doxycycline absorption . The study was carried out in six healthy male volunteers aged between 19 and 21 years , body weight ranging from 54 to 63 kg , selected on the basis of normal clinical and routine biochemical investigations . Written informed consent was obtained . After overnight fasting , the subjects were given two doxycycline capsules 100 mg each , either on empty stomach or after a standard breakfast , no food being permitted for 2 hours after it . The standard breakfast consisted of bread , butter and a commercially available milk drink ( instead of milk , for sake of uniformity ) ; ( K calories 508 , proteins 15 gm , carbohydrates 72.5 gm and fat 17.5 gm ) . The order of administration of drug , with food or after fasting , was randomised and the cross over was done after a washout period of 1 week . Blood samples were collected at 0 hour and at 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 hours after drug administration . Doxycycline content was estimated microbiologically [ 2 ] using test organism Bacillus cereus var mycoides ATCC 11778 . The sensitivity of the method is 0.5 \u00b5g / ml . Area under plasma time concentration curve , C-max , and T-max were the parameters used to assess the bioavailability of doxycycline . Results are summarised in [ Table 1 ] . Standard breakfast reduced the bioavailability of doxycycline as judged by AUC to and maximum concentration reached in plasma , although the rate of absorption as judged by time taken to reach maximum concentration was not affected . [ Fig. 1 ] gives doxycycline concentrations at different timings after drug administration . At 4 , 6 and 8 hours after drug administration doxycycline levels were significantly higher when the drug was given on an empty stomach as compared to when given with food . In the present study , standard breakfast was observed to reduce doxycycline absorption significantly . Absorption of tetracycline occurs in the stomach and the upper small intestine . Absorption of tetracyclines has been reported to be impaired by milk products , aluminum hydroxide gels , sodium bicarbonate , calcium and magnesium salts and iron preparations . The mechanisms responsible for decreased absorption appear to be chelation and an increase in gastric pH. [ 4 ] Doxycycline has been reported to have less binding with ions such as calcium . [ 5 ] Schach von Wittenau [ 5 ] noted that doxycycline levels 1 hour after drug administration were lower when the drug was given after full breakfast as compared to when it was given on an empty stomach , though this was not statistically significant . At 3 hours and 12 hours after dosing , there was no difference between levels achieved after administration of drug on an empty stomach or with food . In the present study , significant difference was observed in the plasma values determined 4 , 6 and 8 hours after drug administration , AUC and C-max being also significantly lower after administration of drug with food . The infrequent sampling viz . 1 , 2 and 12 hours after drug in the study by Schach von Wittenau [ 5 ] may be the reason for their missing the effect of food on doxycycline absorption . Doxycycline undergoes enterohepatic circulation . Lower levels after food could be because of reduced absorption or reduced enterohepatic cycling . In view of these results , it is advisable to instruct the patients to take doxycycline on an empty stomach .

The decision , which reverses the UK government 's previous position , came amid a legal battle over sodium thiopental manufactured in Europe . Mr Cable 's lawyers had told the High Court they could n't stop exports because the drug had legitimate uses . However , he changed that position after seeing evidence that the drug was only being exported for use on death row . Mr Cable said : \" In light of new information I have taken the decision to control the export of sodium thiopental . This move underlines this government 's and my own personal moral opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances without impacting legitimate trade . \" The Department for Business , Innovation and Skills said the order controlling exports of the drug would be made as soon as practicable . Once in force , any person exporting this drug will need a licence issued by the government 's Export Control Organisation . Sodium thiopental , an anaesthetic , is used in a massive dose to induce a coma in condemned prisoners , before two other drugs are used to kill them . But US prison authorities have been struggling to secure sufficient supplies and turned to Europe for further consignments . In October , the US state of Arizona revealed it had executed one of its death row inmates , Jeffrey Landrigan , after receiving a consignment of the drug from the UK . Reprieve , a legal charity which campaigns against death row , intervened after being contacted by lawyers for two death row inmates , Ralph Baze in Kentucky and Edmund Zagorski in Tennessee .

The decision , which reverses the UK government 's previous position , came amid a legal battle over sodium thiopental manufactured in Europe . Mr Cable 's lawyers had told the High Court they could n't stop exports because the drug had legitimate uses . However , he changed that position after seeing evidence that the drug was only being exported for use on death row . Mr Cable said : \" In light of new information I have taken the decision to control the export of sodium thiopental . This move underlines this government 's and my own personal moral opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances without impacting legitimate trade . \" The Department for Business , Innovation and Skills said the order controlling exports of the drug would be made as soon as practicable . Once in force , any person exporting this drug will need a licence issued by the government 's Export Control Organisation . Sodium thiopental , an anaesthetic , is used in a massive dose to induce a coma in condemned prisoners , before two other drugs are used to kill them . But US prison authorities have been struggling to secure sufficient supplies and turned to Europe for further consignments . In October , the US state of Arizona revealed it had executed one of its death row inmates , Jeffrey Landrigan , after receiving a consignment of the drug from the UK . Reprieve , a legal charity which campaigns against death row , intervened after being contacted by lawyers for two death row inmates , Ralph Baze in Kentucky and Edmund Zagorski in Tennessee . Mr Cable initially said he could not restrict exports - but lawyers from Leigh and Day , working with Reprieve , subsequently established that no European supplies to the US were being used in medicine - meaning that they were only going to death row . Furthermore , one of the manufacturers identified in the legal action said it did not oppose the government imposing export restrictions .

The second generation started in August in Quebec , but I suspect there is only time for one generation here in Alberta .

The females live only a few weeks but mature 30 - 70 eggs that they have available for sawing into the upper surface of the leaves of the loosestrife . The larvae will drop off the leaves if disturbed ( I can vouch for that ) and consume a tremendous amount of plant material ( I can also vouch for that ) \u2013 so much so that the loosestrife is mostly defoliated and many plants die . Or at least that is what was happening 40 - odd years ago \u2013 I wonder what is happening at Caousacouta Lake now ? Did the sawflies eat all the loosestrife and go locally extinct ? Was the hydroelectric company forced to stop flooding the lake \u2013 what would that do to the dynamics ? Has the loosestrife evolved resistance to the sawfly ? One wonders if this is n't an interesting historical entomology study waiting to happen . Setting aside my minimal angst at the decimation of my Creeping Jenny ( it was a free gift from Adrian , did far too well for the first couple of years , and now I do n't seem to need to worry about it becoming weedy ) , I do have a bit of worry about the sawfly 's ability to colonize native species .

They are n't very common , so perhaps they are relatively safe \u2013 unless someone starts a loosestrife farm nearby and the overflow of Creepy sawflies eats them out .

Now the senior doctor who revealed the scandal that exposes the dire state of NHS diagnostic services has been sacked . Radiologist Dr Otto Chan has spoken for the first time about the discovery that led to his dismissal . On two separate occasions , some 15,000 packets of films and scans were kept in corridors as the hospital had neither the manpower nor the money to analyse them all . It is estimated that only half of the films and scans were ever seen by a specialist meaning thousands of patients and their doctors will never know whether or not their images showed any signs of disease . At one stage in 2002 , the packages of films were locked away in a storeroom shortly before an official inspection visit . On other occasions , consultants would keep patients ' x-ray films in their car boots because they were so worried they would go missing . Each x-ray or scan should be read , or ' reported ' by a radiologist trained to detect early signs of illness and infection , under medical royal college guidelines . But at Chan 's hospital , Barts and the London NHS Trust , there was no computer system in place to count or record the images in question , so staff had no way of knowing how many images were stored or of cross -checking them with patients ' records . Dr Chan , 49 and a father of six , was suspended 18 months ago , and then dismissed last month - a decision he is now fighting . ' I believe I was sacked because I was marked out as a whistleblower and a troublemaker , and that 's because I refused to accept that thousand of films lying jumbled up in a corridor constituted good patient care , ' he said . He revealed to The Observer that from 2000 the number of films started to accumulate in the Royal London . ' At first it was just few packets from outpatients and inpatients but gradually they built up . By 2001 , it was 10,000 packets of film ( each packet contains up to eight images ) and by 2002 , it was up to 15,000 packets . They were stuffed into boxes and kept in the corridor . ' One day I turned up and they had all disappeared . I tracked them down to a storeroom which had been locked , and it transpired that the inspectors from the Commission for Health Improvement [ now the Healthcare commission ] were coming round on a visit . ' Managers at the time said that the move was taken to protect safety of patient records . These films were finally read at the end of 2002 after Chan demanded action , and threatened to go public with it .

Now the senior doctor who revealed the scandal that exposes the dire state of NHS diagnostic services has been sacked . Radiologist Dr Otto Chan has spoken for the first time about the discovery that led to his dismissal . On two separate occasions , some 15,000 packets of films and scans were kept in corridors as the hospital had neither the manpower nor the money to analyse them all . It is estimated that only half of the films and scans were ever seen by a specialist meaning thousands of patients and their doctors will never know whether or not their images showed any signs of disease . At one stage in 2002 , the packages of films were locked away in a storeroom shortly before an official inspection visit . On other occasions , consultants would keep patients ' x-ray films in their car boots because they were so worried they would go missing . Each x-ray or scan should be read , or ' reported ' by a radiologist trained to detect early signs of illness and infection , under medical royal college guidelines . But at Chan 's hospital , Barts and the London NHS Trust , there was no computer system in place to count or record the images in question , so staff had no way of knowing how many images were stored or of cross -checking them with patients ' records . Dr Chan , 49 and a father of six , was suspended 18 months ago , and then dismissed last month - a decision he is now fighting . ' I believe I was sacked because I was marked out as a whistleblower and a troublemaker , and that 's because I refused to accept that thousand of films lying jumbled up in a corridor constituted good patient care , ' he said . He revealed to The Observer that from 2000 the number of films started to accumulate in the Royal London . ' At first it was just few packets from outpatients and inpatients but gradually they built up . By 2001 , it was 10,000 packets of film ( each packet contains up to eight images ) and by 2002 , it was up to 15,000 packets . They were stuffed into boxes and kept in the corridor . ' One day I turned up and they had all disappeared . I tracked them down to a storeroom which had been locked , and it transpired that the inspectors from the Commission for Health Improvement [ now the Healthcare commission ] were coming round on a visit . ' Managers at the time said that the move was taken to protect safety of patient records . These films were finally read at the end of 2002 after Chan demanded action , and threatened to go public with it . But the hospital administration then allowed a second backlog of another 15,000 packets of film to build up between 2003 and 2004 . This time , there was no agreement to read all of them . Apart from chest X -rays the second pile of films was never checked by radiologists . The scandal may now be investigated by the Healthcare Commission , which looks at issues of patient safety .

Two died and twelve were hurt in the accident . Train accident takes two lives \u00ab After the accident , my daughter wept , looked me in the eye and said mommy I love you , \u00bb said Margit . \u00ab It was just terrible . The second birthday , one may say . One lady had glass fly into her head ... As the ambulance arrived , her heart rate was missing . \u00bb Anu Metsaorg of Raasiku Commune , the first policeman on the spot , was standing at the stay - away tape a couple of hours after the incident , feeling sorry that the barrier long talked about and promised has still not materialised . \u00ab We were sitting in the last car ( the fourth \u2013 edit ) with three kids , \u00bb said Margit . \u00ab A lady said she saw a truck coming at a high speed and she could not figure out who 'd be first \u2013 we or the truck . She was hoping that the truck would make it , but it did not . It smacked the train into the side , \u00bb related the lady . The Tallinn - Tartu passenger train in question departed Balti Jaam Station at 2.55 pm . At 3.19 pm , at the Raasiku crossing , a dumper truck coming at about 70 kilometres an hour ( 43.5 mph ) hit its third wagon and , swung by the impact , tore off part of the fourth . The two wagons that were hit came off the rails , skidding along for a couple of hundred metres . In the third wagon , the one hit by the truck , a lady 43 years of age was killed , having been sitting at the spot of the impact . 12 people were injured . Of these , seven were hospitalised , five were in need of first aid . Swift rescue The truck was thrown into the ditch by the railway , breaking off a large post that stood on its way . Whatever was left of the driver ( 59 ) who had probably been carrying gravel or sand around the Raasiku area , was cut out of the driving cabin three hours after the wreck . Margit , the lady on the train , continued : \u00ab We were lucky to be sitting higher up ( in the two - level train \u2013 edit ) . I bought first class tickets , you see . Had we been sitting down lower , we 'd be seriously hurt I guess . There were relatively few passengers at the back part of the train . We had glass cast all over us , my whole head is full of broken glass . All the glasses broke and everything was flying around inside the train . It happened so suddenly . I had my whole life pass before mine eyes . \u00bb \u00ab There was such a bang that I run upstairs to see if something happened with my wife . Then , we looked out the window and I saw this cloud of dust over the railway crossing , \u00bb described J\u00fcri Muru , a man living in the house closest to the crossing , some 300 metres away . \u00ab The first bang was followed by several others , \u00bb added the man . Beholding the remains of the truck and the damage done to the train , he could picture how the follow - up banks came about , the truck hitting the train twice and then mowing down the post . \u00ab In a couple of minutes , the local police was there ; then those from further away ; then came the ambulance , the rescuers , \u00bb he recalled . In addition to railway workers nearby , Mr Muru was among the first to arrive at the scene . \u00ab By then , many had exited the train and were standing nearby . Some who were the fastest had come all the way to the crossing , \u00bb said the man . \u00ab Lorries come all day long \u2013 carrying gravel and sand . Probably , this was a driver that was daily around here , working , \u00bb said Mr Muru . From his home window , he sees how many a truck driver never slows down approaching the railway \u2013 from one side , the speed limit id 70 km/h , and 90 km/h ( 56 mph ) from the other . \u00ab At the time of the impact , the driver had the sun behind his back , so he could n't have been blinded by it , \u00bb the man muttered , thinking aloud . According to Margit , the men on the train were kind and helpful . \u00ab They helped those who were hurt and assisted people getting out of the train . There was smoke and dust everywhere . They helped to get the [ personal ] things out . Quite fast , the rescue board and ambulance arrived . To my surprise , frankly . In ten minutes they were there . \u00bb Train no more Margit does not take a train daily . \u00ab They always say the wagon at the back is the safest . I was saved thanks to having paid two -three euros extra , taking the train this one time a year , so were in the first class . Had we been down there , maybe we would not be alive , \u00bb said Margit , convinced she 'd be never riding a train again . \u00ab The Raasiku crossing safety has been up for a long time . Since the last year 's tragic accident with the passenger car here , where a woman was killed , we gathered an entire round - table with the Raasiku commune mayor who was then in the office \u2013 representative of police , rescue board , Estonian Railways , commune government , and neighbourhood watch \u2013 in order to clarify the danger spots and prevent accidents , \u00bb said the local policewoman Anu Metsaorg . \u00ab At long last , two crossings in Raasiku Commune have barriers , but Raasiku still has n't \u2013 even though the talk was that by the end of this winter Estonian Railways would have it installed , \u00bb said she . Also , people had told the policewoman , that there had been problems at the crossing at mid-day , the day before \u2013 with warning lights , which were not on . Following the accident , the lights were on . Allegedly , they we also on at the time of the accident . The policewoman admitted that the barriers may not help avoid an accident . \u00ab I have seen a father driving , with a child at his side , doing slalom between the barriers across the railway , \u00bb said Ms Metsaorg , grieved at the carelessness . According to Estonian Railways director-general Ahti Asmann , a barrier for Raasiku is surely coming \u2013 as was decided when analysing the accident of last August \u2013 but he said things are n't built that fast . \u00ab In March we started coordinating the project design criteria , then comes project design work , then construction . And , by August , the Raasiku crossing ought to have the barriers , \u00bb promised Mr Asmann . He also explained that all the crossings have had their risks assessed , the requirements fixed . \u00ab Even in its current form , the Raasiku crossing corresponds to requirements . But , guided by advice given last year , we will install a barrier , \u00bb said Mr Asmann . According to Mr Asmann , all crossings do not need a barrier , and to build these everywhere would be very costly . \u00ab Between Tallinn and Tartu , there is a crossing at every 4.5 kilometres , on average , \u00bb said he . Elron CEO Andrus Ossip stood sadly by the wrecked train , watching rescuers at work . \u00ab The train driver was the same who was the first one to drive the new electric train , in July 1st last year , \u00bb said he . \u00ab The train driver said , after the accident : before the crossing , there are the signs , warnings , large ads saying a train might come ; people need to realise that railways are dangerous , \u00bb said the CEO , relating the message by train driver .

Two died and twelve were hurt in the accident . Train accident takes two lives \u00ab After the accident , my daughter wept , looked me in the eye and said mommy I love you , \u00bb said Margit . \u00ab It was just terrible . The second birthday , one may say . One lady had glass fly into her head ... As the ambulance arrived , her heart rate was missing . \u00bb Anu Metsaorg of Raasiku Commune , the first policeman on the spot , was standing at the stay - away tape a couple of hours after the incident , feeling sorry that the barrier long talked about and promised has still not materialised . \u00ab We were sitting in the last car ( the fourth \u2013 edit ) with three kids , \u00bb said Margit . \u00ab A lady said she saw a truck coming at a high speed and she could not figure out who 'd be first \u2013 we or the truck . She was hoping that the truck would make it , but it did not . It smacked the train into the side , \u00bb related the lady . The Tallinn - Tartu passenger train in question departed Balti Jaam Station at 2.55 pm . At 3.19 pm , at the Raasiku crossing , a dumper truck coming at about 70 kilometres an hour ( 43.5 mph ) hit its third wagon and , swung by the impact , tore off part of the fourth . The two wagons that were hit came off the rails , skidding along for a couple of hundred metres . In the third wagon , the one hit by the truck , a lady 43 years of age was killed , having been sitting at the spot of the impact . 12 people were injured . Of these , seven were hospitalised , five were in need of first aid . Swift rescue The truck was thrown into the ditch by the railway , breaking off a large post that stood on its way . Whatever was left of the driver ( 59 ) who had probably been carrying gravel or sand around the Raasiku area , was cut out of the driving cabin three hours after the wreck . Margit , the lady on the train , continued : \u00ab We were lucky to be sitting higher up ( in the two - level train \u2013 edit ) . I bought first class tickets , you see . Had we been sitting down lower , we 'd be seriously hurt I guess . There were relatively few passengers at the back part of the train . We had glass cast all over us , my whole head is full of broken glass . All the glasses broke and everything was flying around inside the train . It happened so suddenly . I had my whole life pass before mine eyes . \u00bb \u00ab There was such a bang that I run upstairs to see if something happened with my wife . Then , we looked out the window and I saw this cloud of dust over the railway crossing , \u00bb described J\u00fcri Muru , a man living in the house closest to the crossing , some 300 metres away . \u00ab The first bang was followed by several others , \u00bb added the man . Beholding the remains of the truck and the damage done to the train , he could picture how the follow - up banks came about , the truck hitting the train twice and then mowing down the post . \u00ab In a couple of minutes , the local police was there ; then those from further away ; then came the ambulance , the rescuers , \u00bb he recalled . In addition to railway workers nearby , Mr Muru was among the first to arrive at the scene . \u00ab By then , many had exited the train and were standing nearby . Some who were the fastest had come all the way to the crossing , \u00bb said the man . \u00ab Lorries come all day long \u2013 carrying gravel and sand . Probably , this was a driver that was daily around here , working , \u00bb said Mr Muru . From his home window , he sees how many a truck driver never slows down approaching the railway \u2013 from one side , the speed limit id 70 km/h , and 90 km/h ( 56 mph ) from the other . \u00ab At the time of the impact , the driver had the sun behind his back , so he could n't have been blinded by it , \u00bb the man muttered , thinking aloud . According to Margit , the men on the train were kind and helpful . \u00ab They helped those who were hurt and assisted people getting out of the train . There was smoke and dust everywhere . They helped to get the [ personal ] things out . Quite fast , the rescue board and ambulance arrived . To my surprise , frankly . In ten minutes they were there . \u00bb Train no more Margit does not take a train daily . \u00ab They always say the wagon at the back is the safest . I was saved thanks to having paid two -three euros extra , taking the train this one time a year , so were in the first class . Had we been down there , maybe we would not be alive , \u00bb said Margit , convinced she 'd be never riding a train again . \u00ab The Raasiku crossing safety has been up for a long time . Since the last year 's tragic accident with the passenger car here , where a woman was killed , we gathered an entire round - table with the Raasiku commune mayor who was then in the office \u2013 representative of police , rescue board , Estonian Railways , commune government , and neighbourhood watch \u2013 in order to clarify the danger spots and prevent accidents , \u00bb said the local policewoman Anu Metsaorg . \u00ab At long last , two crossings in Raasiku Commune have barriers , but Raasiku still has n't \u2013 even though the talk was that by the end of this winter Estonian Railways would have it installed , \u00bb said she . Also , people had told the policewoman , that there had been problems at the crossing at mid-day , the day before \u2013 with warning lights , which were not on . Following the accident , the lights were on . Allegedly , they we also on at the time of the accident . The policewoman admitted that the barriers may not help avoid an accident . \u00ab I have seen a father driving , with a child at his side , doing slalom between the barriers across the railway , \u00bb said Ms Metsaorg , grieved at the carelessness . According to Estonian Railways director-general Ahti Asmann , a barrier for Raasiku is surely coming \u2013 as was decided when analysing the accident of last August \u2013 but he said things are n't built that fast . \u00ab In March we started coordinating the project design criteria , then comes project design work , then construction . And , by August , the Raasiku crossing ought to have the barriers , \u00bb promised Mr Asmann . He also explained that all the crossings have had their risks assessed , the requirements fixed . \u00ab Even in its current form , the Raasiku crossing corresponds to requirements . But , guided by advice given last year , we will install a barrier , \u00bb said Mr Asmann . According to Mr Asmann , all crossings do not need a barrier , and to build these everywhere would be very costly . \u00ab Between Tallinn and Tartu , there is a crossing at every 4.5 kilometres , on average , \u00bb said he . Elron CEO Andrus Ossip stood sadly by the wrecked train , watching rescuers at work . \u00ab The train driver was the same who was the first one to drive the new electric train , in July 1st last year , \u00bb said he . \u00ab The train driver said , after the accident : before the crossing , there are the signs , warnings , large ads saying a train might come ; people need to realise that railways are dangerous , \u00bb said the CEO , relating the message by train driver .

This dynamic has affected the quality of life in the historic centre , forcing the residents to move to the mainland due to the increase in housing price and lack of services , replaced by tourism- related activities . | | Project Status || In operation | | Conflict outcome / response : || Court decision ( failure for environmental justice ) | Negotiated alternative solution New legislation Repression Strengthening of participation New Environmental Impact Assessment / Study | Proposal and development of alternatives : || The Comitato Grandi Navi has supported the idea of a Tourist off - shore port at harbour entrance of Lido - San Nicol\u00f2 . There are several project with this vision , presented respectively by : De Piccoli [ 18 ] , that is the project supported by the \u201c Comitato NO Grandi Navi \u201d , because in line with the principle of reversibility contained in the law no . 171/1973 ; Vittadini , Boato , Giacomini [ 19 ] ; Caut . The off - shore port project would allow both not to dig new canals into the lagoon , preserving the environmental balance , and avoiding that the ships traffic could be limited by the closure of the MOSE system . The off - shore port would be connected with the city and the Marittima terminal through small / medium size boats . | Other alternative projects have been presented by other actors , both from the central government and local bodies . - Contorta Sant ' Angelo canal project , presented by the Port Authority , has been subjected to an Environmental Impact Assessment ( EIA ) from August 2014 . It provides the excavation of a new canal with a width of 180 m and a depth of 10.5 m . The project also includes the implementation of environmental mitigation measures for the protection of the lagoon beds [ 17 ] . This project present risks concerning the modification of the current 's speed within the lagoon and the erosion of lagoon beds . - \u201c Tangential lagoon project \u201d , proposed by Enrico Zanetti and then developed by the Venice Passenger Terminal ( VPT ) which presented a preliminary project called \u201c Canale Grande Capacit\u00e0 Sud Giudecca \u201d [ 20 ] , provides the transit of the big ships in the rear of the Giudecca island trough a new canal with a width of 160 m , depth of 10.5 m and a length of about 2 km . In this case there would be the same impacts , on environment and on architectural heritage , caused by thecurrent route in Giudecca canal . - New touristic terminal at Marghera , presented by the study of Arch . D'Agostino and supported even by the City Council of Venice , involves the construction of a new tourist port near the VEGA building , exploiting the disused industrial areas [ 21 ] . With this project the risks is both to overlap the cruise ship traffic with the commercial traffic , and to modify the hydro-morphological balance of the lagoon . | Do you consider this an environmental justice success ? Was environmental justice served ?:|| Not Sure | | Briefly explain : || Since many years the Comitato NO Grandi Navi and the environmental venetian associations are fighting against the route of the cruise ships into the Venetian Lagoon , denouncing the evident contrast between the transit of the big ships with the preservation law for the lagoon and historic centre of Venice . | The first objective of the protest has not yet been achieved but the demonstrations put in place by the Comitato and local associations have achieved significant results . For first is the increased level of awareness of citizens and environmental groups on the environmental impacts caused by cruise ships . Further , over the years , the participation in the mobilizations has increased and consequently also the ability to put pressure on local , national and European institutions through demonstrations , popular petitions and appeals to the European Commision and T.A.R. ( Regional Administrative Court ) . In 2012 , the Comitato was able to push through several observations into the P.A.T. of Venice ( Art. 35 bis ) , which should push the city council to seek new design alternative solutions that respect the principles of the lagoon protection . Finally , with regard to the chosen project ( Contorta S'Angelo canal ) by the Comitatone as a solution to the transit of the cruise ships into the venetian lagoon , its implementation or not , will pass through the T.A.R. of Veneto Region appeals presented both by the City of Venice and Comitato NO Grandi Navi whose , for different reasons , consider this alternative illegitimate . | Juridical relevant texts related to the conflict ( laws , legislations , EIAs , etc ) | | References to published books , academic articles , movies or published documentaries | | Contributor : || Stefano Quaglia , [ email protected ] - CDCA | | Last update | | 18/08/2019 | | Conflict ID : ||1673 |","annotations":[{"text":"cruise ships","span":[6137,6148],"token_span":[1055,1056],"role":"Self_mover","label":"Self_mover","role_definition":"This is a sentient being or a vehicle steered by a sentient being which moves."},{"text":"into the Venetian lagoon","span":[6161,6184],"token_span":[1058,1061],"role":"Goal","label":"Goal","role_definition":"Any expression which indicates where the Self_mover ends up as a result of the motion expresses the frame element Goal."},{"text":"the Venetian lagoon","span":[6166,6184],"token_span":[1059,1061],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place is where the motion (which is specified by a Source, Path or Goal) is located."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"Negative effects to the environment such as air pollution , loss of landscape , surface water pollution , erosion , and decreasing water quality have occurred due to the emission and impacts of cruise ships transiting into the Venetian Lagoon .","annotations":[{"text":"cruise ships","span":[194,205],"token_span":[33,34],"role":"Self_mover","label":"Self_mover","role_definition":"This is a sentient being or a vehicle steered by a sentient being which moves."},{"text":"into the Venetian Lagoon","span":[218,241],"token_span":[36,39],"role":"Goal","label":"Goal","role_definition":"Any expression which indicates where the Self_mover ends up as a result of the motion expresses the frame element Goal."}],"trigger":{"text":"transiting","start_char":207,"end_char":216,"start_token":35,"end_token":35,"frame":"Intentional_traversing"}},"source":{"text":"This case form has been translated for your convenience by voluntary translators .

The ARPAV report estimate that the ship emissions are the 8 % of the total PM2.5 emission and the 6 % of the PM10 total emission in the city of Venice . | Health Impacts || Potential : Accidents , Other environmental related diseases | | Other Health impacts || Other impacts for the health of citizens and cruise ship passengers , is the risk of crashes or malfunction of the big ships ; this danger is amplified when cruise ships transiting into the Venetian lagoon , given their size and the proximity of the waterways to the historic centre of Venice and Lido . | The risk is to assist again to incidents as that of Costa Concordia , wrecked at Giglio Island in 2012 , or that of the Jolly Black , which has felled the pilot tower in the port of Genoa in 2013 [ 16 ] . | Socio-economical Impacts || Visible : Loss of landscape / sense of place | Potential : Loss of traditional knowledge / practices / cultures | Other socio-economic impacts || The influx of tourist through the big ships strengthens the mass-tourism model that for decades has characterizes Venice . This dynamic has affected the quality of life in the historic centre , forcing the residents to move to the mainland due to the increase in housing price and lack of services , replaced by tourism- related activities . | | Project Status || In operation | | Conflict outcome / response : || Court decision ( failure for environmental justice ) | Negotiated alternative solution New legislation Repression Strengthening of participation New Environmental Impact Assessment / Study | Proposal and development of alternatives : || The Comitato Grandi Navi has supported the idea of a Tourist off - shore port at harbour entrance of Lido - San Nicol\u00f2 . There are several project with this vision , presented respectively by : De Piccoli [ 18 ] , that is the project supported by the \u201c Comitato NO Grandi Navi \u201d , because in line with the principle of reversibility contained in the law no . 171/1973 ; Vittadini , Boato , Giacomini [ 19 ] ; Caut . The off - shore port project would allow both not to dig new canals into the lagoon , preserving the environmental balance , and avoiding that the ships traffic could be limited by the closure of the MOSE system . The off - shore port would be connected with the city and the Marittima terminal through small / medium size boats . | Other alternative projects have been presented by other actors , both from the central government and local bodies . - Contorta Sant ' Angelo canal project , presented by the Port Authority , has been subjected to an Environmental Impact Assessment ( EIA ) from August 2014 . It provides the excavation of a new canal with a width of 180 m and a depth of 10.5 m . The project also includes the implementation of environmental mitigation measures for the protection of the lagoon beds [ 17 ] . This project present risks concerning the modification of the current 's speed within the lagoon and the erosion of lagoon beds . - \u201c Tangential lagoon project \u201d , proposed by Enrico Zanetti and then developed by the Venice Passenger Terminal ( VPT ) which presented a preliminary project called \u201c Canale Grande Capacit\u00e0 Sud Giudecca \u201d [ 20 ] , provides the transit of the big ships in the rear of the Giudecca island trough a new canal with a width of 160 m , depth of 10.5 m and a length of about 2 km . In this case there would be the same impacts , on environment and on architectural heritage , caused by thecurrent route in Giudecca canal . - New touristic terminal at Marghera , presented by the study of Arch . D'Agostino and supported even by the City Council of Venice , involves the construction of a new tourist port near the VEGA building , exploiting the disused industrial areas [ 21 ] . With this project the risks is both to overlap the cruise ship traffic with the commercial traffic , and to modify the hydro-morphological balance of the lagoon . | Do you consider this an environmental justice success ? Was environmental justice served ?:|| Not Sure | | Briefly explain : || Since many years the Comitato NO Grandi Navi and the environmental venetian associations are fighting against the route of the cruise ships into the Venetian Lagoon , denouncing the evident contrast between the transit of the big ships with the preservation law for the lagoon and historic centre of Venice . | The first objective of the protest has not yet been achieved but the demonstrations put in place by the Comitato and local associations have achieved significant results . For first is the increased level of awareness of citizens and environmental groups on the environmental impacts caused by cruise ships . Further , over the years , the participation in the mobilizations has increased and consequently also the ability to put pressure on local , national and European institutions through demonstrations , popular petitions and appeals to the European Commision and T.A.R. ( Regional Administrative Court ) . In 2012 , the Comitato was able to push through several observations into the P.A.T. of Venice ( Art. 35 bis ) , which should push the city council to seek new design alternative solutions that respect the principles of the lagoon protection . Finally , with regard to the chosen project ( Contorta S'Angelo canal ) by the Comitatone as a solution to the transit of the cruise ships into the venetian lagoon , its implementation or not , will pass through the T.A.R. of Veneto Region appeals presented both by the City of Venice and Comitato NO Grandi Navi whose , for different reasons , consider this alternative illegitimate . | Juridical relevant texts related to the conflict ( laws , legislations , EIAs , etc ) | | References to published books , academic articles , movies or published documentaries | | Contributor : || Stefano Quaglia , [ email protected ] - CDCA | | Last update | | 18/08/2019 | | Conflict ID : ||1673 |","annotations":[{"text":"cruise ships","span":[6137,6148],"token_span":[1055,1056],"role":"Self_mover","label":"Self_mover","role_definition":"This is a sentient being or a vehicle steered by a sentient being which moves."},{"text":"into the Venetian lagoon","span":[6161,6184],"token_span":[1058,1061],"role":"Goal","label":"Goal","role_definition":"Any expression which indicates where the Self_mover ends up as a result of the motion expresses the frame element Goal."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-1252-2-frame-Intentional_traversing","frame":"Intentional_traversing","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Self_mover intentionally moves in a Directionon a Path relative to landmark that is neither the Source nor the Goal of the overall motion.","frame_ancestors":["Self_motion","Intentionally_act","Event","Motion","Traversing"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Access A hiking trail follows the canyon and creek .

The closest camping spots are at Gold Bluffs Beach in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park . They are only open during the summer , usually from Memorial to Labor Day and are always first- come-first-serve . The next closest and within the same park is at Elk Prairie campground , which is open year round . During the summer it is on reservation and the rest of the year it is first - come-first-serve . http://redwoods.info/showrecord.asp?id=1723 Can anyone tell me if this is a pet-friendly trail ? I 'm heading up that way in a couple of weeks and would love to know . It says that no dogs are allowed on the trails State parks usually do not allow dogs in them . The dogs tend to disrupt the wild life . Maybe not the little ones , but that 's the rule . Some dog owners do n't get keeping their dogs on a leash . I would love to hike and see fern canyon . I plan on camping with my dog though . Is there any trails that are dog friendly ? If not , how far from the day parking is the walls of fern ? This is on my bucket list and I dislike the fact that I ca n't bring my hiking buddy with me . This would of been nice to see This area is known for being anti dog areas . Mountain lions and bobcat in the area have been known to track and attack dogs . No trains in the area . Dogs are not allowed period ! The reason most hiking trails are sterile is because they allow dogs on them . Dog owners think they are unique ( among the other 200 people a day who want their dog to play ) and let their dog off leash , Dogs are dogs , if they see anything move they want to play with it , sniff it , lick it , bite it and \u2026 eat it ! This trail is unique because dogs have n't impacted it . In today 's world nature has a hard time surviving . Let 's give her a break and close more trails to dogs . Trails could actually recover . I agree on the dog ban . The writer is correct - dogs are allowed to run free to the dismay of the rest of us . You ca n't take your dog everywhere , get it ? By your logic , close it to humans including children . Humans are the ultimate problems . Grafiti , carving , gathering . I do n't know what type of dogs you run into or meet , but as a Nature Enthusiast , my dog does n't have prey drive ( which means he does NOT run off chasing animals , trying to eat or lick things ) and he enjoys our many hikes . We pick up after him and he 's ALWAYS on leash . However , not every HUMAN dog owner is respectable like some of us . Many trails are closed off for restoration is generally due to HUMANS stomping around trying to make their own paths and not respecting nature and leaving their trash behind . Let 's be real and not blame animals for human doings . Right . And the humans who left wooden planks all over the trail so hikers like you would n't have to cry about getting your feet wet do n't make any kind of impact . Just what I want to see when I 'm out hiking in an otherwise beautiful place like this is constant reminders of human impact around every corner . [ \u2026 ] Fern Canyon Trail [ \u2026 ] Does anyone have the correct phone number to Fern Canyon park ? The one I 'm dialing \u2013 707-465-7354 \u2013 is not working . I was trying to check and see if it was too rainy / flooded to enter the park by car . What is the weather like in December ? Ok for camping ? We 're planning a Christmas week trip and thought this might be fun . Thanks for your help . Likely quite cool and rainy ! Does this park have the train ride ? No trains in the area . - [ \u2026 ] Fern Canyon Trail [ \u2026 ] What 's the weather like end of September and what 's the best place to stay nearby ? I came to this place to check it out on April 12 . It rained a lot and walking the stream upward to the canyon required rain boots which I did not have so I could not check out the fern canyon and I was so close too . I should have just ford the river but time was also a factor as well as we were there around 6 pm ; it was my bad on my part there . But the biggest concern is driving there . Someone needs to cover up the many , MANY potholes on this road as me and others driving there was afraid of damaging something under my car and made getting there SO slow and my brakes constantly being used with all the stop and go . Someone also needs to put a bridge of some sort on the stream that appears on the road up to fern canyon . My car is a RAV4 so it 's raised higher but does not have 4WD . The lack of understanding for those of us who have \u201c man 's best friend , \u201d is deplorable . The meaning of responsibility and environmental impact is n't lost on the choir , but on those pointing fingers ignorant of their own actions . Thank you for ruining it for those of us paying attention . Last time I was there it was wall - to - wall people , many families with small children , people walking with boomboxes blaring , a massive traffic jam in the parking lot . Not exactly the experience promised by the photos . More like a ferny Disneyland . the fern canyon beautiful . the comments some negative . I like to know how to get from La to the canyon is there any other way to get there beside driven ? [ \u2026 ] Gold Bluffs Beach Road , Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park , Orick , CA 95555 .

Someone needs to cover up the many , MANY potholes on this road as me and others driving there was afraid of damaging something under my car and made getting there SO slow and my brakes constantly being used with all the stop and go . Someone also needs to put a bridge of some sort on the stream that appears on the road up to fern canyon . My car is a RAV4 so it 's raised higher but does not have 4WD . The lack of understanding for those of us who have \u201c man 's best friend , \u201d is deplorable . The meaning of responsibility and environmental impact is n't lost on the choir , but on those pointing fingers ignorant of their own actions . Thank you for ruining it for those of us paying attention . Last time I was there it was wall - to - wall people , many families with small children , people walking with boomboxes blaring , a massive traffic jam in the parking lot . Not exactly the experience promised by the photos . More like a ferny Disneyland . the fern canyon beautiful . the comments some negative . I like to know how to get from La to the canyon is there any other way to get there beside driven ? [ \u2026 ] Gold Bluffs Beach Road , Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park , Orick , CA 95555 .

Photo courtesy Jeju Olle | Take an ex-journalist decompressing from a frenzied 23 - year career in Seoul and a chance encounter on a pilgrimage in Spain in 2006 . A year later and back on Jeju Island , the concept of \u201c slowing down \u201d and experiencing nature is not only embraced by Korean tourists , but has made walking a hugely popular tourism activity on the island . The founder of Jeju Olle , Suh Myung Sook , is as surprised as anyone at the number of people now walking the trails . \u201c Two became five , five became 10 , and 10 to a couple hundred thousand , \u201d she said in a recent interview with The Jeju Weekly . Taking a break on Olle trail 14 - 1 , in a shaded garden behind the O'sulloc Green Tea Museum on the west of the island , the veteran reporter said her primary hope is that people appreciate the benefits of slowing down , enjoying nature close up and interacting with fellow travelers and locals in a more humane way . \u201c Koreans as a people lead an extremely hectic and pushy lifestyle . They rush everything in their daily lives , \u201d she said . While everyone strives to be successful , Suh believes modern day Koreans have a particularly insatiable drive due to their relatively fresh memories of extreme poverty during and after the Korean War . \u201c They 've forgotten how to relax and handle obstacles in their lives . They get overly frustrated and confused upon facing even minor failures . This is reflected in the rising suicide rate , \u201d she explained . To escape from this lack of communication and interpersonal interaction , Suh says people come to Jeju Olle \u201c and explore an entirely new paradigm of vacationing . \u201d The word ' olle , ' which refers to the narrow paths that snake along the squat , black volcanic stone walls of the island , has become synonymous with visiting Jeju . Since the first course opened in September 2007 , Olle 's popularity has exploded here . While the decentralized nature of the trails means exact numbers are difficult to estimate , both mainland tourists and islanders alike come and go on the trails , some for a few hours , some for weeks ; some even in large corporate outings designed to build team spirit . Of the 22 trails currently open or planned , five or six receive the brunt of an estimated 500,000 walkers a year . Some walkers register at the start and finish of a trail , similar to pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago route from southern France to northern Spain , collecting official stamps in their trail booklets . The 357 kilometers of trails now span about three - quarters of the island . In keeping with the environmental message and human scale of the Olle ethos , trails are built and maintained by volunteers who use only their physical labor and not large machines . They vary from a short start - to - finish 4 to 5 - hour walk totalling 15 to 17 kilometers , to trails that require days of trekking to complete . A wide variety of scenery and trail selections make Jeju Olle accessible to a large demographic . However , when asked about handicapped accessible routes , Suh said they have yet to finalize a plan for how to proceed , explaining that since the routes are only marked and modified using human power , the large - scale upgrades required for handicap - accessible trails might run counter to the Olle philosophy . It was on the 800 - kilometer pilgrimage of El Camino de Santiago , in autumn 2006 , that Suh , who 'd recently finished a year - and - a- half as editor - in -chief of the online citizen journalism site OhmyNews , struck up conversations with other trekkers along the famous Spanish trek . Her conversations , including with author Paulo Coelho who was filming a documentary about the Camino , encouraged her to set up a similar system of trails back home . Despite having to battle entrenched official criticism on her return to Jeju Island , she \u201c took the initiative , \u201d enlisting the help of her brother , and marking existing pedestrian - only lanes . They then restored these old paths to create new trails for hikers to explore . An estimated 3,000 people hiked Olle trails that first year . Ten times that number in the second , with similar growth in subsequent years . Initially , however , the lifeblood of Jeju Island \u2013 tourism \u2013 was not to be toyed with . Suh spoke of the disappointment and \u201c energy - sapping \u201d resistance she received from all sides . \u201c First off , several local government officers were against me because of the already declining tourism industry in Jeju . It was a time when tourism here essentially involved the automobile . They said , ' Tourists are already inclined to think that Jeju is an expensive and unfriendly retreat even though you could conveniently see the island in a couple days with a car . They now prefer foreign and exotic locations to Jeju . ' \u201d Suh recounted how opponents to Olle trails were skeptical that anyone would come to Jeju \u201c to voluntarily experience the discomfort and the physical demands of walking . \u201d They believed the key to attracting tourists back to the island was \u201c by building more landmark buildings , casinos , and cable cars , as if this was a replica of a foreign country . \u201d \u201c Pedestrianism is for foreigners , and Koreans are not ready to walk . Koreans like to see sights , \u201d Suh heard time and time again . She was also told that \u201c ... the villagers were complaining that the land was private property and they were not going to let people trespass . \u201d But as time went on , and the tourist- friendly and environmental message of the trails began to spread , locals and mainlanders both began to warm to the idea . Suh said she 's confident islanders recognize that Olle Trails will benefit them more than those \u201c mammoth tours , \u201d by which she means the travel agencies , resort complexes and golf courses . \u201c The Ollers walk , and therefore they do n't carry around stuff they bought ... They drink local water , eat at local restaurants , and stay at local accommodations . The drivers come and look around the city for a couple days and the golfers play for a day before they leave . Yet , Ollers need to stay here for three or four days at least ; it could be one or two weeks or even up to a month . \u201d \u201c So in the long run , visitors of Olle would be spending more money here \u2014 the longer the stay , the more the consumption . But what is more important is that the money is not being poured into some \u201c mammoth \u201d corporate chain stores . It 's being distributed to the local economy and individuals . \u201d Many see Jeju Olle as unique in its small - scale , yet enticing , scenery . Suh is a believer . | || || | |\u00a1\u00e3 Photo by Daniel Kojetin | \u201c Trails overseas , like the ones in Switzerland and New Zealand , are surrounded by dramatic and grand - scaled nature that is defined by its height and width ; it is ' mammoth , ' \u201d she explained . For Jeju \u201c the beauty of the landscape of each trail [ is ] on a human scale , be it the oreum [ lateral volcanos ] , gotjawal [ a forest unique to Jeju ] , the villages and the sea . \u201d \u201c The nature here is subtle and exquisite ... Above all , it is feminine ... I hope that people can appreciate the femininity of nature . One should not expect to see the tallest , the broadest , or the grandest ; but to see the natural details assemble into a beautiful ensemble , \u201d she added . Olle has affected Suh personally and positively in more ways than one . \u201c Us journalists , we are not a bunch that believes in miracles . We 're dry and fact - centered rather than believing and full of faith ; we operate on the grounds of facts and certainty , \u201d she said . \u201c Although I started out [ being ] fond of trails and Jeju , I thought that only a few people would be with me . I would have never guessed that so many people would come together and witness such miracles that are still ongoing . \u201d Being a famous face on the island and spending much of her time on the trails herself , fellow hikers have shared a large number of inspiring personal stories with her . Suh recounted one case where a 29 - year - old woman who was diagnosed with cancer and recently separated from her boyfriend came to Jeju Island to enjoy nature one last time and then throw herself off a cliff . But after walking the Olle trails and contemplating her situation \u2013 free from the hectic pace of the big city \u2013 she came to realize what a precious gift life is . She returned to her guest house , confessed everything to the owner and returned to Seoul to start chemotherapy and a new lease on life . \u201c She was thankful of everything that was beautiful : To feel the nature , the wind , and the sea ... Someone who bailed out on life have came back to love it ! \u201d Suh said . Now that Jeju Olle has become a mainstream tourism option , Suh is looking to international markets for yet more visitors . The International Olle Festival will be held Nov. 9 to Nov. 13 . Visitors will walk to different communities on the trails and experience original cuisine and amateur performances by the villagers . This year Olle trails 1 through 5 will be showcased , and trails 5 to 10 in 2011 . Suh expects that most visitors will be predominately from Asia , at least initially , but in a few years it will become \u201c truly an international festival . \u201d She said a large number of Japanese walkers have already preregistered for November . Back in the courtyard of the tea museum , Suh , having gotten her second wind , summed up the main point of Olle : Nature and the common man . \u201c Olle is like a gift from the volunteers to the people . It was n't orchestrated by a great saint like on the Santiago trails nor by a revered monk who wanted to cure illness like on the Shikoku [ Japan ] trails . \u201d Suh described the trail as the work of an \u201c ordinary \u201d woman ex-journalist and a group of \u201c ordinary \u201d volunteers who sought to contribute to the community . \u201c I 'm proud that such a work is being done without any capital investment or government support . This is the reason for the greatness of the story of the Olle trails ; that it was the sweat of common people , not some Holy saints or anyone with reputation . It was a battle with the soil . \u201d For more information , consult the Jeju Olle Web site jejuolle . org where you can find route information , maps and phone numbers to restaurants and guest houses along trails 1 through 16 .

While everyone strives to be successful , Suh believes modern day Koreans have a particularly insatiable drive due to their relatively fresh memories of extreme poverty during and after the Korean War . \u201c They 've forgotten how to relax and handle obstacles in their lives . They get overly frustrated and confused upon facing even minor failures . This is reflected in the rising suicide rate , \u201d she explained . To escape from this lack of communication and interpersonal interaction , Suh says people come to Jeju Olle \u201c and explore an entirely new paradigm of vacationing . \u201d The word ' olle , ' which refers to the narrow paths that snake along the squat , black volcanic stone walls of the island , has become synonymous with visiting Jeju . Since the first course opened in September 2007 , Olle 's popularity has exploded here . While the decentralized nature of the trails means exact numbers are difficult to estimate , both mainland tourists and islanders alike come and go on the trails , some for a few hours , some for weeks ; some even in large corporate outings designed to build team spirit . Of the 22 trails currently open or planned , five or six receive the brunt of an estimated 500,000 walkers a year . Some walkers register at the start and finish of a trail , similar to pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago route from southern France to northern Spain , collecting official stamps in their trail booklets . The 357 kilometers of trails now span about three - quarters of the island . In keeping with the environmental message and human scale of the Olle ethos , trails are built and maintained by volunteers who use only their physical labor and not large machines . They vary from a short start - to - finish 4 to 5 - hour walk totalling 15 to 17 kilometers , to trails that require days of trekking to complete . A wide variety of scenery and trail selections make Jeju Olle accessible to a large demographic . However , when asked about handicapped accessible routes , Suh said they have yet to finalize a plan for how to proceed , explaining that since the routes are only marked and modified using human power , the large - scale upgrades required for handicap - accessible trails might run counter to the Olle philosophy . It was on the 800 - kilometer pilgrimage of El Camino de Santiago , in autumn 2006 , that Suh , who 'd recently finished a year - and - a- half as editor - in -chief of the online citizen journalism site OhmyNews , struck up conversations with other trekkers along the famous Spanish trek . Her conversations , including with author Paulo Coelho who was filming a documentary about the Camino , encouraged her to set up a similar system of trails back home . Despite having to battle entrenched official criticism on her return to Jeju Island , she \u201c took the initiative , \u201d enlisting the help of her brother , and marking existing pedestrian - only lanes . They then restored these old paths to create new trails for hikers to explore . An estimated 3,000 people hiked Olle trails that first year . Ten times that number in the second , with similar growth in subsequent years . Initially , however , the lifeblood of Jeju Island \u2013 tourism \u2013 was not to be toyed with . Suh spoke of the disappointment and \u201c energy - sapping \u201d resistance she received from all sides . \u201c First off , several local government officers were against me because of the already declining tourism industry in Jeju . It was a time when tourism here essentially involved the automobile . They said , ' Tourists are already inclined to think that Jeju is an expensive and unfriendly retreat even though you could conveniently see the island in a couple days with a car . They now prefer foreign and exotic locations to Jeju . ' \u201d Suh recounted how opponents to Olle trails were skeptical that anyone would come to Jeju \u201c to voluntarily experience the discomfort and the physical demands of walking . \u201d They believed the key to attracting tourists back to the island was \u201c by building more landmark buildings , casinos , and cable cars , as if this was a replica of a foreign country . \u201d \u201c Pedestrianism is for foreigners , and Koreans are not ready to walk . Koreans like to see sights , \u201d Suh heard time and time again . She was also told that \u201c ... the villagers were complaining that the land was private property and they were not going to let people trespass . \u201d But as time went on , and the tourist- friendly and environmental message of the trails began to spread , locals and mainlanders both began to warm to the idea . Suh said she 's confident islanders recognize that Olle Trails will benefit them more than those \u201c mammoth tours , \u201d by which she means the travel agencies , resort complexes and golf courses . \u201c The Ollers walk , and therefore they do n't carry around stuff they bought ... They drink local water , eat at local restaurants , and stay at local accommodations . The drivers come and look around the city for a couple days and the golfers play for a day before they leave . Yet , Ollers need to stay here for three or four days at least ; it could be one or two weeks or even up to a month . \u201d \u201c So in the long run , visitors of Olle would be spending more money here \u2014 the longer the stay , the more the consumption . But what is more important is that the money is not being poured into some \u201c mammoth \u201d corporate chain stores . It 's being distributed to the local economy and individuals . \u201d Many see Jeju Olle as unique in its small - scale , yet enticing , scenery . Suh is a believer . | || || | |\u00a1\u00e3 Photo by Daniel Kojetin | \u201c Trails overseas , like the ones in Switzerland and New Zealand , are surrounded by dramatic and grand - scaled nature that is defined by its height and width ; it is ' mammoth , ' \u201d she explained . For Jeju \u201c the beauty of the landscape of each trail [ is ] on a human scale , be it the oreum [ lateral volcanos ] , gotjawal [ a forest unique to Jeju ] , the villages and the sea . \u201d \u201c The nature here is subtle and exquisite ... Above all , it is feminine ... I hope that people can appreciate the femininity of nature . One should not expect to see the tallest , the broadest , or the grandest ; but to see the natural details assemble into a beautiful ensemble , \u201d she added . Olle has affected Suh personally and positively in more ways than one . \u201c Us journalists , we are not a bunch that believes in miracles . We 're dry and fact - centered rather than believing and full of faith ; we operate on the grounds of facts and certainty , \u201d she said . \u201c Although I started out [ being ] fond of trails and Jeju , I thought that only a few people would be with me . I would have never guessed that so many people would come together and witness such miracles that are still ongoing . \u201d Being a famous face on the island and spending much of her time on the trails herself , fellow hikers have shared a large number of inspiring personal stories with her . Suh recounted one case where a 29 - year - old woman who was diagnosed with cancer and recently separated from her boyfriend came to Jeju Island to enjoy nature one last time and then throw herself off a cliff . But after walking the Olle trails and contemplating her situation \u2013 free from the hectic pace of the big city \u2013 she came to realize what a precious gift life is . She returned to her guest house , confessed everything to the owner and returned to Seoul to start chemotherapy and a new lease on life . \u201c She was thankful of everything that was beautiful : To feel the nature , the wind , and the sea ... Someone who bailed out on life have came back to love it ! \u201d Suh said . Now that Jeju Olle has become a mainstream tourism option , Suh is looking to international markets for yet more visitors . The International Olle Festival will be held Nov. 9 to Nov. 13 . Visitors will walk to different communities on the trails and experience original cuisine and amateur performances by the villagers . This year Olle trails 1 through 5 will be showcased , and trails 5 to 10 in 2011 . Suh expects that most visitors will be predominately from Asia , at least initially , but in a few years it will become \u201c truly an international festival . \u201d She said a large number of Japanese walkers have already preregistered for November . Back in the courtyard of the tea museum , Suh , having gotten her second wind , summed up the main point of Olle : Nature and the common man . \u201c Olle is like a gift from the volunteers to the people . It was n't orchestrated by a great saint like on the Santiago trails nor by a revered monk who wanted to cure illness like on the Shikoku [ Japan ] trails . \u201d Suh described the trail as the work of an \u201c ordinary \u201d woman ex-journalist and a group of \u201c ordinary \u201d volunteers who sought to contribute to the community . \u201c I 'm proud that such a work is being done without any capital investment or government support . This is the reason for the greatness of the story of the Olle trails ; that it was the sweat of common people , not some Holy saints or anyone with reputation . It was a battle with the soil . \u201d For more information , consult the Jeju Olle Web site jejuolle . org where you can find route information , maps and phone numbers to restaurants and guest houses along trails 1 through 16 . You can also download free the new Jeju Olle i Phone app ( in Korean , search \u00c1\u00a6\u00c1\u00d6 \u00bf \u00c3\u00b7\u00b9 ) that uses augmented reality to add layers of useful travel information to your mapping / GPS device .

( 7 printed pages ) Contents Introduction Getting Started Using Fiddler Using Fiddler for Performance Testing Using Fiddler for Debugging Extending Fiddler To be continued ... Introduction Have you ever found yourself wondering how Microsoft Internet Explorer interacts with your Web application ? Have you encountered a strange performance bottleneck that you ca n't track down ? Are you curious about which cookies are being sent , or what downloaded content is marked as cacheable ? Microsoft Fiddler can help you answer these questions , and many more . Fiddler is an HTTP debugging proxy that logs all HTTP traffic between your computer and the Internet . Fiddler enables you to inspect all HTTP traffic , set breakpoints , and \" fiddle \" with incoming or outgoing data . Fiddler is much simpler to use than NetMon or other network debuggers because it exposes only HTTP traffic and does so in a user-friendly format . Fiddler includes a simple but powerful Microsoft JScript .NET event - based scripting subsystem flexible enough to support a broad array of HTTP debugging tasks . Written in C# on the Microsoft .NET Framework , Fiddler is available as an unsupported PowerToy for Internet Explorer . Getting Started Installation - Fiddler requires Microsoft Windows 2000 or above , and approximately 10 megabytes of disk space . - First you 'll need to ensure that you have the .NET Framework version 1.1 installed . If you do n't have it yet , you can visit Windows Update to download it . - Next , download Fiddler from https://www.fiddlertool.com. - When installation successfully completes , you 'll find the Fiddler icon on the Internet Explorer toolbar . - If the toolbar icon is missing , right - click the Internet Explorer toolbar and click Customize . You can also launch Fiddler from the Start menu . Running Fiddler After you start Fiddler , the program registers itself as the system proxy for Microsoft Windows Internet Services ( WinInet ) , the HTTP layer used by Internet Explorer , Microsoft Office , and many other products . You can verify that Fiddler is correctly intercepting requests by checking the Proxy Settings dialog . From the Internet Explorer main menu , click Tools , click Internet Options , click Connections , click LAN Setting , and finally click Advanced . Figure 1 . Internet Explorer proxy settings As the system proxy , all HTTP requests from WinInet flow through Fiddler before reaching the target Web servers . Similarly , all HTTP responses flow through Fiddler before being returned to the client application . Figure 2. HTTP traffic flow When you close Fiddler , it unregisters itself as the system proxy before shutting down . Using Fiddler Views Fiddler 's user interface contains a list of HTTP sessions and three tabs that allow you to view different aspects of the selected sessions . Figure 3 . The Fiddler user interface Using Fiddler for Performance Testing HTTP Statistics view By exposing all HTTP traffic , Fiddler easily shows which files are used to generate a given page . Using the Statistics page , the user can multiselect to get a \" total page weight \" \u00e2 the number of requests and the bytes transferred . Figure 4 . Statistics view Additionally , by exposing HTTP Headers in the Session list , the user can see whether pages are missing HTTP Expiration headers that permit client or proxy caching . If a response does not contain Expires or Cache - Control headers , it might not be cached by the client . Figure 5 . HTTP Expiration column Using Fiddler for Debugging In addition to seeing all HTTP requests and responses , Fiddler supports the notion of breakpoints . When the Enable Single Step Debugging option is checked on the Rules menu , or when the properties of the HTTP Request or Response match the target criteria , Fiddler can pause HTTP traffic and allow edits . This feature proves useful for security testing , as well as for general functionality testing , because all code paths can be exercised . Figure 6 . Session Inspector view Users can handcraft an HTTP request on the Builder page , or they can use a drag- and - drop operation to move an existing request from the session list to the Builder page to execute it again . Extending Fiddler Fiddler is extensible using the .NET Framework . There are two primary mechanisms for extending Fiddler : Custom Rules and Inspectors . Extending Fiddler Using Scripted Rules Fiddler supports a JScript .NET event-handling engine that allows the user to automatically modify the HTTP request or response . The engine can modify the visual appearance of the session in the Fiddler user interface ( UI ) , to draw attention to errors or to remove uninteresting sessions from the list altogether . The following sample code changes the UI to purple to show where cookies are uploaded . static function OnBeforeRequest ( oSession : Fiddler.Session ) { if ( oSession.oRequest.headers . Exists ( \" Cookie \" ) ) { o Session [ \" ui- color \" ] = \" purple \" ; o Session [ \" ui-bold \" ] = \" cookie \" ; } } Extending Fiddler by Adding Inspectors The user can add plug - in Inspector objects written in any .NET language . Request Inspectors and ResponseInspectors provide a format-specific or an otherwise specialized view of the HTTP request or response . Inspectors can be read - only ( RO ) or read - write ( RW ) . If an Inspector is read - write , it can be used to modify the HTTP request or response before the server or the client receives it . By default , Fiddler ships with the following Inspectors : Request Inspectors - [ RW ] Headers\u00e2 Shows request headers and status . - [ RW ] TextView\u00e2 Shows the request body in a text box . - [ RW ] HexView\u00e2 Shows the request body in a hexadecimal view . - [ RO ] XML\u00e2 Shows the request body as an XML DOM in a tree view . Response Inspectors - [ RW ] Transformer\u00e2 Removes GZip , DEFLATE , and CHUNKED encodings for easier debugging . - [ RW ] Headers\u00e2 Shows response headers and status . - [ RW ] TextView\u00e2 Shows the response body in a text box . - [ RW ] HexView\u00e2 Shows the response body in a hexadecimal view . - [ RO ] ImageView\u00e2 Shows the response body as an Image . Supports all .NET image formats . - [ RO ] XML\u00e2 Shows the response body as an XML DOM in a tree view . - [ RO ] Privacy\u00e2 Explains the P3P statement in the response headers , if present . To be continued ... We 've barely scratched the surface of Fiddler . At this point , you should know how to install Fiddler , how to see statistics about a set of HTTP Sessions , and how to view the raw traffic of the HTTP Session . In future installments , we 'll take a closer look at using advanced features to debug client / server interactions . Eric Lawrence is a program manager on the Internet Explorer team .

If you do n't have it yet , you can visit Windows Update to download it . - Next , download Fiddler from https://www.fiddlertool.com. - When installation successfully completes , you 'll find the Fiddler icon on the Internet Explorer toolbar . - If the toolbar icon is missing , right - click the Internet Explorer toolbar and click Customize . You can also launch Fiddler from the Start menu . Running Fiddler After you start Fiddler , the program registers itself as the system proxy for Microsoft Windows Internet Services ( WinInet ) , the HTTP layer used by Internet Explorer , Microsoft Office , and many other products . You can verify that Fiddler is correctly intercepting requests by checking the Proxy Settings dialog . From the Internet Explorer main menu , click Tools , click Internet Options , click Connections , click LAN Setting , and finally click Advanced . Figure 1 . Internet Explorer proxy settings As the system proxy , all HTTP requests from WinInet flow through Fiddler before reaching the target Web servers . Similarly , all HTTP responses flow through Fiddler before being returned to the client application . Figure 2. HTTP traffic flow When you close Fiddler , it unregisters itself as the system proxy before shutting down . Using Fiddler Views Fiddler 's user interface contains a list of HTTP sessions and three tabs that allow you to view different aspects of the selected sessions . Figure 3 . The Fiddler user interface Using Fiddler for Performance Testing HTTP Statistics view By exposing all HTTP traffic , Fiddler easily shows which files are used to generate a given page . Using the Statistics page , the user can multiselect to get a \" total page weight \" \u00e2 the number of requests and the bytes transferred . Figure 4 . Statistics view Additionally , by exposing HTTP Headers in the Session list , the user can see whether pages are missing HTTP Expiration headers that permit client or proxy caching . If a response does not contain Expires or Cache - Control headers , it might not be cached by the client . Figure 5 . HTTP Expiration column Using Fiddler for Debugging In addition to seeing all HTTP requests and responses , Fiddler supports the notion of breakpoints . When the Enable Single Step Debugging option is checked on the Rules menu , or when the properties of the HTTP Request or Response match the target criteria , Fiddler can pause HTTP traffic and allow edits . This feature proves useful for security testing , as well as for general functionality testing , because all code paths can be exercised . Figure 6 . Session Inspector view Users can handcraft an HTTP request on the Builder page , or they can use a drag- and - drop operation to move an existing request from the session list to the Builder page to execute it again . Extending Fiddler Fiddler is extensible using the .NET Framework . There are two primary mechanisms for extending Fiddler : Custom Rules and Inspectors . Extending Fiddler Using Scripted Rules Fiddler supports a JScript .NET event-handling engine that allows the user to automatically modify the HTTP request or response . The engine can modify the visual appearance of the session in the Fiddler user interface ( UI ) , to draw attention to errors or to remove uninteresting sessions from the list altogether . The following sample code changes the UI to purple to show where cookies are uploaded . static function OnBeforeRequest ( oSession : Fiddler.Session ) { if ( oSession.oRequest.headers . Exists ( \" Cookie \" ) ) { o Session [ \" ui- color \" ] = \" purple \" ; o Session [ \" ui-bold \" ] = \" cookie \" ; } } Extending Fiddler by Adding Inspectors The user can add plug - in Inspector objects written in any .NET language . Request Inspectors and ResponseInspectors provide a format-specific or an otherwise specialized view of the HTTP request or response . Inspectors can be read - only ( RO ) or read - write ( RW ) . If an Inspector is read - write , it can be used to modify the HTTP request or response before the server or the client receives it . By default , Fiddler ships with the following Inspectors : Request Inspectors - [ RW ] Headers\u00e2 Shows request headers and status . - [ RW ] TextView\u00e2 Shows the request body in a text box . - [ RW ] HexView\u00e2 Shows the request body in a hexadecimal view . - [ RO ] XML\u00e2 Shows the request body as an XML DOM in a tree view . Response Inspectors - [ RW ] Transformer\u00e2 Removes GZip , DEFLATE , and CHUNKED encodings for easier debugging . - [ RW ] Headers\u00e2 Shows response headers and status . - [ RW ] TextView\u00e2 Shows the response body in a text box . - [ RW ] HexView\u00e2 Shows the response body in a hexadecimal view . - [ RO ] ImageView\u00e2 Shows the response body as an Image . Supports all .NET image formats . - [ RO ] XML\u00e2 Shows the response body as an XML DOM in a tree view . - [ RO ] Privacy\u00e2 Explains the P3P statement in the response headers , if present . To be continued ... We 've barely scratched the surface of Fiddler . At this point , you should know how to install Fiddler , how to see statistics about a set of HTTP Sessions , and how to view the raw traffic of the HTTP Session . In future installments , we 'll take a closer look at using advanced features to debug client / server interactions . Eric Lawrence is a program manager on the Internet Explorer team . Before joining Microsoft , Eric worked as a Web developer for a startup during the dot-com heyday .","annotations":[{"text":"Microsoft Fiddler","span":[813,829],"token_span":[133,134],"role":"Interceptor","label":"Interceptor","role_definition":"The volitional agent who without authorization of sender or recipient takes control of a Theme that is en route to a destination."},{"text":"all HTTP traffic between your computer and the Internet","span":[930,984],"token_span":[154,162],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The entity, physical or abstract, construed as traveling from a sender to a goal location, which is taken hold of by the Interceptor without permission."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-4553-401-frame-Intercepting","frame":"Intercepting","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A volitionally acting Interceptor takes control, without being authorized to do so by the sender, of a Theme that is underway from a sender to a recipient.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"\" The Dodger \" again showed his versatility in a 13\u20130 win against Vanderbilt .

This total included 117 centuries , so that he scored a hundred slightly more than one in every three times he went out to bat . He would have made many more had he not lost so much of his prime to the Second World War . For more than eight years , between the Test at Headingley in July 1938 and the first at Brisbane in late 1946 , he played no Test innings at all . Among those batsmen who have completed their careers and played in more than 20 Test innings , the next best averages are those of Graeme Pollock , George Headley and Herbert Sutcliffe , who all finished with an average of 60 , some 40 runs behind Bradman . It is difficult to think of any other field of endeavour in which the best is so much better than the merely excellent . On the other hand , Bradman was never a particularly elegant player , nor a classically orthodox one . He was , after all , entirely self - taught , and had been brought up on concrete wickets covered with matting ; he did not bat on a grass wicket until he was 18 ( and then , of course , he made a century ) . In these circumstances Bradman had developed an unusual grip , which he steadfastly refused to change . The right hand was twisted to the right so that as the palm gripped the handle it was facing nearly directly down the pitch . The left hand was turned so that its back faced the bowler . As Bradman took up his stance the leading edge of the bat pointed almost towards the bowler , while its bottom rested between , not behind , his feet . He took the bat up at an angle of 45 degrees to the flight of the ball . This set - up made him particularly strong in the hook , the pull and the cut . He said his grip made it impossible to lift the hook shot unless he tried to ; and he was equally safe with the cut . More extraordinarily , given his grip , he also developed an effective off-drive . On the debit side , it was argued , the grip handicapped him on wet wickets where there was sharp turn . But then his footwork was so sprightly that he could usually smother spin . It goes without saying that Bradman was quick and accurate in his judgment of length and speed , possessed the sharpest reflexes , and was gifted with perfect hand - eye co-ordination . But he was not alone in these qualities . What made him wholly exceptional were his inner confidence , his determination to dominate an attack , and his ability to sustain total concentration over a long innings . Jim Laker used to tell how , at Lord 's in 1948 , he tied Bradman up for an over and was only prevented by the faintest edge from claiming him LBW . \" Well bowled , Jim , \" Bradman said at the end of the over . \" Thank goodness that 's over . Now we can get on with some batting . \" He hit the first ball of Laker 's next over for four and was never in trouble again . On strike , Bradman would be entirely still , not even tapping his bat . Often he was grinning - cynically , as many bowlers came to feel . \" As I ran up to bowl , \" Jim Laker has recorded , \" Bradman always seemed to know where the ball was going to pitch , what stroke he was going to play and how many runs he was going to score . \" Only at the start of an innings did Bradman appear vulnerable . Once he had settled , his instinct was not just to attack the bowling but to tear it to pieces . Scoring fast was almost as important to him as scoring high , and over his career he averaged 42 runs an hour . His dominance at the crease was the more remarkable as he was only 5 ft 8 in tall , and used a light bat . No mercy was shown to tired or indifferent performers . \" He pitied none , \" wrote Learie Constantine , the great West Indian fast bowler . \" If he can make any bowler look foolish , he will do it . \" And no matter what the heat , or the pressure , Bradman would always appear entirely cool , with not a drop of sweat . Off the pitch he was neither falsely modest nor arrogantly boastful . Unwilling to talk about himself , he was always ready with praise of other players . Yet he was never one of the boys . Teetotal and a non-smoker , when possible he avoided rowdy celebration , although as a talented pianist he was sometimes roped in to accompany sing - songs . After he made 309 not out on the first day of the Test match at Headingley in 1930 , against an attack including Larwood and Tate , he went up to his room to listen to music and write letters . Some of his team - mates resented this attitude . In particular , the Irish and Roman Catholic members of Australia 's side in the 1930s - Jack Fingleton and Bill O'Reilly to the fore - took exception to the tight , dedicated , Empire-loving , Royalty - idolising , aristocrat - adulating genius under whose shadow they lay . \" A churlish little man , \" Fingleton called Bradman in 1980 , all passion clearly not spent . And E W Swanton noted that , when Bradman was out for nought in his last Test , \" I thought they [ Fingleton and O'Reilly ] were going to have a stroke , they were laughing so much \" . Outwardly , Bradman could afford to disdain such critics , though in old age he rather curiously let it be known that when the Irish players arrived at Melbourne station , \" they were met by a bunch of priests in cassocks \" . In the light of this antagonism , O'Reilly 's tribute , that Bradman was \" the greatest cricketer ever to put boots on and walk on to a cricket field \" , gains added force . Yet the isolating intensity with which Bradman played exacted its cost . Throughout the 1930s he was plagued by curiously ill-defined health problems , no doubt caused by the tremendous pressure to which he was subject . In Australia a Bradman failure , such as when he was bowled first ball by Bowes at Melbourne in 1932 , was a national disaster . Bradman 's will , toughness and grit saw him through . And he was shrewd enough , in between making his centuries , to ensure a measure of financial security outside cricket . Donald George Bradman was born at Cootamundra , 200 miles south - west of Sydney , on August 27 1908 . He was the fifth of five children , and four years younger than his brother Victor , the fourth child . The first three children had been daughters . His father 's family had originally hailed from Withersfield , just inside Suffolk on the border with Cambridgeshire , where the path to the church door is lined with Bradnams . In 1833 , the son of John Bradnam was christened , whether intentionally or by error , Charles Bradman . This Charles , an agricultural labourer , emigrated to Australia in 1852 , settling at Mittagong , 80 miles south of Sydney . He married a local girl , and set about earning enough money to buy his own land . In 1874 he fulfilled this ambition by moving 150 miles west to Jindalee ( near Cootamundra ) , where property was cheaper . Two years later his third child , George , Don Bradman 's father , was born . At 17 George married Emily Whatman , from a rather better - off farming family . Emily 's brother George was a keen and talented cricketer . In 1910 George Bradman gave up his farm and moved near to his wife 's family in the Mittagong - Bowral area , where he worked as a carpenter . Don Bradman grew up in a weatherboard bungalow , with no water supply . Often left to his own devices , he satisfied his sporting instincts by throwing a golf ball against the brick base of a water tank , attempting ( and usually succeeding ) to hit it with a stump as it rebounded . He practised fielding by throwing his golf ball at the bars in a gate - which meant tedious retrieval if he missed . At Bowral High School , Don found that he invariably came third in class . But when , aged 12 , he played for the school team against their rivals at Mittagong , he made an undefeated 115 in a total of 155 . Two years later , in 1921 , he was given a chance in Bowral Town senior team . Still in shorts , and using a bat far too large for him , he went in at Number 10 , and made 39 not out . Shortly afterwards his father took him for the first time to Sydney , where they watched Charlie Macartney take 170 off England . Don left school at 14 , commended by his headmaster as \" truthful , honest , industrious , and an unusually bright lad \" , and began work in an estate agency in Bowral . In 1923 - 24 he played no cricket at all , and very little in the following summer . Most of his free time was given to tennis . It was his uncle George Whatman who lured him back to play cricket for Bowral . In December 1925 the town played their local rivals from Wingello , the match taking place on successive Saturday afternoons . The opposition had a demon bowler , nearly three years older than Bradman : Bill O'Reilly , no less . At the close of play on the first Saturday Bradman was 234 not out - though he was bowled first ball by O'Reilly when he resumed his innings the following week . In the next match he made 300 against Moss Vale . Word of these deeds travelled to Sydney , and in October 1926 the New South Wales selectors invited the prodigy for a trial . He impressed , and in December 1927 made his debut for the state in a match against South Australia at Adelaide . Going in at No 7 , he treated Clarrie Grimmett , one of the greatest of all leg spinners , with scant respect , and duly completed his century . His debut in Test cricket came against England at Brisbane in 1928 . For once he failed to do himself justice , and was dropped for the second Test . Returning for the third at Melbourne , he made 79 and 112 , and then hit another century in the fifth match of the series . In between he hammered Victoria 's attack for 340 not out . In 1930 Bradman flayed Queensland 's bowlers to amass 452 not out , which for almost 30 years remained the highest score in first - class cricket . There were seasoned English players - Maurice Tate , Frank Woolley and Percy Fender among them - who felt that Bradman 's frequently cross - batted attacking style could never succeed so well on English wickets . Bradman gave his response in the Test series of 1930 , when he scored 974 runs ( still a record ) and averaged 139.14 without the benefit of a single Not Out . He rated his 254 at Lord 's that year as the best innings he ever played ; every shot , he said , went exactly where intended , even the one from which he was caught ; he had only forgotten that Percy Chapman was so tall . His 334 in the next Test at Headingley remains the highest score by an Australian against England . Nemesis came in the form of the bodyline tactics employed by Douglas Jardine when England toured Australia in 1932 - 33 . Larwood and Voce fired in short - pitched deliveries aimed at the body and head with a cluster of short legs to take the catch as the batsman tried to fend the ball off . Larwood , of course was one of the fastest bowlers of all time , and he was reinforced by the ruthlessness of Jardine , who required his players to refer to Bradman as \" the little bastard \" . After early failures , Bradman found a solution . \" He ran to the off or [ more often ] out to the leg to get away from those head - high whistling balls , \" wrote Walter Hammond , \" and he played golf shots and overhead lawn tennis shots , and from one after another the ball went crashing to the pickets . That was sheer courage . \" Nevertheless England succeeded in reducing Bradman 's average for the series to 56.57 , excellent for any other player who has ever lived , but a comparative failure for him . Australia lost the series 1 - 4 . Though the Australian players had been given \u00a3 600 each to tour England in 1930 , Bradman was aware , in those years of economic depression , of the need for an income outside cricket . Earlier he had publicised sporting equipment ; and in 1931 he signed up with a newspaper and radio group in Sydney . He also engaged in some sharp battles with the Australian Board of Control over his right to earn extra money by writing about the tour of 1930 . In 1934 Bradman moved from Sydney to Adelaide to take up a contract for \u00a3 700 a year offered by a stockbroker called Henry Hodgett . Thereafter he played for South Australia . During the tour of England in 1934 , Bradman ( now promoted to vice - captain ) was troubled by bad health - to such an extent that he went 13 innings without making a century , before making amends with 304 , 244 and 77 in the fourth and fifth Tests . At the end of the season an abnormally complicated appendix operation left him at death 's door . He did not play cricket again for more than a year . Appointed captain of Australia for the 1936 - 37 season , Bradman got off to a disastrous start , as Australia were heavily defeated in the first two Tests . But thanks to a glut of runs from the skipper , they eventually won the series 3 - 2 . The Australians retained the Ashes in England in 1938 , with Bradman averaging 108.50 in the Tests , and 115.66 for the tour . His 103 in appalling light in the fourth Test at Headingley was one of his finest innings . \" Bradman is in such form , \" wrote Jack Hobbs , \" that he could play by candlelight \" . Back in Australia he was more prolific than ever in 1938 - 39 . But the war proved an unhappy time for him . Volunteering for the Royal Australian Air Force in 1940 , he subsequently transferred to the Army as a supervisor of physical education . But his health broke down . He suffered from muscular trouble and , graver still , his eyesight temporarily worsened , so that his scores in 1940 - 41 were 0 , 6 , 0 and 12 . In May 1941 Bradman was discharged from the Army on medical grounds . A frozen shoulder left him unable to lift his right arm . He also lost all feeling in the thumb and index finger of his right hand ; it never returned , he wrote in his book Farewell to Cricket ( 1950 ) . For the rest of the war Bradman busied himself at the Adelaide stock exchange . But even this proved fraught , as Harry Hodgett , his boss , was imprisoned for fraud in 1945 . Bradman worked hard and successfully to restore the position of the firm , which now traded as Don Bradman and Company . When the England team arrived in Australia in 1946 , they thought Bradman looked so ill that he would be better off in a nursing home than on a cricket pitch . But , without recapturing the flair of his pre-war days , Bradman scored 187 in the first Test , and 234 in the second . England were duly annihilated , and the next season he went on to plunder the Indians for an average of 178.75 in the Tests . Confident in his team , he set off for England in 1948 determined to complete the tour without defeat . The mission was achieved . On this last tour Bradman decided that his ageing muscles made it too risky to go for the second hundred . Nevertheless , in the fourth Test at Headingley he achieved one of his greatest triumphs , when Australia scored 404 for three wickets in their second innings to win a game they had looked like losing . Bradman 's contribution was 173 not out . After a final three testimonial matches in Australia , Bradman was knighted in 1949 . \" I would have preferred to remain just Mister , \" he volunteered . In 1979 he was appointed Companion of the Order of Australia . He was the first Australian to be made a life Vice - President of MCC . He continued to work as a stockbroker until 1954 when he announced , rather curiously , that his doctor had advised him to retire . His golf handicap was quickly reduced to scratch . Bradman reported on the Australian tours of England in 1953 and 1956 , sitting next to his old enemy Douglas Jardine in the press box at Headingley in 1953 . In 1962 - 63 , the Australian Prime Minister , Sir Robert Menzies , persuaded him to captain a side against MCC , but to everyone 's disappointment he was bowled for four by Brian Statham . As a delegate to the Imperial Cricket Conference , and ( from 1960 to 1963 ) as chairman of the Australian Board of Control , Bradman helped find a solution , or at least a diplomatic compromise , to the throwing controversy sparked off by the Australians Ian Meckiff and Gordon Rorke , and by the South African Geoff Griffen . Conscious of the waning appeal of cricket , Bradman urged the Australian team to adopt a more enterprising attitude ; the result was the memorable series against the West Indies in 1960 - 61 . Once more chairman of the Board of Control from 1969 to 1972 , he was obliged , rather reluctantly , to cancel the South African tour of 1971 - 72 . The series against the Rest of the World which he organised in its stead proved a great success . Latterly Bradman avoided the limelight . \" They usually leave this sort of thing until you are dead , \" he remarked when a stand was named after him at Sydney in 1974 . Apart from his memoirs , his publications included The Art of Cricket ( 1958 ) and The Bradman Album ( 1988 ) . The Don Declares , taped conversations about his career , was issued in 1988 . Bradman married , in 1932 , Jessie Menzies , a childhood friend , who died in 1997 . They had a son and a daughter .

So Bradman ended with a Test batting average of 99.94 from 52 Tests , a surprisingly small number by modern standards . ( Allan Border played in 156 Test matches between 1978 and 1994 . ) Bradman played 338 innings in first - class matches , and made 28,067 runs with an average of 95.14 .

And he was shrewd enough , in between making his centuries , to ensure a measure of financial security outside cricket . Donald George Bradman was born at Cootamundra , 200 miles south - west of Sydney , on August 27 1908 . He was the fifth of five children , and four years younger than his brother Victor , the fourth child . The first three children had been daughters . His father 's family had originally hailed from Withersfield , just inside Suffolk on the border with Cambridgeshire , where the path to the church door is lined with Bradnams . In 1833 , the son of John Bradnam was christened , whether intentionally or by error , Charles Bradman . This Charles , an agricultural labourer , emigrated to Australia in 1852 , settling at Mittagong , 80 miles south of Sydney . He married a local girl , and set about earning enough money to buy his own land . In 1874 he fulfilled this ambition by moving 150 miles west to Jindalee ( near Cootamundra ) , where property was cheaper . Two years later his third child , George , Don Bradman 's father , was born . At 17 George married Emily Whatman , from a rather better - off farming family . Emily 's brother George was a keen and talented cricketer . In 1910 George Bradman gave up his farm and moved near to his wife 's family in the Mittagong - Bowral area , where he worked as a carpenter . Don Bradman grew up in a weatherboard bungalow , with no water supply .

His 103 in appalling light in the fourth Test at Headingley was one of his finest innings . \" Bradman is in such form , \" wrote Jack Hobbs , \" that he could play by candlelight \" . Back in Australia he was more prolific than ever in 1938 - 39 . But the war proved an unhappy time for him . Volunteering for the Royal Australian Air Force in 1940 , he subsequently transferred to the Army as a supervisor of physical education . But his health broke down . He suffered from muscular trouble and , graver still , his eyesight temporarily worsened , so that his scores in 1940 - 41 were 0 , 6 , 0 and 12 . In May 1941 Bradman was discharged from the Army on medical grounds . A frozen shoulder left him unable to lift his right arm . He also lost all feeling in the thumb and index finger of his right hand ; it never returned , he wrote in his book Farewell to Cricket ( 1950 ) . For the rest of the war Bradman busied himself at the Adelaide stock exchange . But even this proved fraught , as Harry Hodgett , his boss , was imprisoned for fraud in 1945 . Bradman worked hard and successfully to restore the position of the firm , which now traded as Don Bradman and Company . When the England team arrived in Australia in 1946 , they thought Bradman looked so ill that he would be better off in a nursing home than on a cricket pitch . But , without recapturing the flair of his pre-war days , Bradman scored 187 in the first Test , and 234 in the second . England were duly annihilated , and the next season he went on to plunder the Indians for an average of 178.75 in the Tests . Confident in his team , he set off for England in 1948 determined to complete the tour without defeat . The mission was achieved . On this last tour Bradman decided that his ageing muscles made it too risky to go for the second hundred . Nevertheless , in the fourth Test at Headingley he achieved one of his greatest triumphs , when Australia scored 404 for three wickets in their second innings to win a game they had looked like losing . Bradman 's contribution was 173 not out . After a final three testimonial matches in Australia , Bradman was knighted in 1949 . \" I would have preferred to remain just Mister , \" he volunteered . In 1979 he was appointed Companion of the Order of Australia . He was the first Australian to be made a life Vice - President of MCC . He continued to work as a stockbroker until 1954 when he announced , rather curiously , that his doctor had advised him to retire . His golf handicap was quickly reduced to scratch . Bradman reported on the Australian tours of England in 1953 and 1956 , sitting next to his old enemy Douglas Jardine in the press box at Headingley in 1953 . In 1962 - 63 , the Australian Prime Minister , Sir Robert Menzies , persuaded him to captain a side against MCC , but to everyone 's disappointment he was bowled for four by Brian Statham . As a delegate to the Imperial Cricket Conference , and ( from 1960 to 1963 ) as chairman of the Australian Board of Control , Bradman helped find a solution , or at least a diplomatic compromise , to the throwing controversy sparked off by the Australians Ian Meckiff and Gordon Rorke , and by the South African Geoff Griffen . Conscious of the waning appeal of cricket , Bradman urged the Australian team to adopt a more enterprising attitude ; the result was the memorable series against the West Indies in 1960 - 61 . Once more chairman of the Board of Control from 1969 to 1972 , he was obliged , rather reluctantly , to cancel the South African tour of 1971 - 72 . The series against the Rest of the World which he organised in its stead proved a great success . Latterly Bradman avoided the limelight . \" They usually leave this sort of thing until you are dead , \" he remarked when a stand was named after him at Sydney in 1974 . Apart from his memoirs , his publications included The Art of Cricket ( 1958 ) and The Bradman Album ( 1988 ) . The Don Declares , taped conversations about his career , was issued in 1988 . Bradman married , in 1932 , Jessie Menzies , a childhood friend , who died in 1997 . They had a son and a daughter .

We 're not done yet ! Your opinion can help us make it better . International companies are closing up shop in Russia in droves . For some , the decision to leave such a large market is n't an easy one . Political pressure and safety concerns are prompting Western companies to close operations in Russia and Ukraine A corporate exodus has followed the invasion of Ukraine , with major international firms withdrawing or limiting their operations in Russia in response . McDonald 's and Starbucks are two of the latest corporations to take this step after facing pressure to pull out . According to research from Yale University , more than 300 major international businesses have so far reacted to the brutal invasion of Ukraine . From the retail sector to energy , tech and entertainment , over the course of two weeks global Western firms rushed to exit the increasingly isolated nation . But for companies with a larger exposure to Russia , the decision to cut links with Moscow might hurt more than the reputational risk of staying in the market . Half of the 10 largest international companies in Russia have decided to pause or reduce their operations , pointing to supply chain issues and the military crisis in Ukraine . The rest have said little to nothing about the situation since the war began . That 's the case for the Swiss - American tobacco manufacturer Philip Morris International , which in 2020 ranked as the international company with the largest revenues in Russia , after raking in nearly $ 2.6 billion ( \u20ac 2.4 billion ) . The company has temporarily interrupted its business in Ukraine , but continues its activities in Russia and says it is closely following further developments . Another top player , Japan 's tobacco manufacturer JTI , has five factories and 4,500 employees across Russia . It currently maintains its operations in Russia , but has suspended local production in its plant in Ukraine , pointing to concern for workers ' safety . A handful of French firms with exposure to the Russian market also continue to trade . Home retailer Leroy Merlin , which follows Philip Morris in terms of revenue , last week said its 112 stores across Russia will continue to operate normally and that it does n't plan to withdraw itself from the market . The group Auchan , another gigantic French retailer with nearly 300 stores and 41,000 employees in Russia , has n't shown any sign of halting its operations either . Some carmakers rushed to stop on - the-ground production in Russia as the war intensified . Both Germany 's Volkswagen and Japan 's Toyota halted production at their Russian factories and suspended car exports to Russia indefinitely , citing disruptions in the supply chain . Luxury carmakers Rolls Royce , Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin interrupted sales and shipments to Russia , while Mercedes Benz and BMW stopped exports and production on the ground . Volvo , Nissan , Honda , Ford and General Motors have implemented similar measures . But for Renault Group , a deal sealed in 2007 ties the French carmaker to Russia , which with 12 % of its revenue represents its second - biggest market . Back then , Renault entered this booming market through the acquisition of AvtoVaz , the maker of the iconic Soviet -era Lada . Several tech companies have closed up shop . Software companies Microsoft and SAP are among those who have suspended the sales of new products . Google and Facebook parent Meta banned Russian state media from running and profiting from ads on their platforms . Spotify announced the closing of its Moscow office , but said it will continue to allow access to its content in an effort to counter propaganda and misinformation . Despite a large exposure to the Russian market , tech companies Apple and Samsung have chosen to respond to sanctions imposed by the US , the EU and others . Apple interrupted all local product sales through Apple Stores and limited the functionality of some of its services , including its payment platform Apple Pay . Despite leading the Russian smartphone market , Samsung paused smartphone and chip shipments to Russia . Fast fashion brands H&M and Zara announced their retreat from the Russian market last week , temporarily shutting their shops and halting local sales . The American denim brand Levi's , which became a symbol of freedom during the Soviet era , joined on Monday . Sports brands Nike , Puma and Adidas also joined the exodus of fashion retailers . Adidas even went a step further , suspending its partnership with the Russian Football Federation . Luxury brands Chanel , Prada , Hermes , Burberry , LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering , which owns Gucci and Saint Laurent , have paused their sales as well . International payment giants Visa , Mastercard and American Express promptly halted their services after the imposition of sanctions . Visa , for example , announced the interruption of all its transactions and warned that cards issued in Russia would no longer work abroad . Payment platform PayPal has also shut down its services . Along with McDonald 's and Starbucks , Coca - Cola has also said it is exiting the Russian market . Consumer goods brands Unilever and Kraft Heinz suspended all Russian imports and exports .

We 're not done yet ! Your opinion can help us make it better . International companies are closing up shop in Russia in droves . For some , the decision to leave such a large market is n't an easy one . Political pressure and safety concerns are prompting Western companies to close operations in Russia and Ukraine A corporate exodus has followed the invasion of Ukraine , with major international firms withdrawing or limiting their operations in Russia in response . McDonald 's and Starbucks are two of the latest corporations to take this step after facing pressure to pull out . According to research from Yale University , more than 300 major international businesses have so far reacted to the brutal invasion of Ukraine . From the retail sector to energy , tech and entertainment , over the course of two weeks global Western firms rushed to exit the increasingly isolated nation . But for companies with a larger exposure to Russia , the decision to cut links with Moscow might hurt more than the reputational risk of staying in the market . Half of the 10 largest international companies in Russia have decided to pause or reduce their operations , pointing to supply chain issues and the military crisis in Ukraine . The rest have said little to nothing about the situation since the war began . That 's the case for the Swiss - American tobacco manufacturer Philip Morris International , which in 2020 ranked as the international company with the largest revenues in Russia , after raking in nearly $ 2.6 billion ( \u20ac 2.4 billion ) . The company has temporarily interrupted its business in Ukraine , but continues its activities in Russia and says it is closely following further developments . Another top player , Japan 's tobacco manufacturer JTI , has five factories and 4,500 employees across Russia . It currently maintains its operations in Russia , but has suspended local production in its plant in Ukraine , pointing to concern for workers ' safety . A handful of French firms with exposure to the Russian market also continue to trade . Home retailer Leroy Merlin , which follows Philip Morris in terms of revenue , last week said its 112 stores across Russia will continue to operate normally and that it does n't plan to withdraw itself from the market . The group Auchan , another gigantic French retailer with nearly 300 stores and 41,000 employees in Russia , has n't shown any sign of halting its operations either . Some carmakers rushed to stop on - the-ground production in Russia as the war intensified . Both Germany 's Volkswagen and Japan 's Toyota halted production at their Russian factories and suspended car exports to Russia indefinitely , citing disruptions in the supply chain . Luxury carmakers Rolls Royce , Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin interrupted sales and shipments to Russia , while Mercedes Benz and BMW stopped exports and production on the ground . Volvo , Nissan , Honda , Ford and General Motors have implemented similar measures . But for Renault Group , a deal sealed in 2007 ties the French carmaker to Russia , which with 12 % of its revenue represents its second - biggest market . Back then , Renault entered this booming market through the acquisition of AvtoVaz , the maker of the iconic Soviet -era Lada . Several tech companies have closed up shop . Software companies Microsoft and SAP are among those who have suspended the sales of new products . Google and Facebook parent Meta banned Russian state media from running and profiting from ads on their platforms . Spotify announced the closing of its Moscow office , but said it will continue to allow access to its content in an effort to counter propaganda and misinformation . Despite a large exposure to the Russian market , tech companies Apple and Samsung have chosen to respond to sanctions imposed by the US , the EU and others . Apple interrupted all local product sales through Apple Stores and limited the functionality of some of its services , including its payment platform Apple Pay . Despite leading the Russian smartphone market , Samsung paused smartphone and chip shipments to Russia . Fast fashion brands H&M and Zara announced their retreat from the Russian market last week , temporarily shutting their shops and halting local sales . The American denim brand Levi's , which became a symbol of freedom during the Soviet era , joined on Monday . Sports brands Nike , Puma and Adidas also joined the exodus of fashion retailers . Adidas even went a step further , suspending its partnership with the Russian Football Federation . Luxury brands Chanel , Prada , Hermes , Burberry , LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering , which owns Gucci and Saint Laurent , have paused their sales as well . International payment giants Visa , Mastercard and American Express promptly halted their services after the imposition of sanctions . Visa , for example , announced the interruption of all its transactions and warned that cards issued in Russia would no longer work abroad . Payment platform PayPal has also shut down its services . Along with McDonald 's and Starbucks , Coca - Cola has also said it is exiting the Russian market . Consumer goods brands Unilever and Kraft Heinz suspended all Russian imports and exports . Swedish furniture retailer IKEA announced last week the decision to pause its production and retail operations in Russia and Belarus , as well as halt all imports and exports to and from those countries .

Jeff Jones led Bridgend Council until 2004 and chaired the Welsh Joint Education Committee ( WJEC ) exam board when the Welsh Bac was launched . Responding to concerns expressed in the Western Mail by a sixth former about Cardiff University 's refusal to accept the qualification as the equivalent of an A-level A grade for a history and politics course , Mr Jones described the Welsh Bac as \u201c really an A level with a load of nonsense added on \u201d . He added : \u201c It is n't a proper Bac where students at 18 would still be required to study maths , English , a science and a language , not meaningless Mickey Mouse additions . What the heck is the use of ' Wales and the World ' for a start ? \u201c No wonder Russell Group universities who can get students from England with four A stars are not that interested . If I were a student I would n't touch it with a barge pole \u2013 even though I played a small part when I was chair of the WJEC in its development . \u201c Both the then chief executive and I discussed whether to bid for the pilot . We both agreed that it looked like nonsense but I argued that we needed the money and in any case we had to bid because we were the Welsh exam board . In the event we were the only organisation that decided to bid and then employed Keith Davies ( recently elected as the Labour AM for Llanelli ) to develop the idea . \u201d A Welsh Government spokesman said : \u201c Mr Jones ' comments are extremely disappointing \u2013 it is surprising that , as a former chair of WJEC , he would sanction a bid for a qualification that was , in his words , ' nonsense ' . \u201c The Welsh Baccalaureate has been largely welcomed by learners , parents and universities alike across the UK . It gives learners an added dimension , adds breadth to their learning and offers the skills which employers and universities alike are looking for . \u201c Some 44,000 university courses are listed on the UCAS website and over 30,000 of these courses specifically accept the WBQ as an entry qualification . UCAS , which manages the process of university entry , has awarded the advanced diploma 120 points . \u201c We 're sure Mr Jones ' former colleagues at the WJEC will be shocked and embarrassed by these comments . \u201d Mr Davies said : \u201c I find Jeff Jones ' comments on the Welsh Baccalaureate extremely insulting . There are many good examples of offers made to Welsh students from English universities such as Oxford that have included the Welsh Bac . \u201c Many schools report that their students have a much broader base having followed the Welsh Bac programme with its different components , including the essential skills and an individual investigation and that it enables them to perform well at interview as well as producing excellent personal statements . \u201d David Evans , Wales secretary of the National Union of Teachers , said : \u201c I am surprised Jeff Jones has come out and made these statements several years after the event . If that 's what he thought at the time , he should hang his head in shame for putting in a bid from the WJEC to run the Welsh Bac. Making these comments now smacks of scaremongering . \u201d Dr Philip Dixon , director of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers Cymru , said : \u201c Jeff Jones has got it wrong on several counts . Russell Group universities are not interested in applicants piling up A grades \u2013 they made it clear at a meeting I was in the other day that what they want is three good A levels . \u201c The Welsh Bac is recognised by many universities as a useful qualification because it broadens a student 's scope .

Jeff Jones led Bridgend Council until 2004 and chaired the Welsh Joint Education Committee ( WJEC ) exam board when the Welsh Bac was launched . Responding to concerns expressed in the Western Mail by a sixth former about Cardiff University 's refusal to accept the qualification as the equivalent of an A-level A grade for a history and politics course , Mr Jones described the Welsh Bac as \u201c really an A level with a load of nonsense added on \u201d . He added : \u201c It is n't a proper Bac where students at 18 would still be required to study maths , English , a science and a language , not meaningless Mickey Mouse additions . What the heck is the use of ' Wales and the World ' for a start ? \u201c No wonder Russell Group universities who can get students from England with four A stars are not that interested . If I were a student I would n't touch it with a barge pole \u2013 even though I played a small part when I was chair of the WJEC in its development . \u201c Both the then chief executive and I discussed whether to bid for the pilot . We both agreed that it looked like nonsense but I argued that we needed the money and in any case we had to bid because we were the Welsh exam board . In the event we were the only organisation that decided to bid and then employed Keith Davies ( recently elected as the Labour AM for Llanelli ) to develop the idea . \u201d A Welsh Government spokesman said : \u201c Mr Jones ' comments are extremely disappointing \u2013 it is surprising that , as a former chair of WJEC , he would sanction a bid for a qualification that was , in his words , ' nonsense ' . \u201c The Welsh Baccalaureate has been largely welcomed by learners , parents and universities alike across the UK . It gives learners an added dimension , adds breadth to their learning and offers the skills which employers and universities alike are looking for . \u201c Some 44,000 university courses are listed on the UCAS website and over 30,000 of these courses specifically accept the WBQ as an entry qualification . UCAS , which manages the process of university entry , has awarded the advanced diploma 120 points . \u201c We 're sure Mr Jones ' former colleagues at the WJEC will be shocked and embarrassed by these comments . \u201d Mr Davies said : \u201c I find Jeff Jones ' comments on the Welsh Baccalaureate extremely insulting . There are many good examples of offers made to Welsh students from English universities such as Oxford that have included the Welsh Bac . \u201c Many schools report that their students have a much broader base having followed the Welsh Bac programme with its different components , including the essential skills and an individual investigation and that it enables them to perform well at interview as well as producing excellent personal statements . \u201d David Evans , Wales secretary of the National Union of Teachers , said : \u201c I am surprised Jeff Jones has come out and made these statements several years after the event . If that 's what he thought at the time , he should hang his head in shame for putting in a bid from the WJEC to run the Welsh Bac. Making these comments now smacks of scaremongering . \u201d Dr Philip Dixon , director of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers Cymru , said : \u201c Jeff Jones has got it wrong on several counts .

The West Indies had first innings leads in excess of two hundred in each of the first three Tests , yet were defied in the end by dogged and courageous batting performances by England 's players who seemed repentant for their earlier failings , and the extreme docility of the pitches which consistently refused to give the bowlers the help they were entitled to on the fifth day . In the second Test at Kingston , Amiss with 262 not out was England 's hero ; at Bridgetown in the third it was Fletcher , 129 not out . There had been no escape for England in the first Test , which West Indies won by seven wickets although Boycott and Amiss put on 209 for the first wicket in the second innings only to see the rest of the batsmen follow their first innings inclinations . At Georgetown in the fourth Test England at last started to play together . Then , before rain washed out the match , they looked like a team , whereas before they sometimes looked as if they had only just been introduced . In their worst moments they had been sustained by individual performances . So the sides came together for the return match at Port-of - Spain with England gathering confidence and the West Indies probably a little spent and disillusioned from their earlier efforts . The match was to be played over six days on a slow , turning pitch which was to England 's advantage . Not only is that the kind of cricket they have come to understand best in recent years , but it also meant that the spin bowlers would be able to play their full part . And what with injuries to Old and Hendrick which restricted selection , it was the slower bowlers throughout the tour who had been the more impressive . As it was , the match was one of batting collapses by both sides with the pressure Greig , as an off-spinner , was able to keep on the batsmen as he took thirteen wickets for 156 in the match . It is one of the ironies of the game that Underwood whose role in pinning the West Indies batsmen to defence was only a shade less important , took only one . Both bowled well , yet the rewards were disproportionate . The final performance by Greig set the accolade on his tour . He emerged from it as a giant among all - rounders with Test figures of 430 runs -- second only to Amiss -- and 24 wickets , 15 more than the next English bowler . His fielding too , was seldom less than brilliant , whether close to the bat or in defensive positions , and always his driving influence on the side was apparent . Indeed , it was even more apparent when he was not present ! Not surprisingly his success gave rise to conjecture about his future as England 's captain , especially as Denness 's performances , both as captain and as player , were less convincing . Yet there remained about Greig the doubt caused by his explosiveness when the desire to succeed seemed to overwhelm his judgement . He was very good at creating pressure in others , but he was not always so good at controlling it in himself . Undoubtedly Greig could end up as England 's captain , but there were moments on this tour when it would have been embarrassing had he been England 's current leader . The Kallicharran incident was the most important and the most publicised of these . Briefly it occurred when Greig , within the laws if not the spirit of the game , fielded the ball off the last ball of the day during the first Test and ran out Kallicharran who , in the ill-advised belief that play was over , had left the bowler 's crease on his way to the pavilion as Knott pulled up the stumps before the ball was dead . There was never any suggestion that Greig 's action had been anything but spontaneous . Malice was not one of the ingredients . Whatever the causes , the effect was devastating . After a long meeting between members of the West Indies Board of Control and representatives of M.C.C. , it was agreed as a compromise that the appeal should be withdrawn -- thus taking the onus off the umpires -- and that Kallicharran should be allowed to resume his innings . It is unlikely that his move was supportable in law and it brought derision from those who believe that the law is rigid and sacrosanct . Yet the issue in Port-of - Spain seemed clear enough . Either Kallicharran batted again or else the tour went on under the threat of crowd violence and a probable premature end . In a shrinking sport from which South Africa had already been excluded , could England risk alienating West Indies , possibly the most attractive cricketing combination in the world , over one incident of doubtful virtue ? The answer was obviously no . So the cricket went on and Greig , one of the game 's extroverts , by turns charmed and enraged the crowds . But whatever he did , he did it 100 per cent in England 's cause . He should inspire the side for years to come . Thus Greig as vice - captain gained more kudos than did Denness , the captain . The latter was handicapped by his inexperience in cricket at this level , both as a tactician and as a player . Organisation and planning seemed to be lacking from much of England 's efforts in the first half of the tour . It was not until the fourth Test that the West Indies battery of left-handed batsmen was adequately countered . Nor were Denness 's performances with the bat big enough or consistent enough to entitle him to hold the number three place in a Test side . His highest score was 67 and he twice more got into the forties . Indeed his record showed exactly the same weaknesses that had been apparent when he was in India . In that series he had established himself at the crease in every innings , yet his top score was 76 . How the success of his side in beating , if only in one match , a West Indies team who had earlier destroyed Illingworth 's side , was to affect his future as captain was one of the questions still to be answered when the party left for home . The genuine successes of the tour were confined to the older members of the party . The younger ones were disappointing . Amiss , no doubt to his own modest surprise , was a greater power than Boycott , who , after batting well in the first Test , did not again play with conviction until the last one . Amiss , who had scored two centuries and 99 in his previous three Tests outside England -- in Pakistan -- this time scored 663 runs , with three centuries , at an average of 82.87 . Throughout he played with such confidence that it was impossible to realise that an allegedly flawed temperament had once restricted his appearances for England . His power in the drive and the shot to mid wicket off his legs will stay in the memory even of spectators in the West Indies where they are used to seeing the ball struck willingly . The batting of Knott which had seemed to be in decline , revived to such an extent that he played an important part in the last three Tests , when he had four scores of over forty and one of 33 not out . It was his batting probably that decided the selectors ' vote in his favour at a time when Taylor was challenging strongly on wicket -keeping grounds . It remains a tragedy that a player of Taylor 's class should play not one Test match and only three first - class games in three months . Of the other batsmen Fletcher , who missed one Test through illness , played with great determination and skill in Barbados , but seldom looked a dominating player . Jameson played in two Tests and batted with great spirit in the other matches , but the brutal truth is that Test cricket is above his talent -- not that that ever affected his cheerfulness . The saddest figure on the tour was Hayes , the young man who after scoring a century in his first Test , began this campaign with the prospect of establishing himself as one of the side 's resident middle order batsmen . In the event he scored 60 runs in seven innings , and it can only be hoped that such a wound in a player of such evident skill will not take too long healing . It is fairly usual in modern times for England to return from abroad recounting tales of unreliability among the batsmen . The bowlers have generally been the dominant players . It was not true this time and in the long run that many cause more concern than any other feature of the cricket . If Greig had not struck such a golden vein with his new brand of off-spinners and off - cutters it is hard to know who would have got the West Indies side out . The quicker bowlers , so often a force for England , were a failure , a fact not altogether explained by the deadly slowness of the pitches . Willis , whose extra pace was expected to be important , played in three Tests and took only five wickets .

The West Indies had first innings leads in excess of two hundred in each of the first three Tests , yet were defied in the end by dogged and courageous batting performances by England 's players who seemed repentant for their earlier failings , and the extreme docility of the pitches which consistently refused to give the bowlers the help they were entitled to on the fifth day . In the second Test at Kingston , Amiss with 262 not out was England 's hero ; at Bridgetown in the third it was Fletcher , 129 not out . There had been no escape for England in the first Test , which West Indies won by seven wickets although Boycott and Amiss put on 209 for the first wicket in the second innings only to see the rest of the batsmen follow their first innings inclinations . At Georgetown in the fourth Test England at last started to play together . Then , before rain washed out the match , they looked like a team , whereas before they sometimes looked as if they had only just been introduced . In their worst moments they had been sustained by individual performances . So the sides came together for the return match at Port-of - Spain with England gathering confidence and the West Indies probably a little spent and disillusioned from their earlier efforts . The match was to be played over six days on a slow , turning pitch which was to England 's advantage . Not only is that the kind of cricket they have come to understand best in recent years , but it also meant that the spin bowlers would be able to play their full part . And what with injuries to Old and Hendrick which restricted selection , it was the slower bowlers throughout the tour who had been the more impressive . As it was , the match was one of batting collapses by both sides with the pressure Greig , as an off-spinner , was able to keep on the batsmen as he took thirteen wickets for 156 in the match . It is one of the ironies of the game that Underwood whose role in pinning the West Indies batsmen to defence was only a shade less important , took only one . Both bowled well , yet the rewards were disproportionate . The final performance by Greig set the accolade on his tour . He emerged from it as a giant among all - rounders with Test figures of 430 runs -- second only to Amiss -- and 24 wickets , 15 more than the next English bowler . His fielding too , was seldom less than brilliant , whether close to the bat or in defensive positions , and always his driving influence on the side was apparent . Indeed , it was even more apparent when he was not present ! Not surprisingly his success gave rise to conjecture about his future as England 's captain , especially as Denness 's performances , both as captain and as player , were less convincing . Yet there remained about Greig the doubt caused by his explosiveness when the desire to succeed seemed to overwhelm his judgement . He was very good at creating pressure in others , but he was not always so good at controlling it in himself . Undoubtedly Greig could end up as England 's captain , but there were moments on this tour when it would have been embarrassing had he been England 's current leader . The Kallicharran incident was the most important and the most publicised of these . Briefly it occurred when Greig , within the laws if not the spirit of the game , fielded the ball off the last ball of the day during the first Test and ran out Kallicharran who , in the ill-advised belief that play was over , had left the bowler 's crease on his way to the pavilion as Knott pulled up the stumps before the ball was dead . There was never any suggestion that Greig 's action had been anything but spontaneous . Malice was not one of the ingredients . Whatever the causes , the effect was devastating . After a long meeting between members of the West Indies Board of Control and representatives of M.C.C. , it was agreed as a compromise that the appeal should be withdrawn -- thus taking the onus off the umpires -- and that Kallicharran should be allowed to resume his innings . It is unlikely that his move was supportable in law and it brought derision from those who believe that the law is rigid and sacrosanct . Yet the issue in Port-of - Spain seemed clear enough . Either Kallicharran batted again or else the tour went on under the threat of crowd violence and a probable premature end . In a shrinking sport from which South Africa had already been excluded , could England risk alienating West Indies , possibly the most attractive cricketing combination in the world , over one incident of doubtful virtue ? The answer was obviously no . So the cricket went on and Greig , one of the game 's extroverts , by turns charmed and enraged the crowds . But whatever he did , he did it 100 per cent in England 's cause . He should inspire the side for years to come . Thus Greig as vice - captain gained more kudos than did Denness , the captain . The latter was handicapped by his inexperience in cricket at this level , both as a tactician and as a player . Organisation and planning seemed to be lacking from much of England 's efforts in the first half of the tour . It was not until the fourth Test that the West Indies battery of left-handed batsmen was adequately countered . Nor were Denness 's performances with the bat big enough or consistent enough to entitle him to hold the number three place in a Test side . His highest score was 67 and he twice more got into the forties . Indeed his record showed exactly the same weaknesses that had been apparent when he was in India . In that series he had established himself at the crease in every innings , yet his top score was 76 . How the success of his side in beating , if only in one match , a West Indies team who had earlier destroyed Illingworth 's side , was to affect his future as captain was one of the questions still to be answered when the party left for home . The genuine successes of the tour were confined to the older members of the party . The younger ones were disappointing . Amiss , no doubt to his own modest surprise , was a greater power than Boycott , who , after batting well in the first Test , did not again play with conviction until the last one . Amiss , who had scored two centuries and 99 in his previous three Tests outside England -- in Pakistan -- this time scored 663 runs , with three centuries , at an average of 82.87 . Throughout he played with such confidence that it was impossible to realise that an allegedly flawed temperament had once restricted his appearances for England . His power in the drive and the shot to mid wicket off his legs will stay in the memory even of spectators in the West Indies where they are used to seeing the ball struck willingly . The batting of Knott which had seemed to be in decline , revived to such an extent that he played an important part in the last three Tests , when he had four scores of over forty and one of 33 not out . It was his batting probably that decided the selectors ' vote in his favour at a time when Taylor was challenging strongly on wicket -keeping grounds . It remains a tragedy that a player of Taylor 's class should play not one Test match and only three first - class games in three months . Of the other batsmen Fletcher , who missed one Test through illness , played with great determination and skill in Barbados , but seldom looked a dominating player . Jameson played in two Tests and batted with great spirit in the other matches , but the brutal truth is that Test cricket is above his talent -- not that that ever affected his cheerfulness . The saddest figure on the tour was Hayes , the young man who after scoring a century in his first Test , began this campaign with the prospect of establishing himself as one of the side 's resident middle order batsmen . In the event he scored 60 runs in seven innings , and it can only be hoped that such a wound in a player of such evident skill will not take too long healing . It is fairly usual in modern times for England to return from abroad recounting tales of unreliability among the batsmen . The bowlers have generally been the dominant players . It was not true this time and in the long run that many cause more concern than any other feature of the cricket . If Greig had not struck such a golden vein with his new brand of off-spinners and off - cutters it is hard to know who would have got the West Indies side out . The quicker bowlers , so often a force for England , were a failure , a fact not altogether explained by the deadly slowness of the pitches . Willis , whose extra pace was expected to be important , played in three Tests and took only five wickets . Arnold , a destroyer in England , claimed two wickets in three Test matches , while Hendrick did not play in one at all . Old looked the best of the quick bowlers , yet only five batsmen fell to him in four matches . The spinners were no more successful in terms of wickets taken , yet they generally looked more controlled , except when Pocock tried to bring too much variety to his bowling . He , too , often forsakes consistency for experiment . Birkenshaw was steadier , although his batting proved him over - rated as an all - rounder against quick bowling , and Underwood was the perfect stock bowler , miserly and durable . In the final reckoning , England were allowed to come back on the batting collapses of West Indies , so often reckoned their strongest arm . Rowe , who made two single centuries and a triple hundred in Barbados , established himself as an exciting international player . His poise , his timing and his range of strokes all marked him as the latest in the line of outstanding West Indian batsmen . Fredericks , his opening partner , also played with great coolness and with an unfailing ability to hit the bad ball fiercely . Yet the reason for the batting collapses was apparent in the final averages . Kanhai , Lloyd and Sobers , players who have savaged the world 's best bowlers , had averages in the twenties . Their influence had waned and instead Kallicharran had joined Rowe among the new elite . In bowling , the West Indies effort was more widely spread than that of England . Julien , Sobers , Boyce and Gibbs all made telling contributions and each of them was capable of making a dangerous breakthrough . The regret was that the quicker bowlers so often relied upon the bouncer to achieve it -- although no more often than in past tours . Nevertheless , there were times when the number of bouncers amounted to intimidation . If the groundsmen in the West Indies would concentrate on preparing pitches that took some of the hopelessness out of bowling , such methods would not be necessary .

Rao was officially declared dead around 9 a.m. , but the end apparently came much earlier . The doctors who attended on him said that Rao suffered heart attacks twice on Monday night and breathed his last on Tuesday morning . His wife Narmada was kept on sedation till Tuesday late afternoon , but later came out when the urn containing the skeletal remains of Vaishnavi was brought for being taken along with the funeral procession of Rao . Narmada kept crying inconsolably looking at the urn and the dead body of her husband . An uncontrollable crowd thronged the residence of Rao at Ayodhya Nagar since morning when the news of his death spread . There was no respite in the number of people who seemed to only increase with each passing hour . Police threw up their hands as Ministers Dharmana Prasada Rao , K. Parthasarathy , Gade Venkata Reddy , Pithani Satyanarayana , TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu , Praja Rajyam president K. Chiranjeevi and BJP State president Bandaru Dattatreya came to pay their last respects to Rao and console the family members . The funeral procession started around 6 p.m. through the mass of humanity . Besides becoming successful in liquor , real estate and finance businesses , Rao was active in cultural field too and was one of the founders of the ' BC Ikya Vedika ' . Holding black flags , a few youngsters went round in the vicinity and urged the traders to observe bandh . In Guntur , police identified the mortal remains of Vaishnavi from a diamond earring from the boiler - cum- electric furnace at Autonagar . Her skull and pieces of backbone were recovered after a forensic expert visited the factory . The bones and ashes were shifted to Vijayawada . One of the accomplices of the main accused , Jagadish , who is believed to have brought the girl from Tadepalli to Guntur , surrendered before the Old Guntur police on Tuesday afternoon . Ramu and Radha , parents of Jagadish , living in Laljan Nagar , forced their son to surrender . He was taken to Vijayawada for interrogation .

Rao was officially declared dead around 9 a.m. , but the end apparently came much earlier . The doctors who attended on him said that Rao suffered heart attacks twice on Monday night and breathed his last on Tuesday morning . His wife Narmada was kept on sedation till Tuesday late afternoon , but later came out when the urn containing the skeletal remains of Vaishnavi was brought for being taken along with the funeral procession of Rao . Narmada kept crying inconsolably looking at the urn and the dead body of her husband . An uncontrollable crowd thronged the residence of Rao at Ayodhya Nagar since morning when the news of his death spread . There was no respite in the number of people who seemed to only increase with each passing hour . Police threw up their hands as Ministers Dharmana Prasada Rao , K. Parthasarathy , Gade Venkata Reddy , Pithani Satyanarayana , TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu , Praja Rajyam president K. Chiranjeevi and BJP State president Bandaru Dattatreya came to pay their last respects to Rao and console the family members . The funeral procession started around 6 p.m. through the mass of humanity . Besides becoming successful in liquor , real estate and finance businesses , Rao was active in cultural field too and was one of the founders of the ' BC Ikya Vedika ' . Holding black flags , a few youngsters went round in the vicinity and urged the traders to observe bandh . In Guntur , police identified the mortal remains of Vaishnavi from a diamond earring from the boiler - cum- electric furnace at Autonagar . Her skull and pieces of backbone were recovered after a forensic expert visited the factory . The bones and ashes were shifted to Vijayawada . One of the accomplices of the main accused , Jagadish , who is believed to have brought the girl from Tadepalli to Guntur , surrendered before the Old Guntur police on Tuesday afternoon . Ramu and Radha , parents of Jagadish , living in Laljan Nagar , forced their son to surrender . He was taken to Vijayawada for interrogation . Working for Sarada Industries owner -- Srinivasa Rao who is one of the accused in the case -- for the past two years , Jagdish seems to have helped Srinivasa Rao execute the entire plan .

Roadrunner Records ' latest signing , New York 's HINGE ( described as a less manic MUDVAYNE with the heaviness of SLIPKNOT ) , are putting the finishing touches to their debut release in upstate New York with producers Eddie Wohl ( PRIMER 55 ) , Steve Regina ( DREAM THEATER , DAYS OF THE NEW ) and Rob Caggiano ( BOILER ROOM ) from Scrap 60 Productions . 13 tracks are set to appear on the as-yet-untitled album , which will feature guest appearances from PRIMER 55's J-Sin and Bobby Burns . Among the titles that are set to be included on the CD are : ' Nightmare ' , ' Pain ' , ' Rot ' , ' Give up , Give In , Lie Down ' and ' The Strength I Call My Own ' . ' We 're all ready for the release of the record ' , states HINGE lead singer Cliff Rigano . ' It 's shaping up to be a hell of a year so far , and we 're excited about what 's to come .

However , after spending millions of pounds on top of the sale price to fight to keep GMG Radio , the company must consider the appeal to be worth the risk of failure . If Global Radio is forced to sell off the stations , it faces doing so in a market that is not flush with rivals likely to pay decent prices . The Competition Commission noted that it believed Bauer , the UK 's second largest radio operator , would also fall foul of competition law if it tried to take on most of GMG Radio . The third biggest player , TalkSport -owner UTV Media , offered a significantly lower sum when it was outbid for GMG Radio by Global Radio . Global Radio declined to comment .

That may mean this move proves to be largely symbolic , since the broker - dealers may not avail themselves of it either . The next measure would then be to allow them to use the TAF . Expect that to come soon . In addition , keep in mind that the JP Morgan deal for Bear does not necessarily mean that customer will not continue to flee . If the exodus continues , the firm might still have to declare bankruptcy , which could well be a systemic event . So the Fed is using whatever firepower it can marshal . From Greg Ip at the Wall Street Journal : In an extraordinary weekend move , the Federal Reserve announced the most dramatic expansion yet of its lending , promising to lend for up to six months to securities dealers under terms normally reserved only for tightly regulated banks . The Fed also cut the rate on such direct loans by a quarter of a percentage point , just two days before it is likely to slash interest rates more broadly . It cut the discount rate \u2014 ordinarily charged on direct loans to banks , and now also to securities dealers \u2014 to 3.25 % from 3.5 % . That narrows the spread with the more economically important federal - funds rate , now 3 % , to a quarter of a point . The Fed is also expected to cut the fed-funds rate target by at least half a point at its meeting tomorrow \u2026 . Since the current credit crisis began in August , the Fed has taken ever more innovative steps to push its remedies beyond the banking system . The Fed can lend with few constraints to banks through its \u201c discount window \u201d to prevent a shortage of cash caused by a temporary interruption or a generalized loss of confidence . But it has rarely lent to nonbanks , although it has had the authority to do so since 1932 , if five of its seven governors approve . It last lent under this authority in the 1930s . Even as it innovated in the current crisis , the Fed had avoided favoring a particular firm or class of securities . On Friday it crossed that line , stepping in to provide emergency funding to keep Bear Stearns afloat amid a severe cash crunch at the Wall Street firm . Adam Posen , a central - banking expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington , said other troubled firms claiming an equally critical position at the nexus of the financial system now \u201c have political and legal precedent to ask for \u201d help . He said the expectation of such help could also harden the negotiating position of a troubled firm , potentially complicating private- sector solutions . Fed officials say they did n't act to prevent a big firm from failing , but to prevent a firm enmeshed in critical markets from failing in a single day , causing a potentially huge disruption in the financial system . Fed officials do n't dispute that their decision carries \u201c moral hazard \u201d \u2014 the risk that any sort of bailout encourages more of the same risky behavior later . But they believe that compared with the alternative scenario , that cost is small . The funding is structured so that the greater benefit is to those who lent money to Bear Stearns in the \u201c repo \u201d market for secured , overnight loans , not to Bear Stearns itself . Moreover , they note it 's unlikely any firm will consider the loss Bear Stearns 's shareholders are likely to sustain as an acceptable price for taking the same risks in hopes of a bailout . Still , with the credit crisis showing no sign of ending , \u201c Thinking about the appropriate terms of bailouts is especially important if , as seems likely , other firms require similar help down the road , \u201d said Doug Elmendorf , a scholar at the Brookings Institution and former Fed economist . The Fed has intervened from time to time in specific situations , from Treasury loans to Mexico in 1994 to brokering the rescue of the hedge - fund Long Term Capital Management in 1998 . But it has been rare for the Fed to put its own money at risk . The most important example of this was in 1984 when it and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . lent billions to Continental Illinois . Efforts to find a buyer were fruitless and the federal government ultimately ended up owning most of the failed bank . \u201c The financial system is much more interconnected and opaque than in 1984 , \u201d says Kenneth Kuttner , a monetary economist at Oberlin College and former Fed staff economist . That has made \u201c the lender of last resort role much more complicated . \u201d The crisis , he said , is exposing \u201c the limitations and constraints \u201d of the rules laid out for the Fed in the Federal Reserve Act . Since the 1980s , Congress has limited the ability of regulators to prop up weak banks . At the same time , the financial system has moved away from insured deposits to other sources of funding . Securities dealers ' \u201c repo \u201d borrowings \u2014 short - term collateralized loans that grease the market for a wide variety of securities \u2014 have more than doubled to $ 4.5 trillion and now exceed banks ' federally insured deposits . Fed officials believe that multiple sources of credit have made the economy more resilient and less exposed to problems in banks . Less than a year ago , Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn predicted that with a more market - based and less bank - based system , the Fed would rely more on interest rates to stem crises than direct loans to market participants . But the Fed has already learned that interest - rate cuts alone are n't enough to stem the current crisis , and has not only had to use the discount window , but in ways it never thought likely . dis the fed and treasury are scared sh** less they are down this well aware of the unknown risks they are taking as they feel there is no other way to stabilize the situation . given that they do not and have no authority to regulate broker dealers it will really be temporary or in the future legislation will be passed to bring broker dealers under the fed umbrella . the fact that this action is for six months is scary as hell . they fed is thinking sh ** will be hitting the fan for six months !!!! i do not feel calmed whatsoever Anonymous The Fed , in its attempts to calm the panic , is acting so panicky that it 's having the opposite effect . The ultimate example that one should never , ever depend on government in any form to solve anything . FUBAR . TomD Yves Smith I was thinking of making a comparison between the crane collapse in New York and the state of our financial markets , but decided to leave that to other . The bar at the base of the little townhouse that was completely crushed was called Fubar . Anonymous \u201c The Fed , in its attempts to calm the panic , is acting so panicky that it 's having the opposite effect . \u201d Agreed . As an investor I have no idea what to do . Those negative yield TIPS are starting to look attractive after all . Maybe I should sell everything and store my entire net worth in nickels . Then if we get inflation I can smuggle the nickels across the border and melt them down , and if we get deflation I can just cash them in at face value . Obviously I 'm joking since it 's now illegal to export nickels outside the US . Anonymous Fubar worked , so \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. This could be the day of the Wahoo bird . That 's the bird that flies in ever-decreasing concentric circles until if flies up its own asshole screaming WAHOOOOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!! TomD John Stark Tom D : If government had done its job ( curbing the excesses of the greed - driven among us ) it would not now be trying to do the impossible . Does this crisis show the ineffectiveness of government ? Or the utter unreliability of our financial institutions and the people who run them so recklessly ? Or both ? Is it just the latest chapter in the long , long book of human folly ? Lune I ca n't believe the Fed would do something like this without thinking through the consequences . We 've already seen the law of unintended consequences so far : 1 ) Congress raises conforming limits on Fannie / Freddie to help unfreeze the mortgage market . Result : agency spreads skyrocket , bringing down Bear and a host of hedge funds . Mortgage markets still remain frozen . 2 ) Fed opens TSLF to unfreeze mortgage market . Result : Carlyle goes bankrupt as people rapidly arbitrage the difference between holding MBS in firms that can and ca n't access the new credit facility . Mortgage markets remain frozen . Now we have 3 ) Fed opens TSLF to broker-dealers . Given the track record of our esteemed Fed so far , I shudder to think what the unintended consequences of this one will be , and I 'm disturbed that it 's very likely that no one has thought about that while running around in a panic shooting from the hip at any shadow that comes up . Anyway , here 's my speculation \u2026 The Fed is already close to tapping its full balance sheet . The trigger for the collapse of the past few weeks has been the rise of agency spreads , which is the cause not the effect of all the implosions we 've seen so far . So to stop the panic , the Fed would have to intervene in the agency market . But it 's remaining reserves of ~ $ 400 bil is tiny compared to the amount of debt out there . Furthermore , even a full faith govt . guarantee is unlikely to stop the rise in premiums ( witness Ginnie Mae debt , where spreads are increasing even with a govt . guarantee ) . This is partially because of panic , and partially because agency debt will have fundamentally different behavior when it includes all the extra debt Congress is talking about stuffing it with . So with that uncertainty and unpredictability , it 's no wonder spreads are increasing . As the spreads continue to claim more casualties , more firms will line up for funding ( when do hedge funds get to drink directly from the punch bowl ? At this rate , probably in a week or two ) , and the Fed , unable to say no , will have to start issuing treasuries to expand its balance sheet . Within a matter of a month or two , the Fed will find itself with a trillion or so dollars of impaired debt in a \u201c repo \u201d that ca n't ever be recalled ( some because the counterparty 's balance sheet is still too weak , others because the counterparty has gone BK ) . The ultimate casualty ? The Fed itself , unable to lower interest rates below 0 % , facing default on collateral on its hands , and counterparties ( central banks ) unwilling to trust the Fed to manage the dollar any longer . Oh yeah , and mortgage markets will still be frozen . Happy St. Patrick 's day , Yves :-) Yves Smith Lune , That was a great comment . The Fed is already at the end of its debase the currency strategy . The ten -year Treasury auction last week stank . A steeper yield curve means more costly mortgages , unless people do floaters as they did in the inflationary 1970s ( they are n't so awful if they have interest rate ceilings and floors , but from what I can tell , no one has dusted off that product . Plus with subprime ARMs having taken down so many borrowers , you might have a problem with customer receptivity to the product ) . Lune Yves - That was the first unintended consequence , was n't it ? Lower overnight rates to unfreeze the mortgage market and watch 10 - year rates increase as people worry about inflation . I 'm wondering : if the demise of Carlyle and BSC was hastened because they were firms that could n't access Fed money and thus were foreclosed by firms that could , what will happen Monday ? I 'm thinking hedge funds , unable to access the Fed directly , will be eaten alive by the IBs . Why ? Because I 'm figuring they 'll find it safer to shut down hedge funds , take their collateral and convert it into Treasuries , even at the usual Fed haircut , rather than deal with the prolonged uncertainty and volatility of working with their hedge fund clients for an orderly unwind of their positions . When there was no choice but to choose option # 2 , plenty of IBs bent over backward to try to keep the hedgies afloat , lest the market collapse . But now , better to shut them down , stuff the Fed with the remaining crap , and sleep better at night knowing your collateral is now in Treasuries rather than illiquid and opaque hedge fund positions . Which IB out there would n't be willing to convert their whole CDS position into treasuries even at a 50 % discount ( especially since with a repo , if the CDSes do n't default , you 'll get them back at par when the storm has settled ) ? Yves Smith That 's an entirely plausible scenario . Eeek . I do n't know if I have the energy for another long post tonight ( all this drama is enervating ) , but I wanted to write one on the prisoner 's dilemma . We seem to be here now ( Eugene Linden sent me one of his pieces which argued that vampire bats do a better job than we humans do ) . If everyone sells each other out , like all the IBs shut down the levered hedgies ( they 've already started down that path ) , they might think they are improving their risk , but systemically you create a disaster and leave everyone worse off . If everyone showed a bit of forbearance right now , we 'd all be better off , but the mindset is \u201c devil take the hindmost . \u201d doc holiday Your story on The fed is just awful in what it implies ! They have lost control and at this point either they are retarded or have some hidden agenda . Re : JP Morgan . My theory is , the reason that JPM & The Fed offered $ 2B , was because this was an arms length deal , and in the end , JPM only had $ 2B in the vault . This price of $ 2 is as meaningless as The Fed opening the door for any shoeshine boy that needs to trade a bike for cash . The Fed Pawn Shop is not a welcome turn of events and , as usual , it would be nice to see some fringe element from this government to come forward to take control , or to investigate or to do something other than look like limp puppets in a mafia casino . We do n't even seem to have the press asking questions , it 's like deer in the headlight syndrome , where thoughts are frozen . Where the hell is DOJ , FTC or even IMF , NATO , maybe Colin Powell . Maybe this is what happens when Rome falls , people sit around looking at each other , reading the news , as buildings burn down \u2026.. This is getting weird yves ! Lune Prisoner 's dilemma indeed . As a commentator in another blog said : 2 rules of financial investing : 1 ) Do n't panic . 2 ) If you have to , panic first . As far as I can tell , the only reason banks did n't shut down hedge funds earlier is because all that crap would end up on their own books . But now that they have a reliable way of disposing of that stuff , why not ? It 's not like they have any fiduciary duty to the hedgies ' investors . The only reason hedge funds have n't done this yet is because they ca n't . In essence , I 'm afraid the Fed has created the mother of all arbitrage opportunities . If you have access to the Fed 's TSLF / TAF , then the Fed is acting as your market maker , able to convert your toxic bonds into liquid and safe treasuries for a price above what the private market will pay . But only a privileged few have access to the Fed . Thus , the banks are able to arbitrage the enormous difference between the private market for toxic debt and the public ( i.e. Fed ) market for toxic debt , leaving the private market ( i.e. hedge funds ) wiped out . Yves Smith Lune , The prime brokerage market is highly concentrated . Goldman , Morgan Stanley , Deutsche and Bear have about 75 % of the market , maybe 80 % .

With office rents in prime buildings rivalling those in Singapore and land prices also soaring , those with land are enjoying a windfall , while newcomers face a high cost of entry . Developers are focused on high - end projects in Yangon ( formerly known as Rangoon ) , where quality offices , apartments , hotels and retail spaces are all in short supply . Development has greatly accelerated with the lifting of sanctions , with the number of permitted high - rise projects in Yangon proliferating in mid-2013 . But developers have a long way to go to catch up with demand , and the pace of development is still restrained by the limited availability of prime land and domestic financing . Many of the business setting up in Yangon are in substandard spaces . A Relocating Population There are also major projects under way or planned to expand Yangon and accommodate an expected wave of urbanisation ( see analysis ) . A huge industrial zone is being planned with Japanese support in Thilawa , to Yangon 's south - east , which is expected to form the core of an entirely new outer district of the city . The Yangon City Development Committee ( YCDC ) has produced an ambitious urban plan that anticipates a near doubling of Yangon 's population to 10 m by 2040 . Myanmar 's second city of Mandalay is also seeing a renaissance thanks mainly to its strength as a tourist destination and a growing number of international flights . The newly built capital city of Naypyidaw , which dominated development during the last decade , also continues to see work on new housing , hotels and government buildings . Market Particulars Foreign citizens are not allowed to own land in Myanmar , and in any case privately owned freehold land is scarce , as most land is owned by the government and leased to building owners . However , Myanmar is increasing access to its real estate market with two important legal changes ( see analysis ) . A new Condominium Law that was expected to be adopted in early 2014 will allow foreigners to own condominium units , which in the local market is taken to mean apartment units in elevator buildings . And after a 2012 revision to the Foreign Investment Law , foreigners can invest in real estate development in two ways : through a joint venture , in which Myanmar citizens must own at least 20 % of the equity , or with up to 100 % ownership through a build - operate -transfer ( BOT ) lease agreement with the government , which are limited to 70 years . Foreigners can also get permission to take over BOT leases from locals . Some foreigners get around restrictions on land ownership by investing through trusts or nominees , according to Scipio Services , a Yangon - based real estate consultancy . The firm also warns clients that private leases of more than a year are unsupported by current law and untested in Myanmar courts . Landlords typically demand a full year of rent in advance . In addition , the maximum height of buildings in Yangon is set at 127 metres above sea level , which prevents skyscrapers from topping the sacred Shwedagon Pagoda . Within a 1.6 - km radius of the pagoda , buildings are limited to six storeys . Offices In The City Centre Central Yangon has only three class -A office towers : the Sakura Tower , the FMI Centre and tower one of the Centrepoint Towers . Space in them was already tight before sanctions were lifted , and since then it has become so competitive that by mid-2013 rates had reached around $ 1075 per sq metre per year , higher than the average in Singapore . Even deep- pocketed multinationals are being turned away by the high rents and the lack of available space . Quoted rents do not include utilities and various fees , which add another $ 65 to $ 183 per sq metre per year , or interior construction costs , which run $ 590 to $ 970 per sq metre , according to Scipio Services . The next addition to city centre class -A office space will come from the Shwe Taung International Commercial Centre , with 7150 sq metres of office space and 1850 sq metres of retail space , the finishing touches for which were still being completed as of early 2014 . According to Shwe Taung , a major developer - builder , 70 % of the building was already leased as of late 2012 . Next up is Traders Square , a $ 100 m , 20 - storey tower with 58,000 sq metres of total space set to open in 2015 . The developers , led by the Hong Kong - based Shangri - La group , were able to move quickly because the project was planned and allocated land in the mid1990s , when the neighbouring Traders Hotel was built , but mothballed due to the Asian financial crisis of 1997 . Traders Square broke ground in late 2012 . Climbing Higher Three other city centre projects were awaiting approval in August 2013 . The most advanced was a mixed - used project on a 4 - ha site called the Landmark Developments . The project is financed by Yoma Strategic Holdings , the Singapore-listed affiliate of Serge Pun & Associates , a Myanmar developer . The group owns First Myanmar Investment ( FMI ) , developer of the FMI Centre , which neighbours the site . The $ 350 m Landmark project includes a total of 65,000 sq metres of office space in two towers , two hotels , a condominium , serviced apartments and a mall . Yoma raised $ 82.5 m in November 2012 to finance the project but was still negotiating a crucial extension of an existing BOT lease on the site from its remaining 15 years to the maximum of 70 years allowed by law . Two other major city centre office projects were still in early discussion stages . The December Construction Company received permission to build a 120- metre - plus tower on a site it owns that is currently occupied by two cinemas . In July 2013 the firm solicited expressions of interest to design , build , finance and operate the project , called the Shwe Gon Tower . Also , Shwe Taung was reported in early 2013 to be in discussions with city authorities to build a 34 - storey tower by the Bogyoke Market . Both buildings would be built just under the legal maximum height . Offices Uptown Due to the lack of available land and increasing traffic congestion in the city centre , class -A office space is likely to be increasingly built outside the core central business district . In what city officials and real estate professionals say is a more fitting route for Yangon to develop , multiple business centres are beginning to emerge around the city . All these centres have the advantage of being closer to elite residential neighbourhoods and to the airport . One such outer centre is the east side of Inya Lake , north of the city centre on a road leading to Yangon airport . Here a single but very large project is under construction by Hoang Anh Gia Lai Group ( HAGL ) , a major Vietnamese developer - builder with experience in other South -east Asian countries . HAGL plans to invest $ 440 m in a mixed - use complex of high rises after securing a 70 - year BOT lease for a 6.5 - ha site in December 2012 in a first - of - its - kind international tender . Ground was broken in June 2013 . HAGL 's two - phase project includes a 27 - storey office and retail tower with 158,000 sq metres of total space to be completed in 2014 , and a second office tower with 68,000 sq metres to be completed in 2016 . The complex will also include a hotel and serviced apartments . The location neighbours the Sedona Hotel , a business favourite . Another emerging centre is on the west side of Inya Lake , also on a convenient route to the airport . This area has developed as a centre for oil and gas firms , many of which have converted villas and other buildings not originally designed as office space \u2013 a popular alternative in the city . In its first major foray into real estate , the oil and gas services company Myint & Associates is developing a 17 - storey office tower on Pyay Road . The tower was still under construction as of early 2014 , with the car park and landscaping expected to follow afterwards . There is one high - end office building already in the area , the low- rise International Business Centre , and a large Novotel hotel is under construction . A third centre rings Kandawgyi Lake , north of the city centre . Shwe Taung completed its Union Business Centre , a low - rise complex with 5300 sq metres of offices on a site on the lake 's northern side , in mid- to late 2013 . Further north in the Golden Valley neighbourhood , the Aye family is developing a 27- storey mixed - use tower , Diamond Valley Rises . The area is home to high - end hotels and embassies . The fourth emerging centre is Junction Square , on Pyay Road closer into town than Inya Lake . There Shwe Taung is expanding a popular high - end retail mall with a 19 - storey office tower and 21 - storey condominium , called the Crystal Tower and Crystal Residences , to be completed by 2015 . Finally , the Mayangon township north of Inya Lake is being targeted by the YCDC as the first of several new commercial and business centres identified in the Yangon 2040 urban expansion plan ( see analysis ) . Also in the neighbourhood , Living Square , making its foray into real estate , is developing a 27 - storey mixed - use office and residential tower called the Kabar Aye Executive Residence . Serviced Apartments The many international firms and expatriate investors moving to Yangon are driving demand for serviced apartments , which have become one of the hottest market segments . Rates as of summer 2013 began at around $ 125 a night or $ 2500 a month for the smallest apartments in the cheapest complexes , with asking rates north of $ 10,000 a month for three or more bedrooms in the better buildings . Most buildings are full and have waiting lists . The biggest planned development is part of HAGL 's $ 440 m mixed - use project on the east side of Inya Lake , which will include four towers with 1800 serviced apartments . The buildings are part of the project 's second phase , due to be completed in 2016 . The existing Marina Residence and MiCasa serviced apartments are also in this area . The project closest to completion was the Shangri- La Towers , a two -tower , 240 - unit serviced apartment complex in the Kandawgyi Lake area , which is being developed by the Shangri-La group . It was scheduled for completion in late 2013 , although one of the towers was still under construction as of early 2014 . In the city centre area , Yoma 's $ 300 m mixed - use Landmark Developments projects will see the vacated Grand Mee Yee Htah serviced apartments torn down and replaced with a new tower of serviced apartments . The elite residential neighbourhoods between Kandawgyi Lake and Inya Lake , including the Golden Valley and the Yangon University neighbourhood , are another favoured area for serviced apartments . The Sakura Residence , a 115 - apartment complex affiliated with the Sakura Tower , and the Golden Hill Tower , a two -tower , 215 - apartment complex , are in this area . Condominiums Yangon 's condominium market is also very tight , but is expected to get a big boost from a new Condominium Law that was expected to be ratified by early 2014 . The law would allow foreign citizens , who cannot own land , to own condominium units . Condominiums are defined in Myanmar as apartment units in elevator buildings . Allowing foreigners to buy condominiums would enable developers to finance construction by selling off plan , the traditional method in Myanmar of funding large residential construction . Myanmar citizens , who have few other domestic investment opportunities besides real estate , are also investing in condominium units as rental income properties . Apartments in elite complexes such as the Pearl , in the Golden Valley , and Shwe Hintha , on Pyay Road west of Inya Lake , are rented for rates that approach serviced apartments . The largest high - end condominium project under way is the $ 60 m , 34 - storey Diamond Inya Palace being built by Mandalay Golden Wings Construction and scheduled for completion in 2015 . It will be the highest building in Myanmar , just under the legal limit . But due to the slightly higher elevation of its location , in the Mayangon township north of Inya Lake , it is likely to be topped in ground - to - tip height by city centre office towers . The L-shaped building will include 406 apartments . Other high - end projects include a $ 50 m , 250 - unit group of towers planned by a joint venture of Singapore 's Soilbuild Group and Myanmar 's Ayeyar Hinthar Group on the east side of Inya Lake , and Shwe Taung 's Crystal Residence , a 21 - storey condominium at Junction Square , due for completion in 2015 . Much of the unmet demand for higher - end residential space is being forced into mid-range condominiums with lower service levels and less desirable locations . Residential Communities The Serge Pun group , including its affiliates Yoma and FMI , dominates the development of large residential communities in Yangon 's outer districts . Two projects , FMI City and Pun Hlaing Golf Estate , are located on a combined total of more than 445 ha of land in the Hlaing Thar Yar township in the north - west outskirts of Yangon , across the Hlaing river from the Pyay Road and Mayangon neighbourhoods . FMI City , launched in 1995 and nearing completion , has more than 2000 single - family , villa - style houses , while the higher - end Pun Hlaing Golf Estate , launched in 2000 , had sold more than 330 homes out of up to 800 planned . Pun Hlaing features an international school and private hospital , and many of its homes are rental properties catering to expatriate executives . On the opposite end of town , in the Thanlyin district , across the Bago river on Yangon 's south - eastern outskirts , the group is developing Thanlyin Star City , a community of mid-rise condominiums planned to include 9000 apartments . Hotels The rapid growth of tourism has made hotels another top focus for developers ( see Tourism chapter ) . Projects delayed due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis and international sanctions have been revived and are heading for completion in 2013 - 14 , including the 300 - room Hilton Yangon , part of the Centrepoint Towers , the 315 - room Emerald Rose Garden Hotel and the 366- room Novotel Yangon . Shangri - La was also reviving an old project for completion in 2017 , while HAGL 's mixed - use project includes a 412 - room hotel and Yoma 's Landmark Developments includes two : a tower and a renovation of the colonial railway building . Retail Most recent and planned retail development is within mixed - use projects . HAGL 's and Yoma 's large mixed - use projects both include retail malls , and many smaller projects feature retail space on lower floors . For example , Singapore 's Parkson opened a four-floor department store in the lower levels of the FMI Centre in central Yangon in May 2013 . Among stand - alone malls , the most successful has been Junction Square , a 28,000 - sq - metre mall that Shwe Taung is expanding into a mixed - use site . Myanmar 's dominant grocery store chain , City Mart , has expanded into real estate as well , developing mini-malls attached to its markets . Outside Yangon After dominating the real estate sector for most of the previous decade , development in the new capital city of Naypyidaw , which was built from scratch starting in 2002 , is slowing down and playing second fiddle to the much hotter market in Yangon . However , government offices are still in the process of relocating from Yangon , driving demand for residential real estate . Hotels are also a major focus of development in Naypyidaw and the tourist destinations of Mandalay , Bagan , Inle Lake , Ngapali and Ngwe Saung . Mandalay , although larger than Naypyidaw , has a smaller upper class and a quieter real estate market . Its economy is being boosted by increasing tourism and a growing number of direct international flights . The most notable projects there are the 280 - room Novotel Mandalay Mingalar hotel , scheduled to open in 2015 , and a 17,000 - sq - metre mall , the Yadanarpon Super Centre and Yadanarpon Diamond Centre , built in 2010 by Mandalay Golden Wings . Outlook As Brett Miller , managing director of Scipio Services , told OBG , \u201c There are two main events that will drastically effect FDI within the construction sector : the condominium law expected in 2014 and the election in 2015 . Many foreign developers we speak with are waiting for the condominium law so they 're able to own and pre-sell units to fund the construction of projects , and still others are planning to wait and see the results of the 2015 election . \u201d Further out , the market will remain hot for the foreseeable future , especially if the large amount of oil and gas exploration under way yields results . Although the number of high - end projects being permitted accelerated in mid-2013 , relatively few high - end buildings were slated for completion by 2016 , and it is likely that some will arrive behind schedule . Judging from the experience of Vietnam , which went through a somewhat comparable transition from isolation to welcoming foreign investment beginning in the 1990s , Myanmar is likely to enjoy a catch - up period of intensive real estate investment . The greatest challenge for the market will be obtaining financing . The domestic financial system is too weak to support all the development the country needs , and restrictions on foreign ownership make it difficult for investors to utilise Myanmar 's existing real estate assets as collateral against foreign bank loans . U Win Khaing , president of the Myanmar Engineering Society , told OBG one of the most important reforms needed was to allow foreign banks to conduct banking operations in Myanmar . \u201c We have dozens of foreign banks lining up to open representative offices , but the central bank still is not ready to issue them banking licences , \u201d he said .

With office rents in prime buildings rivalling those in Singapore and land prices also soaring , those with land are enjoying a windfall , while newcomers face a high cost of entry . Developers are focused on high - end projects in Yangon ( formerly known as Rangoon ) , where quality offices , apartments , hotels and retail spaces are all in short supply . Development has greatly accelerated with the lifting of sanctions , with the number of permitted high - rise projects in Yangon proliferating in mid-2013 . But developers have a long way to go to catch up with demand , and the pace of development is still restrained by the limited availability of prime land and domestic financing . Many of the business setting up in Yangon are in substandard spaces . A Relocating Population There are also major projects under way or planned to expand Yangon and accommodate an expected wave of urbanisation ( see analysis ) . A huge industrial zone is being planned with Japanese support in Thilawa , to Yangon 's south - east , which is expected to form the core of an entirely new outer district of the city . The Yangon City Development Committee ( YCDC ) has produced an ambitious urban plan that anticipates a near doubling of Yangon 's population to 10 m by 2040 . Myanmar 's second city of Mandalay is also seeing a renaissance thanks mainly to its strength as a tourist destination and a growing number of international flights . The newly built capital city of Naypyidaw , which dominated development during the last decade , also continues to see work on new housing , hotels and government buildings . Market Particulars Foreign citizens are not allowed to own land in Myanmar , and in any case privately owned freehold land is scarce , as most land is owned by the government and leased to building owners . However , Myanmar is increasing access to its real estate market with two important legal changes ( see analysis ) . A new Condominium Law that was expected to be adopted in early 2014 will allow foreigners to own condominium units , which in the local market is taken to mean apartment units in elevator buildings . And after a 2012 revision to the Foreign Investment Law , foreigners can invest in real estate development in two ways : through a joint venture , in which Myanmar citizens must own at least 20 % of the equity , or with up to 100 % ownership through a build - operate -transfer ( BOT ) lease agreement with the government , which are limited to 70 years . Foreigners can also get permission to take over BOT leases from locals . Some foreigners get around restrictions on land ownership by investing through trusts or nominees , according to Scipio Services , a Yangon - based real estate consultancy . The firm also warns clients that private leases of more than a year are unsupported by current law and untested in Myanmar courts . Landlords typically demand a full year of rent in advance . In addition , the maximum height of buildings in Yangon is set at 127 metres above sea level , which prevents skyscrapers from topping the sacred Shwedagon Pagoda . Within a 1.6 - km radius of the pagoda , buildings are limited to six storeys . Offices In The City Centre Central Yangon has only three class -A office towers : the Sakura Tower , the FMI Centre and tower one of the Centrepoint Towers . Space in them was already tight before sanctions were lifted , and since then it has become so competitive that by mid-2013 rates had reached around $ 1075 per sq metre per year , higher than the average in Singapore . Even deep- pocketed multinationals are being turned away by the high rents and the lack of available space . Quoted rents do not include utilities and various fees , which add another $ 65 to $ 183 per sq metre per year , or interior construction costs , which run $ 590 to $ 970 per sq metre , according to Scipio Services . The next addition to city centre class -A office space will come from the Shwe Taung International Commercial Centre , with 7150 sq metres of office space and 1850 sq metres of retail space , the finishing touches for which were still being completed as of early 2014 . According to Shwe Taung , a major developer - builder , 70 % of the building was already leased as of late 2012 . Next up is Traders Square , a $ 100 m , 20 - storey tower with 58,000 sq metres of total space set to open in 2015 . The developers , led by the Hong Kong - based Shangri - La group , were able to move quickly because the project was planned and allocated land in the mid1990s , when the neighbouring Traders Hotel was built , but mothballed due to the Asian financial crisis of 1997 . Traders Square broke ground in late 2012 . Climbing Higher Three other city centre projects were awaiting approval in August 2013 . The most advanced was a mixed - used project on a 4 - ha site called the Landmark Developments . The project is financed by Yoma Strategic Holdings , the Singapore-listed affiliate of Serge Pun & Associates , a Myanmar developer . The group owns First Myanmar Investment ( FMI ) , developer of the FMI Centre , which neighbours the site . The $ 350 m Landmark project includes a total of 65,000 sq metres of office space in two towers , two hotels , a condominium , serviced apartments and a mall . Yoma raised $ 82.5 m in November 2012 to finance the project but was still negotiating a crucial extension of an existing BOT lease on the site from its remaining 15 years to the maximum of 70 years allowed by law . Two other major city centre office projects were still in early discussion stages . The December Construction Company received permission to build a 120- metre - plus tower on a site it owns that is currently occupied by two cinemas . In July 2013 the firm solicited expressions of interest to design , build , finance and operate the project , called the Shwe Gon Tower . Also , Shwe Taung was reported in early 2013 to be in discussions with city authorities to build a 34 - storey tower by the Bogyoke Market . Both buildings would be built just under the legal maximum height . Offices Uptown Due to the lack of available land and increasing traffic congestion in the city centre , class -A office space is likely to be increasingly built outside the core central business district . In what city officials and real estate professionals say is a more fitting route for Yangon to develop , multiple business centres are beginning to emerge around the city . All these centres have the advantage of being closer to elite residential neighbourhoods and to the airport . One such outer centre is the east side of Inya Lake , north of the city centre on a road leading to Yangon airport . Here a single but very large project is under construction by Hoang Anh Gia Lai Group ( HAGL ) , a major Vietnamese developer - builder with experience in other South -east Asian countries . HAGL plans to invest $ 440 m in a mixed - use complex of high rises after securing a 70 - year BOT lease for a 6.5 - ha site in December 2012 in a first - of - its - kind international tender . Ground was broken in June 2013 . HAGL 's two - phase project includes a 27 - storey office and retail tower with 158,000 sq metres of total space to be completed in 2014 , and a second office tower with 68,000 sq metres to be completed in 2016 . The complex will also include a hotel and serviced apartments . The location neighbours the Sedona Hotel , a business favourite . Another emerging centre is on the west side of Inya Lake , also on a convenient route to the airport . This area has developed as a centre for oil and gas firms , many of which have converted villas and other buildings not originally designed as office space \u2013 a popular alternative in the city . In its first major foray into real estate , the oil and gas services company Myint & Associates is developing a 17 - storey office tower on Pyay Road . The tower was still under construction as of early 2014 , with the car park and landscaping expected to follow afterwards . There is one high - end office building already in the area , the low- rise International Business Centre , and a large Novotel hotel is under construction . A third centre rings Kandawgyi Lake , north of the city centre . Shwe Taung completed its Union Business Centre , a low - rise complex with 5300 sq metres of offices on a site on the lake 's northern side , in mid- to late 2013 . Further north in the Golden Valley neighbourhood , the Aye family is developing a 27- storey mixed - use tower , Diamond Valley Rises . The area is home to high - end hotels and embassies . The fourth emerging centre is Junction Square , on Pyay Road closer into town than Inya Lake . There Shwe Taung is expanding a popular high - end retail mall with a 19 - storey office tower and 21 - storey condominium , called the Crystal Tower and Crystal Residences , to be completed by 2015 . Finally , the Mayangon township north of Inya Lake is being targeted by the YCDC as the first of several new commercial and business centres identified in the Yangon 2040 urban expansion plan ( see analysis ) . Also in the neighbourhood , Living Square , making its foray into real estate , is developing a 27 - storey mixed - use office and residential tower called the Kabar Aye Executive Residence . Serviced Apartments The many international firms and expatriate investors moving to Yangon are driving demand for serviced apartments , which have become one of the hottest market segments . Rates as of summer 2013 began at around $ 125 a night or $ 2500 a month for the smallest apartments in the cheapest complexes , with asking rates north of $ 10,000 a month for three or more bedrooms in the better buildings . Most buildings are full and have waiting lists . The biggest planned development is part of HAGL 's $ 440 m mixed - use project on the east side of Inya Lake , which will include four towers with 1800 serviced apartments . The buildings are part of the project 's second phase , due to be completed in 2016 . The existing Marina Residence and MiCasa serviced apartments are also in this area . The project closest to completion was the Shangri- La Towers , a two -tower , 240 - unit serviced apartment complex in the Kandawgyi Lake area , which is being developed by the Shangri-La group . It was scheduled for completion in late 2013 , although one of the towers was still under construction as of early 2014 . In the city centre area , Yoma 's $ 300 m mixed - use Landmark Developments projects will see the vacated Grand Mee Yee Htah serviced apartments torn down and replaced with a new tower of serviced apartments . The elite residential neighbourhoods between Kandawgyi Lake and Inya Lake , including the Golden Valley and the Yangon University neighbourhood , are another favoured area for serviced apartments . The Sakura Residence , a 115 - apartment complex affiliated with the Sakura Tower , and the Golden Hill Tower , a two -tower , 215 - apartment complex , are in this area . Condominiums Yangon 's condominium market is also very tight , but is expected to get a big boost from a new Condominium Law that was expected to be ratified by early 2014 . The law would allow foreign citizens , who cannot own land , to own condominium units . Condominiums are defined in Myanmar as apartment units in elevator buildings . Allowing foreigners to buy condominiums would enable developers to finance construction by selling off plan , the traditional method in Myanmar of funding large residential construction . Myanmar citizens , who have few other domestic investment opportunities besides real estate , are also investing in condominium units as rental income properties . Apartments in elite complexes such as the Pearl , in the Golden Valley , and Shwe Hintha , on Pyay Road west of Inya Lake , are rented for rates that approach serviced apartments . The largest high - end condominium project under way is the $ 60 m , 34 - storey Diamond Inya Palace being built by Mandalay Golden Wings Construction and scheduled for completion in 2015 . It will be the highest building in Myanmar , just under the legal limit . But due to the slightly higher elevation of its location , in the Mayangon township north of Inya Lake , it is likely to be topped in ground - to - tip height by city centre office towers . The L-shaped building will include 406 apartments . Other high - end projects include a $ 50 m , 250 - unit group of towers planned by a joint venture of Singapore 's Soilbuild Group and Myanmar 's Ayeyar Hinthar Group on the east side of Inya Lake , and Shwe Taung 's Crystal Residence , a 21 - storey condominium at Junction Square , due for completion in 2015 . Much of the unmet demand for higher - end residential space is being forced into mid-range condominiums with lower service levels and less desirable locations . Residential Communities The Serge Pun group , including its affiliates Yoma and FMI , dominates the development of large residential communities in Yangon 's outer districts . Two projects , FMI City and Pun Hlaing Golf Estate , are located on a combined total of more than 445 ha of land in the Hlaing Thar Yar township in the north - west outskirts of Yangon , across the Hlaing river from the Pyay Road and Mayangon neighbourhoods . FMI City , launched in 1995 and nearing completion , has more than 2000 single - family , villa - style houses , while the higher - end Pun Hlaing Golf Estate , launched in 2000 , had sold more than 330 homes out of up to 800 planned . Pun Hlaing features an international school and private hospital , and many of its homes are rental properties catering to expatriate executives . On the opposite end of town , in the Thanlyin district , across the Bago river on Yangon 's south - eastern outskirts , the group is developing Thanlyin Star City , a community of mid-rise condominiums planned to include 9000 apartments . Hotels The rapid growth of tourism has made hotels another top focus for developers ( see Tourism chapter ) . Projects delayed due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis and international sanctions have been revived and are heading for completion in 2013 - 14 , including the 300 - room Hilton Yangon , part of the Centrepoint Towers , the 315 - room Emerald Rose Garden Hotel and the 366- room Novotel Yangon . Shangri - La was also reviving an old project for completion in 2017 , while HAGL 's mixed - use project includes a 412 - room hotel and Yoma 's Landmark Developments includes two : a tower and a renovation of the colonial railway building . Retail Most recent and planned retail development is within mixed - use projects . HAGL 's and Yoma 's large mixed - use projects both include retail malls , and many smaller projects feature retail space on lower floors . For example , Singapore 's Parkson opened a four-floor department store in the lower levels of the FMI Centre in central Yangon in May 2013 . Among stand - alone malls , the most successful has been Junction Square , a 28,000 - sq - metre mall that Shwe Taung is expanding into a mixed - use site . Myanmar 's dominant grocery store chain , City Mart , has expanded into real estate as well , developing mini-malls attached to its markets . Outside Yangon After dominating the real estate sector for most of the previous decade , development in the new capital city of Naypyidaw , which was built from scratch starting in 2002 , is slowing down and playing second fiddle to the much hotter market in Yangon . However , government offices are still in the process of relocating from Yangon , driving demand for residential real estate . Hotels are also a major focus of development in Naypyidaw and the tourist destinations of Mandalay , Bagan , Inle Lake , Ngapali and Ngwe Saung . Mandalay , although larger than Naypyidaw , has a smaller upper class and a quieter real estate market . Its economy is being boosted by increasing tourism and a growing number of direct international flights . The most notable projects there are the 280 - room Novotel Mandalay Mingalar hotel , scheduled to open in 2015 , and a 17,000 - sq - metre mall , the Yadanarpon Super Centre and Yadanarpon Diamond Centre , built in 2010 by Mandalay Golden Wings . Outlook As Brett Miller , managing director of Scipio Services , told OBG , \u201c There are two main events that will drastically effect FDI within the construction sector : the condominium law expected in 2014 and the election in 2015 . Many foreign developers we speak with are waiting for the condominium law so they 're able to own and pre-sell units to fund the construction of projects , and still others are planning to wait and see the results of the 2015 election . \u201d Further out , the market will remain hot for the foreseeable future , especially if the large amount of oil and gas exploration under way yields results . Although the number of high - end projects being permitted accelerated in mid-2013 , relatively few high - end buildings were slated for completion by 2016 , and it is likely that some will arrive behind schedule . Judging from the experience of Vietnam , which went through a somewhat comparable transition from isolation to welcoming foreign investment beginning in the 1990s , Myanmar is likely to enjoy a catch - up period of intensive real estate investment . The greatest challenge for the market will be obtaining financing . The domestic financial system is too weak to support all the development the country needs , and restrictions on foreign ownership make it difficult for investors to utilise Myanmar 's existing real estate assets as collateral against foreign bank loans . U Win Khaing , president of the Myanmar Engineering Society , told OBG one of the most important reforms needed was to allow foreign banks to conduct banking operations in Myanmar . \u201c We have dozens of foreign banks lining up to open representative offices , but the central bank still is not ready to issue them banking licences , \u201d he said .

Arnold Schwarzenegger 's special election agenda Tuesday , handing the governor a humbling loss after he gambled on a high - stakes plan to reshape state government . With more than three - quarters of the votes counted , the four initiatives that Schwarzenegger said were needed to reform California were all losing . The centerpiece of the governor 's agenda , Proposition 76 , which would limit state spending , was trailing badly . Proposition 77 , which would strip lawmakers of the ability to draw political voting districts ; Proposition 74 , which would lengthen the time it takes for public school teachers to get tenure ; and Proposition 75 , aimed at curbing public employee unions ' political spending , were also losing . Four other ballot measures appeared on the special election ballot , and early returns showed two rival measures to lower the price of prescription drugs for uninsured Californians failing . A measure that would have made changes to the state 's electricity market was failing , while an initiative that would require girls 18 or under to notify their parents before getting an abortion was losing narrowly . The election results appeared to be a major setback for Schwarzenegger , who called for the vote but never succeeded in convincing Californians that it was needed . The election sparked a political brawl that invigorated Democrats and labor unions , who mounted a relentless , yearlong attack that showed that even a governor who once appeared invincible is no match for nurses , teachers and firefighters . Two years after an angry electorate looking for a new voice in Sacramento thrust Schwarzenegger into office , voters appear to have turned their anger back on him . The governor clearly recognized that Tuesday night . Taking the stage in a huge ballroom at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills , Schwarzenegger did not concede . But he did reach out to his opponents -- thanking Californians for participating in the election and thanking those \" who were so passionately vocal against us . \" The governor insisted Californians still want big changes , but seemed to acknowledge his \" Year of Reform \" focused on the wrong things . \" We need more nurses , teachers , firefighters and police officers , \" said the governor , singling out the groups that had targeted him . \" We need more affordable housing , more energy and more water . We need more of everything , and I recognize that we also need more bipartisan cooperation . I promise I will deliver that . \" \" The people of California are sick and tired of all the fighting , \" he added . In contrast to the somber mood in Schwarzenegger 's camp , his opponents were jubilant . Lou Paulson , president of the California Professional Firefighters , raised a broom over his head as it became clear all four of Schwarzenegger 's initiatives would fail , leading a party in a Sacramento hotel in chants of \" Sweep ! \" Democratic lawmakers were less strident . While declaring that Schwarzenegger \" took a wrong turn in January and we wasted a year , \" Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata , D-Oakland , pledged to work with Schwarzenegger next year . \" Win or lose , we have to put this behind us , \" he said . \" I do n't think anybody should be taking a victory lap . \" Tuesday marked the end of a bitter and costly brawl that Schwarzenegger sparked in January , with a combative State of the State speech in which he predicted a \" big political fight . \" The election became the costliest in state history , and Schwarzenegger sank more than $ 7 million of his own money into his losing effort . The anti-Schwarzenegger coalition raised and spent more than $ 100 million against him . Both Prop. 75 and 76 were , to labor leaders , direct assaults aimed at tilting the balance of power in Sacramento . Schwarzenegger campaigned for his initiatives by saying the election was a sequel to the recall . Labor and Democrats characterized the election as unnecessary and polarizing . The anti-Schwarzenegger coalition was a vast , sophisticated political machine that played on public sympathies . \" You do n't win many fights with nurses , \" noted Jack Pitney , a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College . The California Teachers Association ran commercials complaining about his education budget . The California Nurses Association protested his appearances -- union leaders bragged this week that they have had a presence at more than 100 of Schwarzenegger 's public events this year . Fittingly , the union staged a party in the same hotel as Schwarzenegger on Tuesday night . The attacks seemed to work , cutting Schwarzenegger 's approval rating among voters in half by June , according to statewide Field Polls . Only about a third of voters polled said they approve of the governor . Schwarzenegger largely ignored the assault , something supporters say was a mistake . \" There are a lot of us who wanted him to fight back much earlier , \" said Mike Spence , president of the California Republican Assembly , a conservative group . Other stumbles also cost the governor . Two of the four issues Schwarzenegger first promoted in January -- capping state expenses for public pensions and paying teachers based on merit instead of tenure -- were dropped . And by spending much of the year raising money from corporate donors , and then running a campaign that featured mostly controlled events among GOP supporters , some political observers believe Schwarzenegger made it easier for foes to portray him as pushing a Republican agenda . Issues like redistricting and teacher performance are n't necessarily partisan issues , noted Republican political consultant Kevin Spillane , but the governor 's opponents were able to paint Schwarzenegger 's entire agenda as a Republican power grab . \" His team seems to have played right into the hands of the opponents , \" said Spillane . Ironically , observers said , the man who ousted former Gov. Gray Davis , who was the ultimate political insider , ran a sheltered campaign that never connected with the people Schwarzenegger claimed to represent . \" He 's been hidden , and he 's been packaged , and he clearly did n't learn the lesson of Gray Davis , which is you need to be out there talking to real people , \" said Darry Sragow , a longtime Democratic strategist . Schwarzenegger stormed up and down the state in the last few weeks arguing that the special election was a sequel to the recall and that his initiatives were the tools he needed to fix a broken system . He also railed against \" union bosses \" that he characterized as controlling the Capitol , saying yesterday \" the government is no longer accountable to the people . \" Many political observers say Schwarzenegger tried to do too much . \" Too many issues and too many enemies , \" said Phil Trounstine , a former communications director for Davis and now director of the Survey and Policy Research Institute at San Jose State University .

A measure that would have made changes to the state 's electricity market was failing , while an initiative that would require girls 18 or under to notify their parents before getting an abortion was losing narrowly . The election results appeared to be a major setback for Schwarzenegger , who called for the vote but never succeeded in convincing Californians that it was needed . The election sparked a political brawl that invigorated Democrats and labor unions , who mounted a relentless , yearlong attack that showed that even a governor who once appeared invincible is no match for nurses , teachers and firefighters . Two years after an angry electorate looking for a new voice in Sacramento thrust Schwarzenegger into office , voters appear to have turned their anger back on him . The governor clearly recognized that Tuesday night . Taking the stage in a huge ballroom at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills , Schwarzenegger did not concede . But he did reach out to his opponents -- thanking Californians for participating in the election and thanking those \" who were so passionately vocal against us . \" The governor insisted Californians still want big changes , but seemed to acknowledge his \" Year of Reform \" focused on the wrong things . \" We need more nurses , teachers , firefighters and police officers , \" said the governor , singling out the groups that had targeted him . \" We need more affordable housing , more energy and more water . We need more of everything , and I recognize that we also need more bipartisan cooperation . I promise I will deliver that . \" \" The people of California are sick and tired of all the fighting , \" he added . In contrast to the somber mood in Schwarzenegger 's camp , his opponents were jubilant . Lou Paulson , president of the California Professional Firefighters , raised a broom over his head as it became clear all four of Schwarzenegger 's initiatives would fail , leading a party in a Sacramento hotel in chants of \" Sweep ! \" Democratic lawmakers were less strident . While declaring that Schwarzenegger \" took a wrong turn in January and we wasted a year , \" Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata , D-Oakland , pledged to work with Schwarzenegger next year . \" Win or lose , we have to put this behind us , \" he said . \" I do n't think anybody should be taking a victory lap . \" Tuesday marked the end of a bitter and costly brawl that Schwarzenegger sparked in January , with a combative State of the State speech in which he predicted a \" big political fight . \" The election became the costliest in state history , and Schwarzenegger sank more than $ 7 million of his own money into his losing effort . The anti-Schwarzenegger coalition raised and spent more than $ 100 million against him . Both Prop. 75 and 76 were , to labor leaders , direct assaults aimed at tilting the balance of power in Sacramento . Schwarzenegger campaigned for his initiatives by saying the election was a sequel to the recall . Labor and Democrats characterized the election as unnecessary and polarizing . The anti-Schwarzenegger coalition was a vast , sophisticated political machine that played on public sympathies . \" You do n't win many fights with nurses , \" noted Jack Pitney , a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College . The California Teachers Association ran commercials complaining about his education budget . The California Nurses Association protested his appearances -- union leaders bragged this week that they have had a presence at more than 100 of Schwarzenegger 's public events this year . Fittingly , the union staged a party in the same hotel as Schwarzenegger on Tuesday night . The attacks seemed to work , cutting Schwarzenegger 's approval rating among voters in half by June , according to statewide Field Polls . Only about a third of voters polled said they approve of the governor . Schwarzenegger largely ignored the assault , something supporters say was a mistake . \" There are a lot of us who wanted him to fight back much earlier , \" said Mike Spence , president of the California Republican Assembly , a conservative group . Other stumbles also cost the governor . Two of the four issues Schwarzenegger first promoted in January -- capping state expenses for public pensions and paying teachers based on merit instead of tenure -- were dropped . And by spending much of the year raising money from corporate donors , and then running a campaign that featured mostly controlled events among GOP supporters , some political observers believe Schwarzenegger made it easier for foes to portray him as pushing a Republican agenda . Issues like redistricting and teacher performance are n't necessarily partisan issues , noted Republican political consultant Kevin Spillane , but the governor 's opponents were able to paint Schwarzenegger 's entire agenda as a Republican power grab . \" His team seems to have played right into the hands of the opponents , \" said Spillane . Ironically , observers said , the man who ousted former Gov. Gray Davis , who was the ultimate political insider , ran a sheltered campaign that never connected with the people Schwarzenegger claimed to represent . \" He 's been hidden , and he 's been packaged , and he clearly did n't learn the lesson of Gray Davis , which is you need to be out there talking to real people , \" said Darry Sragow , a longtime Democratic strategist . Schwarzenegger stormed up and down the state in the last few weeks arguing that the special election was a sequel to the recall and that his initiatives were the tools he needed to fix a broken system . He also railed against \" union bosses \" that he characterized as controlling the Capitol , saying yesterday \" the government is no longer accountable to the people . \" Many political observers say Schwarzenegger tried to do too much . \" Too many issues and too many enemies , \" said Phil Trounstine , a former communications director for Davis and now director of the Survey and Policy Research Institute at San Jose State University .

That 's what we want to know . The Home Alive benefit shows are , as ATN previously reported , planned in three cities : Seattle , San Francisco and New York . Two shows in Seattle will be free , while there will be a cover charge for the shows in San Francisco and New York . The money that these shows clear will be deposited into a bank account , and held for organizations that ( like Home Alive ) will create free self - defense programs for women . The money will be held for one year , and if no one comes forward to create the organization , the money will be donated to women 's shelters in the communities where the shows are taking place . The point is that the money made from the shows will not be going to the mother organization in Seattle , and instead will be used to inspire other community - based organizations . The Seattle shows will be held at the world - famous Moe's . On February 16 : Viva , Catfood , Maria Mabra , Los Hornets , Michael Nichols ( spoken word ) Posies , Christien Storm , ( spoken word ) and Dancing French Liberals of ' 48 . February 17 : John Shaw , North American Bison , Christen Kosmas ( spoken word ) Gretta Harley , Skin Horse . Martha Linehan spoken , Green Apple Quick Step , Tamara Paris , ( spoken word ) and Love Battery . The San Francisco show will be held on February 28 , featuring : Christdriver , Natalie Jacobson ( spoken word ) , Alison I. Murchie , Tribe 8 , Seven Year Bitch , and Jello Biafra ( spoken word ) .
