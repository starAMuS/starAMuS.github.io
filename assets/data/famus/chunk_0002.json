Bettel spoke alone to reporters , next to an empty podium , after Boris Johnson , the British Prime Minister , left in a car following private talks , with the chants of anti-Brexit protesters directed at him as he departed . Speaking passionately on the current state of Brexit , Bettel said it was time to \" stop speaking and act \" , insisting \" we wo n't accept any agreement that goes against the single market or the Good Friday Agreement \" . Euronews ' Political Editor Darren McCaffrey asked Bettel if the ongoing situation \" is all theatre so that Boris Johnson can blame the EU when it all falls apart in October ? \" Bettel responded : \" Some people would love to give the blame to another . Again , one party , the Conservative party , decided to organise the referendum . A clear information campaign was not organised in the UK , with all risks of the referendum and Brexit . Now people try to blame others because we ca n't find agreement . We did not decide to start Brexit . \" Johnson 's message was recorded and released to the media after Bettel had made his address and taking questions . He made assurances that although a deal is not ' in the bag ' , everyone involved knows a deal is being seriously attempted . Johnson insisted \" there is a good chance of a deal \" being struck over the next few weeks , but maintained the backstop would have to go for that to happen . Explaining why he did n't attend the press conference with Bettel as planned , Johnson claimed \" I do n't think it would have been fair to the Prime Minister of Luxembourg \" due to the noise being made by protesters . However EU leaders insist there 's only a chance of a deal if the UK can put concrete proposals on the table to come up with a solution to the backstop , which has been the key problem with getting an agreement over the line . Bettel said Johnson had no such concrete proposals for him . And earlier on Monday , European Commission President Jean - Claude Juncker said the same . Johnson attended a lunch meeting with him , and the EU 's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier , with Brexit on the agenda ahead of a crunch leaders ' summit next month . Juncker told reporters it was a \" friendly \" meeting and negotiations \" will continue at high speed \" , with a 10 Downing Street spokesperson insisting talks would need to \" intensify \" over the coming days . The UK Prime Minister was also greeted by a chorus of boos and chants from protesters , and questions from journalists , as he left the restaurant where he was expected to build his case for a revised deal taking the UK out of the EU , which he hopes will be agreed at an EU leaders ' summit on October 17 - 18 . On the way out , Juncker was asked if he had seen any \" concrete proposals \" from the UK government . A statement from the Commission was then released , saying it is the \" UK 's responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions that are compatible with the Withdrawal Agreement \" , to achieve a way forward on the backstop . The statement added \" such proposals have not yet been made \" . \" The leaders agreed that the discussions needed to intensify and that meetings would soon take place on a daily basis , \" a spokesman from Johnson 's office said in a statement following the lunch . \" It was agreed that talks should also take place at a political level between Michel Barnier and the Brexit Secretary , and conversations would also continue between President Juncker and the Prime Minister . \" Johnson told reporters he was feeling \" cautious \" as he went into a restaurant with Juncker , where a UK government source said the leaders would be eating snails , salmon and cheese . No extension to transition period \" If we can make enough progress in the next few days , I intend to go to that crucial summit on Oct. 17 , and finalise an agreement that will protect the interests of business and citizens on both sides of the Channel , and on both sides of the border in Ireland , \" Johnson wrote in the Daily Telegraph , ahead of the meeting in Luxembourg . Meanwhile the PM 's spokesman said Britain has no intention of seeking an extension to the transition period after it leaves the European Union if a divorce deal is struck with the bloc . A deal reached between the EU and former Prime Minister Theresa May , which was later voted down by the British parliament , included a transition period until December 2020 to ensure an orderly exit from the bloc . On Sunday Johnson reiterated his intention to take Britain out of the EU with or without a deal in a newspaper interview in which he likened himself to comic book character The Incredible Hulk . Commenting on the bill that would require Johnson to ask for an extension to the Brexit deadline if he ca n't reach a deal , he said that while the fictional scientist Bruce Banner may be \u201c bound in manacles \u201d when he was angry he \u201c explodes out of them \u201d as Hulk . \u201c The madder Hulk gets , the stronger Hulk gets , \u201d Johnson was quoted as saying by the Mail on Sunday . \u201c Hulk always escaped , no matter how tightly bound in he seemed to be - and that is the case for this country . We will come out on October 31 . \u201d Johnson 's comments suggest that he will try to find a way to bypass the law passed by parliament , which was voted through after 21 Conservative MPs rebelled against the government . The MPs were subsequently kicked out of the party . One rebel , Sam Gyimah - a rising star in former PM Theresa May 's government - joined the Liberal Democrats on Saturday . Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson has pledged to fight the next general election as the anti-Brexit party , with plans to revoke Article 50 altogether .

He said he was \u201c very confident \u201d that a solution could be found . \u201c There 's a very , very good conversation going on about how to address the issues of the Northern Irish border . A huge amount of progress is being made , \u201d Johnson told the newspaper , without giving details . But while the possibility of Johnson breaking the law over Brexit has provoked disquiet in parliament , it may not have hurt him in the polls . The most recent polling by Opinium for the Observer newspaper has the Conservatives rising from 35 to 37 % over the past week . However , a separate poll by ComRes for the Sunday Express put Conservative support at just 28 % , down from 30 % and only a shade ahead of Labour at 27 % . ComRes said just 12 % thought Britain 's parliament could be trusted to do the right thing for the country .

In Rwanda , bold , geometric imigongo art adorns the huts of traditional villages and the lobbies of the country 's finest boutique hotels ( including the recently opened One&Only Nyungwe House ) . The hottest fashion design shops and artisan studios in the capital of Kigali proudly carry pieces of imigongo art on their shelves . But there 's more to this distinctly Rwandan craft than meets the eye : It is created through a remarkable process that uses an abundant material \u2014 cow dung \u2014 and , with the help of artistry and natural dyes , turns it into an object of admiration . In the disarray that followed the genocide , the art form nearly disappeared ; but now , riding the wave of cultural resurgence that 's taking over the country 25 years later , imigongo stands as a symbol of incredible resilience and ingenuity \u2014 like Rwandans themselves . Here is what you need to know about imigongo and where to find it . A royal tradition In the small landlocked Eastern African nation of Rwanda , cows have been revered for centuries . Owning a cow in this traditionally agrarian society was a symbol of wealth and noble social status ; the animal was so important that a subset of the breed called inyambo was developed specifically for the kings in the 17th century . These elegant royal cows with long , arched horns and a stately appearance paraded past royal villages in elaborate ceremonies that honored the ruling king . Perhaps the idea for imigongo was sparked during one of these royal parades . According to local beliefs , the practice of decorating with cow dung was invented in the late 18th or early 19th century by Prince Kakira , the son of King Kimenyi of Gisaka in the eastern Kibungo region near the Tanzanian border . Mixing cow dung , a readily available medium , with ash and clay , Prince Kakira adorned the dull walls of his hut with the paste-like compound . He then taught local women his method , and they passed it on through the generations . From dung to art Most contemporary imigongo is now found off hut walls as smaller - scale artworks , but the process of making it remains the same . It starts with a wooden base plate that can range in size from a tiny photo frame to large - scale wall mural . The artist divides this plate into equal parts using banana fibers to ensure that the finished design is proportional then sketches geometric patterns \u2014 zigzags , spirals , diamonds , or squares \u2014 onto the plate with charcoal . The main medium is a mixture of fresh cow dung and ash , which kills bacteria and odor . The artist applies this malleable , dough - like paste by hand and painstakingly traces the desired pattern with the fingers , creating a raised relief . It takes the work about a day to air dry , and then it 's sanded for smoothness and covered in a neutral base coat of ochre to ensure that the rest of the colors will show up in uniform hues . Once the work is dried , the artist paints designs in a simple palette of no more than four natural pigments . Traditional colors include white , derived from the clay mineral kaolin ; red from the iron-rich Rwandan soil ; yellow from ochre , another natural clay pigment ; and a black created from banana peel ashes , aloe ( ikakarubamba ) sap , and poisonous soda apple fruit ( umutobotobo ) . Increasingly , artists use a broader range of colors in more modern designs , but the traditional look continues to feature four colors or fewer . A contemporary revival Twenty - five years after the genocide , the unimaginable series of events that tore the nation apart , Kigali 's clean , leafy streets are abuzz with a radiant energy that suggests that the country is on the rise . Delegations from other African nations visit to study governance and green energy practices , and young , ambitious Rwandan artists flock here to explore their cultural heritage and traditional art forms . You can find imigongo in the several design shops and artisan studios in Kigali that profile these artists ' work . One of them is Haute Baso , an ethical fashion design brand that collaborates with nearly 300 local artisans to create high - quality , sustainable products . In the busy neighborhood of Kimihurura , the local Azizi Life artisan studio carries imigongo products by artist Alex Nsengiyimva , who learned the craft from his wife . ( While imigongo is a traditionally female art form , it is now attracting male artists as well . ) Shelves inside the airy studio also display colorful woven baskets and jars of local honey , all supplied by nearly 30 Rwandan cooperatives . Here , you can purchase a stunning imigongo to take home or create your own in a weekly workshop run by Nsengiyimva . The studio even ships products in the United States from a stateside warehouse . But to get to the heart of imigongo , you must go east to where the art form was born . Head out along the RN3 road and you 'll pass several artisan cooperatives such as the Imigongo Art Center and craft coffee shop in Kayonza ( a 90 - minute drive from Kigali ) and the Ikora Imigongo Kirehe ( KOIIK ) in Kaziba village ( a three - hour drive from Kigali ) . Perhaps the most famous collective is near the town of Nyakarambi , about three hours east of Kigali . Over a dozen women , many of them genocide widows , carry on the prince 's tradition at his namesake cooperative , Kakira Imigongo . The organization was established after the 1994 tragedy to revive the practice , which came to a halt during the genocide , while giving grieving women a creative outlet . Today , a replica of the prince 's hut houses a staggering array of black - and - white patterns in a maze - like space . Here , and across Rwanda , imigongo is more than cow dung art .

The Ritz -Carlton Hotel in Georgetown is a pretty swanky place , but Ron Bailey would rather be somewhere else . It 's a rainy Saturday morning in October , and Reason magazine is hosting a two -day event called \u201c Reason in D.C . \u201d It is mainly for donors to the foundation that publishes the magazine . Bailey , the libertarian journal 's science correspondent , is getting ready to head a panel discussing global climate change . As he prepares to take the stage he mutters , \u201c I 'm going to have to go up and experience some pain . \u201d Bailey has a reason to be apprehensive . He was once one of the leading skeptics of climate change . Yet in recent years he has shifted . He now believes that global warming is real , man-made , and potentially a serious problem . This stance has led him to embrace taxes as a solution . He must now explain himself to some of the very people whose generosity helps keep the magazine that employs him afloat . \u201c It is really annoying to have to even remotely agree with Al Gore , \u201d the lanky 6 ' , 5 \u201d science reporter tells the audience . And yet , he says , libertarians need to accept this and do something to respond to it . And he cannot see a free - market way to do that . \u201c So , the question is , ' What is the least bad way to regulate ? ' And that is why I have come out in favor of a carbon tax , \u201d Bailey explains . Co-panelist Fred Smith , president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute , a think tank that has a long history of opposition to climate and energy regulations , shakes his head . Even if we must \u201c do something , \u201d why must we do that ? \u201c Why must that ' something ' be the increase of statist power ? \u201d he asks . \u201c The costs of energy rationing are not trivial . \u201d The debate is spirited but civil . Despite Bailey 's earlier fears , his remarks do not result in any hostility from the audience . Most listen raptly and seem intrigued by his presentation . \u201c It was intellectually very stimulating , \u201d says Reason subscriber Ron Gray afterwards . He is n't sold on carbon taxes though . \u201c I 'm not sure it can be implemented in an effective fashion . \u201d Still , the applause is a relief for Bailey . His turnabout has otherwise been an awkward , lonely experience . It has driven a wedge between him and friends and colleagues like Smith . Meanwhile , it has won him virtually no support from the environmentalist movement , which still views him as an enemy . But as the polite reception at the Reason event shows , his switch has n't been that big of a deal in the libertarian policy world . And that might be the most surprising thing : If a hard - core skeptic like Ron Bailey can change his mind , where does that suggest the debate on global warming is heading ? *** A few years ago a debate like the one Reason hosted would have been unthinkable in a conservative or libertarian setting . Throughout the 80s and 90s free marketers disputed \u2014 when they were n't actually mocking \u2014 the whole notion of global warming . Many still feel that way . The Politico recently reported that 26 % of Republican voters think global warming is a hoax . Senator James Inhofe , ranking Republican on Environment and Public Works Committee , said in 2005 that the threat of catastrophic global warming is the \u201c greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people . \u201d It was a natural position for the Right to take when global warming first became an issue , says Steven Hayward , resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute . \u201c Most conservatives \u2014 and I was among them \u2014 said , ' Who is telling us that this is the new crisis ? ' \u201d Hawyard says . \u201c It is the same people who were wrong about all of the previous [ environmental ] crises , \u201d like overpopulation or peak oil . Besides , Hayward and others on his side of the debate repeatedly insist , the science just was n't clear at the time . There were sound reasons to be skeptical . Most now concede there is a warming trend , but many dispute its severity . One of the leading doubters was Bailey . Beginning in 1989 , he wrote a series of columns and essays for leading publications like the Wall Street Journal , Forbes , National Review , and Reason , among many others . Most of them had the same basic theme : Proponents of global warming fears are dangerous kooks . \u201c [ W] hile environmental problems do exist , the end of the world is not at hand . With Earth in the Balance , Gore has joined the ranks of the end - of - the-second - millennium low - budget prophets , \u201d Bailey wrote in a 1992 book review for NR . Bailey continued to press this argument throughout the decade at think tanks like the Cato Institute and CEI , where he won the first Warren T. Brookes writing fellowship . In 1993 , he authored Eco-Scam : The False Prophets of Environmental Apocalypse . In the book 's global warming chapter , entitled \u201c The Sky Is Falling , \u201d he wrote : \u201c To the dismay of the apocalypse boosters , their data , on which the headlines are based , appear to be simply wrong . Satellites orbiting the earth for the last 13 years that detect atmospheric temperature differences as small as 0.01 C degrees confirm that there has been only a statistically insignificant upward trend of 0.06 degrees in global atmospheric temperatures during the 1980s . \u201d Bailey continued in a similar vein after becoming Reason 's science writer in 1997 . But close readers of his columns would have noticed that his arguments on the subject grew more tentative in the last few years . Then , in 2005 , he announced that he had been wrong all along . In an online column titled , \u201c We 're All Global Warmers Now , \u201d Bailey wrote that anyone still clinging to notion that there is no warming \u201c ought to hang it up . All data sets \u2014 satellite , surface , and balloon \u2014 have been pointing to rising global temperatures . In fact , they all have had upward pointing arrows for nearly a decade . \u201d Bailey explained that he had long relied on satellite data by climatologists John Christy and Roy Spencer at the University of Alabama , Huntsville to justify his own skepticism . That was the data that he cited in Eco -Scam for example . Unfortunately for him , that data was wrong . An article in Science magazine pointed out that an error in the satellite data had introduced a \u201c spurious cooling trend . \u201d Once corrected , the satellite data fell in line with others showing a warming trend . Bailey ruminated on his mistake in a later online Reason column jokingly entitled , \u201c Confessions of an Alleged ExxonMobil Whore . \u201d Actually , it was all an honest mistake , he said , and begged his readers ' indulgence . \u201c In hindsight I can only plead that there is no magic formula for deciding when enough evidence has accumulated that a fair - minded person must change his or her mind on a controversial scientific issue . With regard to global warming it finally did for me in the last year , \u201d he wrote . He took solace in the fact that he was one of the first skeptics to convert . He added that global warming \u201c could well be a significant problem . \u201d *** A socialist when he went to college in the early 1970s , Bailey 's undergraduate years happened to coincide with a boom in books warning of a coming environmental apocalypse . In just a few years , natural resources would run out . Oil reserves would dry up . The air and rivers would turn toxic . Overpopulation would lead to famine and disease . To Bailey 's college professors , it was the gospel truth . Meanwhile the young socialist 's idealism led him , ironically enough , towards libertarianism . \u201c I became a libertarian , politically speaking because \u2014 and I know this is going to sound sanctimonious but it is literally true \u2014 if you are really concerned about the poor people then you have to pick the system that in fact helps poor people . And the only one that has done that is democratic capitalism , period , \u201d he says during a long interview at his Dupont Circle apartment . By the mid-1980s he was writing for Forbes magazine . He hit upon the idea of writing an article revisiting environmentalist books and asking the authors how they had gotten their doomsday predictions so obviously wrong . The answer he got from people like Paul Ehrlich , author of The Population Bomb , was simple : We did n't get anything wrong . The earth is still doomed . Ehrlich told a flabbergasted Bailey that he merely got his timing wrong . \u201c Well , by this point , he was off by two decades . So I said , ' When is it going to happen ? ' And he said , ' After the year 2000 , '\u201d Bailey says , his disgust still evident almost two decades later . Somebody had to unmask these people Bailey thought . He would be that man . \u201c What happened is that I decided to write ( Eco - Scam ) as I became more aware that environmentalism is not a science , it is an ideology . I was trying in my mind to find out why all of these things were accepted as true \u2014 even my professors had taught them to me \u2014 and the scientific evidence to back them up was the thinnest [ stuff ] possible , \u201d he says .

It can get very personal . It can get quite nasty , \u201d Taylor says . Bailey tried anyway , regularly hitting the lecture circuit . It often hit back . Audiences could be difficult , even hostile , when challenged on climate change . Environmentalist groups and liberal journals were eager to discredit or embarrass skeptics . Web sites like Exxonsecrets.org maintain dossiers on Bailey and his scandalous writings . In early 2006 , an article in the New Republic tried to tie Bailey to the Jack Abramoff scandal , based on the fact that Bailey had traveled to the North Marianas Islands on the Islands ' dime . ( It was one of Abramoff 's clients . ) Luckily for Bailey , he had disclosed this in the story he wrote about the trip , which was n't terribly complimentary of the islands . So the hit on Bailey fizzled . The British Royal Society , the world 's oldest scientific organization , darkly noted in 2006 that ExxonMobil had donated millions to groups that had projected \u201c an inaccurate and misleading view of climate change . \u201d The oil giant has given $ 250,000 to the Reason Foundation since 2000 . You can see where the society was going with this . Bailey mocked them in his \u201c ExxonMobil Whore \u201d column , saying , no , then - CEO Lee Raymond did not \u201c hand me brown paper bags filled with stacks of unmarked bills in the back of taxis while whispering , ' Ron , we 're counting on your widely read and highly influential articles to help stave off the Green onslaught against our soaring profits . ' \u201d Bailey concedes he found it all rather wearisome . It also hardened his opinions of the environmentalists and the claims they made . It was part of the reason why he discounted global warming , he says . \u201c On global warming , the problem is ideologically I suspect it did cause me to \u2026 discount evidence which cut against the way I wanted it to be in that case . My justification to my self would be that I had seen [ the environmentalists ] be so wrong so many times before , why should I trust them this time ? \u201d he says . But when the science appeared irrefutable , Bailey changed . It was not a complete conversion though . He still opposes most policies favored by environmentalists because he fears their cures may be worse than the disease . \u201c Cap and trade is not working . It is very complicated ; it allows corporations and governments to game the system in all kinds of horrible ways . And you do n't get any benefit out of it . Even if you thought you were trying to reduce carbon dioxide emissions , it is just not working . Therefore the economic policy solution is a carbon tax , \u201d he says . A carbon tax would mean that the government would simply increase the cost of fossil fuels in order to discourage their use and therefore reduce emissions . He likes the idea because he sees it as less prone to cheating and corruption . Innovation would spur better technology and better practices by industry . It 's also easily adjustable . If the warming trend gets better or worse , governments can alter the tax accordingly . It is an interesting idea . Al Gore certainly thinks so . He has endorsed a carbon tax as well . *** Liberal journalist Chris Mooney , author of The Republican War on Science , says it is \u201c admirable \u201d that Bailey conceded his error but has little further praise for him . \u201c He now accepts human causation , which is all to the good . However \u2026 he seems to think that some of the worst case projections are overdone and we 're only going to see mild warming , \u201d Mooney said . \u201c I do n't accept it . \u2026 I see no reason to assume global warming is going to be minor and manageable . \u201d Others are less kind . When the environmentalist Web sites began posting Bailey 's \u201c confessions \u201d story , commentators saw little reason to let him off the hook . \u201c ( L) ibertarianism is a blindness and an echo chamber , lowering one 's I.Q. by about 30 points , \u201d wrote Bart Anderson of energybulletin.net , in a typical posting . At the site treehugger.com , the mood ran more towards tarring and feathering Bailey . That kind of stuff does n't bother him much . After all , he has similar feelings for the environmentalists . \u201c The difference ( between us ) is that I have admitted that I was wrong . When have they ever admitted that they were wrong about something ? \u201d Bailey asks . But his switch has also strained relationships with erstwhile free -market friends . \u201c You 'll find that there are two groups [ of thought ] out there . You 'll find that one group is still inclined to argue that the evidence that industrial emissions are the primary driver of the warming we are feeling today is just not true , \u201d said Cato 's Taylor . The others think the earth is getting warmer , but debate the severity and need for a policy change . Taylor counts himself and Bailey among that group . But unlike Bailey , he 's against a carbon tax . *** It happened months ago but Bailey is still steaming about an incident at a CEI dinner in which speaker John O'Sullivan made a joke about Pontius Pilate that Bailey believes was an oblique reference to him . ( Bailey 's name was not mentioned by O'Sullivan . ) \u201c I was not happy . I talked to Fred ( Smith ) afterwards and he found it hilarious , \u201d Bailey fumes . *** The desk in Fred Smith 's office at CEI 's K Street headquarters is littered with science fiction novels . Smith reads them voraciously . He loves to imagine the world as it might be in the future . \u201c One of the great strengths the Left has is that they propose ideal solutions , utopian solutions , \u201d Smith says . \u201c By doing so they gain the support of idealists , who as young people believe the world could be a much better place than it is . \u201d The free -market Right should do the same thing , he argues . It should not give up the moral high ground of promoting freedom over statism . Alas , Smith sighs , Bailey has done just that . Smith , like all of the other libertarians interviewed for this article , agrees the earth is warming . He just is n't sure that the warming is so bad that it requires his side to propose solutions . \u201c How can anyone endorse carbon energy taxes and an emissions trading system ? I do n't understand it . Well , Ron says we have to show that we are in favor of doing something , \u201d Smith says , repeating the words \u201c doing something \u201d with amazement . \u201c Since when do free - market people see ' doing something ' as expanding the role of the state to interfere with our lives ? It seems to me that the whole idealism of our movement is to show ways how free people can solve their problems better . \u201d Smith and Bailey have known each other for about 20 years . He remains an adjunct scholar at the institute to this day . Despite their mutual exasperation , both speak fondly of each other . But they do n't speak often . \u201c I call up Ron from time to time and say , ' Ron I am trying to understand . Give me one more chance , '\u201d Smith says . As an adjunct scholar , Bailey receives no money from CEI . He only does when he works on a specific project with them , such as Eco -Scam . But his last project for them was in 2000 , and there are no plans for any future projects . \u201c I do n't think Ron could write \u2014 at least I have not seen him write \u2014 a piece that was consistent with a libertarian vision on global warming , \u201d Smith says . Bailey 's CEI bio was even recently taken off the institute 's online list of in - house experts , though it can still be found if one searches the Web site . ( When I asked Smith about this later he said he was unaware that the bio was n't listed . ) Asked to explain Bailey 's change , Smith say he believes Bailey was worn down by his years on the lecture circuit and appearing at debates opposite environmentalists . \u201c It is very , very lonely , \u201d says Smith , who does quite a bit of it himself . \u201c I think the psychological pressures of resisting the crowd are much higher than we realize . And I think some of us stumble . \u201d All of this is said in a more - in-sorrow - than - in - anger tone . Smith adds later : \u201c Sometimes your friends marry the wrong woman and the best you can do is to say that ' I think you are making a mistake , ' but still be friends . I think Ron is taking the wrong position on this , but I think we can still be friends . \u201d *** If his ties to CEI are shaky , Bailey 's position at Reason is secure . Nick Gillespie , until recently Reason 's editor - in-chief and Bailey 's boss , calls him \u201c absolutely the most thoughtful and honest and authentic science reporter \u201d out there . New Reason editor- in-chief Matt Welch is a fan too . Bailey complains of being blackballed from some conservative publications but attributes that more to his writings on cloning and stem cells , which some social conservatives have taken exception to . Otherwise his byline still turns up in places like the Wall Street Journal . Colleagues like Taylor and Hayward still count themselves as admirers of his writing . *** Could Bailey 's shift be a portent ? If a one - time skeptic like him can be converted , does that mean the debate on global warming itself is shifting ? Gillespie thinks it might . He compares Bailey to the proverbial \u201c canary in the coalmine . \u201d \u201c When Ron Bailey shifts position that is really meaningful , \u201d Gillespie says . \u201c Wherever he is that is where the conventional wisdom among the broadly - defined Right , among libertarians and free - market people will be . If Ron Bailey is someplace , look for them to be there about 15 - 30 minutes later . \u201d Indeed , since Bailey 's conversion , others on the conservative / libertarian axis have come forward with similar conclusions . \u201c Ron changing his mind on global warming cemented my own transition to an AGW ( i.e. , man - made climate change ) believer , \u201d says Atlantic blogger Megan McArdle . A June cover story in National Review declared : \u201c It is no longer possible , scientifically or politically , to deny that human activities have very likely increased global temperatures ; what remains in dispute is the precise magnitude of the human impact . Conservatives should accept this reality \u2014 and move on to the question of what we should do about it . \u201d The author , Jim Manzi , does not support a carbon tax , but has taken flack from conservatives for the piece anyway . A November story in the Politico quoted Rep. Bob Inglis , R-S.C. , a one - time skeptic turned recent convert , as saying that the GOP will get \u201c hammered \u201d if they do not address the issue . \u201c A lot of smart Republican thinkers are coming to the same conclusion , \u201d according to the article , citing people like Newt Gingrich and Ken Mehlman as examples . AEI 's Hayward favors a carbon tax too , arguing it could be a vehicle for broader tax reform . Bailey himself dismisses the argument that he has anything to do with these changes out of hand , finding the whole notion both silly and exasperating . He is just a writer , he says . Who cares what he thinks ? \u201c It is just hard to believe , \u201d he says .

The Ritz -Carlton Hotel in Georgetown is a pretty swanky place , but Ron Bailey would rather be somewhere else . It 's a rainy Saturday morning in October , and Reason magazine is hosting a two -day event called \u201c Reason in D.C . \u201d It is mainly for donors to the foundation that publishes the magazine . Bailey , the libertarian journal 's science correspondent , is getting ready to head a panel discussing global climate change . As he prepares to take the stage he mutters , \u201c I 'm going to have to go up and experience some pain . \u201d Bailey has a reason to be apprehensive . He was once one of the leading skeptics of climate change . Yet in recent years he has shifted . He now believes that global warming is real , man-made , and potentially a serious problem . This stance has led him to embrace taxes as a solution . He must now explain himself to some of the very people whose generosity helps keep the magazine that employs him afloat . \u201c It is really annoying to have to even remotely agree with Al Gore , \u201d the lanky 6 ' , 5 \u201d science reporter tells the audience . And yet , he says , libertarians need to accept this and do something to respond to it . And he cannot see a free - market way to do that . \u201c So , the question is , ' What is the least bad way to regulate ? ' And that is why I have come out in favor of a carbon tax , \u201d Bailey explains . Co-panelist Fred Smith , president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute , a think tank that has a long history of opposition to climate and energy regulations , shakes his head . Even if we must \u201c do something , \u201d why must we do that ? \u201c Why must that ' something ' be the increase of statist power ? \u201d he asks . \u201c The costs of energy rationing are not trivial . \u201d The debate is spirited but civil . Despite Bailey 's earlier fears , his remarks do not result in any hostility from the audience . Most listen raptly and seem intrigued by his presentation . \u201c It was intellectually very stimulating , \u201d says Reason subscriber Ron Gray afterwards . He is n't sold on carbon taxes though . \u201c I 'm not sure it can be implemented in an effective fashion . \u201d Still , the applause is a relief for Bailey . His turnabout has otherwise been an awkward , lonely experience . It has driven a wedge between him and friends and colleagues like Smith . Meanwhile , it has won him virtually no support from the environmentalist movement , which still views him as an enemy . But as the polite reception at the Reason event shows , his switch has n't been that big of a deal in the libertarian policy world . And that might be the most surprising thing : If a hard - core skeptic like Ron Bailey can change his mind , where does that suggest the debate on global warming is heading ? *** A few years ago a debate like the one Reason hosted would have been unthinkable in a conservative or libertarian setting . Throughout the 80s and 90s free marketers disputed \u2014 when they were n't actually mocking \u2014 the whole notion of global warming . Many still feel that way . The Politico recently reported that 26 % of Republican voters think global warming is a hoax . Senator James Inhofe , ranking Republican on Environment and Public Works Committee , said in 2005 that the threat of catastrophic global warming is the \u201c greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people . \u201d It was a natural position for the Right to take when global warming first became an issue , says Steven Hayward , resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute . \u201c Most conservatives \u2014 and I was among them \u2014 said , ' Who is telling us that this is the new crisis ? ' \u201d Hawyard says . \u201c It is the same people who were wrong about all of the previous [ environmental ] crises , \u201d like overpopulation or peak oil . Besides , Hayward and others on his side of the debate repeatedly insist , the science just was n't clear at the time . There were sound reasons to be skeptical . Most now concede there is a warming trend , but many dispute its severity . One of the leading doubters was Bailey . Beginning in 1989 , he wrote a series of columns and essays for leading publications like the Wall Street Journal , Forbes , National Review , and Reason , among many others . Most of them had the same basic theme : Proponents of global warming fears are dangerous kooks . \u201c [ W] hile environmental problems do exist , the end of the world is not at hand . With Earth in the Balance , Gore has joined the ranks of the end - of - the-second - millennium low - budget prophets , \u201d Bailey wrote in a 1992 book review for NR . Bailey continued to press this argument throughout the decade at think tanks like the Cato Institute and CEI , where he won the first Warren T. Brookes writing fellowship . In 1993 , he authored Eco-Scam : The False Prophets of Environmental Apocalypse . In the book 's global warming chapter , entitled \u201c The Sky Is Falling , \u201d he wrote : \u201c To the dismay of the apocalypse boosters , their data , on which the headlines are based , appear to be simply wrong . Satellites orbiting the earth for the last 13 years that detect atmospheric temperature differences as small as 0.01 C degrees confirm that there has been only a statistically insignificant upward trend of 0.06 degrees in global atmospheric temperatures during the 1980s . \u201d Bailey continued in a similar vein after becoming Reason 's science writer in 1997 . But close readers of his columns would have noticed that his arguments on the subject grew more tentative in the last few years . Then , in 2005 , he announced that he had been wrong all along . In an online column titled , \u201c We 're All Global Warmers Now , \u201d Bailey wrote that anyone still clinging to notion that there is no warming \u201c ought to hang it up . All data sets \u2014 satellite , surface , and balloon \u2014 have been pointing to rising global temperatures . In fact , they all have had upward pointing arrows for nearly a decade . \u201d Bailey explained that he had long relied on satellite data by climatologists John Christy and Roy Spencer at the University of Alabama , Huntsville to justify his own skepticism . That was the data that he cited in Eco -Scam for example . Unfortunately for him , that data was wrong . An article in Science magazine pointed out that an error in the satellite data had introduced a \u201c spurious cooling trend . \u201d Once corrected , the satellite data fell in line with others showing a warming trend . Bailey ruminated on his mistake in a later online Reason column jokingly entitled , \u201c Confessions of an Alleged ExxonMobil Whore . \u201d Actually , it was all an honest mistake , he said , and begged his readers ' indulgence . \u201c In hindsight I can only plead that there is no magic formula for deciding when enough evidence has accumulated that a fair - minded person must change his or her mind on a controversial scientific issue . With regard to global warming it finally did for me in the last year , \u201d he wrote . He took solace in the fact that he was one of the first skeptics to convert . He added that global warming \u201c could well be a significant problem . \u201d *** A socialist when he went to college in the early 1970s , Bailey 's undergraduate years happened to coincide with a boom in books warning of a coming environmental apocalypse . In just a few years , natural resources would run out . Oil reserves would dry up . The air and rivers would turn toxic . Overpopulation would lead to famine and disease . To Bailey 's college professors , it was the gospel truth . Meanwhile the young socialist 's idealism led him , ironically enough , towards libertarianism . \u201c I became a libertarian , politically speaking because \u2014 and I know this is going to sound sanctimonious but it is literally true \u2014 if you are really concerned about the poor people then you have to pick the system that in fact helps poor people . And the only one that has done that is democratic capitalism , period , \u201d he says during a long interview at his Dupont Circle apartment . By the mid-1980s he was writing for Forbes magazine . He hit upon the idea of writing an article revisiting environmentalist books and asking the authors how they had gotten their doomsday predictions so obviously wrong . The answer he got from people like Paul Ehrlich , author of The Population Bomb , was simple : We did n't get anything wrong . The earth is still doomed . Ehrlich told a flabbergasted Bailey that he merely got his timing wrong . \u201c Well , by this point , he was off by two decades . So I said , ' When is it going to happen ? ' And he said , ' After the year 2000 , '\u201d Bailey says , his disgust still evident almost two decades later . Somebody had to unmask these people Bailey thought . He would be that man . \u201c What happened is that I decided to write ( Eco - Scam ) as I became more aware that environmentalism is not a science , it is an ideology . I was trying in my mind to find out why all of these things were accepted as true \u2014 even my professors had taught them to me \u2014 and the scientific evidence to back them up was the thinnest [ stuff ] possible , \u201d he says . And thus his career as a professional skeptic was born . It was n't easy . Unless one can manage a best -selling book or a regular TV gig , opinion journalism is not a pathway to riches . It can be especially hard if your area of expertise is deemed politically incorrect . It is \u201c virtually impossible \u201d to have an honest debate on global warming , says Jerry Taylor , senior fellow at the Cato Institute . \u201c The debate is very , very heated and very passionate . It can get very personal . It can get quite nasty , \u201d Taylor says . Bailey tried anyway , regularly hitting the lecture circuit . It often hit back . Audiences could be difficult , even hostile , when challenged on climate change . Environmentalist groups and liberal journals were eager to discredit or embarrass skeptics . Web sites like Exxonsecrets.org maintain dossiers on Bailey and his scandalous writings .

You can see where the society was going with this . Bailey mocked them in his \u201c ExxonMobil Whore \u201d column , saying , no , then - CEO Lee Raymond did not \u201c hand me brown paper bags filled with stacks of unmarked bills in the back of taxis while whispering , ' Ron , we 're counting on your widely read and highly influential articles to help stave off the Green onslaught against our soaring profits . ' \u201d Bailey concedes he found it all rather wearisome . It also hardened his opinions of the environmentalists and the claims they made .

Colleagues like Taylor and Hayward still count themselves as admirers of his writing . *** Could Bailey 's shift be a portent ? If a one - time skeptic like him can be converted , does that mean the debate on global warming itself is shifting ? Gillespie thinks it might . He compares Bailey to the proverbial \u201c canary in the coalmine . \u201d \u201c When Ron Bailey shifts position that is really meaningful , \u201d Gillespie says . \u201c Wherever he is that is where the conventional wisdom among the broadly - defined Right , among libertarians and free - market people will be . If Ron Bailey is someplace , look for them to be there about 15 - 30 minutes later . \u201d Indeed , since Bailey 's conversion , others on the conservative / libertarian axis have come forward with similar conclusions . \u201c Ron changing his mind on global warming cemented my own transition to an AGW ( i.e. , man - made climate change ) believer , \u201d says Atlantic blogger Megan McArdle . A June cover story in National Review declared : \u201c It is no longer possible , scientifically or politically , to deny that human activities have very likely increased global temperatures ; what remains in dispute is the precise magnitude of the human impact . Conservatives should accept this reality \u2014 and move on to the question of what we should do about it . \u201d The author , Jim Manzi , does not support a carbon tax , but has taken flack from conservatives for the piece anyway . A November story in the Politico quoted Rep. Bob Inglis , R-S.C. , a one - time skeptic turned recent convert , as saying that the GOP will get \u201c hammered \u201d if they do not address the issue . \u201c A lot of smart Republican thinkers are coming to the same conclusion , \u201d according to the article , citing people like Newt Gingrich and Ken Mehlman as examples . AEI 's Hayward favors a carbon tax too , arguing it could be a vehicle for broader tax reform . Bailey himself dismisses the argument that he has anything to do with these changes out of hand , finding the whole notion both silly and exasperating . He is just a writer , he says . Who cares what he thinks ? \u201c It is just hard to believe , \u201d he says . A few moments later , he adds , \u201c Well , obviously somebody thinks I 'm doing something right because they keep publishing me . \u201d \u2013 Sean Higgins is Washington correspondent for Investor 's Business Daily and a contributing editor to Doublethink .","annotations":[{"text":"the earth","span":[15515,15523],"token_span":[3026,3027],"role":"Item","label":"Item","role_definition":"The entity whose temperature changes."},{"text":"temperatures","span":[5837,5848],"token_span":[1143,1143],"role":"Temperature","label":"Temperature","role_definition":"The scalar property that the Item possesses.

At the age of ten , he was hunting and exporting live muskrats and teaching himself taxidermy . He studied science in college , but had to drop out for financial reasons . Forced to support himself , he joined various scientific expeditions that took him to remote places , including Labrador , where he spent several years in the fur business . On all these trips he liked to experiment with whatever fresh food was on hand . In the Southwest , he ate slices of rattlesnake fried in pork fat . From Labrador , he wrote letters home that described exotic meals like lynx marinated in sherry , porcupine , polar bear meat and skunk . The long Labrador winters also taught him what it was to crave fresh food , and introduced him for the first time in his life to frozen food that tasted good . Up until the 1920s in America , it was the food of last resort . \" When it thawed it was mushy and less appealing than even canned food , \" writes Kurlansky . But in Labrador he learned from the Inuit how to fish trout from holes in the ice and watch it freeze instantly in the air , which registered at 30 degrees below zero . And when it was cooked , it tasted like fresh trout . It was the same with their meat and game , which they kept fresh for months in hard - packed snow . He soon figured out that the key to success was to freeze food fast , and at very low temperatures . This prevented large ice crystals from forming . These large crystals could damage cells and were responsible for giving much frozen food an unpleasant mushy texture . But it took a while for Birdseye to see where all this would lead him . He and his family returned to the US in 1917 and he took a series of jobs before joining the U.S. Fisheries Association in Washington \u2014 a lobbying group . It was while working with them that the \" big Birdseye idea , \" as Kurlansky calls it , first began to take shape . Packaging Matters Birdseye realized that the way to expand the market for fish was to develop the means to pack and transport it over long distances , \" in compact and convenient containers \" and distribute it to individual customers with its \" intrinsic freshness \" intact . He experimented with his own containers to chill food at first , but when that failed , he started thinking about what he learned in Labrador . And the more he thought about it , the more he became convinced that quick freezing had huge potential . In 1922 he left his job at the Fisheries Association and set out to \" create an industry , to find a commercially viable way of producing large quantities of fast frozen fish . \" Even if he did n't pioneer actual freezing , Kurlansky points out , that Birsdseye he had \" to pioneer most everything else in his process . \" This included everything from the boxes he packed the fish in to the machine that froze them and everything in between \u2014 from waterproof inks and glues to scaling and filleting machines . The fish had to be frozen in small portions both for speed and because he wanted to sell it to individual customers . He was also concerned with eliminating the little air pockets that in whole fish could harbor bacteria and lead to decomposition . So a key part of his original 1924 process called for filleting the fish \u2014 which was an unusual thing to do in 1920s . It had to be done by hand . But it allowed them to be packed tightly into rectangular fiberboard boxes . At first , Birdseye put these boxes into a long metal holders that was immersed in freezing calcium chloride , but three years later , in 1927 , he applied to patent his multiplate freezing machine . Large Scale Fast Freezing This invention , along with the process which went with it , became the basis of the new frozen food industry , says Kurlansky , and \" remained the basic commercial freezing system for decades . \" In essence , the machine squeezed waterproof cartons holding two inch blocks of fish between freezing plates that were kept between 20 and 50 degrees below Farenheit , for 75 minutes . The cartons never came into contact with the refrigerant and the neat packages were suitable for marketing to individual customers . And with a few tweaks , this new machine could be used to freeze anything from berries to pork sausages . \" By now , Birdseye 's own ambitions had soared way beyond fish fillets , but it did n't happen quite as Birdseye had imagined . His haddock fillets were slow to catch on . Kurlansky explains that people distrusted frozen food , railroads worried that they might be sued if the fish thawed in transit , public health officials fretted about bugs and germs . Stores had nowhere to store the frozen fillets and customers had no way to keep them frozen . The boxes piled up in the factory . Birdseye ran out of money and sold his company to the Post company . But Birdseye , now a newly minted millionaire , continued to work for the new Birds Eye Frosted Foods division of the Post company . It shared Birdseye 's vision that this was the food of the future . Convincing The Public To win over customers , the company started with ten stores in Springfield Massachusetts in March 1930 . They gave them display freezers , put their staff through a three - day training course , and offered the food on consignment . These included 27 different frozen items : The original haddock fillets , porterhouse steak , spring lamb chops , loganberries and raspberries , spinach and June peas advertised \" as gloriously green as any you will see next summer . \" Gradually , the world came to realize that frozen food was safe , and could provide an appealing and often more nutritious alternative to canned , salted and smoked foods . It overcame the limitations of local and seasonal food in unprecedented ways . Stores and domestic kitchens began to acquire freezers , and after World War II , frozen food got a huge boost , because it made it possible to put entire meals on the table without women having to spend hours in the kitchen . It even helped shaped current school lunch programs . as Allison Aubrey reported . There was no going back . Kurlansky argues that \" by modernizing the process of food preservation , Birdseye nationalized and then internationalized food distribution ... facilitated urban living and helped to take people away from the farms ... and greatly contributed to the development of industrial - scale agriculture . \" Birdseye , he says , would have seen all these as positive things . Not everyone would agree with that verdict of course , but it 's harder to disagree with Kurlansky 's claim that \" Undeniably , Birdseye changed our civilization . \"","annotations":[{"text":"1927","span":[4734,4737],"token_span":[903,903],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the change in temperature occurs."},{"text":"his multiplate freezing machine","span":[4762,4792],"token_span":[909,912],"role":"Item","label":"Item","role_definition":"The entity whose temperature changes."},{"text":"between 20 and 50 degrees below Farenheit","span":[5143,5183],"token_span":[975,981],"role":"Temperature","label":"Temperature","role_definition":"The scalar property that the Item possesses.

Packaging Matters Birdseye realized that the way to expand the market for fish was to develop the means to pack and transport it over long distances , \" in compact and convenient containers \" and distribute it to individual customers with its \" intrinsic freshness \" intact . He experimented with his own containers to chill food at first , but when that failed , he started thinking about what he learned in Labrador . And the more he thought about it , the more he became convinced that quick freezing had huge potential . In 1922 he left his job at the Fisheries Association and set out to \" create an industry , to find a commercially viable way of producing large quantities of fast frozen fish . \" Even if he did n't pioneer actual freezing , Kurlansky points out , that Birsdseye he had \" to pioneer most everything else in his process . \" This included everything from the boxes he packed the fish in to the machine that froze them and everything in between \u2014 from waterproof inks and glues to scaling and filleting machines . The fish had to be frozen in small portions both for speed and because he wanted to sell it to individual customers . He was also concerned with eliminating the little air pockets that in whole fish could harbor bacteria and lead to decomposition . So a key part of his original 1924 process called for filleting the fish \u2014 which was an unusual thing to do in 1920s . It had to be done by hand . But it allowed them to be packed tightly into rectangular fiberboard boxes . At first , Birdseye put these boxes into a long metal holders that was immersed in freezing calcium chloride , but three years later , in 1927 , he applied to patent his multiplate freezing machine . Large Scale Fast Freezing This invention , along with the process which went with it , became the basis of the new frozen food industry , says Kurlansky , and \" remained the basic commercial freezing system for decades . \" In essence , the machine squeezed waterproof cartons holding two inch blocks of fish between freezing plates that were kept between 20 and 50 degrees below Farenheit , for 75 minutes . The cartons never came into contact with the refrigerant and the neat packages were suitable for marketing to individual customers . And with a few tweaks , this new machine could be used to freeze anything from berries to pork sausages . \" By now , Birdseye 's own ambitions had soared way beyond fish fillets , but it did n't happen quite as Birdseye had imagined . His haddock fillets were slow to catch on . Kurlansky explains that people distrusted frozen food , railroads worried that they might be sued if the fish thawed in transit , public health officials fretted about bugs and germs . Stores had nowhere to store the frozen fillets and customers had no way to keep them frozen . The boxes piled up in the factory . Birdseye ran out of money and sold his company to the Post company . But Birdseye , now a newly minted millionaire , continued to work for the new Birds Eye Frosted Foods division of the Post company . It shared Birdseye 's vision that this was the food of the future . Convincing The Public To win over customers , the company started with ten stores in Springfield Massachusetts in March 1930 . They gave them display freezers , put their staff through a three - day training course , and offered the food on consignment . These included 27 different frozen items : The original haddock fillets , porterhouse steak , spring lamb chops , loganberries and raspberries , spinach and June peas advertised \" as gloriously green as any you will see next summer . \" Gradually , the world came to realize that frozen food was safe , and could provide an appealing and often more nutritious alternative to canned , salted and smoked foods . It overcame the limitations of local and seasonal food in unprecedented ways . Stores and domestic kitchens began to acquire freezers , and after World War II , frozen food got a huge boost , because it made it possible to put entire meals on the table without women having to spend hours in the kitchen . It even helped shaped current school lunch programs . as Allison Aubrey reported . There was no going back . Kurlansky argues that \" by modernizing the process of food preservation , Birdseye nationalized and then internationalized food distribution ... facilitated urban living and helped to take people away from the farms ... and greatly contributed to the development of industrial - scale agriculture . \" Birdseye , he says , would have seen all these as positive things . Not everyone would agree with that verdict of course , but it 's harder to disagree with Kurlansky 's claim that \" Undeniably , Birdseye changed our civilization . \"","annotations":[{"text":"his multiplate freezing machine","span":[4762,4792],"token_span":[909,912],"role":"Item","label":"Item","role_definition":"The entity whose temperature changes."},{"text":"between 20 and 50 degrees below Farenheit","span":[5143,5183],"token_span":[975,981],"role":"Temperature","label":"Temperature","role_definition":"The scalar property that the Item possesses.

However , despite the beard and an attachment to old ways of doing things it 's not Dumbledore Radcliffe is thinking of . \u201c In the only sit-down , casual interview I have seen with Jeremy Corbyn , he talks about his allotment and making jam , \u201d said Radcliffe , \u201c so he reminds me in the loveliest way of my English teacher , who is someone I am very , very fond of \u2013 so he has a fast track to my heart ! \u201d It is just so nice to have people excited about somebody Corbyn has energised politics , he added . \u201c It is incredible . It is just so nice to have people excited about somebody . It seems to be more or less because they are excited about sincerity . I think we all suddenly realised that we are so used to politicians lying . Even when they are being sincere , it feels so scripted that it is hard to get behind them . \u201c I feel like this show of sincerity by a man who has been around long enough and stuck to his beliefs long enough that he knows them and does n't have to be scripted is what is making people sit up and get excited . It is great . \u201d Radcliffe is back in the UK to promote a new BBC2 drama , The Gamechangers , in which he plays Sam Houser , videogame producer and one of the creative forces behind the Grand Theft Auto gaming phenomenon .

Or would he be outmuscled by the whole - hearted son-of - the -soil , Raymond Poulidor , whose approach stood in complete contrast to that of his calm , calculating opponent ? Greg LeMond 's eight - second victory over Laurent Fignon in the 1989 Tour is usually held up as the race 's ultimate drama , and statistically speaking there is nothing to touch it . But that contest all came down to an individual time trial \u2013 two men competing separately , with the stopwatch as the real enemy . What unfolded between Anquetil and Poulidor on the merciless slopes of an extinct volcano in the Auvergne was more like hand - to- hand combat . When people talk about the Tour de France 's golden age , it is moments like this \u2013 the Duel on the Puy de D\u00f4me \u2013 that they have in mind . France 's post- war recovery was as much about an idea of itself as about anything more tangible , and in nothing was that idea so vividly and joyfully expressed as in La Grande Boucle , the incredible three - week bike race that from the most opulent boulevard to the humblest village caf\u00e9 brought the nation together . Nostalgia for this uniquely French sense of shared belonging invariably centres on the Fifties and Sixties . Not that French cyclists were having it all their own way during this period . Jean Robic won for France when the Tour resumed in 1947 , but the race soon acquired a distinctly Italian flavour courtesy of the charismatic Fausto Coppi ( the winner in 1949 and 1952 ) and his compatriot Gino Bartali ( the winner in 1948 ) . There were Swiss winners in Ferdinand K\u00fcbler and Hugo Koblet . Come the mid-Fifties , however , home - grown talent was to the fore again . Louison Bobet scored a hat-trick of Tour victories from 1953 to 1955 . Roger Walkowiak won in 1956 before Anquetil announced himself with his first victory in 1957 , at the age of only 23 . A three - year hiatus saw the Tour won by Charly Gaul of Luxembourg , the Spaniard Federico Bahamontes and an Italian , Gastone Nencini , but then Anquetil took over , winning in 1961 , 1962 and 1963 . Nobody had ever won four Tours before \u2013 but then nobody had ever ridden like Anquetil . \" Master Jacques \" was his nickname , acquired when he led the 1961 Tour from start to finish . Yet in spite of his astonishing record , French cycling fans never really warmed to this builder 's son from Rouen . Anquetil appeared to expend little effort in a sport where suffering is what it is meant to be all about . His triumphs were generally founded on his mastery of the lonely discipline of time - trialling \u2013 solo efforts against the clock that draw admiration but rarely stir spectators ' souls . Anquetil was the supreme tactician . He understood better than anyone the internal dynamics of a race , watching every move , using his team - mates to protect him , judging precisely what he had to do and when . The smoothness of his pedal strokes was rarely disturbed . He was n't an attacker . He did not go in for heroics . He did what was necessary , and the undoubted style with which he did it almost counted against him in the public 's hearts . His film- star looks accentuated the distance between him and others . Of course , Anquetil did n't see himself that way . In later life , he would explain that what people took to be arrogance was shyness . He had to dig as deep as anyone else , and endured as much pain as they did , but he was adept at not showing it . Indeed , the creation of an aura of imperturbability was a key element in his success . Anquetil , it seems , felt misunderstood . He was deserving of much greater credit and popularity , and it 's this knowledge that adds a kind of poignancy to his great duel with Poulidor on the Puy de D\u00f4me . Public affection was what Poulidor enjoyed in copious quantities , and there was no doubting which rider had more supporters on that seismic day . Like Anquetil , Poulidor too had a rural upbringing . But whereas Anquetil 's family were members of the artisan classes , Poulidor 's worked the Limousin land at the bottom rung of the social ladder . The humble embodiment of the spirit of La France profonde , Poulidor still somehow spoke of cycling 's simple pleasures even when competing at the highest level . Not for him the scientific approach of Anquetil . Physically much more imposing than his tall , slender rival , Poulidor was tremendously aggressive , the better climber , and he gave it his all for all to see . But he could n't time - trial like Anquetil . At 28 going into the 1964 Tour , Poulidor was only two years younger than Anquetil but much less experienced in big races . Anquetil , in his sophisticated , citizen - of - the - world kind of way , was competing abroad when Poulidor had barely been outside his d\u00e9partement . He acquired skills and understanding which were essential to his dominance of cycling , whereas Poulidor tended to rely more on instinct . Poulidor allowed his emotions to come into play , and of course the fans loved him for it . Did Anquetil envy Poulidor 's status as the darling of the French public ? Did Poulidor resent Anquetil 's superior ways ? Both men could be forgiven if they did , but the extent to which there was mutual antipathy may well have been exaggerated by a French press which was intent on setting up Poulidor vs Anquetil as the great rivalry of the day . Poulidor had competed in only two Tours before 1964 , compared with Anquetil 's seven . But in finishing third on his debut in ' 62 and eighth the year after , he had shown what a dangerous rider he could be . In spite of the small age difference , there was a sense in ' 64 that Poulidor was the coming man and that Anquetil , after all he had achieved , was approaching the end of his Tour career . Not that Poulidor was the only challenger Anquetil had to worry about . Bahamontes \u2013 the \" Eagle of Toledo \" \u2013 remained a serious threat five years on from his one Tour win , still a brilliant climber at 36 , with five King of the Mountains jerseys to his name . There was the Italian Vittorio Adorni , whom Anquetil had just beaten to win the 1964 Giro d'Italia , the Dutchman Jan Janssen ( destined to win the Tour in 1968 ) and Britain 's Tom Simpson , then and to this day the best cyclist to have emerged from these islands . As the winner of the prestigious Milan - San Remo one - day race earlier in ' 64 , Simpson was firmly in cycling 's top echelon . So the stage was set \u2013 all the more so than previous years because 1964 was the first Tour to be shown live on French television . Huddled round the radio , or poring over newspaper reports , was how people had up till now experienced the excitement of the Tour if they had not been able to get roadside , and millions tuned in to watch the black - and - white pictures being beamed across the country as the riders set off on what would prove to be the decisive Stage 22 from Brive , with the race only four days away from its finale in Paris . Anquetil had not had things all his own way in the preceding two and a half weeks . Bahamontes had been outstanding in the Alps . But Anquetil scored an inevitable victory in a time trial to put himself back in charge of proceedings . Then came a rest day in Andorra and an incident that still has Tour followers baffled . Anquetil , instead of keeping loose by going for a short training ride , chose to attend a barbecue laid on by a local radio station . He and his wife , Janine , were reported to have been knocking back the champagne , and when battle recommenced the following day , Anquetil just could n't get going properly . Still , with another time trial in which he reasserted himself , Anquetil arrived in Brive in yellow , with a 56 - second advantage over the only man who could realistically catch him \u2013 Raymond Poulidor . Would it be enough ? In a 2003 book , Golden Stages of the Tour de France , the cycling writer Chris Sidwells describes the route profile from Brive to the top of the Puy de D\u00f4me as \" looking like an upturned saw ... a perfect day to gain time , or lose it \" . In the end , it all came down to the final climb . Anquetil vs Poulidor . \" Now they were alone , the two contenders , George and the Dragon , head to head , \" Sidwells writes . \" It was time for each to show what he 'd got . Poulidor had it all to do ; he kept piling on the pressure , but Anquetil refused to ride behind him . No , that would give his rival confidence ; Anquetil rode directly alongside Poulidor , imposing his presence on him ... \" No other cyclist would have done what Anquetil did . Riding directly behind the man in front might give him confidence , but it 's proven to be the more efficient way of going about things . The following rider saves energy , can track the moves of the man in front , can time the moment to burst past . But then Anquetil always did things his own way . He knew he could n't let Poulidor go , and this was how he chose to stop him . Half a million spectators lined the road leading to the top of the Puy . None had seen anything like it . The showdown continued like this \u2013 two men locked in mortal combat \u2013 for an astonishing 10 km , on gradients that hit 13 per cent . The suffering was intense , the courage awesome . \" I never felt that bad on a bike , \" Poulidor said . More than 20 years later , dying from cancer , Anquetil told Poulidor the pain he was in was \" like racing up the Puy de D\u00f4me , all day , every day \" . Only with the finish almost in sight did Poulidor finally escape , and in that time he managed to cut 42 seconds from Anquetil 's lead . It was n't enough . Anquetil still had 14 seconds in hand , and there are those who say that his computer - like brain worked out exactly where he could afford to drop off and still not lose the overall lead . After the Puy , there were only two flat stages and a time trial left before Paris , which meant that , barring disaster , Anquetil had his fifth Tour victory in the bag . In the end , he won from Poulidor by 55 seconds \u2013 up till that point the narrowest Tour victory there had been . It would prove to be Anquetil 's last . He missed the Tour in ' 65 , abandoned it in ' 66 , and that was it . The era of the Master was over . Four other men have since clocked up five or more Tour wins \u2013 Eddy Merckx , Bernard Hinault , Miguel Indurain , and Lance Armstrong \u2013 but , as the first man to do so , Anquetil will always be special . Poulidor , meanwhile , kept going in the Tour until 1974 \u2013 a staggering feat of sustained effort , which if he had ever won the race might not have happened . But , alas , he never did win it . He finished third five times \u2013 including in his last Tour , when he was 40 \u2013 and he was runner - up three times . In 14 Tours \u2013 12 completed \u2013 he never once even wore the yellow jersey . \" The eternal second \" was how Poulidor came to be known , and that it so endeared him to his countrymen was probably scant consolation . Now 73 , Poulidor is still an occasional figure on the French cycling scene , much loved without ever becoming what you could call a celebrity . He lives in the area he grew up in , not far from Limoges ; and on the shores of the nearby Lac de Vassivi\u00e8re , tucked away among some trees , there is a delightful museum in his honour where bikes he rode and kit he wore are on display , along with photographs from his long , illustrious career . And no moment was more illustrious than when he and Jacques Anquetil faced each other down , and neither man gave a centimetre .

The showdown continued like this \u2013 two men locked in mortal combat \u2013 for an astonishing 10 km , on gradients that hit 13 per cent . The suffering was intense , the courage awesome . \" I never felt that bad on a bike , \" Poulidor said . More than 20 years later , dying from cancer , Anquetil told Poulidor the pain he was in was \" like racing up the Puy de D\u00f4me , all day , every day \" . Only with the finish almost in sight did Poulidor finally escape , and in that time he managed to cut 42 seconds from Anquetil 's lead . It was n't enough . Anquetil still had 14 seconds in hand , and there are those who say that his computer - like brain worked out exactly where he could afford to drop off and still not lose the overall lead . After the Puy , there were only two flat stages and a time trial left before Paris , which meant that , barring disaster , Anquetil had his fifth Tour victory in the bag . In the end , he won from Poulidor by 55 seconds \u2013 up till that point the narrowest Tour victory there had been . It would prove to be Anquetil 's last . He missed the Tour in ' 65 , abandoned it in ' 66 , and that was it . The era of the Master was over . Four other men have since clocked up five or more Tour wins \u2013 Eddy Merckx , Bernard Hinault , Miguel Indurain , and Lance Armstrong \u2013 but , as the first man to do so , Anquetil will always be special . Poulidor , meanwhile , kept going in the Tour until 1974 \u2013 a staggering feat of sustained effort , which if he had ever won the race might not have happened . But , alas , he never did win it . He finished third five times \u2013 including in his last Tour , when he was 40 \u2013 and he was runner - up three times . In 14 Tours \u2013 12 completed \u2013 he never once even wore the yellow jersey . \" The eternal second \" was how Poulidor came to be known , and that it so endeared him to his countrymen was probably scant consolation . Now 73 , Poulidor is still an occasional figure on the French cycling scene , much loved without ever becoming what you could call a celebrity . He lives in the area he grew up in , not far from Limoges ; and on the shores of the nearby Lac de Vassivi\u00e8re , tucked away among some trees , there is a delightful museum in his honour where bikes he rode and kit he wore are on display , along with photographs from his long , illustrious career . And no moment was more illustrious than when he and Jacques Anquetil faced each other down , and neither man gave a centimetre .

Includes the Catholic Encyclopedia , Church Fathers , Summa , Bible and more all for only $ 19.99 ... The Truce of God is a temporary suspension of hostilities , as distinct from the Peace of God which is perpetual . The jurisdiction of the Peace of God is narrower than that of the Truce . Under the Peace of God are included only : At an early date the councils extended the Peace of God to the Church 's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s , the poor , pilgrims , crusaders , and even merchants on a journey . The peace of the sanctuary gave rise to the right of asylum . Finally it was the sanctification of Sunday which gave rise to the Truce of God , for it had always been agreed not to do battle on that day and to suspend disputes in the law-courts . The Truce of God dates only from the eleventh century . It arose amid the anarchy of feudalism as a remedy for the powerlessness of lay authorities to enforce respect for the public peace . There was then an epidemic of private wars , which made Europe a battlefield bristling with fortified castles and overrun by armed bands who respected nothing , not even sanctuaries , clergy , or consecrated days . A Council of Elne in 1027 , in a canon concerning the sanctification of Sunday , forbade hostilities from Saturday night until Monday morning . Here may be seen the germ of the Truce of God . This prohibition was subsequently extended to the days of the week consecrated by the great mysteries of Christianity , viz . , Thursday , in memory of the Ascension , Friday , the day of the Passion , and Saturday , the day of the Resurrection ( council 1041 ) . Still another step included Advent and Lent in the Truce . Efforts were made in this way to limit the scourge of private war without suppressing it outright . The penalty was excommunication . The Truce soon spread from France to Italy and Germany ; the oecumenical council of 1179 extended the institution to the whole Church by Canon xxi , \" De treugis servandis \" , which was inserted in the collection of canon law ( Decretal of Gregory IX , I , tit . , \" De treuga et pace \" ) . The problem of the public peace which was the great desideratum of the Middle Ages was not solved at one stroke , but at least the impetus was given . Gradually the public authorities , royalty , the leagues between nobles ( Landfrieden ) , and the communes followed the impulse and finally restricted war to international conflicts .

The Truce of God is a temporary suspension of hostilities , as distinct from the Peace of God which is perpetual . The jurisdiction of the Peace of God is narrower than that of the Truce . Under the Peace of God are included only : At an early date the councils extended the Peace of God to the Church 's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s , the poor , pilgrims , crusaders , and even merchants on a journey . The peace of the sanctuary gave rise to the right of asylum . Finally it was the sanctification of Sunday which gave rise to the Truce of God , for it had always been agreed not to do battle on that day and to suspend disputes in the law-courts . The Truce of God dates only from the eleventh century . It arose amid the anarchy of feudalism as a remedy for the powerlessness of lay authorities to enforce respect for the public peace . There was then an epidemic of private wars , which made Europe a battlefield bristling with fortified castles and overrun by armed bands who respected nothing , not even sanctuaries , clergy , or consecrated days . A Council of Elne in 1027 , in a canon concerning the sanctification of Sunday , forbade hostilities from Saturday night until Monday morning . Here may be seen the germ of the Truce of God . This prohibition was subsequently extended to the days of the week consecrated by the great mysteries of Christianity , viz . , Thursday , in memory of the Ascension , Friday , the day of the Passion , and Saturday , the day of the Resurrection ( council 1041 ) . Still another step included Advent and Lent in the Truce . Efforts were made in this way to limit the scourge of private war without suppressing it outright . The penalty was excommunication . The Truce soon spread from France to Italy and Germany ; the oecumenical council of 1179 extended the institution to the whole Church by Canon xxi , \" De treugis servandis \" , which was inserted in the collection of canon law ( Decretal of Gregory IX , I , tit . , \" De treuga et pace \" ) . The problem of the public peace which was the great desideratum of the Middle Ages was not solved at one stroke , but at least the impetus was given . Gradually the public authorities , royalty , the leagues between nobles ( Landfrieden ) , and the communes followed the impulse and finally restricted war to international conflicts .

But within a few years , as Hitler rose to power , the two had to flee Germany and reinvent their lives and careers in America . Their relationship is at the center of a new musical , LoveMusik , which opens this week on Broadway \u2014 and when you discover a little more about Weill and Lenya , you realize theirs was a complex relationship indeed . Weill said that when he wrote his music , he heard Lenya singing it . But they were an unlikely couple from the start . He was the button-down musical prodigy from a German Jewish family ; his father was a cantor . She was the free-spirited actress from an Austrian Roman Catholic family , a victim of child abuse who 'd been a teenage prostitute . And yet when Weill and Lenya met , each found a soul mate , according to music historian Kim Kowalke . \" I like to say that Weill gave voice to Lenya 's music , and she gave voice to his , \" Kowalke says . \" And through all the affairs and all the time separated , the one thing that seemed to keep them together was , yes , their affection for each other \u2014 but it seemed also to be Weill 's music . \" Kowalke co-edited Speak Low , a volume of collected letters that chronicles the ups and downs of Lenya and Weill 's relationship . Legendary Broadway director Hal Prince , whose credits include Sweeney Todd and Cabaret , among others , read the book and saw a show in it . He sent it to Alfred Uhry , the Pulitzer Prize - winning playwright , \" the minute I read it . \" Uhry , for his part , was n't immediately thrilled . He says the task of dramatizing Weill and Lenya 's life story was intimidating . \" When I was given the book of letters , the next day a huge , big package of CDs came from the Kurt Weill Foundation to sort of further intimidate me , \" he says . \" And I listened to those CDs for months \u2014 months \u2014 while I was reading the book , and gradually it began to find its way into my head , how to do it . \" Uhry and Prince have worked on LoveMusik for the past four years , creating not so much a traditional musical but a play with music \u2014 a lot of music . Michael Cerveris , who plays Weill , says that was the only way . \" The distinctive personal voice that you hear when you listen to the music , \" Cerveris says , \" made me feel that that was the way to sort of find the soul of the man . \" Both Cerveris and co-star Donna Murphy , who plays Lenya , did a lot of research to prepare for their roles . Murphy 's dressing room is filled with CDs and books . \" With Lenya , you feel an obligation to honor who she was , \" Murphy says . \" But from the beginning , Hal said to me that he was n't looking for a reproduction or an imitation ; he was looking for an essence . \" Love Musik spans a period of more than 25 years , from Lenya and Weill 's first meeting as little - known artists to their triumphs in Europe and America to Weill 's untimely death of a heart attack at age 50 . \" I think they loved each other almost from the first day , and they really never stopped , \" Uhry says . Not that it was easy : They had an open marriage , with its own dynamic . \" Many obstacles were in their path , \" Uhry says . \" Her own sleeping with a lot of guys and his commitment to his work ; he always said his music came first . But they loved each other , and they needed each other , and they managed to stay together . \" LoveMusik also explores another key \u2014 and complicated \u2014 relationship in Weill 's life : the professional one he shared with German poet and playwright Bertolt Brecht . The two had a brief but important collaboration in the late ' 20s and early ' 30s ; they wrote several shows together , including The Threepenny Opera .

But within a few years , as Hitler rose to power , the two had to flee Germany and reinvent their lives and careers in America . Their relationship is at the center of a new musical , LoveMusik , which opens this week on Broadway \u2014 and when you discover a little more about Weill and Lenya , you realize theirs was a complex relationship indeed . Weill said that when he wrote his music , he heard Lenya singing it . But they were an unlikely couple from the start . He was the button-down musical prodigy from a German Jewish family ; his father was a cantor . She was the free-spirited actress from an Austrian Roman Catholic family , a victim of child abuse who 'd been a teenage prostitute . And yet when Weill and Lenya met , each found a soul mate , according to music historian Kim Kowalke . \" I like to say that Weill gave voice to Lenya 's music , and she gave voice to his , \" Kowalke says . \" And through all the affairs and all the time separated , the one thing that seemed to keep them together was , yes , their affection for each other \u2014 but it seemed also to be Weill 's music . \" Kowalke co-edited Speak Low , a volume of collected letters that chronicles the ups and downs of Lenya and Weill 's relationship . Legendary Broadway director Hal Prince , whose credits include Sweeney Todd and Cabaret , among others , read the book and saw a show in it . He sent it to Alfred Uhry , the Pulitzer Prize - winning playwright , \" the minute I read it . \" Uhry , for his part , was n't immediately thrilled . He says the task of dramatizing Weill and Lenya 's life story was intimidating . \" When I was given the book of letters , the next day a huge , big package of CDs came from the Kurt Weill Foundation to sort of further intimidate me , \" he says . \" And I listened to those CDs for months \u2014 months \u2014 while I was reading the book , and gradually it began to find its way into my head , how to do it . \" Uhry and Prince have worked on LoveMusik for the past four years , creating not so much a traditional musical but a play with music \u2014 a lot of music . Michael Cerveris , who plays Weill , says that was the only way . \" The distinctive personal voice that you hear when you listen to the music , \" Cerveris says , \" made me feel that that was the way to sort of find the soul of the man . \" Both Cerveris and co-star Donna Murphy , who plays Lenya , did a lot of research to prepare for their roles . Murphy 's dressing room is filled with CDs and books . \" With Lenya , you feel an obligation to honor who she was , \" Murphy says . \" But from the beginning , Hal said to me that he was n't looking for a reproduction or an imitation ; he was looking for an essence . \" Love Musik spans a period of more than 25 years , from Lenya and Weill 's first meeting as little - known artists to their triumphs in Europe and America to Weill 's untimely death of a heart attack at age 50 . \" I think they loved each other almost from the first day , and they really never stopped , \" Uhry says . Not that it was easy : They had an open marriage , with its own dynamic . \" Many obstacles were in their path , \" Uhry says . \" Her own sleeping with a lot of guys and his commitment to his work ; he always said his music came first . But they loved each other , and they needed each other , and they managed to stay together . \" LoveMusik also explores another key \u2014 and complicated \u2014 relationship in Weill 's life : the professional one he shared with German poet and playwright Bertolt Brecht . The two had a brief but important collaboration in the late ' 20s and early ' 30s ; they wrote several shows together , including The Threepenny Opera . Kowalke says that at the beginning , the Marxist playwright and the left-leaning composer got along . \" Brecht gave Weill the contemporary language , the poetry he needed , \" Kowalke says . \" And on the other hand , Weill 's music gave Brecht 's poetry and plays a way to access an audience , without the audience feeling like they were being hit over the head .

The famed particle is a missing link in current theories of physics , used to explain how things gains their mass . Rumours have been swirling about the findings for weeks , ahead of the announcement on Tuesday afternoon . It is likely to yield only tantalising hints , as the teams do not have enough data to claim a formal discovery . However , most physicists concede that not finding the Higgs boson is as exciting a prospect as finding it in the place where existing theory predicts it should be . \" If we would n't find it it would be even - in a way - more exciting , but you know , both ways , it 's a win-win situation , \" said Prof Stefan Soldner - Rembold , a particle physicist from the University of Manchester . \" [ If ] we find it , we know this theory 's complete , but there 's still more things to look for . If we do n't find it , we know there must be something else which we have n't understood yet . \" Field day Finding the Higgs was a key goal for the $ 10 bn ( \u00c2\u00a3 6bn ) Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) - a 27km ( 17 - mile ) circumference accelerator ring of superconducting magnets , designed to re-create the conditions just after the Big Bang in an attempt to answer fundamental questions of science and the Universe itself . The collider hosts two experiments - Atlas and CMS - that are searching for the particle independently . There is intense excitement among physicists working at Cern , the Geneva - based organisation which operates the collider , over hints that the hunters have cornered their quarry . \" It is a fantastic time at the moment , you can feel people are enthusiastic , \" Dr Christoph Rembser , a senior scientist on the Atlas experiment , told BBC News . \" It is really very lively . \" Prof Soldner - Rembold called the quality of the LHC 's results \" exceptional \" , adding : \" Within one year we will probably know whether the Higgs particle exists , but it is likely not going to be a Christmas present . \" He told me : \" The Higgs particle would , of course , be a great discovery , but it would be an even greater discovery if it did n't exist where theory predicts it to be . \" The Higgs boson is a \" fundamental \" particle ; one of the basic building blocks of the Universe . It is also the last missing piece in the leading theory of particle physics - known as the Standard Model - which describes how particles and forces interact . The Higgs explains why other particles have mass . As the Universe cooled after the Big Bang , an invisible force known as the Higgs field formed together with its associated boson particle . It is this field ( and not the boson ) that imparts mass to the fundamental particles that make up atoms . Without it , these particles would zip through the cosmos at the speed of light . Mass mechanism The way the Higgs field works has been likened to the way photographers and reporters congregate around a celebrity . The cluster of people are strongly attracted to the celebrity and create resistance to his or her movement across a room . In other words , they give the celebrity \" mass \" . \" The thing about the Higgs is that we always say we need it to explain mass . But the real importance of it is that we need it to make sense of the Universe , \" said Dr Tara Shears , a particle physicist at Liverpool University . She told BBC News : \" Discovering the Higgs confirms that the approach we have been taking to understand the Universe is correct . \" Such deeper motivations underlie the current effort at Cern to dislodge the Higgs and other phenomena . Housed in a 27km - long circular tunnel beneath the French - Swiss border , the LHC smashes particle beams together at close to the speed of light , with the aim of detecting new particles in the debris . Physicists do not know the mass of the Higgs itself , which has made hunting for it more difficult . They have to look for the particle by systematically searching a range of masses where it is predicted to be .

The famed particle is a missing link in current theories of physics , used to explain how things gains their mass . Rumours have been swirling about the findings for weeks , ahead of the announcement on Tuesday afternoon . It is likely to yield only tantalising hints , as the teams do not have enough data to claim a formal discovery . However , most physicists concede that not finding the Higgs boson is as exciting a prospect as finding it in the place where existing theory predicts it should be . \" If we would n't find it it would be even - in a way - more exciting , but you know , both ways , it 's a win-win situation , \" said Prof Stefan Soldner - Rembold , a particle physicist from the University of Manchester . \" [ If ] we find it , we know this theory 's complete , but there 's still more things to look for . If we do n't find it , we know there must be something else which we have n't understood yet . \" Field day Finding the Higgs was a key goal for the $ 10 bn ( \u00c2\u00a3 6bn ) Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) - a 27km ( 17 - mile ) circumference accelerator ring of superconducting magnets , designed to re-create the conditions just after the Big Bang in an attempt to answer fundamental questions of science and the Universe itself . The collider hosts two experiments - Atlas and CMS - that are searching for the particle independently . There is intense excitement among physicists working at Cern , the Geneva - based organisation which operates the collider , over hints that the hunters have cornered their quarry . \" It is a fantastic time at the moment , you can feel people are enthusiastic , \" Dr Christoph Rembser , a senior scientist on the Atlas experiment , told BBC News . \" It is really very lively . \" Prof Soldner - Rembold called the quality of the LHC 's results \" exceptional \" , adding : \" Within one year we will probably know whether the Higgs particle exists , but it is likely not going to be a Christmas present . \" He told me : \" The Higgs particle would , of course , be a great discovery , but it would be an even greater discovery if it did n't exist where theory predicts it to be . \" The Higgs boson is a \" fundamental \" particle ; one of the basic building blocks of the Universe . It is also the last missing piece in the leading theory of particle physics - known as the Standard Model - which describes how particles and forces interact . The Higgs explains why other particles have mass . As the Universe cooled after the Big Bang , an invisible force known as the Higgs field formed together with its associated boson particle . It is this field ( and not the boson ) that imparts mass to the fundamental particles that make up atoms . Without it , these particles would zip through the cosmos at the speed of light . Mass mechanism The way the Higgs field works has been likened to the way photographers and reporters congregate around a celebrity . The cluster of people are strongly attracted to the celebrity and create resistance to his or her movement across a room . In other words , they give the celebrity \" mass \" . \" The thing about the Higgs is that we always say we need it to explain mass . But the real importance of it is that we need it to make sense of the Universe , \" said Dr Tara Shears , a particle physicist at Liverpool University . She told BBC News : \" Discovering the Higgs confirms that the approach we have been taking to understand the Universe is correct . \" Such deeper motivations underlie the current effort at Cern to dislodge the Higgs and other phenomena . Housed in a 27km - long circular tunnel beneath the French - Swiss border , the LHC smashes particle beams together at close to the speed of light , with the aim of detecting new particles in the debris . Physicists do not know the mass of the Higgs itself , which has made hunting for it more difficult . They have to look for the particle by systematically searching a range of masses where it is predicted to be . From 1989-2000 , Cern 's LEP particle smasher ruled the Higgs out up to a mass of 114 gigaelectronvolts ( GeV ) .

In Pernambuco , nearly 4,000 children born in 2015 show congenital malformations , especially MICROCEPHALY ( heads smaller than usual ) . The Brazilian Ministry of Health promptly claimed that it was a consequence of the infection caused by the Zika virus ( 1 ) Discovered in 1947 in the Zika forest in Uganda , the ZIKA virus is an arbovirus of the genus Flavivirus , similar to the virus causing dengue , yellow fever , Japanese encephalitis , West Nile fever , and St. Louis encephalitis . First human cases of Zika infection were described during the 1960 's in Africa ; after that there were outbreaks in Southeast Asia and Oceania ( 2 ) . Up until 2007 , when a large epidemic appeared in Yap \u2014 an island in the Pacific Ocean ( Micronesia ) \u2014 Zika infections had been limited to sporadic cases or small - scale epidemics . During the Yap epidemic , an estimated three - quarters of the local population had been infected . ( 2 ) The expanding area of distribution of ZIKA turned Zika fever into an emerging disease , confirmed by the current epidemic affecting French Polynesia since October 2013 and New Caledonia , with reported cases since late 2013 . These Pacific Islands are characterised by the large number of mosquitoes that proliferate especially among native villages . ( 2 ) In May 2015 , the World Health Organization reported native cases identified in Brazil . Last December , the Ministry of Health estimated that 440,000 to 1,300,000 suspected cases of Zika virus disease had occurred in Brazil during 2015 . ( 2 ) The true incidence of Zika fever is unknown , due to the fact that its clinical manifestations imitate the infection caused by Dengue virus , and to the lack of simple and reliable lab tests . In endemic areas , epidemiological studies show a high prevalence of antibodies against ZIKA . For example , the 2007 Yap epidemic resulted in an attack rate of 14.6/1,000 inhabitants , and a seroprevalence of 750/1000 inhabitants after the epidemic ( i.e. 750/1000 had the infection without developing the disease . ) The infection appears to be symptomatic only in 18 % of cases . ( 2 - 3 ) It usually happens as a flu-like syndrome , often confused with other arbovirus infections such as Dengue or Chikungunya . The typical form of the disease is associated with low- grade fever ( between 37.8 \u00ba C and 38.5 \u00ba C ) , arthralgia , especially of small joints in hands and feet , myalgia , headache , retro-orbital pain , conjunctivitis , and maculopapular rash . Digestive problems ( abdominal pain , diarrhoea , constipation ) , ulceration of mucous membranes ( thrush ) , and itching can be rarely observed . Asthenia after infection seems to be common . ( 2 ) On December 2013 , during the Zika epidemic in French Polinesia , an increase in cases of Guillain Barre syndrome , a neurological paralysis linked to immune disruption generated by viruses , vaccines and / or environmental toxins , was reported . ( 4 ) Zika in Brazil On January 2016 , the Brazilian Association for Collective Health ( ABRASCO ) published a Technical Note and Open Letter to the People of Brazil ( 1 ) , questioning the linear analysis carried out by the Ministry of Health of Brazil , which linked the emergent congenital malformations to Zika , leaving aside other factors that can have an influence on the problem , and minimising the fact that the widespread epidemic in the Pacific and the current epidemic in Colombia , resulted in no cases of malformations , much less microcephaly . Above all , the role of the chemical model for vector control is ignored . This model , implying the mass usage of chemical poisons in order to reduce or eradicate the presence of mosquitoes , has been carried out in the most vulnerable areas of Northeast Brazil for 40 years , whilst the epidemics , poverty , social marginalisation , deforestation , and climate change have multiplied . Since the second half of 2014 , the Brazilian Ministry of Health ( 5 ) stopped using temephos ( an organophosphate agrotoxic to which Aedes larvae became resistant ) as larvicide , massively incorporating the poison Pyroproxyfen , commercially known as Sumilarv and manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical , Japanese company associated with Monsanto in Latin America for marketing of pesticides to control \u00ab weeds \u00bb . ( 1,5 ) . The spatial distribution by place of residence of mothers of children born with microcephaly shows a higher concentration in the poorest areas of Northeastern Brazil , with poor urbanisation and inadequate sanitation . Large areas of Recife and other cities in Northeastern Brazil , with intermittent water supply , led these communities to store water at home in an unsafe manner , due to the inadequate protection of tanks intended for human consumption , leading to very favourable conditions for the Aedes Aegypti mosquito , by creating a breeding ground which should not exist and that can be mechanically removed . ( 1 ) Pyroproxyfen is applied directly by the Brazilian Ministry of Health on drinking - water reservoirs used by the people of Pernambuco , where the proliferation of the Aedes mosquito is very high ( a situation similar to the Pacific Islands ) . ( 6 ) This poison , recommended by the WHO , is a growth inhibitor of mosquito larvae , which alters the development process larva-pupa-adult , thus generating malformations in developing mosquitoes and causing their death or incapacity . It is analogous to the insect juvenile hormone or juvenoids , which has the effect of inhibiting the development of adult insect characteristics ( for example wings , mature external genitalia ) and the reproductive development , maintaining an \u00ab immature \u00bb aspect ( nymph or larvae ) , which means that it acts by endocrine disruption and that is teratogenic . Malformations detected in thousands of children from pregnant women living in areas where the Brazilian state added pyriproxyfen to drinking water is not a coincidence , even though the Ministry of Health places a direct blame on Zika virus for this damage , while trying to ignore its responsibility and ruling out the hypothesis of direct and cumulative chemical damage caused by years of endocrine and immunological disruption of the affected population . Doctors from the Brazilian Association for Collective Health ( ABRASCO ) demand that urgent epidemiological studies taking into account this causal link be carried out , especially when among 3,893 cases of malformations confirmed until January 20 , 2016 , 49 children have died and only five of them were confirmed to have been infected with Zika ( 1 ) . Many policy - makers , even PAHO and OMS , epidemiologists , public health experts , chemists and politicians in general easily forget that human beings , every one of us , have deployed embryonic development processes in which we go through very different stages . The evolution from zygote to embryo , from embryo to foetus and from foetus to newborn , is not far from the development process of the mosquito affected by pyriproxyfen . They also very easily try to ignore that in humans , 60 % of our active genes are identical to those of insects such as the Aedes mosquito . And it is much more confusing when they are \u201c advised \u201d by experts from Foundations and chemical insecticides companies ( for ex . : Fundaci\u00f3n Mundo Sano and Chemotecnica ) , or when decision makers from the Ministry of Health are former employees of global companies manufacturing and selling poisons for \u201c domestic purposes . \u201d Brazil fumigates against adult Aedes using Malation , a carcinogenic organophosphorate compound according to WHO . Paraguay acquired thousands of tonnes of clorpyriphos in order to kill mosquitoes , although we know that clorpyriphos affects the developing brain of foetus and newborns . In Argentina , vector \u201c control \u201d is carried out using pyrethroids , which is a little less toxic but banned in Europe because of its effect on people . For doctors in ABRASCO , the problem is that behind these decisions we find the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization , holding \u00ab Pesticides \u00bb committees that maintain no dialogue with the environmental , sanitation and health promotion committees . In these agencies , the committees prescribing the use and regulation of the purchase of supplies for vector control for the entire world are imperial . It is these agencies who convince and endorse the tendering processes for national governments . ( 1 ) How to face these diseases The hegemonic strategies for facing these diseases spread by mosquitoes and multiplied by poverty , lack of sanitation , excreta , lack of safe water , are vertical intervention programs , while chemical poisons ( larvicides and adulticides ) demobilise the population by relying on the success of the poison 's properties , which in turn makes them sick , kills the natural predators of mosquitoes and generates the need for repeated applications that only benefit the chemical poisons companies . A vast amount of independent scientific data shows how this strategy is defective and that it is only useful for taking photographs of the rulers in office . Community - based strategies including social participation and mobilisation yield better results against the impending epidemic . ( 7,8,9 ) The steps that lead to defeating the disease are linked to social justice and equity . Clearly , the social sectors affected by Dengue and Zika are the poorest and most deprived of services and rights . In some very specific moments , massive aerial spraying over inhabited areas might be advisable , but their effects are limited only to decreasing the amount of adult mosquitoes during 2 - 3 days , which can be useful when colder days arrive ( note that the Aedes mosquito is immobilised and does not reproduce nor feed with temperatures below 23 \u00b0C . ) Controlled applications around houses in the first case ( focus control ) are useful to decrease the progress of the epidemic , but massive sprayings over entire cities requires an analysis of health costs ( damage to human health and the ecosystem ) vs health benefits ( control and mitigation of the epidemic ) , which cannot be justified in any \u00ab sanitary \u00bb way , despite being used by governments and the hegemonic press to simulate that measures are taken to defend the health of people . Our experience from the Dengue epidemic in Cordoba in 2009 , in which we had direct participation , shows that the distribution of cases corresponds to the same distribution of infant mortality in 2007 and the distribution of the population with higher unmet basic needs , namely : lack of housing , jobs , education and health , which can be seen on the maps attached . Massive spraying is not the solution to a problem ; it 's merely generating a business within a problem . New strategy : GM mosquitoes ( new business ) Within this framework , there is a new health intervention strategy in Brazil , which they will try to expand to the entire region : GM mosquitoes . The English company Oxitec sells male GM mosquitoes , supposedly in order to decrease the Aedes population . A lethal gene is inserted in those mosquitoes , which is transmitted to the offspring , causing death to larvae if it is not blocked by an antibiotic ( tetracycline ) . The goal is that millions of male mosquitoes are released to mate with wild females , so that their eggs result in larvae which dies spontaneously . ( 10,11 ) The business is to sell those lab mosquitoes to governments , and then people need to \u201c protect \u201d those mosquitoes because , supposedly , it is neither necessary nor advisable to remove the sites where mosquitoes breed . Currently in Brazil nearly 15 million GM mosquitoes have been released , and the failure is complete . Where field tests were carried out , less than 15 % of larvae were transgenic , that is to say \u2026 wild females are not accepting the English mosquito from Oxitec . The response : increasing the release in poor areas . ( 10 ) Also , we must take into account that the biology of the disease shows that the female only \u00ab stings \u00bb when it 's pregnant and generating eggs after being fertilised by a male ; it does it in that state and only then , because it needs blood components in order to develop the eggs . So , if millions of male mosquitoes are released , there will be many more fertilised females looking to suck the blood of mammals , thus increasing the spreading of the disease from infected people to healthy people ! In the face of the Zika threat , mass sprayings in Mercosur The governments of Mercosur are causing alarm with the threat of Zika and microcephaly , proposing \u00ab more of the same . \u00bb The agribusiness is offering the services of the \u00ab Soya Air Force \u00bb to be used for spraying over cities and villages . ( 12 ) Monoculture , the massive use of pesticides , deforestation , destruction of flora and fauna , ecological imbalance , climate change , inequality , those factors are not considered as a cause of the problem . To social inequality , these epidemics will add health inequalities , and governments with their chemical attacks will generate environmental inequality .

In Pernambuco , nearly 4,000 children born in 2015 show congenital malformations , especially MICROCEPHALY ( heads smaller than usual ) . The Brazilian Ministry of Health promptly claimed that it was a consequence of the infection caused by the Zika virus ( 1 ) Discovered in 1947 in the Zika forest in Uganda , the ZIKA virus is an arbovirus of the genus Flavivirus , similar to the virus causing dengue , yellow fever , Japanese encephalitis , West Nile fever , and St. Louis encephalitis . First human cases of Zika infection were described during the 1960 's in Africa ; after that there were outbreaks in Southeast Asia and Oceania ( 2 ) . Up until 2007 , when a large epidemic appeared in Yap \u2014 an island in the Pacific Ocean ( Micronesia ) \u2014 Zika infections had been limited to sporadic cases or small - scale epidemics . During the Yap epidemic , an estimated three - quarters of the local population had been infected . ( 2 ) The expanding area of distribution of ZIKA turned Zika fever into an emerging disease , confirmed by the current epidemic affecting French Polynesia since October 2013 and New Caledonia , with reported cases since late 2013 . These Pacific Islands are characterised by the large number of mosquitoes that proliferate especially among native villages . ( 2 ) In May 2015 , the World Health Organization reported native cases identified in Brazil . Last December , the Ministry of Health estimated that 440,000 to 1,300,000 suspected cases of Zika virus disease had occurred in Brazil during 2015 . ( 2 ) The true incidence of Zika fever is unknown , due to the fact that its clinical manifestations imitate the infection caused by Dengue virus , and to the lack of simple and reliable lab tests . In endemic areas , epidemiological studies show a high prevalence of antibodies against ZIKA . For example , the 2007 Yap epidemic resulted in an attack rate of 14.6/1,000 inhabitants , and a seroprevalence of 750/1000 inhabitants after the epidemic ( i.e. 750/1000 had the infection without developing the disease . ) The infection appears to be symptomatic only in 18 % of cases . ( 2 - 3 ) It usually happens as a flu-like syndrome , often confused with other arbovirus infections such as Dengue or Chikungunya . The typical form of the disease is associated with low- grade fever ( between 37.8 \u00ba C and 38.5 \u00ba C ) , arthralgia , especially of small joints in hands and feet , myalgia , headache , retro-orbital pain , conjunctivitis , and maculopapular rash . Digestive problems ( abdominal pain , diarrhoea , constipation ) , ulceration of mucous membranes ( thrush ) , and itching can be rarely observed . Asthenia after infection seems to be common . ( 2 ) On December 2013 , during the Zika epidemic in French Polinesia , an increase in cases of Guillain Barre syndrome , a neurological paralysis linked to immune disruption generated by viruses , vaccines and / or environmental toxins , was reported . ( 4 ) Zika in Brazil On January 2016 , the Brazilian Association for Collective Health ( ABRASCO ) published a Technical Note and Open Letter to the People of Brazil ( 1 ) , questioning the linear analysis carried out by the Ministry of Health of Brazil , which linked the emergent congenital malformations to Zika , leaving aside other factors that can have an influence on the problem , and minimising the fact that the widespread epidemic in the Pacific and the current epidemic in Colombia , resulted in no cases of malformations , much less microcephaly . Above all , the role of the chemical model for vector control is ignored . This model , implying the mass usage of chemical poisons in order to reduce or eradicate the presence of mosquitoes , has been carried out in the most vulnerable areas of Northeast Brazil for 40 years , whilst the epidemics , poverty , social marginalisation , deforestation , and climate change have multiplied . Since the second half of 2014 , the Brazilian Ministry of Health ( 5 ) stopped using temephos ( an organophosphate agrotoxic to which Aedes larvae became resistant ) as larvicide , massively incorporating the poison Pyroproxyfen , commercially known as Sumilarv and manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical , Japanese company associated with Monsanto in Latin America for marketing of pesticides to control \u00ab weeds \u00bb . ( 1,5 ) . The spatial distribution by place of residence of mothers of children born with microcephaly shows a higher concentration in the poorest areas of Northeastern Brazil , with poor urbanisation and inadequate sanitation . Large areas of Recife and other cities in Northeastern Brazil , with intermittent water supply , led these communities to store water at home in an unsafe manner , due to the inadequate protection of tanks intended for human consumption , leading to very favourable conditions for the Aedes Aegypti mosquito , by creating a breeding ground which should not exist and that can be mechanically removed . ( 1 ) Pyroproxyfen is applied directly by the Brazilian Ministry of Health on drinking - water reservoirs used by the people of Pernambuco , where the proliferation of the Aedes mosquito is very high ( a situation similar to the Pacific Islands ) . ( 6 ) This poison , recommended by the WHO , is a growth inhibitor of mosquito larvae , which alters the development process larva-pupa-adult , thus generating malformations in developing mosquitoes and causing their death or incapacity . It is analogous to the insect juvenile hormone or juvenoids , which has the effect of inhibiting the development of adult insect characteristics ( for example wings , mature external genitalia ) and the reproductive development , maintaining an \u00ab immature \u00bb aspect ( nymph or larvae ) , which means that it acts by endocrine disruption and that is teratogenic . Malformations detected in thousands of children from pregnant women living in areas where the Brazilian state added pyriproxyfen to drinking water is not a coincidence , even though the Ministry of Health places a direct blame on Zika virus for this damage , while trying to ignore its responsibility and ruling out the hypothesis of direct and cumulative chemical damage caused by years of endocrine and immunological disruption of the affected population . Doctors from the Brazilian Association for Collective Health ( ABRASCO ) demand that urgent epidemiological studies taking into account this causal link be carried out , especially when among 3,893 cases of malformations confirmed until January 20 , 2016 , 49 children have died and only five of them were confirmed to have been infected with Zika ( 1 ) . Many policy - makers , even PAHO and OMS , epidemiologists , public health experts , chemists and politicians in general easily forget that human beings , every one of us , have deployed embryonic development processes in which we go through very different stages . The evolution from zygote to embryo , from embryo to foetus and from foetus to newborn , is not far from the development process of the mosquito affected by pyriproxyfen . They also very easily try to ignore that in humans , 60 % of our active genes are identical to those of insects such as the Aedes mosquito . And it is much more confusing when they are \u201c advised \u201d by experts from Foundations and chemical insecticides companies ( for ex . : Fundaci\u00f3n Mundo Sano and Chemotecnica ) , or when decision makers from the Ministry of Health are former employees of global companies manufacturing and selling poisons for \u201c domestic purposes . \u201d Brazil fumigates against adult Aedes using Malation , a carcinogenic organophosphorate compound according to WHO . Paraguay acquired thousands of tonnes of clorpyriphos in order to kill mosquitoes , although we know that clorpyriphos affects the developing brain of foetus and newborns . In Argentina , vector \u201c control \u201d is carried out using pyrethroids , which is a little less toxic but banned in Europe because of its effect on people . For doctors in ABRASCO , the problem is that behind these decisions we find the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization , holding \u00ab Pesticides \u00bb committees that maintain no dialogue with the environmental , sanitation and health promotion committees . In these agencies , the committees prescribing the use and regulation of the purchase of supplies for vector control for the entire world are imperial . It is these agencies who convince and endorse the tendering processes for national governments . ( 1 ) How to face these diseases The hegemonic strategies for facing these diseases spread by mosquitoes and multiplied by poverty , lack of sanitation , excreta , lack of safe water , are vertical intervention programs , while chemical poisons ( larvicides and adulticides ) demobilise the population by relying on the success of the poison 's properties , which in turn makes them sick , kills the natural predators of mosquitoes and generates the need for repeated applications that only benefit the chemical poisons companies . A vast amount of independent scientific data shows how this strategy is defective and that it is only useful for taking photographs of the rulers in office . Community - based strategies including social participation and mobilisation yield better results against the impending epidemic . ( 7,8,9 ) The steps that lead to defeating the disease are linked to social justice and equity . Clearly , the social sectors affected by Dengue and Zika are the poorest and most deprived of services and rights . In some very specific moments , massive aerial spraying over inhabited areas might be advisable , but their effects are limited only to decreasing the amount of adult mosquitoes during 2 - 3 days , which can be useful when colder days arrive ( note that the Aedes mosquito is immobilised and does not reproduce nor feed with temperatures below 23 \u00b0C . ) Controlled applications around houses in the first case ( focus control ) are useful to decrease the progress of the epidemic , but massive sprayings over entire cities requires an analysis of health costs ( damage to human health and the ecosystem ) vs health benefits ( control and mitigation of the epidemic ) , which cannot be justified in any \u00ab sanitary \u00bb way , despite being used by governments and the hegemonic press to simulate that measures are taken to defend the health of people . Our experience from the Dengue epidemic in Cordoba in 2009 , in which we had direct participation , shows that the distribution of cases corresponds to the same distribution of infant mortality in 2007 and the distribution of the population with higher unmet basic needs , namely : lack of housing , jobs , education and health , which can be seen on the maps attached . Massive spraying is not the solution to a problem ; it 's merely generating a business within a problem . New strategy : GM mosquitoes ( new business ) Within this framework , there is a new health intervention strategy in Brazil , which they will try to expand to the entire region : GM mosquitoes . The English company Oxitec sells male GM mosquitoes , supposedly in order to decrease the Aedes population . A lethal gene is inserted in those mosquitoes , which is transmitted to the offspring , causing death to larvae if it is not blocked by an antibiotic ( tetracycline ) . The goal is that millions of male mosquitoes are released to mate with wild females , so that their eggs result in larvae which dies spontaneously . ( 10,11 ) The business is to sell those lab mosquitoes to governments , and then people need to \u201c protect \u201d those mosquitoes because , supposedly , it is neither necessary nor advisable to remove the sites where mosquitoes breed . Currently in Brazil nearly 15 million GM mosquitoes have been released , and the failure is complete . Where field tests were carried out , less than 15 % of larvae were transgenic , that is to say \u2026 wild females are not accepting the English mosquito from Oxitec . The response : increasing the release in poor areas . ( 10 ) Also , we must take into account that the biology of the disease shows that the female only \u00ab stings \u00bb when it 's pregnant and generating eggs after being fertilised by a male ; it does it in that state and only then , because it needs blood components in order to develop the eggs . So , if millions of male mosquitoes are released , there will be many more fertilised females looking to suck the blood of mammals , thus increasing the spreading of the disease from infected people to healthy people ! In the face of the Zika threat , mass sprayings in Mercosur The governments of Mercosur are causing alarm with the threat of Zika and microcephaly , proposing \u00ab more of the same . \u00bb The agribusiness is offering the services of the \u00ab Soya Air Force \u00bb to be used for spraying over cities and villages . ( 12 ) Monoculture , the massive use of pesticides , deforestation , destruction of flora and fauna , ecological imbalance , climate change , inequality , those factors are not considered as a cause of the problem . To social inequality , these epidemics will add health inequalities , and governments with their chemical attacks will generate environmental inequality .

There is a stillness here amongst the personal panic and aggressive weather front : the tips of Mount Esja vying for attention through the settled grey light , the clarity of the air unmatched and the stunning glass palace that is Harpa \u2013 the concert building in which Biophilia was housed for 9 days last year \u2013 standing tall against the icy droves of Faxafloi bay , almost as if it were the city 's protector . While Bj\u00f6rk , fresh - faced and dressed in a grass - green silk playsuit , \u201c is basically its Queen , you know ? ! \u201d or at least that is one whispered remark we overhear as we enter the hotel lobby . A couple of hours previous , I had also been reliably informed that when in Reykjavik she reverts into \u201c mumsy \u201d mode . She is the most glamourous mum . But , as we sit down to chat over a cup of tea , I can see what they meant ; talking to Bj\u00f6rk is more like talking to a wise aunt or tribal elder than a genuine , stratospheric pop star . She even complains that the cold is making her skin very dry and offers me some moisturiser she picked up in the duty free . She fidgets constantly , her face serious but her eyes smiling . She is completely in her element , excited about seeing Dirty Projectors and Ol\u00f6f Arnalds , as well as her own son 's band Sindri Eldon , play later . You can tell she is looking forward to letting her hair down tonight and why should n't she be , having spent a good four years absorbed in the world of Biophilia ? And when I say \u201c world \u201d I 'm underplaying the magnitude of her recent undertaking : \u201c universe \u201d is probably more apt . Embracing the possibility of new technologies whilst paying homage to the old , her Biophilia project saw the creation of new instruments , a travelling educational program ( which has even made its way onto the Icelandic school curriculum ) , breath - taking month long residencies , ground - breaking apps and now , as if all that were n't enough , it has spawned an entire album 's worth of remixes . Bastards is Bj\u00f6rk 's alternate universe \u2013 one which she has chosen to share with Death Grips , Hudson Mohawke , Omar Souleyman , These New Puritans , Matthew Herbert , 16 Bit , The Slips , Current Value and Alvo Noto . \u201c I probably should have done it with every album , \u201d she remarks , \u201c but you know , I just get too busy . \u201d I reassure her that no one begrudges her this , after all Biophilia is not your average album \u2013 its very nature making it perfect for stripping apart and re-imagining . Each rework comes with its own back story : some coming together across great distances , some emerging from close encounters , some created with relative strangers and some , as in the case of Matthew Herbert at least , born of long time friendships . \u201c Matthew is so talented , \u201d Bj\u00f6rk beams proudly , \u201c and he 's so flexible . He just came and did a version of every song . For him it 's like drinking water . He 's amazing to work with because he 's not that precious about what he does so if I decide not to use something I do n't hurt his feelings . Two of his mixes ended up on the actual album but after spending a long time with me he took everything home with him , and took some things even further . \u201d She also spent a lot of time with 16 bit , whose Eddie Jefferys tells me via email that his first experience of Bj\u00f6rk was ' It 's Oh So Quiet ' . \u201c He came to Brooklyn for a week and we worked together . I was really torn about whether to use their version of ' Hollow ' on the album . Their beats for ' Crystalline ' and ' Mutual Core ' made it on there , but in the end ' Hollow ' wound up on the remix album . The structure is actually exactly the same . It 's not a typical remix because it sounds so much like the original . It 's got all my vocals , it 's not like they just sampled it and fucked with it . \u201d Speaking of the remix and what it meant to him to work with Bj\u00f6rk , Eddie tells me , \u201c It was easy to get lost in it . Working with such abstract time signatures was definitely a strange mix of confusing and enjoyable . She has been so successful without compromising her music or herself . Bj\u00f6rk is like a breath of fresh air . \u201d She admits to not really getting These New Puritans at first but tells me how she soon fell head over heels for them . \u201c I listened to them when their album came out and I must have just been in the wrong mood or something but then , I do n't know why , about a year ago I put it on and it just clicked . I had a moment , for like two or three months , where I listened to it all day , every day . It 's like all or nothing with me , you know when you just fall for something , head over heels . I asked them about working with me and I was so surprised they were up for it . \u201d The circumstances of Omar Souleyman 's collaboration were completely different . \u201c We 've never met , \u201d she says with a look of regret , \u201c although I would love to do that . I just sent everything in the post and he would send YouTube clips of them , like , travelling in Istanbul . And then Alvo Noto , he 's somebody that I just knew would be ideal for Biophilia because the subject matter is very elemental , it 's all about signs and nature so somebody like him , whose music is so architectural , hardcore and elemental \u2013 almost like this \u2013 \u201d she actually get 's up and pounds the stone structure next to us in the hotel , \u201c \u2013 really basic you know , was just an obvious choice . \u201d Death Grips ' collaboration was also born of long distances . \u201c I think they 're one of my favourite bands right now . I really fell in love with that beat in ' Full Moon ' and then I ended up emailing them saying ' is it lazy or like illegal if we do a mash up of ' Sacrifice ' and the beat from ' Full Moon ? ' They thought it was a great idea . I think I tried to do it at first but that did n't really work so they took it and chopped it up and totally fucked it up and I love it , I really love it . \u201d We discuss how she feels about people \u201c fucking \u201d with her work . I misguidedly think it is good that she does n't feel too precious , she graciously corrects me . \u201c I am precious . I mean I get to pick what ends up on my album . I do n't know if there were any rules as such but I can feel in my gut whether something is right or wrong . I 'm really protective over the whole thing . \u201d With such vision I think it 's only fair that Bj\u00f6rk remains uncompromising , although she reveals that she does get torn up when things do n't go according to plan . \u201c I probably should n't say anything about this \u2026 \u201d she trails off before takinga sip of tea and cautiously continuing \u201c \u2026 but I had a really hard time with El Guincho . He came to New York and did two bass lines on the album . We had a really great time . He is amazing but he did one remix , and it was just such a different mood to the rest of the songs that it just did n't fit . It was really hard for me to decide not to use it but I had to not think just about the best mixes but about the whole album . I love the mix but it was just on another wavelength . I tried to pick out the hardcore beats and put them all together and El Guincho was maybe just a little bit too sweet or dreamy . I love dreamy music do n't get me wrong , but it just was n't right for this . At least it 's out there to download for those who want it , for the nerds and completists . For people like me . \u201d With over 40 remixes to play with , this wo n't have been the only decision she agonised over . \u201c I did n't really plan anything , \u201d she explains . \u201c There were a lot of tough choices . Sometimes I 'd have a few versions of the same song and I 'd get to choose which was the remix version and which was the album version , but then some songs were so clearly their own thing that I sort of wanted to make one cohesive unit out of them . I 'm lucky to have worked with Derek from One Little Indian because we both kind of come from the punk roots . It was really common that record companies , the big ones ( before the indies kind of started ) , would never release anything unless it was guaranteed to sell . We were kind of punks you know . We were like ' no , it should be the other way around \u2013 release all the quirky bits and all the little eccentric things that sell five copies . ' We 're both nerds like that . We were really keen to release things that were not about making money . \u201d It 's probably the nerd in her that took an album and made it into an educational program , and the humble integrity in that which leads her to saying \u201c I'll probably end up being a teacher or something , let 's face it . \u201d She clearly takes great joy in that thought . Biophilia was designed with 6 year olds in mind but she ended up teaching 10 - 12 years because they 're already \u201c self-sufficient \u201d and there is quite a complicated array of scales , arpeggios , chords , rhythms and science involved . Last year she brought her Biophilia project to Reykjavik 's Harpa and enjoyed not being the centre of attention for once , \u201c the majority of the kids did n't even know who I was and even if they 'd seen me in the papers or something , they 'd never heard my music . But that is kind of the beauty of these things , you can write your own song with the apps , you can sort of skip mine if you like and make your own . \u201d She 's even thought about releasing their creations . \u201c We 've been keeping everything so maybe at one point I 'll listen through all of them and pick the best . There is a whole Soundcloud somewhere as well where people can upload their own pieces . It would take a long time to go through everything , maybe if I get like a spare month I 'll go through them all . I ca n't promise anything though . \u201d But there is a spark in Bj\u00f6rk 's eyes every time she discusses the idea of launching other people 's work upon the world , after all she has always stressed that Biophilia 's spirit , its endless homes and beautifully tangental branches \u201c are not about me . \u201d Bastards is available now through One Little Indian .","annotations":[{"text":"Biophilia","span":[1872,1880],"token_span":[370,370],"role":"Undertaking","label":"Undertaking","role_definition":"This frame element marks constituents that express the project in which the Partners are collaborating."},{"text":"Eddie Jefferys","span":[3452,3465],"token_span":[690,691],"role":"Partner_2","label":"Partner_2","role_definition":"This Frame element marks constituents expressing the grammatically less prominent, typically oblique, party in a collaboration."},{"text":"Bj\u00f6rk","span":[3515,3519],"token_span":[701,701],"role":"Partner_1","label":"Partner_1","role_definition":"When the parties in a collaboration are expressed separately, this Frame Element marks constituents that express the one that is grammatically more prominent, i.e., the one that is the subject of an active clause."},{"text":"Brooklyn","span":[3562,3569],"token_span":[715,715],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the collaboration occurs."},{"text":"for a week","span":[3571,3580],"token_span":[716,718],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the Partners are engaged in their collaboration."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"Their beats for ' Crystalline ' and ' Mutual Core ' made it on there , but in the end ' Hollow ' wound up on the remix album \" .

There is a stillness here amongst the personal panic and aggressive weather front : the tips of Mount Esja vying for attention through the settled grey light , the clarity of the air unmatched and the stunning glass palace that is Harpa \u2013 the concert building in which Biophilia was housed for 9 days last year \u2013 standing tall against the icy droves of Faxafloi bay , almost as if it were the city 's protector . While Bj\u00f6rk , fresh - faced and dressed in a grass - green silk playsuit , \u201c is basically its Queen , you know ? ! \u201d or at least that is one whispered remark we overhear as we enter the hotel lobby . A couple of hours previous , I had also been reliably informed that when in Reykjavik she reverts into \u201c mumsy \u201d mode . She is the most glamourous mum . But , as we sit down to chat over a cup of tea , I can see what they meant ; talking to Bj\u00f6rk is more like talking to a wise aunt or tribal elder than a genuine , stratospheric pop star . She even complains that the cold is making her skin very dry and offers me some moisturiser she picked up in the duty free . She fidgets constantly , her face serious but her eyes smiling . She is completely in her element , excited about seeing Dirty Projectors and Ol\u00f6f Arnalds , as well as her own son 's band Sindri Eldon , play later . You can tell she is looking forward to letting her hair down tonight and why should n't she be , having spent a good four years absorbed in the world of Biophilia ? And when I say \u201c world \u201d I 'm underplaying the magnitude of her recent undertaking : \u201c universe \u201d is probably more apt . Embracing the possibility of new technologies whilst paying homage to the old , her Biophilia project saw the creation of new instruments , a travelling educational program ( which has even made its way onto the Icelandic school curriculum ) , breath - taking month long residencies , ground - breaking apps and now , as if all that were n't enough , it has spawned an entire album 's worth of remixes . Bastards is Bj\u00f6rk 's alternate universe \u2013 one which she has chosen to share with Death Grips , Hudson Mohawke , Omar Souleyman , These New Puritans , Matthew Herbert , 16 Bit , The Slips , Current Value and Alvo Noto . \u201c I probably should have done it with every album , \u201d she remarks , \u201c but you know , I just get too busy . \u201d I reassure her that no one begrudges her this , after all Biophilia is not your average album \u2013 its very nature making it perfect for stripping apart and re-imagining . Each rework comes with its own back story : some coming together across great distances , some emerging from close encounters , some created with relative strangers and some , as in the case of Matthew Herbert at least , born of long time friendships . \u201c Matthew is so talented , \u201d Bj\u00f6rk beams proudly , \u201c and he 's so flexible . He just came and did a version of every song . For him it 's like drinking water . He 's amazing to work with because he 's not that precious about what he does so if I decide not to use something I do n't hurt his feelings . Two of his mixes ended up on the actual album but after spending a long time with me he took everything home with him , and took some things even further . \u201d She also spent a lot of time with 16 bit , whose Eddie Jefferys tells me via email that his first experience of Bj\u00f6rk was ' It 's Oh So Quiet ' . \u201c He came to Brooklyn for a week and we worked together . I was really torn about whether to use their version of ' Hollow ' on the album . Their beats for ' Crystalline ' and ' Mutual Core ' made it on there , but in the end ' Hollow ' wound up on the remix album . The structure is actually exactly the same . It 's not a typical remix because it sounds so much like the original . It 's got all my vocals , it 's not like they just sampled it and fucked with it . \u201d Speaking of the remix and what it meant to him to work with Bj\u00f6rk , Eddie tells me , \u201c It was easy to get lost in it . Working with such abstract time signatures was definitely a strange mix of confusing and enjoyable . She has been so successful without compromising her music or herself . Bj\u00f6rk is like a breath of fresh air . \u201d She admits to not really getting These New Puritans at first but tells me how she soon fell head over heels for them . \u201c I listened to them when their album came out and I must have just been in the wrong mood or something but then , I do n't know why , about a year ago I put it on and it just clicked . I had a moment , for like two or three months , where I listened to it all day , every day . It 's like all or nothing with me , you know when you just fall for something , head over heels . I asked them about working with me and I was so surprised they were up for it . \u201d The circumstances of Omar Souleyman 's collaboration were completely different . \u201c We 've never met , \u201d she says with a look of regret , \u201c although I would love to do that . I just sent everything in the post and he would send YouTube clips of them , like , travelling in Istanbul . And then Alvo Noto , he 's somebody that I just knew would be ideal for Biophilia because the subject matter is very elemental , it 's all about signs and nature so somebody like him , whose music is so architectural , hardcore and elemental \u2013 almost like this \u2013 \u201d she actually get 's up and pounds the stone structure next to us in the hotel , \u201c \u2013 really basic you know , was just an obvious choice . \u201d Death Grips ' collaboration was also born of long distances . \u201c I think they 're one of my favourite bands right now . I really fell in love with that beat in ' Full Moon ' and then I ended up emailing them saying ' is it lazy or like illegal if we do a mash up of ' Sacrifice ' and the beat from ' Full Moon ? ' They thought it was a great idea . I think I tried to do it at first but that did n't really work so they took it and chopped it up and totally fucked it up and I love it , I really love it . \u201d We discuss how she feels about people \u201c fucking \u201d with her work . I misguidedly think it is good that she does n't feel too precious , she graciously corrects me . \u201c I am precious . I mean I get to pick what ends up on my album . I do n't know if there were any rules as such but I can feel in my gut whether something is right or wrong . I 'm really protective over the whole thing . \u201d With such vision I think it 's only fair that Bj\u00f6rk remains uncompromising , although she reveals that she does get torn up when things do n't go according to plan . \u201c I probably should n't say anything about this \u2026 \u201d she trails off before takinga sip of tea and cautiously continuing \u201c \u2026 but I had a really hard time with El Guincho . He came to New York and did two bass lines on the album . We had a really great time . He is amazing but he did one remix , and it was just such a different mood to the rest of the songs that it just did n't fit . It was really hard for me to decide not to use it but I had to not think just about the best mixes but about the whole album . I love the mix but it was just on another wavelength .

Crumb Illustrates Bukowski Two grand masters of irreverence come together . By Maria Popova In the early 1980s , two titans of the artfully cynical and subversive joined forces in an extraordinary collaboration : Legendary cartoonist and album cover artist R. Crumb illustrated two short books by Charles Bukowski ( August 16 , 1920 \u2013 March 9 , 1994 ) , Bring Me Your Love ( public library ) and There 's No Business ( public library ) . Crumb 's signature underground comix aesthetic and Bukowski 's commentary on contemporary culture and the human condition by way of his familiar tropes \u2014 sex , alcohol , the drudgery of work \u2014 coalesce into the kind of fit that makes you wonder why it had n't happened sooner . In 1998 , a final posthumous collaboration was released under the title The Captain Is Out to Lunch and the Sailors Have Taken Over the Ship ( public library ) \u2014 an illustrated selection from Buk 's previously unpublished diaries , capturing a year in his life shortly before his death in 1994 .

It can cause signs and symptoms such as a fever , cough and tiredness . Two coccidioides fungi species cause valley fever . These fungi are commonly found in soil in specific regions . The fungi 's spores can be stirred into the air by anything that disrupts the soil , such as farming , construction and wind . People can then breathe the fungi into their lungs . The fungi can cause valley fever , also known as acute coccidioidomycosis ( kok-sid - e-oy - doh - my -KOH - sis ) . Mild cases of valley fever usually resolve on their own . In more -severe cases , doctors treat the infection with antifungal medications . Products & Services Symptoms Valley fever is the initial form of coccidioidomycosis infection . This initial , acute illness can develop into a more serious disease , including chronic and disseminated coccidioidomycosis . Acute coccidioidomycosis ( valley fever ) The initial , or acute , form of coccidioidomycosis is often mild , with few or no symptoms . Signs and symptoms occur one to three weeks after exposure . They tend to be similar to flu symptoms . Symptoms can range from minor to severe , including : - Fever - Cough - Tiredness - Shortness of breath - Headache - Chills - Night sweats - Joint aches and muscle soreness - Red , spotty rash , mainly on lower legs but sometimes on the chest , arms and back If you do n't become ill or have symptoms from valley fever , you may only find out you 've been infected later . You may find out when you have a positive skin or blood test or when small areas of residual infection in the lungs ( nodules ) show up on a routine chest X -ray . The nodules typically do n't cause problems , but they can look like cancer on X -rays . If you develop symptoms , especially severe ones , the course of the disease is highly variable . It can take months to fully recover . Fatigue and joint aches can last even longer . The disease 's severity depends on several factors , including your overall health and the number of fungus spores you inhale . Chronic coccidioidomycosis If the initial coccidioidomycosis infection does n't completely resolve , it may progress to a chronic form of pneumonia . This complication is most common in people with weakened immune systems . Signs and symptoms include : - Low-grade fever - Weight loss - Cough - Chest pain - Blood -tinged sputum ( matter discharged during coughing ) - Nodules in the lungs Disseminated coccidioidomycosis The most serious form of the disease , disseminated coccidioidomycosis , is uncommon . It occurs when the infection spreads ( disseminates ) beyond the lungs to other parts of the body . Most often these parts include the skin , bones , liver , brain , heart , and the membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord ( meninges ) . Signs and symptoms of disseminated disease depend on the body parts affected and may include : - Nodules , ulcers and skin lesions that are more serious than the rash that sometimes occurs with other forms of the disease - Painful lesions in the skull , spine or other bones - Painful , swollen joints , especially in the knees or ankles - Meningitis \u2014 an infection of the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord When to see a doctor Seek medical care if you are over 60 , have a weakened immune system , are pregnant , or are of Filipino or African heritage , and you develop the signs and symptoms of valley fever , especially if you : - Live in or have recently traveled to an area where this disease is common - Have symptoms that are n't improving Be sure to tell your doctor if you 've traveled to a place where valley fever is common and you have symptoms . Causes Valley fever is caused by a person inhaling spores of certain fungi . The fungi that cause valley fever \u2014 Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides posadasii \u2014 live in the soil in parts of Arizona , Nevada , Utah , New Mexico , California , Texas and Washington . It 's named after the San Joaquin Valley in California . The fungi can also often be found in northern Mexico and Central and South America . Like many other fungi , coccidioides species have a complex life cycle . In the soil , they grow as a mold with long filaments that break off into airborne spores when the soil is disturbed . A person can then inhale the spores . The spores are extremely small and can be carried far by the wind . Once inside the lungs , the spores reproduce , continuing the disease cycle . Risk factors Risk factors for valley fever include : - Environmental exposure . Anyone who inhales the spores that cause valley fever is at risk of infection . People who live in areas where the fungi are common \u2014 especially those who spend a lot of time outdoors \u2014 have a greater risk . Also , people who have jobs that expose them to dust are most at risk \u2014 construction , road and agricultural workers , ranchers , archaeologists , and military personnel on field exercises . - Race . For reasons that are n't well understood , people of Filipino and African heritage are more susceptible to developing serious fungal infections . - Pregnancy . Pregnant women are vulnerable to more-serious infections during the third trimester . New mothers are vulnerable right after their babies are born . - Weakened immune system . Anyone with a weakened immune system is at increased risk of serious complications . This includes people living with AIDS or those being treated with steroids , chemotherapy and anti-rejection drugs after transplant surgery . People with certain autoimmune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn 's disease , who are being treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) drugs also have an increased risk of infection . - Diabetes . People with diabetes may have a higher risk of severe lung infections . - Age . Older adults are more likely to develop valley fever . This may be because their immune systems are less robust or because they have other medical conditions that affect their overall health . Complications Some people , especially pregnant women , people with weakened immune systems \u2014 such as those living with HIV / AIDS \u2014 and those of Filipino or African heritage are at risk of developing a more severe form of coccidioidomycosis . Complications of coccidioidomycosis may include : - Severe pneumonia . Most people recover from coccidioidomycosis-related pneumonia without complications . Others , mainly people of Filipino and African heritage , and those with weakened immune systems , may become seriously ill . - Ruptured lung nodules . A small percentage of people develop thin - walled nodules ( cavities ) in their lungs . Many of these eventually disappear without causing any problems , but some may rupture , causing chest pain and difficulty breathing . A ruptured lung nodule might require the placement of a tube into the space around the lungs to remove the air or surgery to repair the damage . - Disseminated disease . This is the most serious complication of coccidioidomycosis but it 's uncommon . If the fungus spreads ( disseminates ) throughout the body , it can cause problems including skin ulcers , abscesses , bone lesions , severe joint pain , heart inflammation , urinary tract problems and meningitis \u2014 a potentially fatal infection of the membranes and fluid covering the brain and spinal cord . Prevention There is no vaccine to prevent valley fever . If you live in or visit areas where valley fever is common , take common - sense precautions , especially during the summer months when the chance of infection is highest . Consider these tips : - Wear a mask . - Avoid very dusty areas , such as construction sites . - Stay inside during dust storms . - Wet the soil before digging in it , or avoiding soil if you 're at higher risk of infection . - Keep doors and windows tightly closed . - Clean skin injuries with soap and water .

Claire would ask if I believed that everyone is capable of killing another person , whether murder or otherwise Something like that . We had many debates about this , about the nature of man / womankind . I loved it and I loved Claire asking such challenging questions . It was a very open relationship . Claire was very open . She was very clear about what she wanted , but she was open to listen and to hear a good suggestion . She was open to elements of story and she would run with them . BJ 's heart transplant was a combination of elements . It was Claire 's inspriation and story and it included a combination of elements coming out of meetings between Claire , Shelley , and me . It 's Claire 's story , she wrote it beautifully . But she was very open to suggestions , turning points or scenes , that sort of thing . She was n't afraid to use something from another person if it worked . Her ego always sat in the right place . It was all about the characters and the storytelling . She is a great writer and a great collaborator . I wanted to do a story about AIDS when I first got to GH. AIDS was on the rise , a non-discriminating disease that did n't care who it attacked . I felt it was an issue of great importance and wanted to find a way to interface many of the characters of Port Charles with the hospital . At first , I thought it could be a story for A.J. Quartermaine . I thought , what would happen if A.J. had another drunken night in college , one of many , and explore what would happen when a friend , a male friend , from college shows up at the Quartermaine mansion wanting A.J. 's help since his family threw him out because he had AIDS . And A.J. does n't remember who had sex with who , and what he did during so many drunken orgies . They could have both had sex with a woman who was a drug addict . The intention was not to make them gay , but the implication might have stirred up a lot . We could have asked , \u201c Why does everyone care so much if he was gay ? Why does he care ? How would Edward Quatermaine react and what would Lila do to bring the family back together ? \u201d We could have looked at it all . But it was n't about being gay , I did n't want to be , \u201c Oh those gay people , of course they screw around so much ... \u201d of some B.S. like that . AIDS is a non-discriminating disease , it does n't care who you are are or what your sexuality is . If you do stupid things , have unprotected sex , you risk getting it . If we had done it with a gay character we would not have gotten the message of urgency across . So the intention was to have a smart person who was not gay but made stupid choices get AIDS . I did n't have Claire at the time , and I do n't know if Claire would have even wanted to do it that way , but the network did not want to do that story . They did n't want A.J. to be in question of having AIDS , or maybe not being 100 % heterosexual , they just did n't want to go there because he was a Quartermaine , which of course , is exactly why I wanted to go there . I talked to Claire about this , and she came up with Robin and Stone . She was not ready to do this story at the beginning of her run on GH . But one day , a year later , we were at a company retreat dinner and she looked at me with that twinkle in her eye , learned over , and whispered , \u201c I think I 've got it . \u201d She told me the story in two lines and I loved it . It was everything I hoped for . We were so excited , we told Pat [ Fili - Krushel ] right then and there and she said to go with it . Claire and I had driven up to Connecticut together for the retreat and what was wonderful is that we had the long trip to talk about it . We Love Soaps : Those two stories you mentioned are still some of the most powerful stories I have ever seen . You can see them now on YouTube and notice how detailed the crafting was . Wendy Riche : The crafting of the writing was the best I have ever experienced . Claire Labine is a master craftsman and a great leader and the the writers on the team were a unit that was so tight , and felt so free , that the writing soared . Writing as an isolated , very personal , art form , and we ask ten writers to collaborate on one vision . That 's a mighty task . And the writers at GENERAL HOSPITAL during that time were all on the same page , they all contributed , and they all took the story beyond . They loved Claire , they loved the show , they loved the actors and they wrote their very best . As did the directors , as did the actors . The entire cast and crew were behind the story and many tears were shed on set . We Love Soaps : How much did ABC fight against Robin becoming positive for HIV ? Wendy Riche : Pat Fili- Krushel did n't hesitate . She asked a lot of questions but her instincts were so good and she trusted them . And she trusted us . After telling her about it at the retreat , Claire worked on laying it out and we presented it to Pat and she loved it . She knew that the the timing for this story was right . And we all believed in Claire 's ability to tell the story . You ca n't just have a good idea , you have to be able to execute it . We all had faith that Claire could execute this well and she did brilliantly . We Love Soaps : Looking back on those years of collaboration , what moments do you feel most proud of ? Wendy Riche : That 's such a hard question . I am so proud of my time there . Of all the stories that were told . But especially the BJ story line , and Robin and Stone . The two scenes that are pivotal to me are when Tony comes to Frisco and tells him what happened . And that he has a heart for Maxie . One brother actually giving the heart of his dying daughter to his brother 's living child who would / could die without it . And then when Felicia drops to the floor when she learns what happened . Then when Brad listenes to BJ's heart in Maxie 's body . I will never forget those moments . And I will never forget Stone opening his dying eyes , saying to Robin , \u201c I see you . \u201d Right before he dies he has clarity of his love and of his purpose . It was extraordinary . Then in the Lois and Ned love story there were so many moments that were spectacular . I will never forget the look of pure joy on Lois ' face when she stood in the middle of the Brooklyn Bridge with Ned. Rena Sofer is an incredible woman and actress and she brought so many layers to her dramatic and comedic portrayal of Lois ... her joyfulness and sense of wonder , her determination and intensity , her big heart , her moral compass , her sense of friendship and honor . A great character in a really fun story . And then we had Monica 's breast cancer story . We wanted to do a story of survival and we wanted a story for Leslie Charleston . This was a story both Claire and I wanted to tackle for lots of reasons . We knew it would be good for the show and we both had people or relatives , like my mother , who had had survived breast cancer . There were too many scenes to count that were moving and significant , and Leslie did such a superb job . She is a wonderful actress , and that was very rewarding . We Love Soaps : As someone who grew up with a mother who fought breast cancer , I personally related to that story , especially as watching it through the eyes of a child , played by Amber Tamblyn . That was particuarly emotional for me . Wendy Riche : My mother had breast cancer as well , which is part of why I wanted to do a story about it . When Claire wanted to also , I was thrilled . We could explore it from the woman 's point - of - view , but from the child 's point - of - view as well . As well as how our breasts are so much a part of our identity . Every woman has dealt with this issue of breasts in some way whether they are large or small , or some issue going on . All of us have known someone who had had breast cancer . I do n't think there is a person who does n't . I 'm glad it was very moving for you , it was so important to us . We Love Soaps : That had to do in large part , again , with how the story was crafted . It reached me in a way no other show has . Wendy Riche : We would have Directors meetings with Claire and the producers . That was something else very important to me and to Claire , that we would have a clear line of communication from the page to the stage . They got it , and they were so attentive to making every scene work , and giving the actors a chance to bring more than what time usually allows on soap opears . But it did n't take extra time , it just took extra deep breaths and a commitment to doing this right . There was a real continuity which I think contributed to our success .

They knew we needed a writer that would fit with me , and whom I would fit . Because it is a fit , it is like a marriage , you work with a writer and you have to have a similar vision , concern , care , ideology . Not that we were exactly alike , we had great debates and we both loved that part of the relationship . We knew how to challenge each other in a healthy way . We Love Soaps : Can you recall any debates ? Wendy Riche : I remember one debate we had ongoing .

Lakers 4 , Boston 2 Magic Maneuvers Lakers Past Celtics Kareem Abdul - Jabbar was almost 40 years old heading into the 1986 - 87 season . And as long as anyone could remember , he had been the focus of the Los Angeles Lakers ' offense . But Riley wanted to change that . Abdul - Jabbar 's retirement was inevitable , and Riley wanted to begin shifting the burden to other players . He wanted Magic Johnson , and to a lesser degree James Worthy , to become the focus of the offense . So Riley and his staff began formulating their ideas of how this transition should work and took their notions into training camp that fall . Within days the players became comfortable with the new system . Abdul - Jabbar personally reassured Riley that everything was working fine . Then Magic sealed it in gold by turning in a stellar season , one that would make him the first guard since Oscar Robertson to win the league MVP Award . His scoring zoomed to a career - high 23.9 points per game , and he topped the league in assists at 12.2 per game . He did n't do it alone , of course . Abdul - Jabbar , Worthy , Byron Scott , Michael Cooper and A. C. Green all wanted to establish their superiority . Their big boost arrived on Feb. 13 , when the team acquired Mychal Thompson from the San Antonio Spurs . Larry Bird was heartsick at the news . The 6 - foot - 10 Thompson gave the Lakers just what they needed up front . He could play backup to Abdul - Jabbar at center , and he was a solid power forward . Better yet , he was an excellent low- post defender , and having played with Kevin McHale on the college level , he knew better than anyone how to defend Boston 's long - armed forward . With Thompson , the Lakers surged to a 65 - win regular season , the best in the NBA . All the while , Boston 's fortunes were headed in the other direction . It had been 18 seasons since a team had won back - to - back championships in the NBA . The 1986 - 87 Celtics had hopes of being the first modern team to repeat . But one by one things fell apart for them . Tragedy struck the day after the draft when Len Bias , the second overall pick , collapsed and died from cocaine- induced heart failure . The Boston bench , which seemed so deep in 1986 , rapidly disintegrated . After an early - season accident on a stationary bike , Bill Walton was sidelined with the foot injuries that had plagued him throughout his career . Scott Wedman was struck down by a heel injury and never played for Boston again , and Jerry Sichting was slowed by a persistent virus . To bolster the frontcourt , the Celtics picked up Darren Daye and Fred Roberts , but they needed time to build confidence . Without a strong bench , the Boston starters were forced to play Herculean minutes . As a result , Bird , Danny Ainge and Robert Parish were each troubled by nagging injuries . Then , late in the season , McHale broke a navicular bone in his right foot and tore ligaments as well . The doctors were worried that continued play might cause McHale permanent damage , but because the Celtics seemed to have a good chance in the playoffs , he decided to play hurt . Boston survived a seven-game encounter with the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals , then bashed heads with the Detroit Pistons in the conference finals . Again the series went to seven games , and Boston escaped , but only by virtue of Bird 's last - second steal of an Isiah Thomas pass in Game 5 . Bird quickly fed Dennis Johnson for the winning layup to complete a play for the ages . The Lakers , meanwhile , were scorching . Detroit assistant coach Dick Versace scouted them during the playoffs and came away shaking his head . \" They 're cosmic , \" he said . \" They 're playing better than any team I 've ever seen . \" The Finals opened in the Forum before a crowd peppered with even more celebrities than usual . Their presence only seemed to inflame Riley more . The Celtics get all the respect for being hardworking , while the Lakers are packaged as a bunch of glitzy , super-talented guys who glide through \" Showtime \" without much character or thought , Riley told his players . Magic Johnson led the rout in Game 1 with 29 points , 13 assists , eight rebounds and no turnovers . Worthy , on the receiving end of many of Johnson 's passes , had 33 points and nine rebounds . The Lakers ran 35 fast breaks in the first two quarters and led by 21 at intermission . They settled into a canter thereafter , finally posting a 126 - 113 win . The Celtics knew they were reeling , and to catch themselves they had to stop Magic . They accomplished that in Game 2 , but in the process they allowed Cooper to switch specialities , from defense to offense . Boston Coach K.C. Jones put Ainge on Magic , and that seemed to work for a while . But Boston trailed by seven in the second quarter as Cooper pushed the Lakers through a 20 - 10 outburst , scoring or assisting on all 20 points . When it was over , he had laced in 6 of 7 three - point attempts , a playoff record . And the Celtics had spent another day in feeble pursuit of the Lakers ' break . \" One of the Laker girls could 've scored a layup on us , \" Boston backup center Greg Kite said later . Abdul - Jabbar flicked in 10 of 14 shots for 23 points , while Magic posted 20 assists and 22 points . In Cooper 's big second quarter , he racked up eight assists , tying a Finals record . It all added up to a 141 - 122 rout , Boston 's sixth straight road loss in the playoffs . Before doubt crept too far into Celtics minds , they righted themselves in Game 3 . McHale had limped off the floor in Game 2 after further aggravating his injury by stepping on Parish 's foot . But the Celtics ' forward bounced back in Boston with 21 points and 10 rebounds while letting the air out of Worthy 's game , limiting the Lakers ' forward to only 13 points and three rebounds . Scott hit 2 of 9 shots from the field to finish with four points . The Lakers ' load fell on Magic and Abdul - Jabbar . The former scored a game - high 32 , but Abdul - Jabbar was left to contend with the little - known Kite . K.C. Jones loved the way Kite worked before and after practice to improve his game , calling him an inspiration to the team . That Sunday , June 7 , Kite provided more than inspiration . He played 20 minutes , and while he failed to score , he grabbed nine rebounds , blocked a Magic layup and did solid body work on Abdul - Jabbar . The defensive minutes Kite gave Boston from the bench were just enough , as Bird scored 30 points and Dennis Johnson hit 11 of 22 attempts from the field to finish with 26 points . The Celtics ' big effort came in the second quarter , when they went 17 - of - 21 from the field . \" I hope that 's as well as they can play , \" said Abdul - Jabbar after the 109 - 103 Boston victory . \" Maybe we were just due for a game like that , \" said Magic . \" I know we wo n't play that way again . \" For a brief moment the pressure was off the Celtics . No longer did they have to worry about the big embarrassment . \" We 're just too good a team to be swept , \" Bird said . \" This was the most important game of the series for us . If we lost , it might 've been tough to get up for Game 4 . Now it 's going to be easy . \" Boston went up by 16 after halftime , but Los Angeles cut the lead to eight with 3 \u00bd minutes to go in the game . The game 's conclusion -- the series , actually -- came down to one Magic sequence . With half a minute left , the Lakers called a timeout to set up a pick for Abdul - Jabbar . But Magic told him to fake it as his defender , Parish , attempted to fight through the pick , and then roll to the basket . He did . The pass was there , and the Lakers took a 104 - 103 lead . But Bird 's three - pointer with 12 seconds left put Boston up 106 - 104 . On the next possession , Abdul - Jabbar was fouled and went to the line , where he made the first and missed the second . McHale grabbed the rebound , but Thompson gave him a gentle push and the ball went out of bounds . McHale signaled Boston ball , but the officials saw it the other way , giving possession to the Lakers . What followed was another play for the ages . Magic took the inbounds pass to the left of the key and at first contemplated a 20 - footer , but McHale came out to change his mind . So Magic motored into the key , where Bird and Parish joined McHale in a trio of extended arms . Nevertheless , Magic lofted a hook which just cleared Parish 's fingertips and then snuggled into the basket with a swish . K.C. Jones , watching from a twisted stance from the Celtics ' bench just feet away , felt his heart sink into an abyss . The Celtics got a timeout with two seconds left , and the Lakers even left Bird open for a shot . But the ball rattled in and then out and Magic ran off happily , having stolen Game 4 , 107 - 106 . In the locker room , he dubbed the shot \" my junior , junior , junior sky-hook . \" \" You expect to lose on a sky-hook , \" Bird said with a pained smile . \" You do n't expect it to be from Magic . \" The Celtics made the mistakes down the stretch , he continued . \" We turned the ball over twice . We missed a rebound after a free throw . We really ca n't blame anybody but ourselves . \" Would the game be remembered just for its last minutes ? \" It should , \" Bird said . \" A lot happened in the last minute - and - a-half . Robert gets the ball taken away from him . I throw the ball at Kevin 's feet . They miss a free throw , and we do n't get the rebound . How many chances do you need to win a game ? \" The Celtics had to win Game 5 in the Garden . Fortunately , for Boston , the Lakers were compliant . And Ainge had his outside shot going . The Celtics got the lead and kept it . Ainge missed a trey early in the second half , bringing the Celtics ' bench to shout that they did n't need threes . But Ainge must have had plugs in his ears . He kept throwing them up , hitting four in the period . For the game , he made 5 - of - 6 from \" Ainge range . \" Magic countered for Los Angeles with 29 points , 12 assists , eight rebounds and four steals , but he received little help . Before the game Bird had told his teammates , \" If they want to celebrate , let 's not let them do it on the parquet . \" At one point during the contest , the Lakers ' staff even iced down several cases of champagne . But the Celtics had incentive enough . They got their second win , 123 - 108 , and the series jetted back across the continent . Kareem arrived for Game 6 with a shave job on his balding head . And for a time , it seemed Los Angeles was intent on cutting the game just as close . Magic had only four points by the half , and the Celtics led 56 - 51 . But like Abdul - Jabbar 's perspiring pate , the Lakers shone after intermission . Worthy finished with 22 points , while Abdul - Jabbar contributed 32 points , six rebounds and four blocks . Thompson added 15 points and nine rebounds . And Magic led them with another display of all - around brilliance . On top of his previous efforts , his 16 - point , 19 - assist , eight - rebound showing brought him the Finals MVP Award as Los Angeles claimed its fourth title of the decade with a 106 - 93 win . \" Magic is a great , great basketball player , \" Bird stated flatly , settling the issue for the moment . \" The best I 've ever seen . \" \" I guess this is the best team I 've ever played against , \" Bird said . \" In ' 85 , they were good . In ' 84 , I really thought they should have beaten us . I do n't know if this team 's better than they were , but I guess they are . Their fast break is better . They 're deeper . \" The Lakers and the Celtics had established a standard for pro basketball , and by 1987 they had begun to assume that the championship round was theirs to share . | NBA||D-LEAGUE ||WNBA ||MOBILE ||TICKETS ||NBATV |","annotations":[{"text":"1987 NBA Finals","span":[55,69],"token_span":[7,9],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time is when the congregating occurs."},{"text":"Celtics","span":[126,132],"token_span":[21,21],"role":"Party_2","label":"Party_2","role_definition":"A grammatically less prominent participant in the congregating event."},{"text":"Los Angeles Lakers","span":[284,301],"token_span":[54,56],"role":"Party_1","label":"Party_1","role_definition":"Party_1 is the grammatically more prominent participant in the congregating event."},{"text":"the Forum","span":[3875,3883],"token_span":[756,757],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place is where the congregating occurs."},{"text":"in Boston","span":[5805,5813],"token_span":[1144,1145],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place is where the congregating occurs."},{"text":"The Lakers and the Celtics","span":[11721,11746],"token_span":[2433,2437],"role":"Configuration","label":"Configuration","role_definition":"The Configuration describes the resulting formation of the individuals."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"thumb|left | Magic Johnson against the Celtics in the 1987 finals The Celtics rebounded the following year to win the 1986 NBA Finals against the Rockets .

The 6 - foot - 10 Thompson gave the Lakers just what they needed up front . He could play backup to Abdul - Jabbar at center , and he was a solid power forward . Better yet , he was an excellent low- post defender , and having played with Kevin McHale on the college level , he knew better than anyone how to defend Boston 's long - armed forward . With Thompson , the Lakers surged to a 65 - win regular season , the best in the NBA . All the while , Boston 's fortunes were headed in the other direction . It had been 18 seasons since a team had won back - to - back championships in the NBA . The 1986 - 87 Celtics had hopes of being the first modern team to repeat . But one by one things fell apart for them . Tragedy struck the day after the draft when Len Bias , the second overall pick , collapsed and died from cocaine- induced heart failure . The Boston bench , which seemed so deep in 1986 , rapidly disintegrated . After an early - season accident on a stationary bike , Bill Walton was sidelined with the foot injuries that had plagued him throughout his career . Scott Wedman was struck down by a heel injury and never played for Boston again , and Jerry Sichting was slowed by a persistent virus . To bolster the frontcourt , the Celtics picked up Darren Daye and Fred Roberts , but they needed time to build confidence . Without a strong bench , the Boston starters were forced to play Herculean minutes . As a result , Bird , Danny Ainge and Robert Parish were each troubled by nagging injuries . Then , late in the season , McHale broke a navicular bone in his right foot and tore ligaments as well . The doctors were worried that continued play might cause McHale permanent damage , but because the Celtics seemed to have a good chance in the playoffs , he decided to play hurt . Boston survived a seven-game encounter with the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals , then bashed heads with the Detroit Pistons in the conference finals . Again the series went to seven games , and Boston escaped , but only by virtue of Bird 's last - second steal of an Isiah Thomas pass in Game 5 . Bird quickly fed Dennis Johnson for the winning layup to complete a play for the ages . The Lakers , meanwhile , were scorching . Detroit assistant coach Dick Versace scouted them during the playoffs and came away shaking his head . \" They 're cosmic , \" he said . \" They 're playing better than any team I 've ever seen . \" The Finals opened in the Forum before a crowd peppered with even more celebrities than usual . Their presence only seemed to inflame Riley more . The Celtics get all the respect for being hardworking , while the Lakers are packaged as a bunch of glitzy , super-talented guys who glide through \" Showtime \" without much character or thought , Riley told his players . Magic Johnson led the rout in Game 1 with 29 points , 13 assists , eight rebounds and no turnovers . Worthy , on the receiving end of many of Johnson 's passes , had 33 points and nine rebounds . The Lakers ran 35 fast breaks in the first two quarters and led by 21 at intermission . They settled into a canter thereafter , finally posting a 126 - 113 win . The Celtics knew they were reeling , and to catch themselves they had to stop Magic . They accomplished that in Game 2 , but in the process they allowed Cooper to switch specialities , from defense to offense . Boston Coach K.C. Jones put Ainge on Magic , and that seemed to work for a while . But Boston trailed by seven in the second quarter as Cooper pushed the Lakers through a 20 - 10 outburst , scoring or assisting on all 20 points . When it was over , he had laced in 6 of 7 three - point attempts , a playoff record . And the Celtics had spent another day in feeble pursuit of the Lakers ' break . \" One of the Laker girls could 've scored a layup on us , \" Boston backup center Greg Kite said later . Abdul - Jabbar flicked in 10 of 14 shots for 23 points , while Magic posted 20 assists and 22 points . In Cooper 's big second quarter , he racked up eight assists , tying a Finals record . It all added up to a 141 - 122 rout , Boston 's sixth straight road loss in the playoffs . Before doubt crept too far into Celtics minds , they righted themselves in Game 3 . McHale had limped off the floor in Game 2 after further aggravating his injury by stepping on Parish 's foot . But the Celtics ' forward bounced back in Boston with 21 points and 10 rebounds while letting the air out of Worthy 's game , limiting the Lakers ' forward to only 13 points and three rebounds . Scott hit 2 of 9 shots from the field to finish with four points . The Lakers ' load fell on Magic and Abdul - Jabbar . The former scored a game - high 32 , but Abdul - Jabbar was left to contend with the little - known Kite . K.C. Jones loved the way Kite worked before and after practice to improve his game , calling him an inspiration to the team . That Sunday , June 7 , Kite provided more than inspiration . He played 20 minutes , and while he failed to score , he grabbed nine rebounds , blocked a Magic layup and did solid body work on Abdul - Jabbar . The defensive minutes Kite gave Boston from the bench were just enough , as Bird scored 30 points and Dennis Johnson hit 11 of 22 attempts from the field to finish with 26 points . The Celtics ' big effort came in the second quarter , when they went 17 - of - 21 from the field . \" I hope that 's as well as they can play , \" said Abdul - Jabbar after the 109 - 103 Boston victory . \" Maybe we were just due for a game like that , \" said Magic . \" I know we wo n't play that way again . \" For a brief moment the pressure was off the Celtics . No longer did they have to worry about the big embarrassment . \" We 're just too good a team to be swept , \" Bird said . \" This was the most important game of the series for us . If we lost , it might 've been tough to get up for Game 4 . Now it 's going to be easy . \" Boston went up by 16 after halftime , but Los Angeles cut the lead to eight with 3 \u00bd minutes to go in the game . The game 's conclusion -- the series , actually -- came down to one Magic sequence . With half a minute left , the Lakers called a timeout to set up a pick for Abdul - Jabbar . But Magic told him to fake it as his defender , Parish , attempted to fight through the pick , and then roll to the basket . He did . The pass was there , and the Lakers took a 104 - 103 lead . But Bird 's three - pointer with 12 seconds left put Boston up 106 - 104 . On the next possession , Abdul - Jabbar was fouled and went to the line , where he made the first and missed the second . McHale grabbed the rebound , but Thompson gave him a gentle push and the ball went out of bounds . McHale signaled Boston ball , but the officials saw it the other way , giving possession to the Lakers . What followed was another play for the ages . Magic took the inbounds pass to the left of the key and at first contemplated a 20 - footer , but McHale came out to change his mind . So Magic motored into the key , where Bird and Parish joined McHale in a trio of extended arms . Nevertheless , Magic lofted a hook which just cleared Parish 's fingertips and then snuggled into the basket with a swish . K.C. Jones , watching from a twisted stance from the Celtics ' bench just feet away , felt his heart sink into an abyss . The Celtics got a timeout with two seconds left , and the Lakers even left Bird open for a shot . But the ball rattled in and then out and Magic ran off happily , having stolen Game 4 , 107 - 106 . In the locker room , he dubbed the shot \" my junior , junior , junior sky-hook . \" \" You expect to lose on a sky-hook , \" Bird said with a pained smile . \" You do n't expect it to be from Magic . \" The Celtics made the mistakes down the stretch , he continued . \" We turned the ball over twice . We missed a rebound after a free throw . We really ca n't blame anybody but ourselves . \" Would the game be remembered just for its last minutes ? \" It should , \" Bird said . \" A lot happened in the last minute - and - a-half . Robert gets the ball taken away from him . I throw the ball at Kevin 's feet . They miss a free throw , and we do n't get the rebound . How many chances do you need to win a game ? \" The Celtics had to win Game 5 in the Garden . Fortunately , for Boston , the Lakers were compliant . And Ainge had his outside shot going . The Celtics got the lead and kept it . Ainge missed a trey early in the second half , bringing the Celtics ' bench to shout that they did n't need threes . But Ainge must have had plugs in his ears . He kept throwing them up , hitting four in the period . For the game , he made 5 - of - 6 from \" Ainge range . \" Magic countered for Los Angeles with 29 points , 12 assists , eight rebounds and four steals , but he received little help . Before the game Bird had told his teammates , \" If they want to celebrate , let 's not let them do it on the parquet . \" At one point during the contest , the Lakers ' staff even iced down several cases of champagne . But the Celtics had incentive enough . They got their second win , 123 - 108 , and the series jetted back across the continent . Kareem arrived for Game 6 with a shave job on his balding head . And for a time , it seemed Los Angeles was intent on cutting the game just as close . Magic had only four points by the half , and the Celtics led 56 - 51 . But like Abdul - Jabbar 's perspiring pate , the Lakers shone after intermission . Worthy finished with 22 points , while Abdul - Jabbar contributed 32 points , six rebounds and four blocks . Thompson added 15 points and nine rebounds . And Magic led them with another display of all - around brilliance . On top of his previous efforts , his 16 - point , 19 - assist , eight - rebound showing brought him the Finals MVP Award as Los Angeles claimed its fourth title of the decade with a 106 - 93 win . \" Magic is a great , great basketball player , \" Bird stated flatly , settling the issue for the moment . \" The best I 've ever seen . \" \" I guess this is the best team I 've ever played against , \" Bird said . \" In ' 85 , they were good . In ' 84 , I really thought they should have beaten us . I do n't know if this team 's better than they were , but I guess they are . Their fast break is better . They 're deeper . \" The Lakers and the Celtics had established a standard for pro basketball , and by 1987 they had begun to assume that the championship round was theirs to share . | NBA||D-LEAGUE ||WNBA ||MOBILE ||TICKETS ||NBATV |","annotations":[{"text":"Los Angeles Lakers","span":[284,301],"token_span":[54,56],"role":"Party_1","label":"Party_1","role_definition":"Party_1 is the grammatically more prominent participant in the congregating event."},{"text":"Celtics","span":[126,132],"token_span":[21,21],"role":"Party_2","label":"Party_2","role_definition":"A grammatically less prominent participant in the congregating event."},{"text":"1987 NBA Finals","span":[55,69],"token_span":[7,9],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time is when the congregating occurs."},{"text":"the Forum","span":[3875,3883],"token_span":[756,757],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place is where the congregating occurs."},{"text":"Boston","span":[5808,5813],"token_span":[1145,1145],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place is where the congregating occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-1341-84-frame-Come_together","frame":"Come_together","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"In this frame a group of Individuals meet to form a Configuration.","frame_ancestors":["Event"],"frame_descendants":["Assemble","Encounter"],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Background Representatives from a number of the Thirteen Colonies assembled as the Stamp Act Congress in response to the Stamp Act 1765 , to call into question the right of a distant power to tax them without proper representation .","annotations":[{"text":"Representatives from a number of the Thirteen Colonies","span":[11,64],"token_span":[1,8],"role":"Individuals","label":"Individuals","role_definition":"The Individuals are self-movers who come together."},{"text":"the Stamp Act Congress","span":[79,100],"token_span":[11,14],"role":"Configuration","label":"Configuration","role_definition":"The Configuration describes the resulting formation of the individuals."},{"text":"1765","span":[131,134],"token_span":[21,21],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time is when the congregating occurs."}],"trigger":{"text":"assembled","start_char":66,"end_char":74,"start_token":9,"end_token":9,"frame":"Come_together"}},"source":{"text":"1763 - The Proclamation of 1763 , signed by King George III of England , prohibits any English settlement west of the Appalachian mountains and requires those already settled in those regions to return east in an attempt to ease tensions with Native Americans . 1764 - The Sugar Act is passed by the English Parliament to offset the war debt brought on by the French and Indian War and to help pay for the expenses of running the colonies and newly acquired territories .

It maintains a threepenny per pound import tax on tea arriving in the colonies , which had already been in effect for six years . It also gives the near bankrupt British East India Company a virtual tea monopoly by allowing it to sell directly to colonial agents , bypassing any middlemen , thus underselling American merchants . The East India Company had successfully lobbied Parliament for such a measure . In September , Parliament authorizes the company to ship half a million pounds of tea to a group of chosen tea agents . 1773 - In October , colonists hold a mass meeting in Philadelphia in opposition to the tea tax and the monopoly of the East India Company .

In New York City , violence breaks out as a mob burns the royal governor in effigy , harasses British troops , then loots houses . 1765 - In December , British General Thomas Gage , commander of all English military forces in America , asks the New York assembly to make colonists comply with the Quartering Act and house and supply his troops . Also in December , the American boycott of English imports spreads , as over 200 Boston merchants join the movement . 1766 - In January , the New York assembly refuses to completely comply with Gen. Gage 's request to enforce the Quartering Act. 1766 - In March , King George III signs a bill repealing the Stamp Act after much debate in the English Parliament , which included an appearance by Ben Franklin arguing for repeal and warning of a possible revolution in the American colonies if the Stamp Act was enforced by the British military . 1766 - On the same day it repealed the Stamp Act , the English Parliament passes the Declaratory Act stating that the British government has total power to legislate any laws governing the American colonies in all cases whatsoever . 1766 - In April , news of the repeal of the Stamp Act results in celebrations in the colonies and a relaxation of the boycott of imported English trade goods . 1766 - In August , violence breaks out in New York between British soldiers and armed colonists , including Sons of Liberty members . The violence erupts as a result of the continuing refusal of New York colonists to comply with the Quartering Act . In December , the New York legislature is suspended by the English Crown after once again voting to refuse to comply with the Act. 1767 - In June , The English Parliament passes the Townshend Revenue Acts , imposing a new series of taxes on the colonists to offset the costs of administering and protecting the American colonies . Items taxed include imports such as paper , tea , glass , lead and paints . The Act also establishes a colonial board of customs commissioners in Boston . In October , Bostonians decide to reinstate a boycott of English luxury items . 1768 - In February , Samuel Adams of Massachusetts writes a Circular Letter opposing taxation without representation and calling for the colonists to unite in their actions against the British government . The letter is sent to assemblies throughout the colonies and also instructs them on the methods the Massachusetts general court is using to oppose the Townshend Acts . 1768 - In April , England 's Secretary of State for the Colonies , Lord Hillsborough , orders colonial governors to stop their own assemblies from endorsing Adams ' circular letter . Hillsborough also orders the governor of Massachusetts to dissolve the general court if the Massachusetts assembly does not revoke the letter . By month 's end , the assemblies of New Hampshire , Connecticut and New Jersey have endorsed the letter . 1768 - In May , a British warship armed with 50 cannons sails into Boston harbor after a call for help from custom commissioners who are constantly being harassed by Boston agitators . In June , a customs official is locked up in the cabin of the Liberty , a sloop owned by John Hancock . Imported wine is then unloaded illegally into Boston without payment of duties . Following this incident , customs officials seize Hancock 's sloop . After threats of violence from Bostonians , the customs officials escape to an island off Boston , then request the intervention of British troops . 1768 - In July , the governor of Massachusetts dissolves the general court after the legislature defies his order to revoke Adams ' circular letter . In August , in Boston and New York , merchants agree to boycott most British goods until the Townshend Acts are repealed . In September , at a town meeting in Boston , residents are urged to arm themselves . Later in September , English warships sail into Boston Harbor , then two regiments of English infantry land in Boston and set up permanent residence to keep order . 1769 - In March , merchants in Philadelphia join the boycott of British trade goods . In May , a set of resolutions written by George Mason is presented by George Washington to the Virginia House of Burgesses . The Virginia Resolves oppose taxation without representation , the British opposition to the circular letters , and British plans to possibly send American agitators to England for trial . Ten days later , the Royal governor of Virginia dissolves the House of Burgesses . However , its members meet the next day in a Williamsburg tavern and agree to a boycott of British trade goods , luxury items and slaves . 1769 - In July , in the territory of California , San Diego is founded by Franciscan Friar Juniper Serra . In October , the boycott of English goods spreads to New Jersey , Rhode Island , and then North Carolina . 1770 - The population of the American colonies reaches 2,210,000 persons . 1770 - Violence erupts in January between members of the Sons of Liberty in New York and 40 British soldiers over the posting of broadsheets by the British . Several men are seriously wounded . March 5 , 1770 - The Boston Massacre occurs as a mob harasses British soldiers who then fire their muskets pointblank into the crowd , killing three instantly , mortally wounding two others and injuring six . After the incident , the new Royal Governor of Massachusetts , Thomas Hutchinson , at the insistence of Sam Adams , withdraws British troops out of Boston to nearby harbor islands . The captain of the British soldiers , Thomas Preston , is then arrested along with eight of his men and charged with murder . 1770 - In April , the Townshend Acts are repealed by the British . All duties on imports into the colonies are eliminated except for tea . Also , the Quartering Act is not renewed . 1770 - In October , trial begins for the British soldiers arrested after the Boston Massacre . Colonial lawyers John Adams and Josiah Quincy successfully defend Captain Preston and six of his men , who are acquitted . Two other soldiers are found guilty of manslaughter , branded , then released . 1772 - In June , a British customs schooner , the Gaspee , runs aground off Rhode Island in Narragansett Bay . Colonists from Providence row out to the schooner and attack it , set the British crew ashore , then burn the ship . In September , a 500 pound reward is offered by the English Crown for the capture of those colonists , who would then be sent to England for trial . The announcement that they would be sent to England further upsets many American colonists . 1772 - In November , a Boston town meeting assembles , called by Sam Adams . During the meeting , a 21 member committee of correspondence is appointed to communicate with other towns and colonies . A few weeks later , the town meeting endorses three radical proclamations asserting the rights of the colonies to self -rule . 1773 - In March , the Virginia House of Burgesses appoints an eleven member committee of correspondence to communicate with the other colonies regarding common complaints against the British . Members of that committee include , Thomas Jefferson , Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee . Virginia is followed a few months later by New Hampshire , Rhode Island , Connecticut and South Carolina . 1773 - May 10 , the Tea Act takes effect . It maintains a threepenny per pound import tax on tea arriving in the colonies , which had already been in effect for six years . It also gives the near bankrupt British East India Company a virtual tea monopoly by allowing it to sell directly to colonial agents , bypassing any middlemen , thus underselling American merchants . The East India Company had successfully lobbied Parliament for such a measure . In September , Parliament authorizes the company to ship half a million pounds of tea to a group of chosen tea agents . 1773 - In October , colonists hold a mass meeting in Philadelphia in opposition to the tea tax and the monopoly of the East India Company . A committee then forces British tea agents to resign their positions . In November , a town meeting is held in Boston endorsing the actions taken by Philadelphia colonists . Bostonians then try , but fail , to get their British tea agents to resign . A few weeks later , three ships bearing tea sail into Boston harbor . 1773 - November 29/30 , two mass meetings occur in Boston over what to do about the tea aboard the three ships now docked in Boston harbor . Colonists decide to send the tea on the ship , Dartmouth , back to England without paying any import duties . The Royal Governor of Massachusetts , Hutchinson , is opposed to this and orders harbor officials not to let the ship sail out of the harbor unless the tea taxes have been paid . December 16 , 1773 - About 8000 Bostonians gather to hear Sam Adams tell them Royal Governor Hutchinson has repeated his command not to allow the ships out of the harbor until the tea taxes are paid . That night , the Boston Tea Party occurs as colonial activists disguise themselves as Mohawk Indians then board the ships and dump all 342 containers of tea into the harbor . 1774 - In March , an angry English Parliament passes the first of a series of Coercive Acts ( called Intolerable Acts by Americans ) in response to the rebellion in Massachusetts . The Boston Port Bill effectively shuts down all commercial shipping in Boston harbor until Massachusetts pays the taxes owed on the tea dumped in the harbor and also reimburses the East India Company for the loss of the tea . 1774 - May 12 , Bostonians at a town meeting call for a boycott of British imports in response to the Boston Port Bill . May 13 , General Thomas Gage , commander of all British military forces in the colonies , arrives in Boston and replaces Hutchinson as Royal governor , putting Massachusetts under military rule . He is followed by the arrival of four regiments of British troops . 1774 - May 17 - 23 , colonists in Providence , New York and Philadelphia begin calling for an intercolonial congress to overcome the Coercive Acts and discuss a common course of action against the British . 1774 - May 20 , The English Parliament enacts the next series of Coercive Acts , which include the Massachusetts Regulating Act and the Government Act virtually ending any self - rule by the colonists there . Instead , the English Crown and the Royal governor assume political power formerly exercised by colonists . Also enacted ; the Administration of Justice Act which protects royal officials in Massachusetts from being sued in colonial courts , and the Quebec Act establishing a centralized government in Canada controlled by the Crown and English Parliament . The Quebec Act greatly upsets American colonists by extending the southern boundary of Canada into territories claimed by Massachusetts , Connecticut and Virginia . 1774 - In June , a new version of the 1765 Quartering Act is enacted by the English Parliament requiring all of the American colonies to provide housing for British troops in occupied houses and taverns and in unoccupied buildings . In September , Massachusetts Governor Gage seizes that colony 's arsenal of weapons at Charlestown . 1774 - September 5 to October 26 , the First Continental Congress meets in Philadelphia with 56 delegates , representing every colony , except Georgia . Attendants include Patrick Henry , George Washington , Sam Adams and John Hancock . On September 17 , the Congress declares its opposition to the Coercive Acts , saying they are \" not to be obeyed , \" and also promotes the formation of local militia units . On October 14 , a Declaration and Resolves is adopted that opposes the Coercive Acts , the Quebec Act , and other measure taken by the British that undermine self-rule . The rights of the colonists are asserted , including the rights to \" life , liberty and property . \" On October 20 , the Congress adopts the Continental Association in which delegates agree to a boycott of English imports , effect an embargo of exports to Britain , and discontinue the slave trade . 1775 - February 1 , in Cambridge , Mass. , a provincial congress is held during which John Hancock and Joseph Warren begin defensive preparations for a state of war . February 9 , the English Parliament declares Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion . March 23 , in Virginia , Patrick Henry delivers a speech against British rule , stating , \" Give me liberty or give me death ! \" March 30 , the New England Restraining Act is endorsed by King George III , requiring New England colonies to trade exclusively with England and also bans fishing in the North Atlantic . 1775 - In April , Massachusetts Governor Gage is ordered to enforce the Coercive Acts and suppress \" open rebellion \" among the colonists by all necessary force .","annotations":[{"text":"representatives from nine of the colonies","span":[3419,3459],"token_span":[632,637],"role":"Individuals","label":"Individuals","role_definition":"The Individuals are self-movers who come together."},{"text":"the Stamp Act Congress","span":[3363,3384],"token_span":[621,624],"role":"Configuration","label":"Configuration","role_definition":"The Configuration describes the resulting formation of the individuals."},{"text":"1765 - In October","span":[3343,3359],"token_span":[616,619],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time is when the congregating occurs."},{"text":"New York City","span":[3398,3410],"token_span":[627,629],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place is where the congregating occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-3022-379-frame-Coming_to_be","frame":"Coming_to_be","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Entity comes into existence at a particular Place and Time which may take a certain Duration_of_endstate, have a Cause, or be formed from Components.","frame_ancestors":["Event"],"frame_descendants":["Being_born"],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Non-European cultures Among the Ancient Hawaiians , the relationship of punalua involved \" the fact that two or more brothers with their wives , or two or more sisters with their husbands , were inclined to possess each other in common \" .

Yet again the Maoris ascribed prophetic gifts to the oldest woman of the tribe , while in Tonga there were priestesses who , after drinking ava , were possessed and prophesied . In Micronesia their social position has unmistakably risen . Here it is quite contrary to good manners for a husband to beat his wife or use insulting words to her in public . In Pelew , if the woman insulted belongs to the Ajdit stock , the fine imposed is equal to that for homicide , and if it cannot be paid the culprit must fly the country . The greatest insult that can be offered to a married man is any ill word of his wife ; and no one must mention the name of another man 's wife in public . A social organisation exists here for women corresponding to that of the men , and running almost parallel with it . Just as the chief of the men in Pelew must belong to the family whose seat is Ajdit , so the eldest woman of this family is the queen of the women . Beside her stand a number of female chiefs , with whom she keeps an eye upon the good behaviour of the women , holds her tribunal , and gives judgment without any man being allowed to interfere . So too the women are divided into leagues , called Klobbergoll .

Marriage No tie in the whole life of the Polynesians appears to be weaker than that of marriage . Small reasons are enough to undo it , and its undoing is taken very easily on both sides .

Thanks to an after - work drinking session and his years of musical expertiese , Sano became one of the producers of the Korg DS - 10 . Continue on to read our interview with Nobuyoshi Sano . Destructoid : Some big names in Japanese videogame music came together to create the DS - 10 , yourself and Mr. Mitsuda included . Who originally came up with the idea of bringing a synth to a game system ? Nobuyoshi Sano : I went drinking with Mr. Okamiya of AQ Interactive , who is the other producer for DS - 10 awhile ago and we started talking about how great it would be to make a synthesizer for the DS . We know that this is an emulation of the classic electronic instrument , KORG MS - 10 . What made you choose this instrument over any other ? While we were drinking looking at an open DS , the shape looked like a KORG MS - 10 ! So we said , \u201c Let 's put a MS - 10 into a DS ! \u201d Also , the very first synthesizer I bought was an MS - 10 , so that was another reason why we chose that model . How cooperative was KORG ? They were obviously happy enough with the end product to put their name on it , but in the beginning , was this title a difficult pitch ? When we presented the idea to KORG they were in the midst of doing some research on the DS . KORG is a very open-minded company and eager to take on new challenges so we had no problem pitching this title to them . Thanks to the presets and some great demo tracks , it 's easy to jump in and create music . But the more advanced parameters may confuse newcomers . Was there any concern that the software may be too complex for new users ? Our sole goal was to create a solid synthesizer on the DS , so to be honest , we really did n't consider the new users very much . Also , when I purchased the MS- 10 I was 13 years old and it fully immersed me and showed how fun it is to use a synthesizer without being too confusing , so I did n't think it would be a problem . In the development process , were there ever any reservations about bringing a full - blown synthesizer to a handheld game console ? Before starting the project we discussed with our co-development companies KORG and PROCYON STUDIO , which handled all the sounds other than the Synth engine part , and they both said with confidence that this could be done so , we did n't have any doubts or concerns while in development . On the contrary , when KORG brought in the first prototype version on the DS , I had this sudden urge and even anxiety to hurry up and finish this project in order to \u201c show - off \u201d this title to everyone as soon as possible . We 've already seen the DS - 10 used live , including alongside live instruments . In the creation process , were you mindful of its live use possibilities ? What did you do to make it performance - friendly ? I did not think the live performance using the DS - 10 would be this big and widely accepted . For functionality , the implementation of the MUTE button and SOLO button for each tracks in the PATTERN MODE were for the purpose of live performances . We see a lot of YouTube clips using these functions in ways that our development staff did n't even imagine when we were creating them . We 're sad that we missed your performance at Extra- Hyper Game Music Event 2008 this year . We heard you performed arrangements of your music from Ridge Racer and Ridge Racer II . What were your highlights from that event ? Did you perform any solos on the touch pad ? At Extra , the very popular game in Japan , Idolmaster , which is a music rhythm game which you become the producer of a pop star , WE did a live performance and that was the highlight of the event . I was really happy that our \u201c Trio the DS - 10 \u201d got a lot of hype and cheers too . Also , Mr. Okamiya from AQ Interactive did an awesome solo play using the KAOSS Pad that was equivalent or even more powerful than his guitar play , and that really rocked the house . ( Mr. Okamiya is the guitarist in the hard rock band \u201c THE BLACK MAGES \u201d which Final Fantasy 's Mr. Uematsu is also in ) Now that you have a strong team and a working relationship with Korg , is there any chance you 'd release another DS musical product ? Maybe a ROMpler like the M1 , with a built - in sequencer ? We would love to continue making more products like the DS - 10 in the future .

Reserve your spot here ! Mobile payment system Mopay announced today that people charging online merchandise directly to their cell phones or landlines has nearly doubled over the last year in North America , putting local consumers on par with leading regions like Asia that have long been using the method . The 11-year - old company lets you pay for physical merchandise with your cell phone in online transactions in 28 countries \u2014 a process also referred to as carrier billing . As such , it now handles digital goods purchases for more than 400 customers , reaching 3.3 billion people \u2014 including well - known gaming brands like Bigpoint , Gameforge , Innogames , Sulake and Travian . The Munich - based company said it attributes this rapid , recent adoption in North American users to improved carrier agreements , easier integration , optimized usability and growing general acceptance among consumers . \u201c Merchants are adapting to a trend where consumers are not using credit cards but phones to make online purchases , with games spearheading the implementations to make virtual goods available to unbanked and underbanked consumers , \u201d Kolja Reiss , managing director of Mopay in the United States , told VentureBeat . Mopay ( which spells its name \u201c mopay \u201d ) said it gathered the stats after analyzing specific data from its international mobile payments platform and based their conclusions on conversion rates , transaction values and transaction numbers accumulated in more than 80 countries . The process works in three - steps : Once a service is selected as a form of payment , the consumer enters their mobile phone number when prompted . Second , the consumer will receive a special pin number via text message . Third , a user will enter that pin number in the designated field on the website , which will complete the transaction . The purchase is then billed directly to the buyer 's mobile phone account . The ability to have companies charge a consumer 's phone directly has long been popular in Asia , where phones come equipped with near- field communication ( NFC ) chips and retailers have scanners that can process the transactions . But now that global consumers are demanding the service , there has been a boom in companies interested in taking a slice of the billions to be made in the space , including American startups such as Boku , Zong and BilltoMobile . Other findings from Mopay 's study included : \u2013 Regardless of region , adults use mobile payments more deliberately , making the average global conversion rate of adults more than twice as high . \u2013 Mobile payments work best within a value of $ 2.50 and $ 10 . Global merchants have independently established a \u201c sweet spot \u201d of their mobile payment offers of around $ 8 . Only three percent of all offers ranged below a value of $ 2.50 and two percent exceeded a value of $ 14 . \u2013 Within this price range , the average transaction value of mobile payments increased in 2010 , mirroring the growing trust of consumers in mobile payments . \u2013 Although mobile payments are broadly considered \u201c micropayments , \u201d consumers regularly spend up to $ 50 per month using mobile payments . This fact is apparently due to a high percentage of repeat customers , with the majority of consumers use mobile payments more than once a month \u2014 in 2010 almost 60 percent . Hence , as low as the pricing range may seem , mobile payments regularly generate macro revenue per consumer . So far , Mopay has raised $ 20 million to date from investors including T-Venture Mobile , Tempo Capital and Holtzbrinck Ventures , with its last round in 2004 .

In what seemed to be a bit of good news on Tuesday , Pornhub announced that it would change its policies to only allow verified users to upload content to , or download from , the platform \u2014 as well as enact a more robust moderation process . This was a welcome shift , and was a long time coming : non-consensual sexual imagery activists , as well as performers whose work is often pirated and reposted to Pornhub , have been asking for these changes for years . But by Thursday , Mastercard and Visa pulled the rug out from under performers and models on Pornhub , each announcing within an hour of one another that they were discontinuing service with Pornhub completely , following investigations into unlawful content on the site . The verified users that are now the only ones able to upload or download to Pornhub are also suddenly unable to receive payouts through the two biggest credit card companies . Sex workers and activists say that this is a dangerous , discriminatory decision \u2014 one fueled by anti-porn campaigners and conservative activist groups who want sex work abolished . In a statement published Friday , Sex Workers Outreach Project Behind Bars wrote that the decision will force more sex workers into the margins , calling it a \" war \" on sex workers . \" We say ' war against sex workers ' because the damage they do does not impact the labor as much as it affects the laborers who depend on the Pornhub platform to earn a living , \" it wrote . \" [...] Violence against sex workers includes the societal and institutional violence that has led to the shuttering of our online platforms that give us a measure of safety and allow us the critical resource that is the ability to access banking . \" \u201c If they can be shut down or hurt by this campaign , what hope is there for smaller platforms ? \u201d All of these changes came days after a piece published by Nicholas Kristof in the New York Times , which highlighted the plight of child sexual abuse survivors whose images were posted Pornhub . Despite writing about an issue that 's been used as political ammunition to censor adult content on the internet for decades \u2014 including the deeply harmful Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2018 \u2014 he barely cited performers who use the site or sex worker rights activists . Instead , he opted to name - check Traffickinghub , a campaign run by conservative religious anti-trafficking organization Exodus Cry , which opposes decriminalizing sex work and wants to abolish porn altogether . In that opinion piece , Kristof directly calls for payment processors to drop Pornhub : \" And call me a prude , but I do n't see why search engines , banks or credit card companies should bolster a company that monetizes sexual assaults on children or unconscious women . If PayPal can suspend cooperation with Pornhub , so can American Express , Mastercard and Visa , \" he wrote . \" I do n't see any neat solution . \" Much of the content on Pornhub is free to view , but for many performers , Pornhub was a stable revenue stream . The platform 's verified Amateur Program , as well as the clip selling service Modelhub and ad revenue made on video uploads make up a constellation of ways performers can make money on Pornhub . Kristof 's inability to see a \" neat solution \" erases the fact that many people rely on tube sites like Pornhub for their livelihoods , even though these sites are incredibly flawed . It 's not prudish to suggest child exploitation should stop and it 's willfully ignorant to suggest that it would be ; everyone agrees on that , including Pornhub . Suggesting all payments on the site should be dropped is , however , callous and myopic . \" This is something we in the industry have known about for a long time , but often the trafficking or child porn headlines will drown out our voices , \" cam model Mary Moody told me . \" We saw a similar issue unfold under SESTA / FOSTA when survival or full service sex workers were unable to verify through Backpage and had to move to the more risky street based work , where a disproportionate amount of minority groups are arrested . \" Porn performers have dealt with deplatforming and discriminatory payment processing practices from the beginning of the internet and beyond , but have always adapted , finding new ways to continue their work .

Dylan Thomas , an amateur performer , told me that after coming out as trans and facing discrimination and harassment in his former career , as well as a decrease in regular income from the pandemic , he chose to start modeling on Pornhub to make money . \" Now Mastercard and Visa are essentially for lack of a better term cock - blocking my potential to generate income through Pornhub and Modelhub , \" he said . \" I am watching to see if my Only Fans will be their next target and sincerely hoping not . \" Sex workers are often the most vocal , constructive critics of the platforms they use , and many have been trying to get Pornhub to change its unverified upload policies for years . Six months ago , adult model Ginger Banks started a petition specifically to ask Pornhub to change its upload policies to make them safer . No one wants sexual abuse imagery to proliferate on the internet , let alone on a site they use every day for income .

While Estradiol and Spironolactone can be acquired at numerous online pharmacies , most forms of testosterone are regulated as a steroid by both the Controlled Substances Act and the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990 \u2014 meaning most DIYers are transgender women .

Another reflected on living in the Southern United States , \u201c where trans healthcare is nonexistent and 9 out of 10 doctors are overtly hostile and antagonist [ sic ] toward trans patients . \u201d In a 2011 study by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay & Lesbian Task Force , 28 percent of respondents said they avoided medical care because of discrimination from a medical professional , and 19 percent reported being refused medical care because of their gender identity . Fifty percent said they had to teach their doctor about appropriate care \u2014 one reason some people may feel confident enough to manage their own transition . * * * A provision in the Affordable Care Act outlaws discrimination against patients on the basis of gender , a rule that Lambda Legal \u2014 an LGBT civil - rights organization that regularly takes up cases of discrimination \u2014 has argued extends to transgender individuals , since HRT is typically covered for women going through menopause . \u201c When people need to have access to care and they ca n't get it , they use any means possible , \u201d says Dru Levasseur , Lambda 's Transgender Rights Project Director . Some states , like New York and Massachusetts , have begun initiatives to close these gaps . But for now , questionable pharmacies are filling the void left open by the health care system . Websites like InHouse Pharmacy , All Day Chemist , and Quality Health , Inc. offer by - mail delivery of a vast number of drugs that typically require a prescription . Taking advantage of dense international shipping and drug laws , these sites sell hormones and many other medications not listed as controlled substances by the Drug Enforcement Administration \u2014 though , as The Washington Post has reported , Deep Web traffickers can help you with that , too . Earlier this year , the Center for Safe Internet Pharmacies surveyed 30,000 online drug-sellers , and found that 96 percent existed outside of regulations or licenses typically enforced by the Food and Drug Administration , the National Association of Boards of Pharmacies , and the DEA . \u201c These rogue sites often sell unapproved drugs , drugs that contain the wrong active ingredient , drugs that may contain too much or too little of the active ingredient , or drugs that contain dangerous ingredients , \u201d warns the FDA . According to Libby Baney , executive director of the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies * and a lawyer specializing in the regulation of the healthcare supply chain , patients are rolling the dice when they order prescription medications or controlled substances through most online pharmacies . \u201c One in two of these pharmacies are selling counterfeit medicine , \u201d she says , citing a report by the World Health Organization . Even if the drugs patients do obtain are legitimate and not counterfeit , many of these pharmacies and manufacturers do not have the same safety standards as the FDA and the U.S. government , she adds , citing India , Russia , and Pakistan as some of the more popular pharmacy locations . ( All Day Chemist , an online pharmacy based in India , even has a strict \u201c as - is \u201d policy , meaning they do not claim 100 - percent certainty about the products they sell . ) Hormones manufactured and distributed from abroad might be contaminated , or kept out of cold storage , which is necessary to keep them from degrading . \u201c Even if you 're lucky enough not to get a counterfeit , you do n't know the quality of the medicine you get , \u201d Baney says . Simply taking hormones poses health risks , too . Safer , the Boston University professor , notes that estrogen contributes to blood clots and can increase one 's chances of stroke or heart disease , as well as put extra strain on the liver . Spironolactone , the most popular testosterone blocker prescribed to transgender women , is a \u201c potassium - sparing diuretic , \u201d meaning a patient with existing kidney problems might have to restrict their dose or not take the drug at all . The moderators of r/asktransgender , the largest trans - related subreddit , with nearly 25,000 members , have made clear their position against DIY HRT . \u201c I know there are many of us who do not have access to knowledgeable doctors or have unsupportive parents . And there are many of us who have successfully gone down the road of DIY , \u201d a moderator on the forum wrote . \u201c However , please bear in mind that there ARE risks , and you should always try to transition under the support and care of a medical professional . \u201d While r/asktransgender does n't prohibit all talk of DIY hormones , other sites ban users helping each other administer their own HRT . Susan 's Place , one of the largest and oldest transgender forums on the web , explicitly prohibits any discussion of non-prescription hormones and even goes so far as to block discussion about \u201c natural \u201d hormone methods ( some transgender women will pursue a diet heavy in phytoestrogens in order to enhance certain feminine characteristics of their body ) . The Susan 's Place rule could be to avoid liability for the forum and its users , but individuals are rarely prosecuted for ordering off-prescription drugs . The pharmacies that sell them are conducting illegal activity under the federal regulations , but according to Baney , the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies lawyer , \u201c it 's unlikely an individual buying online is going to be prosecuted for that . The burden is on the drug seller that 's selling online \u2014 and the entities that facilitate that . \u201d She mentions a $ 500 million settlement between the Justice Department and Google , which failed to verify the authenticity of online pharmacies using its ad network . Similarly , in 2014 , FedEx faced a $ 1.4 billion fine for conspiring to deliver prescription drugs from illicit online pharmacies to patients without a prescription . * * * In many ways , the people braving the legal landscape to obtain HRT resemble the famous \u201c buyers clubs \u201d of the AIDS crisis . When a supposedly lagging FDA and medical community made drugs hard to come by for sufferers of HIV or AIDS , local groups began harvesting experimental AIDS drugs from countries with less regulation and distributing them to eager and desperate patients . One such group , founded by Ron Woodroof in 1989 , was portrayed in the Oscar-winning movie Dallas Buyer 's Club . Another , the People With AIDS Health Group in New York City , was profiled by journalist David France in the 2012 documentary How To Survive A Plague . Like then , the illicit drug market has picked up the pieces where the medical system has failed those who want more legitimate care . Some , like Andrea , are happy with the experimental freedom given to them when they control their own gender identity down to the medical options in front of them . But others , like Adam and Katherine , would be delighted to find easy and affordable access to health care through safer and more verified channels .

Kate Bartlett explores the curious case of the bogus ancestor , and tries to unmask the perpetrator of the cunning deceit . On 18 December 1912 newspapers throughout the world ran some sensational headlines - mostly along the lines of : ' Missing Link Found - Darwin 's Theory Proved ' . That same day , at a meeting of the Geological Society in London , fragments of a fossil skull and jawbone were unveiled to the world . These fragments were quickly attributed to ' the earliest Englishman - Piltdown Man ' , although the find was officially named Eoanthropus dawsoni after its discoverer , Charles Dawson . Dawson was an amateur archaeologist , said to have stumbled across the skull in a gravel pit at Barkham Manor , Piltdown , in Sussex . Some 40 years later , however , on 21 November 1953 , a team of English scientists dramatically exposed Piltdown Man as a deliberate fraud . Instead of being almost a million years old , the skull fragments were found to be 500 years old , and the jaw in fact belonged to an orang - utan . So what had really happened ? The story of Piltdown Man came out at just the time when scientists were in a desperate race to find the missing link in the theory of evolution . Since Charles Darwin had published his theory on the origin of species in 1859 , the hunt had been on for clues to the ancient ancestor that linked apes to humans . The story of Piltdown Man came out at just the time when scientists were in a desperate race to find the missing link in the theory of evolution . Since Charles Darwin had published his theory on the origin of species in 1859 , the hunt had been on for clues to the ancient ancestor that linked apes to humans . Sensational finds of fossil ancestors , named Neanderthals , had already occurred in Germany and France . British Scientists , however , were desperate to prove that Britain had also played its part in the story of human evolution , and Piltdown Man was the answer to their prayers - because of him , Britain could claim to be the birthplace of mankind . Charles Dawson had made a name for himself by finding fossils in Sussex , and passing them on to Sir Arthur Smith Woodward at what is now the Natural History Museum , London . Dawson now claimed that at some point before 1910 , a workman had handed him a dark - stained and thick piece of human skull . He said that recognising that this might be part of an ancient human , he had continued to dig at the site and collected more pieces of skull . Charles Dawson had made a name for himself by finding fossils in Sussex , and passing them on to Sir Arthur Smith Woodward at what is now the Natural History Museum , London . On 14 February 1912 , he wrote to Woodward with news of exciting discoveries , and that summer Woodward joined him to excavate at Piltdown . They found more fragments of skull , and the bones and teeth of extinct British animals such as elephants , rhinos and beavers . They also found primitive stone tools , and a remarkable ape-like jaw . On the basis of these finds , Woodward constructed a skull that seemed to supply the missing link in the evolutionary path between humans and the apes . With a brain the same size as that of modern humans , and a very ape - like jaw , Piltdown Man was born . Some overseas experts were sceptical of the match between the skull and jaw . They argued that they represented separate human and ape fossils , and had become mixed in the same fossil deposit . In 1913 , however , Dawson and Woodward made further finds at Piltdown , including one of a canine tooth . Some overseas experts were sceptical of the match between the skull and jaw . They argued that they represented separate human and ape fossils , and had become mixed in the same fossil deposit . This was of an intermediate size , between that of an ape 's and a human 's tooth , exactly as Woodward had predicted on his model of Piltdown Man . This seemed to confirm that the jaw was from an intermediate ape-man creature , not an ape . Then in 1915 Dawson claimed to have found another molar tooth , and some skull pieces , just two miles from the original Piltdown dig site . These looked similar to those of Piltdown Man , and the find was dubbed Piltdown Man II . With two family members and the backing of the Natural History Museum , Piltdown Man thus became generally accepted . For the next 40 years , Piltdown Man remained a key member of the human family tree , although in the early 1920s and 30s , other fossils being discovered around the world did n't seem to fit with his physiology . Dart 's fossil , however , now known as ' Taung 's child ' , eventually became recognised as a genuine member of the human family tree , officially named Australopithecines . In South Africa , in 1924 , Raymond Dart discovered the fossil skull of an ape-man that had human-like teeth , but since its brain was much smaller than that of Piltdown , most British scientists dismissed Dart 's find as an ancient ape . Dart 's fossil , however , now known as ' Taung 's child ' , eventually became recognised as a genuine member of the human family tree , officially named Australopithecines . Despite this , British scientists , including Sir Arthur Smith Woodward , continued to believe in Piltdown - as can be seen from Woodward 's book ' The Earliest Englishman ' ( published 1948 ) . It was not until new technology for the dating of fossils was developed , in the late 1940s , that Piltdown Man came to be seriously questioned once again . In 1949 , Dr Kenneth Oakley , a member of the staff at the Natural History Museum , tested the Piltdown fossils and found that the skull and jaw were not that ancient . It had simply been boiled and stained to match the colour and antiquity of the Piltdown gravels . He joined forces with Professor Joe Weiner and Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark from Oxford , to apply stringent tests to all the Piltdown remains . They realised that the human-like wear pattern on the teeth had been created by artificially filing down the teeth from an orang - utan jaw . The skull pieces were found to have come from an unusually thick - boned - but quite recent - human skull . It had simply been boiled and stained to match the colour and antiquity of the Piltdown gravels . Although many of the mammal fossils were genuine , they had also been stained to match the skull and came from all over the world . It turned out that every single one of the 40 odd finds at Piltdown had been planted . On 21 November 1953 the news broke , and headline writers revelled in the Natural History Museum 's embarrassment : ' Fossil Hoax Makes Monkeys Out Of Scientists ! ' Weiner and Oakley quickly began an investigation to uncover the identity of the hoaxer . Who had had the access , the expertise and the motive to carry out such an outrageous forgery ? Weiner set off in pursuit of Charles Dawson . He was the one person who was always present when the discoveries were made , and after his premature death from septicaemia in 1916 no more finds were ever made at Piltdown . He also discovered that Dawson was an ambitious man , who had made many supposed discoveries that later turned out also to be forgeries . Weiner 's went to Lewes in Sussex , where Dawson had lived . Here he discovered Dawson 's unsavoury local reputation - he had obtained his home , Castle Lodge , by falsely claiming to be buying it for the Sussex Archaeological Society . He also discovered that Dawson was an ambitious man , who had made many supposed discoveries that later turned out also to be forgeries . Although Weiner hinted at Dawson being the perpetrator of the Piltdown hoax in his book The Piltdown Forgery , he never out - right accused him . There was serious doubt about whether he had sufficient knowledge to fake the bones that had deceived so many scientists . Was he himself the victim of someone else 's elaborate vendetta ? The most famous name linked to the Piltdown forgery is that of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , creator of the fictitious sleuth Sherlock Holmes . Conan Doyle lived near to Piltdown , and was a member of the same archaeological society as Charles Dawson . The most famous name linked to the Piltdown forgery is that of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , creator of the fictitious sleuth Sherlock Holmes . As a doctor and fossil collector he had the relevant knowledge to pull off the hoax . He may also have left some intriguing clues to the Piltdown hoax in one of his most famous novels , The Lost World , published the same years as Piltdown was found . The book treated in colourful detail the supposed survival into modern times of dinosaurs and ape-men - and included a tantalising line about bones being as easy to fake as a photograph . Most revealing of all is a possible motive . Conan Doyle spent the last decade of his life advancing the cause of spiritualism - he believed that it was possible to communicate with the dead . His beliefs were mocked by fellow scientists , so what better way to shake the arrogance of the scientific establishment than to fake Piltdown and expose their fallibility ? There have also always been rumours that the forgery was perpetrated by somebody inside the Natural History Museum with a grudge against Sir Arthur Smith Woodward . One man , Martin Hinton , was a volunteer at the museum when Piltdown was discovered - who was known to have fallen out with Woodward over payment for his work . There have also always been rumours that the forgery was perpetrated by somebody inside the Natural History Museum with a grudge against Sir Arthur Smith Woodward . Rumours about Hinton 's involvement took off in 1978 , when a trunk belonging to Hinton was discovered in the museum - containing fossil animal bones , stained and deliberately cut to see how far the stain had penetrated . The stains looked like those used on the Piltdown remains , but no-one can say whether Hinton was staining material to plant at Piltdown , or just conducting his own tests on how Piltdown was forged . One of the most extraordinary aspects of the Piltdown discoveries was a curious artefact found by Woodward and Dawson in 1915 . It was in the shape of a prehistoric cricket bat - perhaps a bit too apt a tool for the ' earliest Englishman ' ? Many people believe this indicated the practical joker , Hinton , and believe it was an attempt to bring an end to Piltdown Man . Unfortunately it appears the joke backfired when Woodward and Dawson wrote up the find as a genuine early tool of Piltdown Man . No single suspect , however , satisfactorily explains all the complexities of the hoax . And it seems that we may never know the identity of the Piltdown hoaxer - it remains one of the most fascinating and intriguing scientific hoaxes of all time .

Kate Bartlett explores the curious case of the bogus ancestor , and tries to unmask the perpetrator of the cunning deceit . On 18 December 1912 newspapers throughout the world ran some sensational headlines - mostly along the lines of : ' Missing Link Found - Darwin 's Theory Proved ' . That same day , at a meeting of the Geological Society in London , fragments of a fossil skull and jawbone were unveiled to the world . These fragments were quickly attributed to ' the earliest Englishman - Piltdown Man ' , although the find was officially named Eoanthropus dawsoni after its discoverer , Charles Dawson . Dawson was an amateur archaeologist , said to have stumbled across the skull in a gravel pit at Barkham Manor , Piltdown , in Sussex . Some 40 years later , however , on 21 November 1953 , a team of English scientists dramatically exposed Piltdown Man as a deliberate fraud . Instead of being almost a million years old , the skull fragments were found to be 500 years old , and the jaw in fact belonged to an orang - utan . So what had really happened ? The story of Piltdown Man came out at just the time when scientists were in a desperate race to find the missing link in the theory of evolution . Since Charles Darwin had published his theory on the origin of species in 1859 , the hunt had been on for clues to the ancient ancestor that linked apes to humans .

Since Charles Darwin had published his theory on the origin of species in 1859 , the hunt had been on for clues to the ancient ancestor that linked apes to humans .

He made a calculated attempt to cover his tracks , persuading his girlfriend , Maxine Carr , to take part in the cruel deception . The case has stunned many of those who thought they knew Ian Huntley . Yet the words they use to describe him are strikingly similar . They paint a picture of a moody , domineering young man with an unhealthy interest in schoolgirls . It was at school in Immingham on the outskirts of Grimsby that his troubles began . He was good at football , but not popular with the other boys and was self - conscious about his appearance . Fellow pupil Carl McLaughlin remembers him as a misfit , a quiet boy who had an alarming temper . \" Ian was a smallish lad , skinny and with a big forehead , \" he recalls . \" He never used to get on with the lads . He was picked on because he did n't fit in , and he took out his temper on smaller boys , chasing people around the playground . \" When Ian got angry , it was like he changed from one person to another . One minute he was human , the next he was a monster like the Incredible Hulk . Not a nice lad to know . \" With few male friends , the teenage Ian Huntley sought out the company of girls . Marriage He was described as \" a charmer \" , but after he left school at 16 , a more disturbing picture began to emerge . He drifted around North East Lincolnshire , changing address every few months . In December 1994 , Huntley , then 20 , met 18 - year - old Claire Evans . They embarked on a whirlwind romance and he asked her to marry him . She agreed but within weeks of the wedding , the marriage was over and she moved out . Relatives claim that Huntley had become violent and abusive towards her . To Huntley 's anger , she began a relationship with his brother , Wayne , whom she later married . Huntley then had a succession of young girlfriends who described him as having violent tendencies . ' Punched in stomach ' One teenage girlfriend , Becky Bartlett , recalled how she lived with him briefly until a violent incident ended the relationship . \" I thought I was pregnant and I told him , and he just punched me in the stomach . I fell on the bed and I just said ' What did you do that for ? ' \" He just said ' I do n't want no kids ' . That 's when I realised that I should n't really have been with him . \" Others who came into contact with Huntley became uneasy about his behaviour . In Grimsby , he stayed for several weeks in the house of Louise de Gruchy . \" He was charming , well - mannered and polite , but strange , \" she recalls . \" There was just something about him that made you think he was not quite right , \" she recalls . Louise says she told Huntley she did not approve of him seeing a 14- year - old schoolgirl . The relationship fizzled out , but then there was another incident . \" I had a friend sleeping over ; she was 15 . When I woke up in the morning I found them in bed together , so I had a few words to say to them both . \" It was either the next day , or a couple of days later , I came home and he 'd moved out . He was strange , I 'd say manipulative , especially with the young girls . \" Uneasy She was not the only woman disturbed by Ian Huntley . Sue Penney , his employer in Grimsby , says his fellow workers disliked him . \" He was very deep and moody , \" she says . \" The way he would look at you made you feel very uneasy . It was not a normal friendly face . Women in particular felt really uncomfortable with him . \" If you asked him questions about himself , he 'd just change the subject and go very quiet and then talk about something completely different . \" But there were other things that bothered her , like the way Huntley treated his girlfriend , who was about 16 or 17 . \" It was about him controlling her . He would just sort of have to look at her and she would know he was mad with her , and just clam up . \" And factory workers told stories about Huntley and even younger girls . \" We heard rumours of underage sex with 12 and 13 - year - old girls , \" says Sue . \" That , and the way the girls felt around him , was enough for us to get rid of him . \" It has now emerged that Huntley had faced four allegations of underage sexual relations and one of sexual assault when he lived in Grimsby in the late 1990s . These claims never led to a prosecution . Rape allegation In 1998 , Ian Huntley found himself accused of rape . The case against him was eventually dropped , but he was concerned that detectives in Soham would find out . In fact Humberside Police say they had ten contacts with Huntley over eight offences allegedly committed by him . This included the rape claim , and one arrest for failure to appear in court . Huntley told Maxine Carr he feared police would \" fit him up \" for the murders of Holly and Jessica . In Scunthorpe , the couple lived together at a flat in West Street , close to a hairdressing salon . Stylist Marie Wilson remembers him being \" a bit weird \" , and says the other staff did not like him . \" It was his general mannerisms , \" she recalls . \" There was just something about him that made them feel uncomfortable . They said they would be passing him in the street , and he 'd be leering at them . \" Pattern of behaviour After moving to Soham , Huntley and Carr used to visit a pub called the Black Horse at Littleport , a few miles outside the village . On Sunday , one week after the two girls went missing , they came in as usual , telling the landlord they wanted to get away from the media . \" Ian was playing pool , talking to the lads about football , \" says Brian Kelly . \" I ca n't believe somebody could do that , walk into a pub , and be so cool .

He made a calculated attempt to cover his tracks , persuading his girlfriend , Maxine Carr , to take part in the cruel deception . The case has stunned many of those who thought they knew Ian Huntley . Yet the words they use to describe him are strikingly similar . They paint a picture of a moody , domineering young man with an unhealthy interest in schoolgirls . It was at school in Immingham on the outskirts of Grimsby that his troubles began . He was good at football , but not popular with the other boys and was self - conscious about his appearance . Fellow pupil Carl McLaughlin remembers him as a misfit , a quiet boy who had an alarming temper . \" Ian was a smallish lad , skinny and with a big forehead , \" he recalls . \" He never used to get on with the lads . He was picked on because he did n't fit in , and he took out his temper on smaller boys , chasing people around the playground . \" When Ian got angry , it was like he changed from one person to another . One minute he was human , the next he was a monster like the Incredible Hulk . Not a nice lad to know . \" With few male friends , the teenage Ian Huntley sought out the company of girls . Marriage He was described as \" a charmer \" , but after he left school at 16 , a more disturbing picture began to emerge . He drifted around North East Lincolnshire , changing address every few months . In December 1994 , Huntley , then 20 , met 18 - year - old Claire Evans . They embarked on a whirlwind romance and he asked her to marry him . She agreed but within weeks of the wedding , the marriage was over and she moved out . Relatives claim that Huntley had become violent and abusive towards her . To Huntley 's anger , she began a relationship with his brother , Wayne , whom she later married . Huntley then had a succession of young girlfriends who described him as having violent tendencies . ' Punched in stomach ' One teenage girlfriend , Becky Bartlett , recalled how she lived with him briefly until a violent incident ended the relationship . \" I thought I was pregnant and I told him , and he just punched me in the stomach . I fell on the bed and I just said ' What did you do that for ? ' \" He just said ' I do n't want no kids ' . That 's when I realised that I should n't really have been with him . \" Others who came into contact with Huntley became uneasy about his behaviour . In Grimsby , he stayed for several weeks in the house of Louise de Gruchy . \" He was charming , well - mannered and polite , but strange , \" she recalls . \" There was just something about him that made you think he was not quite right , \" she recalls . Louise says she told Huntley she did not approve of him seeing a 14- year - old schoolgirl . The relationship fizzled out , but then there was another incident . \" I had a friend sleeping over ; she was 15 . When I woke up in the morning I found them in bed together , so I had a few words to say to them both . \" It was either the next day , or a couple of days later , I came home and he 'd moved out . He was strange , I 'd say manipulative , especially with the young girls . \" Uneasy She was not the only woman disturbed by Ian Huntley . Sue Penney , his employer in Grimsby , says his fellow workers disliked him . \" He was very deep and moody , \" she says . \" The way he would look at you made you feel very uneasy . It was not a normal friendly face . Women in particular felt really uncomfortable with him . \" If you asked him questions about himself , he 'd just change the subject and go very quiet and then talk about something completely different . \" But there were other things that bothered her , like the way Huntley treated his girlfriend , who was about 16 or 17 . \" It was about him controlling her . He would just sort of have to look at her and she would know he was mad with her , and just clam up . \" And factory workers told stories about Huntley and even younger girls . \" We heard rumours of underage sex with 12 and 13 - year - old girls , \" says Sue . \" That , and the way the girls felt around him , was enough for us to get rid of him . \" It has now emerged that Huntley had faced four allegations of underage sexual relations and one of sexual assault when he lived in Grimsby in the late 1990s . These claims never led to a prosecution . Rape allegation In 1998 , Ian Huntley found himself accused of rape . The case against him was eventually dropped , but he was concerned that detectives in Soham would find out . In fact Humberside Police say they had ten contacts with Huntley over eight offences allegedly committed by him . This included the rape claim , and one arrest for failure to appear in court . Huntley told Maxine Carr he feared police would \" fit him up \" for the murders of Holly and Jessica . In Scunthorpe , the couple lived together at a flat in West Street , close to a hairdressing salon . Stylist Marie Wilson remembers him being \" a bit weird \" , and says the other staff did not like him . \" It was his general mannerisms , \" she recalls . \" There was just something about him that made them feel uncomfortable . They said they would be passing him in the street , and he 'd be leering at them . \" Pattern of behaviour After moving to Soham , Huntley and Carr used to visit a pub called the Black Horse at Littleport , a few miles outside the village . On Sunday , one week after the two girls went missing , they came in as usual , telling the landlord they wanted to get away from the media . \" Ian was playing pool , talking to the lads about football , \" says Brian Kelly . \" I ca n't believe somebody could do that , walk into a pub , and be so cool . I just ca n't believe it . \" Yet the Old Bailey heard this was part of a pattern of behaviour by a man who was able to kill two ten-year- old girls , and then get on with his life as if nothing had happened . Ian Huntley felt no guilt and no remorse over the deaths of Holly and Jessica . His sole concern was to avoid suspicion and remain a free man .

But even the government acknowledges that Mehanna never translated anything at the direct behest of al - Qaida operatives \u2014 which is why it 's rather surprising that the government successfully prosecuted him for providing \u201c material support \u201d to a terrorist organization and sentenced him to 210 months in prison . Everybody agrees that Mehanna supported al - Qaida 's cause ; At Tibyan is a fairly popular terrorist forum , and Mehanna translated its content with the clear intention of swaying opinion toward the jihadist cause . But translating , publishing , and praising ideological texts , no matter how morally vile , is generally considered to be a basic free speech activity . Everyone knows that the First Amendment protects translations of Mein Kampf . Why did Mehanna 's translation of jihadist hosannas land him behind bars ? That 's the question Mehanna is asking the Supreme Court , which will decide whether to take his case later in September . If the justices do agree to review Mehanna 's conviction , it 'll be wading into a constitutional controversy at once timeless and novel . The court has long recognized that cheerleading for terrorism may eventually cross the line from free speech to a criminal act . But the Internet 's ability to spread ideas and connect like - minded people may now force the justices to reconsider that boundary . And if the court lets Mehanna 's conviction stand , it may wind up drawing the line dangerously close to the kind of Internet activity some of us engage in without a second thought . The Supreme Court has been grappling with the question of dangerous speech for as long as America has been attempting to suppress dissent in the name of national security \u2014 that is , pretty much forever . For our first century or so , nobody thought that criminalizing anti-American speech raised a real First Amendment concern . But in a 1919 case called Abrams v. United States , Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , joined by Justice Louis Brandeis , cracked the orthodoxy wide open , issuing a stunning dissent from the conviction of a revolutionary anarchist who advocated a violent overthrow of the U.S. government . Holmes described a constitutional command to tolerate anti-government speech , explaining that censorship of \u201c opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death \u201d is unacceptable unless those opinions \u201c imminently threaten \u201d the country 's safety . Today , Holmes ' view is more or less the law . But that has n't kept Congress from passing censorship laws on the theory that a certain group 's speech qualifies as a clear and present danger to the country . The latest attempt , a post - 9/11 anti-terrorism law , made it illegal for anyone to \u201c knowingly \u201d provide \u201c material support or resources \u201d to a foreign terrorist organization , even for nonviolent purposes . What if that material support comes in the form of otherwise protected speech ? That 's OK , said the Supreme Court in a 2010 called Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project \u2014 so long as the terrorist sympathizer truly \u201c coordinated \u201d with a terrorist organization . This \u201c coordination \u201d standard appears nowhere in the law itself ; the court wrote it in , since , without it , the statute would be a hopelessly unconstitutional suppression of speech . But where , exactly , does free speech end and unlawful terrorist coordination begin ? We 'll save that question for another day , the court wrote , when a \u201c concrete fact situation \u201d presents itself . Mehanna is hoping the court will view his prosecution as precisely the kind of \u201c concrete fact situation \u201d it prognosticated in 2010 . But even if the justices vote to take his case , it 's no sure thing that they 'll grant him First Amendment protection . There 's little doubt that Mehanna wanted to help terrorists ; it seems the only thing that stopped him was his own utter fecklessness . He flew to the Middle East to join a terrorist training camp but could n't find any ; he was intent on killing American troops stationed in Iraq but got cold feet once he arrived in Fallujah . When an actual al - Qaida associate finally got in touch in Mehanna asking him to translate a video , Mehanna seems to have overlooked the email ; when the associate followed up six months later , Mehanna was puzzled , responding , \u201c what do u mean . \u201d The government 's case , then , is built on the tenuous theory that by associating with al - Qaida associates and promoting jihadist speech , Mehanna provided coordinated material support to terrorists . There is , however , a problem with this theory : It 's exactly what the government promised it would n't do in Humanitarian Law Project . During oral arguments for that case , then - Solicitor General Elena Kagan told Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Anthony Kennedy that Americans could \u201c absolutely \u201d still meet and communicate with terrorists , and advocate for their causes . The one activity the law forbade , Kagan agreed , was \u201c communicat [ ing ] advice \u201d to terrorists \u201c on how to pursue their goals . \u201d Why is this distinction between \u201c advocacy \u201d and \u201c communication \u201d important ? Because without it , we may accidentally become a nation of criminal terrorist sympathizers . The Internet fosters association and amplifies advocacy . Under the government 's revised interpretation of the law , an American who uses the Web to defend terrorist groups might find herself facing federal prosecution . This scenario might seem far-fetched \u2014 but in reality , it 's chillingly plausible . Imagine an American driven to sympathize with Hamas , a designated foreign terrorist organization , after seeing images of brutality in Gaza . She posts Facebook statuses supporting Hamas ' mission to \u201c free Gaza \u201d and converses with other Hamas supporters \u2014 including a few associates of the organization \u2014 on a blog . Eventually , she begins translating Hamas ' statements and posting them online at the behest of her newfound comrades . All of this activity would seem to be a constitutionally protected form of speech and association . But under the government current theory , our Hamas sympathizer is , in fact , a criminal who has \u201c coordinated \u201d with terrorists to provide them with \u201c material support . \u201d Mehanna hopes tech - flavored hypotheticals like these will convince the Supreme Court that the law ( as the government construes it ) is an infringement on his free speech rights . He 's also arguing that this interpretation of the law in unconstitutionally vague \u2014 that is , its contours are so blurry that Mehanna could n't have known his actions were criminal . It 'll be a close call . The justices have a mixed record in applying legal principles to new technology ; sometimes , they do a decent job ; other times , they get confused about GPS trackers and tiny constables . But for a dispute that 's fundamentally about speech on the Internet , Mehanna 's case is n't really that much different from the one the court grappled with back in 1919 .

In 1919 , a few hundred people might read your calls to action ; today , a few billion could . That prospect might sound scary \u2014 but scariness is n't usually a reason to send a man to prison for his advocacy . With Mehanna , the government has functionally admitted that it does n't think terrorist sympathizers deserve free speech rights .

Kai and Sae get back together . Reviewer 's Thoughts : I loved this show and I have watched it many times . Although I am not a recent college graduate it is still easy to identify with these characters . In general all 5 main characters have some type of dialogue that reflects their uncertainness of their future , their wonderings if their choices were correct and the things that typically impact ones decision - making processes . The characters are facing an important turning point in their lives . They need to decide what kind of life they want to live and are a little scared to make such an important decision . Their \u00e2 Orange Society\u00e2 friendship is very supportive and comforting to each of it 's members . Kai is especially helpful for Sae to cope with her hearing loss . In her frustration she throws tantrums , becomes upset , and drowns herself in pity . Each time she does that Kai is there to calmly encourage her , advise her how to navigate her difficulties . It is through their discussions that you see the self - doubt and timid -ness that all 20 something experience . Sae 's character was very complex because she was so insecure with her relationships and her feelings of inadequacies , which led to be abrasive . Some of the most touching parts were the scenes where Kai would scold Sae for being impolite . I also enjoyed watching Shohei and Akane 's relationship develop . In the beginning you can see that Shohei was n't a bad kind of guy but you get a sense that he felt that was what he needed to do be successful and take care of his sister . Akane character was a girl next- door kind of personality . I was impressed with her quiet strength . I consider this a must see of Japanese Dramas .

Kai and Sae get back together . Reviewer 's Thoughts : I loved this show and I have watched it many times . Although I am not a recent college graduate it is still easy to identify with these characters . In general all 5 main characters have some type of dialogue that reflects their uncertainness of their future , their wonderings if their choices were correct and the things that typically impact ones decision - making processes . The characters are facing an important turning point in their lives . They need to decide what kind of life they want to live and are a little scared to make such an important decision . Their \u00e2 Orange Society\u00e2 friendship is very supportive and comforting to each of it 's members . Kai is especially helpful for Sae to cope with her hearing loss . In her frustration she throws tantrums , becomes upset , and drowns herself in pity . Each time she does that Kai is there to calmly encourage her , advise her how to navigate her difficulties . It is through their discussions that you see the self - doubt and timid -ness that all 20 something experience . Sae 's character was very complex because she was so insecure with her relationships and her feelings of inadequacies , which led to be abrasive . Some of the most touching parts were the scenes where Kai would scold Sae for being impolite . I also enjoyed watching Shohei and Akane 's relationship develop . In the beginning you can see that Shohei was n't a bad kind of guy but you get a sense that he felt that was what he needed to do be successful and take care of his sister . Akane character was a girl next- door kind of personality . I was impressed with her quiet strength . I consider this a must see of Japanese Dramas .

This story originally appeared in July and in the 2018 Body Issue . Subscribe to ESPN The Magazine today ! Behind the scenes at the Senior Bowl weigh - in , the moment of truth is at hand . It 's just after dawn on a Tuesday in late January , and already the massive South Exhibit Hall of the Mobile Convention Center in Alabama is packed with NFL personnel types , clipboards at the ready . Meanwhile , on the other side of the pageant - style stage , players are pacing around in the dark , in various stages of undress , when Titans scout Mike Boni pokes his head through the curtains to offer instructions about one of the most bizarre yet necessary events in sports . As he speaks , the players try not to stare at the shiny metal carpenter 's square in Boni 's right hand . But they know that this simple tool Boni picked up for $ 6.99 at an Ace Hardware has measured the height of every NFL prospect since 2012 -- and , unlike the players , it never lies . To be fair , yes , Boni has turned the carpenter 's square on himself . \" Six - two , \" he blurts proudly . But then , before the words have even left his mouth , Boni holds up a finger to wait , catching even himself in the kind of ubiquitous fib that this event was meant to combat . OK , well , he 's not exactly 6 - foot - 2 , he confesses . He 's \" six oh one seven , \" scout -speak for 6 - foot - 1 , which amounts to a difference of about half the thickness of your phone . Boni is a stickler . And when it comes to extracting the truth from elite athletes about their height and weight , well , you have to be . In the hyper-data era of sports , we are hurtling toward absolute precision and mathematical certainty , where we can gleefully quantify grand mysteries such as a third - string fullback 's fourth - quarter red zone yards after contact in temperatures above and below 55 degrees . Yet it is something of a delightful , rebellious quirk that the first critical bit of data we learn about elite athletes -- their height and weight -- is still , more often than not , a complete and utter fabrication . \" The secret little sin in sports nobody ever talks about , \" says the legit 6 - 4 Rebecca Lobo , a 2017 inductee into the Basketball Hall of Fame and an ESPN analyst . \" In sports , intimidation can be just as important as truth . If a little lie gives you that little extra mental edge , then it 's worth it . That 's the reason for all the fibbing -- it works . \" Lying , after all , is a highly effective , innate part of the human condition that comes as easily , and almost as often , as breathing . And exaggerating our stature , one of the most common fibs of all , has been practically programmed into our brains by millions of years of evolution and sociology that reinforce the notion that taller , larger people are superior . That programming is exponentially more powerful in sports , where athletes often stretch the truth to fight back against ridiculous notions of ideal body prototypes , which exclude , say , NFL quarterbacks under 6 feet or diminutive hockey wingers . Take Martin St. Louis , a right winger who retired in 2015 after 16 seasons and 391 goals and is a lock for the Hockey ( and heightening ) Hall of Fame . Starting at Vermont and throughout his NHL career , St. Louis says he would get officially measured at 5 - 7 every year at his team physical . And every year before the season opener , he 'd glance at the game program and see himself listed at 5 - 9 . \" I do n't know if it was me seeing myself as being bigger than my actual number or if , at the time , in a big man 's game , I just had a better chance at making it as a 5 - 9 player than at 5 - 7 1/2 , \" he says . \" Everyone 's trying to get an edge , and sometimes it 's with the tape measure . It 's a game of inches , right ? \" It 's hard to judge athletes too harshly for heightening when their deceits are often encouraged and magnified by what sociologists call an ecology of enablers -- parents , coaches , recruiters , trainers , agents , media -- who benefit just as much from the tall tales . Which means almost every single person in sports is either lying about his or her height or lying about the lying . \" It 's very peculiar and pathological , \" says David Smith , a philosophy professor at the University of New England and the author of Why We Lie . \" In sports it becomes an arms race where if everyone 's exaggerating , you kind of have to do it too just to keep up . \" Indeed , fibbing about height and weight is such a common , widespread and time - honored tradition in sports that it barely even registers as deception anymore . Most people dismiss it like a harmless embellishment on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 , a vestige of a simpler , less calculated time in sports . \" Everybody in the world thinks they 're taller than they are , \" Boni says . \" So even with all that [ advanced analytics and data ] , I do n't think we 'll get to the point where athletes will ever start telling the full truth , because this is a human nature thing more than a football thing . \" Elite athletes , and football players in particular , have turned manipulating their anthropometrics into an art form . Behind the stage at the Senior Bowl , empty gallon jugs of water are everywhere , guzzled by players trying to inflate their weight and perhaps their draft status . Several players are also doing last - second neck and back exercises because , according to Senior Bowl lore , that 's how Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson managed to taffy -stretch himself above 5 - 10 at this event in 2012 . Boni and his fellow scouts are pretty sure they 've seen it all : weights \" hidden \" in spandex shorts ; orthotics in socks ; even artificially enhanced man buns . And despite all his instructions and warnings , the first two players step onstage wearing flip-flops . \" Come on , guys , \" Boni says with a sigh . Later he adds , \" Flip -flops ... that was a new one , even for me . \" Boni has developed an intricate routine to safeguard every measurement . Players must place their heels together and their feet in a V , which makes it difficult to rise up on the toes or boost themselves off the wall . While talking guys through the process with the calm tone of a yoga instructor , Boni manipulates their head and chin into position . They fight him on this because it feels counterintuitive , but a level chin actually raises the crown of your head . And that 's where Boni places his trusty carpenter 's square . He pushes it like a lever back toward the chart on the wall and as soon as it goes flush , Boni barks out the player 's official height down to an eighth of an inch . For example , even though No. 1 draft pick Baker Mayfield is listed in the Oklahoma football program ( and on NFL.com ) as 6 - 1 , his true height is 6003 , or 6 - 0 . Each time Boni speaks , the sea of scouts nods in cultish unison to inscribe the data or breathlessly whisper it into tiny hand - held devices . Players , though , rarely like what they hear . Boni says 99 percent end up shorter than their program height . A few years ago , a wide receiver from the SEC was infuriated with Boni after he was informed he was n't actually 6 - 5 but instead barely 6 - 3 . After guaranteeing everyone he 'd hit 72 inches back in 2014 , Johnny Manziel looked physically ill when Boni announced him at 5116 ( 5 - 11 \u00be ) . \" And he was not happy about it , \" Boni says . \" I always hear guys say , ' Wait , but I 've been 6 - 3 my whole life . ' Well , you might have been listed in media guides as 6 - 3 your whole life , but in the real world , sorry , you 're 6 - 1 . \" This year , on the 56 - man Senior Bowl North roster alone , 70 percent of the players are caught stretching the truth by more than half an inch in height or more than 5 pounds in weight . Almost 40 percent have lied by an inch or more in height and 10 pounds or more in weight . The fudging in Mobile is consistent with the sleight of hand going on across the sports landscape . In 2012 , college hoops blog Run the Floor analyzed the data at the predraft Portsmouth Invitational Tournament and found that of the 62 players measured , 76 percent were at least an inch shorter than they claimed . Brett Brungardt , the founder of Seattle - based Basic Athletic Measurement , which collects anthropometrics for the NBA 's prospects and 16 other sports , says the heightening in basketball is so rampant that as soon as he sets up his equipment , \" players literally run out of the gym . \" Not even the tallest , richest athletes on earth are immune to the universal desire to feel bigger . In 2016 , The Wall Street Journal helped expose just how laughable the program heights can be in the NBA . Really , just pick a name of any \" big \" man in the league . Kevin Love ? Dwight Howard ? They 're both 2 inches shorter than they claim . In 2015 , current Rockets forward Tarik Black was officially 6 - 11 . The next season , he mysteriously shrank to 6 - 9 . A college strength and conditioning coach for 25 years , Brungardt was so frustrated in 2008 by the lack of standard measurements in sports that he quit his job at the University of Washington to start BAM . One of his favorite players at UW was future NBA All - Star Nate Robinson , listed at 5 - 9 . \" On his very best day , if we stretched Nate and hung him upside down and put him in space gravity , he might have been 5 - 7 -- maybe , \" Brungardt says . ( Robinson 's agent did n't respond to a request for comment . ) \" Nate was one of the all - time greatest all - around athletes . So much heart and ability . But man , he still wanted to be 5 - 9 in that program so bad for some reason . \" Dallas guard J.J. Barea , who admits to being 5 - 10 on a good day , has to occasionally stop himself from giggling when he 's announced before games as being 6 feet \" because me and about 20,000 other people in the arena knew that was a lie , \" he told the Journal . The paper also uncovered the fact that 6 - 11 NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant is actually lying in reverse , shortening himself to 6 - 9 because he wants to be perceived as a small forward , not a power forward . It 's a trick he said he learned from Kevin Garnett . In perhaps the truest statement ever spoken about lying in sports , Durant admitted that when he 's in basketball circles , he tells everyone he 's 6 - 9 . And when he 's talking to women ? \" I 'm 7 feet , \" he says . Sports anthropometrics judge men by the unrealistic body standards we normally impose on women . Nancy Blaker , a professor in New Zealand who studies the connection between physical size and social status , has proved that men are far more likely than women to exaggerate their stature , mainly because the benefits of being perceived as bigger are typically greater for men . That seems to hold true in athletics as well . Rather than lie , short female athletes tend to just stand tall . Jocelyne Lamoureux - Davidson , the shootout hero of the gold - medal - winning U.S. Olympic hockey team , puts it this way : \" I am what I am , and adding an inch or 10 pounds is n't going to make me more or less of an opponent . \" There 's still plenty of fibbing going on in women 's sports , though , if you know where to look . Former Mississippi State guard Morgan William , the star of the 2017 Final Four who ended UConn 's 111 - game winning streak with a game - winning shot over 5 - 11 Gabby Williams , is still listed at 5 - 5 . But when ESPN 's Holly Rowe , who is 5 - 3 , recently pressed William on her height , she included this genius , ironclad disclaimer for William : Not what it says in the program , not what you think in your dreams , but what the number says in black and white on the chart when you go to the doctor 's office . \" OK , yeah , I 'm 5 - foot - 3 , \" William relented . \" And a half ! \" Rowe and Lobo are also pretty sure that two - time WNBA MVP Candace Parker and a handful of other players are taller than their program heights . ( Parker , when asked via text whether she was taller than 6 - 4 , did not respond . ) \" The truth is important , \" Lobo says , \" but pretty much everyone knows the first measurement an athlete gives you is a lie . The number in the program seems to reflect the version of themselves that athletes wished they were . \" In 2012 , before the WTA did away with publishing tennis players ' weights in their tour bios , Ben Rothenberg , in a piece for Slate , realized that at 6 - 2 and 130 pounds , Maria Sharapova would almost have the BMI of a Barbie Doll . \" This is all probably because of your standard stereotype about women wanting to be smaller , \" says Olympic hockey team captain Meghan Duggan . \" Which I do n't necessarily agree with . Powerful , strong female athletes are incredible role models . \" Duggan admits to rounding up less than half an inch to her listed height of 5 - 10 simply because \" those double digits just look nicer . \" She is a part of a grand old tradition of heightening in hockey . In the NHL , rule changes have turned the game 's emphasis from power and size to speed and agility , creating even less incentive to lie . Yet so many people doubt Patrick Kane 's listed height of 5 - 11 that Google autocorrects inquiries on this subject directly to : How tall is Patrick Kane really . Setting up for a photo op at the White House in 2016 , Sidney Crosby tried to join the \" tall line \" before a teammate told him to head \" a couple of rows that way , Sid . \" Crosby slumped away mumbling his program height . \" I 'm 5 - 11 , boys , I 'm 5 - 11 . \" Alex Ovechkin still claims to be the same size ( 6 - 3 ) as his countryman Evgeni Malkin even though he regularly ends up staring directly into Malkin 's chin when they meet on the ice . Last fall , when informed that the Capitals had listed him at 239 pounds in their training camp roster , Ovi chuckled and said \" 239 ? 259 . \" The Caps responded by doubling down and listing him as 235 in the media guide -- a number that really should be adjusted to 279.5 to account for Ovi 's newest appendage , the Stanley Cup . In Montreal , the Canadiens ' website features a video quiz called \" Who Knows You Best ? \" which pits teammates against one another . In an episode from 2014 , winger Brendan Gallagher ( listed at 5 - 9 ) asks teammate Alex Galchenyuk , \" How tall am I ? \" The first thing Galchenyuk clarifies ? The golden rule when inquiring about an elite athlete 's height : \" NHL . com or real life ? \" Real life , Gallagher says . \" Five ten point four , \" Galchenyuk guesses . \" Generous , but no , 5 - 8 \u00bd , \" Gallagher admits with a slight wince . Halfway through the Senior Bowl weigh - in , the same kind of pained look unfurls across the face of Michigan linebacker Mike McCray . Listed at 6 - 4 his entire college career , McCray does a double take when Boni announces his actual height as barely 6 - 1 . It 's the biggest fib by a linebacker anyone has heard since , well , since the year before , when Michigan linebacker Jabrill Peppers turned out to be 5 - 10 , more than 2 inches shorter than the Wolverines claimed . When asked to explain the discrepancies , Michigan spokesman David Ablauf concluded that the rest of the world must be off by 3 inches . \" We use real measurements to determine these numbers coming from our medical and strength staffs , \" Ablauf wrote in an email . \" Also , we change heights and weights once a year in the fall to reflect changes made by lifting programs , nutritional adjustments and natural body changes for 18 - to 22 - year - old young men . \" McCray 's measurement inspires more than a few eye rolls in the audience , especially among those who have ever endured one of Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 's sermons about the importance of honesty . \" You will have choices to make where a dishonest edge can be gained , \" Harbaugh said during a 2015 commencement speech at Coronado High School in California . \" And whatever gain is made will be undermined sometime down the road . As our dad told us flat out , never lie , it wo n't be worth it . \" In sports , that might be the biggest lie of all . When McCray first stepped on campus in Ann Arbor , he was simply told : \" You 're 6 - 4 . \" \" I 'm not sure who decided I was 6 - 4 , \" he says , \" but I ca n't control what they put in the program . \" McCray asked several times to have his height corrected , only to be told , \" It is what it is . \" Over time , though , he grew to enjoy being thought of as 6 - 4 and even convinced himself it was an acceptable embellishment because in his heart he knew he was taller than his dad , Mike McCray Sr. , a linebacker and captain on the 1984 Ohio State team who was listed on the Buckeyes ' roster at 6 - 3 . The only problem ? Now an assistant high school principal in Ohio , Mike Sr. admits that he 's -- wait for it -- only 6 - 1 in real life . \" When I have my cleats and helmet on and I 'm feeling good , I do feel taller than I am , \" Mike Jr. says after his first Senior Bowl practice . \" What else can I say ? I honestly do n't know what I 'm going to say , but I 'm sure teams will have questions about it . \" Less than five weeks later , a duly chastened McCray found out exactly how much the NFL worries about this kind of blatant heightening when he reported to the NFL combine in Indianapolis . Terrified that he had messed up his draft status , the first thing McCray did after checking in was look up his new official draft bio . After a few anxious clicks , there it was , in big digits right at the top of the page , his new NFL - approved authentic height : 6 -4.","annotations":[{"text":"J.J.

In the hyper-data era of sports , we are hurtling toward absolute precision and mathematical certainty , where we can gleefully quantify grand mysteries such as a third - string fullback 's fourth - quarter red zone yards after contact in temperatures above and below 55 degrees . Yet it is something of a delightful , rebellious quirk that the first critical bit of data we learn about elite athletes -- their height and weight -- is still , more often than not , a complete and utter fabrication . \" The secret little sin in sports nobody ever talks about , \" says the legit 6 - 4 Rebecca Lobo , a 2017 inductee into the Basketball Hall of Fame and an ESPN analyst . \" In sports , intimidation can be just as important as truth . If a little lie gives you that little extra mental edge , then it 's worth it . That 's the reason for all the fibbing -- it works . \" Lying , after all , is a highly effective , innate part of the human condition that comes as easily , and almost as often , as breathing . And exaggerating our stature , one of the most common fibs of all , has been practically programmed into our brains by millions of years of evolution and sociology that reinforce the notion that taller , larger people are superior . That programming is exponentially more powerful in sports , where athletes often stretch the truth to fight back against ridiculous notions of ideal body prototypes , which exclude , say , NFL quarterbacks under 6 feet or diminutive hockey wingers . Take Martin St. Louis , a right winger who retired in 2015 after 16 seasons and 391 goals and is a lock for the Hockey ( and heightening ) Hall of Fame . Starting at Vermont and throughout his NHL career , St. Louis says he would get officially measured at 5 - 7 every year at his team physical . And every year before the season opener , he 'd glance at the game program and see himself listed at 5 - 9 . \" I do n't know if it was me seeing myself as being bigger than my actual number or if , at the time , in a big man 's game , I just had a better chance at making it as a 5 - 9 player than at 5 - 7 1/2 , \" he says . \" Everyone 's trying to get an edge , and sometimes it 's with the tape measure . It 's a game of inches , right ? \" It 's hard to judge athletes too harshly for heightening when their deceits are often encouraged and magnified by what sociologists call an ecology of enablers -- parents , coaches , recruiters , trainers , agents , media -- who benefit just as much from the tall tales . Which means almost every single person in sports is either lying about his or her height or lying about the lying . \" It 's very peculiar and pathological , \" says David Smith , a philosophy professor at the University of New England and the author of Why We Lie . \" In sports it becomes an arms race where if everyone 's exaggerating , you kind of have to do it too just to keep up . \" Indeed , fibbing about height and weight is such a common , widespread and time - honored tradition in sports that it barely even registers as deception anymore . Most people dismiss it like a harmless embellishment on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 , a vestige of a simpler , less calculated time in sports . \" Everybody in the world thinks they 're taller than they are , \" Boni says . \" So even with all that [ advanced analytics and data ] , I do n't think we 'll get to the point where athletes will ever start telling the full truth , because this is a human nature thing more than a football thing . \" Elite athletes , and football players in particular , have turned manipulating their anthropometrics into an art form . Behind the stage at the Senior Bowl , empty gallon jugs of water are everywhere , guzzled by players trying to inflate their weight and perhaps their draft status . Several players are also doing last - second neck and back exercises because , according to Senior Bowl lore , that 's how Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson managed to taffy -stretch himself above 5 - 10 at this event in 2012 . Boni and his fellow scouts are pretty sure they 've seen it all : weights \" hidden \" in spandex shorts ; orthotics in socks ; even artificially enhanced man buns . And despite all his instructions and warnings , the first two players step onstage wearing flip-flops . \" Come on , guys , \" Boni says with a sigh . Later he adds , \" Flip -flops ... that was a new one , even for me . \" Boni has developed an intricate routine to safeguard every measurement . Players must place their heels together and their feet in a V , which makes it difficult to rise up on the toes or boost themselves off the wall . While talking guys through the process with the calm tone of a yoga instructor , Boni manipulates their head and chin into position . They fight him on this because it feels counterintuitive , but a level chin actually raises the crown of your head . And that 's where Boni places his trusty carpenter 's square . He pushes it like a lever back toward the chart on the wall and as soon as it goes flush , Boni barks out the player 's official height down to an eighth of an inch . For example , even though No. 1 draft pick Baker Mayfield is listed in the Oklahoma football program ( and on NFL.com ) as 6 - 1 , his true height is 6003 , or 6 - 0 . Each time Boni speaks , the sea of scouts nods in cultish unison to inscribe the data or breathlessly whisper it into tiny hand - held devices . Players , though , rarely like what they hear . Boni says 99 percent end up shorter than their program height . A few years ago , a wide receiver from the SEC was infuriated with Boni after he was informed he was n't actually 6 - 5 but instead barely 6 - 3 . After guaranteeing everyone he 'd hit 72 inches back in 2014 , Johnny Manziel looked physically ill when Boni announced him at 5116 ( 5 - 11 \u00be ) . \" And he was not happy about it , \" Boni says . \" I always hear guys say , ' Wait , but I 've been 6 - 3 my whole life . ' Well , you might have been listed in media guides as 6 - 3 your whole life , but in the real world , sorry , you 're 6 - 1 . \" This year , on the 56 - man Senior Bowl North roster alone , 70 percent of the players are caught stretching the truth by more than half an inch in height or more than 5 pounds in weight . Almost 40 percent have lied by an inch or more in height and 10 pounds or more in weight . The fudging in Mobile is consistent with the sleight of hand going on across the sports landscape . In 2012 , college hoops blog Run the Floor analyzed the data at the predraft Portsmouth Invitational Tournament and found that of the 62 players measured , 76 percent were at least an inch shorter than they claimed . Brett Brungardt , the founder of Seattle - based Basic Athletic Measurement , which collects anthropometrics for the NBA 's prospects and 16 other sports , says the heightening in basketball is so rampant that as soon as he sets up his equipment , \" players literally run out of the gym . \" Not even the tallest , richest athletes on earth are immune to the universal desire to feel bigger . In 2016 , The Wall Street Journal helped expose just how laughable the program heights can be in the NBA . Really , just pick a name of any \" big \" man in the league . Kevin Love ? Dwight Howard ? They 're both 2 inches shorter than they claim . In 2015 , current Rockets forward Tarik Black was officially 6 - 11 . The next season , he mysteriously shrank to 6 - 9 . A college strength and conditioning coach for 25 years , Brungardt was so frustrated in 2008 by the lack of standard measurements in sports that he quit his job at the University of Washington to start BAM . One of his favorite players at UW was future NBA All - Star Nate Robinson , listed at 5 - 9 . \" On his very best day , if we stretched Nate and hung him upside down and put him in space gravity , he might have been 5 - 7 -- maybe , \" Brungardt says . ( Robinson 's agent did n't respond to a request for comment . ) \" Nate was one of the all - time greatest all - around athletes . So much heart and ability . But man , he still wanted to be 5 - 9 in that program so bad for some reason . \" Dallas guard J.J. Barea , who admits to being 5 - 10 on a good day , has to occasionally stop himself from giggling when he 's announced before games as being 6 feet \" because me and about 20,000 other people in the arena knew that was a lie , \" he told the Journal . The paper also uncovered the fact that 6 - 11 NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant is actually lying in reverse , shortening himself to 6 - 9 because he wants to be perceived as a small forward , not a power forward . It 's a trick he said he learned from Kevin Garnett . In perhaps the truest statement ever spoken about lying in sports , Durant admitted that when he 's in basketball circles , he tells everyone he 's 6 - 9 . And when he 's talking to women ? \" I 'm 7 feet , \" he says . Sports anthropometrics judge men by the unrealistic body standards we normally impose on women . Nancy Blaker , a professor in New Zealand who studies the connection between physical size and social status , has proved that men are far more likely than women to exaggerate their stature , mainly because the benefits of being perceived as bigger are typically greater for men . That seems to hold true in athletics as well . Rather than lie , short female athletes tend to just stand tall . Jocelyne Lamoureux - Davidson , the shootout hero of the gold - medal - winning U.S. Olympic hockey team , puts it this way : \" I am what I am , and adding an inch or 10 pounds is n't going to make me more or less of an opponent . \" There 's still plenty of fibbing going on in women 's sports , though , if you know where to look . Former Mississippi State guard Morgan William , the star of the 2017 Final Four who ended UConn 's 111 - game winning streak with a game - winning shot over 5 - 11 Gabby Williams , is still listed at 5 - 5 . But when ESPN 's Holly Rowe , who is 5 - 3 , recently pressed William on her height , she included this genius , ironclad disclaimer for William : Not what it says in the program , not what you think in your dreams , but what the number says in black and white on the chart when you go to the doctor 's office . \" OK , yeah , I 'm 5 - foot - 3 , \" William relented . \" And a half ! \" Rowe and Lobo are also pretty sure that two - time WNBA MVP Candace Parker and a handful of other players are taller than their program heights . ( Parker , when asked via text whether she was taller than 6 - 4 , did not respond . ) \" The truth is important , \" Lobo says , \" but pretty much everyone knows the first measurement an athlete gives you is a lie . The number in the program seems to reflect the version of themselves that athletes wished they were . \" In 2012 , before the WTA did away with publishing tennis players ' weights in their tour bios , Ben Rothenberg , in a piece for Slate , realized that at 6 - 2 and 130 pounds , Maria Sharapova would almost have the BMI of a Barbie Doll . \" This is all probably because of your standard stereotype about women wanting to be smaller , \" says Olympic hockey team captain Meghan Duggan . \" Which I do n't necessarily agree with . Powerful , strong female athletes are incredible role models . \" Duggan admits to rounding up less than half an inch to her listed height of 5 - 10 simply because \" those double digits just look nicer . \" She is a part of a grand old tradition of heightening in hockey . In the NHL , rule changes have turned the game 's emphasis from power and size to speed and agility , creating even less incentive to lie . Yet so many people doubt Patrick Kane 's listed height of 5 - 11 that Google autocorrects inquiries on this subject directly to : How tall is Patrick Kane really . Setting up for a photo op at the White House in 2016 , Sidney Crosby tried to join the \" tall line \" before a teammate told him to head \" a couple of rows that way , Sid . \" Crosby slumped away mumbling his program height . \" I 'm 5 - 11 , boys , I 'm 5 - 11 . \" Alex Ovechkin still claims to be the same size ( 6 - 3 ) as his countryman Evgeni Malkin even though he regularly ends up staring directly into Malkin 's chin when they meet on the ice . Last fall , when informed that the Capitals had listed him at 239 pounds in their training camp roster , Ovi chuckled and said \" 239 ? 259 . \" The Caps responded by doubling down and listing him as 235 in the media guide -- a number that really should be adjusted to 279.5 to account for Ovi 's newest appendage , the Stanley Cup . In Montreal , the Canadiens ' website features a video quiz called \" Who Knows You Best ? \" which pits teammates against one another . In an episode from 2014 , winger Brendan Gallagher ( listed at 5 - 9 ) asks teammate Alex Galchenyuk , \" How tall am I ? \" The first thing Galchenyuk clarifies ? The golden rule when inquiring about an elite athlete 's height : \" NHL . com or real life ? \" Real life , Gallagher says . \" Five ten point four , \" Galchenyuk guesses . \" Generous , but no , 5 - 8 \u00bd , \" Gallagher admits with a slight wince . Halfway through the Senior Bowl weigh - in , the same kind of pained look unfurls across the face of Michigan linebacker Mike McCray . Listed at 6 - 4 his entire college career , McCray does a double take when Boni announces his actual height as barely 6 - 1 . It 's the biggest fib by a linebacker anyone has heard since , well , since the year before , when Michigan linebacker Jabrill Peppers turned out to be 5 - 10 , more than 2 inches shorter than the Wolverines claimed . When asked to explain the discrepancies , Michigan spokesman David Ablauf concluded that the rest of the world must be off by 3 inches . \" We use real measurements to determine these numbers coming from our medical and strength staffs , \" Ablauf wrote in an email . \" Also , we change heights and weights once a year in the fall to reflect changes made by lifting programs , nutritional adjustments and natural body changes for 18 - to 22 - year - old young men . \" McCray 's measurement inspires more than a few eye rolls in the audience , especially among those who have ever endured one of Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 's sermons about the importance of honesty . \" You will have choices to make where a dishonest edge can be gained , \" Harbaugh said during a 2015 commencement speech at Coronado High School in California . \" And whatever gain is made will be undermined sometime down the road . As our dad told us flat out , never lie , it wo n't be worth it . \" In sports , that might be the biggest lie of all . When McCray first stepped on campus in Ann Arbor , he was simply told : \" You 're 6 - 4 . \" \" I 'm not sure who decided I was 6 - 4 , \" he says , \" but I ca n't control what they put in the program . \" McCray asked several times to have his height corrected , only to be told , \" It is what it is . \" Over time , though , he grew to enjoy being thought of as 6 - 4 and even convinced himself it was an acceptable embellishment because in his heart he knew he was taller than his dad , Mike McCray Sr. , a linebacker and captain on the 1984 Ohio State team who was listed on the Buckeyes ' roster at 6 - 3 . The only problem ? Now an assistant high school principal in Ohio , Mike Sr. admits that he 's -- wait for it -- only 6 - 1 in real life . \" When I have my cleats and helmet on and I 'm feeling good , I do feel taller than I am , \" Mike Jr. says after his first Senior Bowl practice . \" What else can I say ? I honestly do n't know what I 'm going to say , but I 'm sure teams will have questions about it . \" Less than five weeks later , a duly chastened McCray found out exactly how much the NFL worries about this kind of blatant heightening when he reported to the NFL combine in Indianapolis . Terrified that he had messed up his draft status , the first thing McCray did after checking in was look up his new official draft bio . After a few anxious clicks , there it was , in big digits right at the top of the page , his new NFL - approved authentic height : 6 -4.","annotations":[{"text":"J.J.

When it was easier to get a record deal ? Dom Kennedy : No , because the way it is now causes you to mature , grow and learn . That 's never a bad thing . Labels just want all of the work to be done for them . I know some people from labels that will say something like , \u201c We 're not signing anybody unless they have 10 singles . \u201d But damn - if I have 10 singles out then why would I sign with you ? I 'll be better off selling it myself if that 's the case . AllHipHop.com : No deal in the works for you right now ? Dom Kennedy : None of that ! I 'm just working on my music right now . I 'll be releasing From The Westside With Love Part 2 soon . I released Part 1 last year and that taught me so much about music and myself . I expect this new one to be twice as good as the last one . AllHipHop.com : Has anybody ever told you that you do n't sound like a West Coast artist ? Dom Kennedy : No , but I kind of know what you 're getting at . I 've never had that . I know that my music makes people feel like they 're in L.A. AllHipHop.com : Not even when you go out of town ? Dom Kennedy : If I go out of town , I might hear that I sound different from what they would expect or what they 've previously heard come out of Los Angeles .

It started when journalists attending this month 's Games Media Awards were given the chance to win a PS3 by tweeting about a certain game and including its hashtag in their message . I did n't do it because I felt it was tantamount amount to a sponsored tweet , a form of advertising that the Guardian would not permit , but the fact that some attendees did enter the competition angered a lot of industry watchers . Shortly afterwards , the TV comedian and Eurogamer columnist Robert Florence wrote a damning article calling into question the increasingly close relationship between games journalists and games publishers . Later , certain elements of this scathing diatribe were removed due to complaints made by a writer criticised in the text , and Florence announced that he would no longer be contributing to the site . A fireball of invective and criticism then consumed industry Twitter communications for the next three days . Veteran games writer Stuart Campbell has provided a lengthy timeline of the controversy here , and Robert Florence has written a response to the ensuing Twitter storm on the personal site of John Walker , the editor of PC gaming site , Rock Paper Shotgun . It has , in short , been a difficult and depressing week for games journalism . Accusations and insults have been chucked around and the impartiality of games news sources , which rely heavily on working relationships with publishers , has been brought into question . It seems there are a lot of gamers who believe that games writers are little better than PR shills , trading favourable features and reviews for exclusive access to new titles or juicy freebies . Certainly , as in all forms of entertainment writing , there is close and regular interaction between the journalists and the PR departments of the major content providers . Access to preview and review material is now tightly controlled in this industry . This is partly because the threat of software piracy is ever present and terrifying to companies that have spent millions of dollars and countless working hours to produce Triple A titles . But it 's also because publishers want to engineer an environment in which their products are viewed and discussed favourably . Getting access to new games now involves a relationship between journalist and producer , an understanding that there are two motives being uneasily aligned . We must now consider this properly . The situation is far from perfect , it involves compromise , and yet somehow it is the way entertainment writing works \u2014 especially in the digital era . Some might also draw a distinction here between entertainment writing and news journalism . Very few games writers indulge in the popularly accepted definition of \" journalism \" \u2014 an investigative procedure in which the aim is exposure . As William Randolph Hearst famously wrote , \" news is something somebody does n't want printed ; all else is advertising \" . There is truth in that , of course . But it is also true that entertainment writing is about providing people with the information they want on things they love \u2013 like games , movies and music . The best entertainment writers do more than that \u2013 they analyse and interpret the industry ; they provide context and draw interesting conclusions ; they add depth and soul to the experience of learning about new things . Standards of quality must be the same . However , writing about games can be fraught with difficulties and ambiguities . The increasing cost of producing games has made publishers more guarded and controlling . At the same time , the rise of blogging culture has created a scene in which games journalism and fan content co-exist and combine . There are major debates going on about what journalism should mean in the digital era \u2013 there are arguments that it is mutating into aggregation . Alan Rusbridger 's concept of open journalism suggests that some stories are best explored in partnership with bloggers and other participants outside of mainstream journalism . New frameworks have to be established in this complex arena ; we also need to set clear standards if we work in partnership with bloggers too . I have been a games writer for 18 years , and I have seen many changes in the industry . Today , the job I do involves a lot of communication with the PR departments of major publishers \u2014 so ultimately it is up to myself to consider the boundaries within the context of the Guardian 's overall code . I have thought a lot about my role in the last week while watching this controversy unfold and it has made me ask serious questions . From a personal and professional standpoint , I put the reader first in everything I write or commission \u2013 this is sacrosanct . Games writing might not be as \" important \" as other areas of the news media , but it must be carried out with integrity . I also believe that most PR professionals are helpful individuals , playing and promoting games they adore . However , during a period in which the credibility and impartiality of games writers is being questioned , it 's worth reiterating or spelling out how games are covered on this site , and how I wish to increase transparency . ALL articles resulting from hosted press trips and events will be flagged as such . This practice is common throughout the Guardian and it forms part of the newspaper 's code of conduct . Press trips are a very useful element of games writing and they can result in fantastic and interesting articles \u2014 they allow unique access to the people who develop the content . But it is important for readers to know when something they are reading is the direct result of a trip or event funded by a publisher . I will no longer commission reviews based on publisher - organised events . Often major publishers , rightfully fearful of their game code slipping into the wrong hands and being pirated before release , will hold special review events . This is really specific to the games industry , at least to the best of my knowledge . Journalists are invited to attend and can play forthcoming titles , usually for a couple of days , without distraction . They 're convenient , well - managed and well - intentioned , but they also limit the reviewer 's time with the game and can be perceived by some as a questionable form of collaboration between publisher and critic . Non-attendance at such events will mean that we sometimes provide our reviews later than other sources . I think it 's worth it . The last week has been depressing and damaging , but it should not end with games writers closing ranks and denying that there are ambiguities and dilemmas that must be addressed . The best outcome would be for all of us , including myself , to rethink how we engage with and report on this magnificent and powerful medium .

On 26 October , the BBC published an article headlined , \u201c We 're being pressured into sex by some trans women \u201c , a one - sided story platforming multiple voices that claimed cisgender lesbians are being coerced into sex by trans women . Those interviewed by journalist Caroline Lowbridge included anti-trans pressure groups Get the L Out and LGB Alliance , as well as transphobic porn star Lily Cade , who after the article 's publication posted an extremist manifesto on her blog calling for trans women to be \u201c lynched \u201d . In her story , Lowbridge wrote that she had \u201c contacted several \u2026 high profile trans women who have either written or spoken about sex and relationships \u201d , but claimed : \u201c None of them wanted to speak to me . \u201d Now , a trans porn performer and activist is disputing this claim . Chelsea Poe told PinkNews that she was contacted via Twitter on 2 September 2020 by Lowbridge , who asked if she would do an interview about the \u201c cotton ceiling \u201d . The \u201c cotton ceiling \u201d is a concept coined by porn star and trans activist Drew DeVeaux , and describes the inherent prejudice that many cisgender lesbians have against trans women , reducing them to their genitals , even if they are outwardly accepting . It is not about an individual 's sexual decisions , which should only ever be made freely and with full , enthusiastic consent . PinkNews has seen screenshots of direct messages that verify Poe and Lowbridge discussed an interview on this date . Poe agreed to the interview , despite the toxic discourse that surrounds the term , because she saw the interview as an opportunity to discuss trans inclusion in the porn industry . The next day , she and Lowbridge conducted the interview via Zoom . \u201c I really tried to focus on my industry , because I believe it 's really about the systemic discrimination , rather than me trying to explain anyone else 's sexuality , \u201d she said . \u201c Like the policy that put trans women into a marginalised niche for so many years , that was filled with stereotypes and slurs . \u201c Luckily the industry has become more inclusive over the years due to people like myself pushing for trans inclusion and getting rid of slurs on trans porn sites . \u201d But Lowbridge , she said , kept bringing the conversation back to \u201c questions [ that ] had to do with dating in the real world , in reference to going on dates with people not into trans women \u201d . Poe continued : \u201c I told her that I 'm in a serious , committed relationship . I also disclose being trans on any dating sites because with my job , I 'm naked all over the internet . \u201c She pushed further and I tried to explain that my job is people finding me attractive , so I 've never really had a issue with that \u2026 It feel extremely baiting and like she had the narrative of the article written before we talked . \u201d She added : \u201c I felt so truly gross after it \u2026 I 've had some experience with press interviewing me that was extremely baiting , but this was truly an extreme example . \u201d When the story was finally released , Poe 's first reaction was that she was glad she was n't included for fear of \u201c more targeted harassment from TERFs \u201d , which she has faced online for years . But when Cade 's violent and transphobic \u201c manifesto \u201d was released days later , met with silence from the BBC , she felt it was \u201c important to share what was behind the process \u201d . The claim that trans women did not \u201c want to speak \u201d to Lowbridge is \u201c entirely untrue \u201d , Poe said . \u201c I have the DMs prove to me they talked to me about the piece about the cotton ceiling . \u201c I would love for them to release my video interview , but I 'm assuming it does n't fit their narrative . \u201c I have many sex worker friends who completely ignore the press , it might be my Midwestern politeness to give the press a chance , but this time I was extremely disappointed with everything . \u201d A BBC source has confirmed to PinkNews that Lowbridge interviewed Poe , and said that her contribution was judged not to be relevant to the story . A BBC spokesperson added : \u201c Many people were interviewed ahead of publication and not all were included in the article . That is standard journalistic practice . \u201d Trans porn performer Chelsea Poe says she warned the BBC about sexual assault allegations against Lily Cade Chelsea Poe and Lily Cade crossed paths early in Poe 's porn career . In a podcast on the BBC article , Poe explained that at the beginning of her career she was already landing roles in lesbian and BDSM porn . She met Cade when the porn star and director attended a party hosted by Poe and they followed each other on social media . Poe decided to try her chances and reach out to Cade to see if she could be featured in one of Cade 's films . The request soon spiralled into a public Twitter row over trans inclusion in lesbian porn , which resulted in Poe receiving a pile - on of transphobic abuse which lasted for months , and left her suffering with PTSD . Since then , Cade has ducked out of the porn industry , following a string of accusations of sexual assault by multiple women . She referenced the allegations in one of her blog posts , writing : \u201c If a rapist is someone who is accused in public of sexual misconduct , then I am a rapist \u2026 If a rapist is someone who pays women to have sex that they do n't actually want to have , then I am a goddamn f**king rapist , and your world is run by rapists . \u201d Poe said that she made the BBC aware of the allegations against Cade , but that there was not \u201c much of a reaction \u201d from the journalist . Poe told PinkNews : \u201c I truly never thought topics surrounding my early porn career and interactions with Lily Cade would ever lead to this international news story about her posting terrorist threats . \u201d Activists are calling for the BBC to admit that its piece was ' biased towards transphobic rhetoric ' When the BBC article was initially published , an open letter by Trans Activism UK , criticising the article for suggesting that \u201c transgender women generally pose a risk to cisgender lesbians in great enough numbers that it is newsworthy \u201d when the reality is this is \u201c a matter of incredibly rare , isolated experiences \u201d . In light of the blog posts from Lily Cade , in which she explicitly called for execution of trans women , the group has issued an addendum to the letter . It said : \u201c Either through malice or incompetence , the BBC 's piece has platformed violent and dangerous people as impartial subjects on trans people as a wider group . \u201d Poe 's story , it said , suggests that the BBC \u201c deliberately covered up the context \u201d of the abuse accusations , \u201c and lied when stating that trans women contacted for comment did not respond \u201d . Trans Activism UK continued : \u201c If true , this means that the article 's lack of Lily Cade context was deliberate rather than through error or ignorance \u2026 further proving that this article was wholly intended to specifically target and paint all trans women as likely predators . \u201c It also suggests that a quote from a trans woman , where she stated that she discloses her trans status because not doing so is dangerous for many trans women , was deliberately omitted from the piece . \u201c In our open letter , one of our criticisms was that no trans women were able to give that specific context , and it seems that the BBC had a quote to that effect but decided not to use it in the article . \u201c It is clear that the BBC platformed a person with violently dangerous anti-trans views , and has not been quick to act in the wake of the manifesto being posted . \u201d The group is demanding \u201c a full and appropriate response to our criticisms of the above mentioned article \u201d , and added : \u201c The BBC cannot continue to stand behind the sentiment that its piece is impartial , properly researched , and not biased towards clearly transphobic rhetoric . \u201d A BBC spokesperson admitted to PinkNews that \u201c an admission of inappropriate behaviour \u201d by Lily Cade \u201c should have been included in the original article \u201d .","annotations":[{"text":"Caroline Lowbridge","span":[467,484],"token_span":[86,87],"role":"Communicator","label":"Communicator","role_definition":"The person who uses language in the written or spoken modality to convey a message to another person."},{"text":"several \u2026 high profile trans women","span":[779,812],"token_span":[143,148],"role":"Addressee","label":"Addressee","role_definition":"The person that receives the message from the Communicator."},{"text":"about sex and relationships","span":[848,874],"token_span":[155,158],"role":"Topic","label":"Topic","role_definition":"This is the subject matter to which the message pertains.

[ 1 ] The imaging evaluation of a patient with aortic dissection can be undoubtedly complex , requiring that the interpreting physician understand the classification systems and vocabulary used . This can be made all the more challenging by advances in medical imaging that reshape our understanding of aortic dissection . [ 2 ] Classic aortic dissection is seen as a longitudinal split or partition in the media of the aorta . An intimal tear connects the media with the aortic lumen , and an exit tear creates a true lumen and a false lumen . The smaller true lumen is lined by intima , and the false lumen is lined by media . Typically , flow in the false lumen is slower than in the true lumen , and the false lumen often becomes aneurysmal when subjected to systemic pressure . Acute aortic dissection is considered chronic at 2 weeks . Typical symptoms of acute aortic dissection include severe chest pain , hypotension , and syncope ; hence , they mimic acute myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism . [ 3 ] The dissection usually stops at an aortic branch vessel or at the level of an atherosclerotic plaque . [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] ( See the images of aortic dissection below . ) Aortic dissection is a life - threatening event that is associated with a very poor outcome . A number of complex phenomena are involved in its initiation and propagation . Advances in comprehension of the mechanisms leading to dissection are the result of improvements in imaging and experimental techniques . However , the micromechanics involved in triggering such rupture events remains poorly described and understood . [ 7 ] Most classic aortic dissections begin at 1 of 3 distinct anatomic locations : the aortic root ; 2 cm above the aortic root ; and just distal to the left subclavian artery . Ascending aortic involvement may result in death from wall rupture , hemopericardium and tamponade , occlusion of the coronary ostia with myocardial infarction , or severe aortic insufficiency . Aortic intramural hematoma ( AIH ) is a more recently described entity in which no intimal flap is present . It results in a spontaneous medial hematoma that may be secondary to an infarction of the vasa vasorum of the adventitia . Aortic intramural hematoma accounts for approximately 25 % of aortic dissections . Involvement of the ascending aorta , especially if the overall aortic diameter is greater than 5 cm , should be treated surgically to prevent rupture or progression to a classic dissection with intimal tear . Conservative management is indicated for AIH of the descending aorta . [ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ] Aortic dissection remains a serious cardiovascular emergency with significant early and late mortality and morbidity . Improving outcomes are directly linked to early clinical diagnosis , swift confirmation by appropriate imaging , and management by dedicated teams with high levels of expertise in a complex clinical condition . [ 14 ] Despite improvements in diagnostic measures , including imaging modalities and biomarkers , misdiagnosis of acute aortic dissection remains commonplace and current guidelines are relatively limited in preventing its occurrence . Measures proposed to improve diagnosis of acute aortic dissection and limit the risk of misdiagnosis include early use of acute aortic dissection risk scoring , focused echocardiography , and fast -tracking patients to cross-sectional imaging when suspicion of acute aortic dissection is high . [ 15 ] Imaging modalities Several factors determine the best modality for initial evaluation and postoperative follow - up . These factors include the following : stability of the patient 's condition , the patient 's renal function , suspected postoperative complications , and the availability of each imaging modality . Preferred examinations for aortic dissection include contrast-enhanced spiral computed tomography ( CT ) , transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) in the emergency setting , and magnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging for hemodynamically stable patients . TEE has an advantage over CT and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) in its ability to reveal the status of the aortic valve and the ostia of the coronary arteries . CT and MR angiography have largely replaced conventional diagnostic angiography for assessment of aortic dissection . [ 6 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ] Maffei et al performed a randomized , controlled trial in which 44 patients ( 252 evaluations ) were examined with TEE and CT . [ 23 ] The authors concluded that both TEE and CT are atraumatic , safe , and accurate techniques for serial follow - up studies of patients treated for aortic dissection . Three noninvasive studies are associated with high specificity and sensitivity for aortic dissection . CT and MRI are associated with a sensitivity and a specificity of 94 - 100 % and 95 - 100 % , respectively . TEE is less sensitive and specific than spiral CT or MRI , and TEE is operator -dependent . In addition , because of tracheal interposition , there is a 2 - cm \" blind spot \" for TEE just proximal to the innominate arteries . Note that TEE is contraindicated in approximately 1 % of patients ( eg , patients with esophageal varices ) . Radiography Mediastinal widening is the most common plain radiographic finding in aortic dissection ; it is noted in 80 % of patients ( see the image below ) . Other radiographic findings include the following : Double aortic knob sign ( present in 40 % of patients ) Diffuse enlargement of the aorta with poor definition or irregularity of the aortic contour Inward displacement of aortic wall calcification by more than 10 mm Tracheal displacement to the right Pleural effusion ( more common on the left side ; suggests leakage ) Pericardial effusion Cardiac enlargement Displacement of a nasogastric tube Left apical opacity All findings on plain images are nonspecific but may help in determining the need for further workup . Mediastinal fat commonly causes widening of the mediastinum , which may lead to a false - positive diagnosis of aortic dissection . Computed Tomography Since its introduction in the 1970s , CT has become a widely used technology , particularly in the ED . With the advent of spiral CT , studies may be performed in less time than before , with less patient discomfort , greater accuracy , and lower iodine load . Spiral CT permits patient translation and data acquisition simultaneously . This technology is useful in the evaluation of thoracic trauma , which enables the rapid diagnosis of thoracic injury . Multislice or multidetector CT may be used to perform faster imaging or to acquire thinner slices that may be reconstructed in multiple planes . [ 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 ] The sensitivity of CT for aortic dissection is 87 - 94 % , and the specificity is 92 - 100 % . A typical helical scanning protocol for aortic dissection includes the following parameters : 5 - mm collimation , 1.5 pitch , and 7.5 - mm imaging spacing . Because cardiac output is variable in patients with aortic dissection , a test injection of contrast should be used to determine circulation time ; alternatively , an automated bolus detection scheme may be used . One advantage of the test injection method is that one may visually differentiate the true lumen from the false lumen on the basis of contrast arrival time . Usually , scanning is performed from the thoracic inlet to the common femoral arteries . When dissection is identified , repeat scanning may be performed to obtain delayed images of the false lumen and aortic branches . Multiplanar reformation images are obtained in sagittal , coronal , oblique sagittal , and curved projections generated at an independent workstation . Use of volume rendering may be helpful in planning surgery . Typical CT findings in acute dissection or intramural hematoma include the following : Aortic intramural hematoma : Crescentic high- attenuating clot within the media , with internally displaced calcification ( see the image below ) Nonenhanced CT scan of the chest demonstrates a type B acute aortic intramural hematoma with displacement of intimal calcification and a crescentic high - attenuating clot without mass effect on the aortic lumen .

Courtesy of Joel L Fishman , MD . Contrast-enhanced axial CT image demonstrates an intimal flap that separates the 2 channels in the ascending aorta and descending aorta and begins at the level of the aortic root . Courtesy of Joel L Fishman , MD . Hemorrhagic pleural and pericardial effusions and mediastinal hemorrhage may be seen . CT is helpful in postoperative follow - up . It may accurately depict associated complications , including the following : Thrombosis Hemorrhage Infection Pseudoaneurysm Aortoenteric fistula Ureteral obstruction Inadequate contrast opacification may lead to false- negative findings of aortic dissection . Aortic intramural hematoma may be misinterpreted as an aneurysm with thrombus or arteritis . Spiral CT artifacts include perivenous streaks and motion artifacts . Perivenous streaks are caused by beam hardening and motion resulting from transmitted pulsation in a vein that carries undiluted contrast medium into the heart . Some authors recommend injecting the contrast agent at a rate of 2 mL/s via a peripheral intravenous site in the right arm . Aortic motion artifact is produced by aortic wall motion from the end of diastole to the end of systole . Typically , this artifact is seen in the left anterior and right posterior margins of the aortic circumference . In some patients , especially those with cystic medial necrosis , the intimal flap may be subtle . CT scanning helps assess predictive factors associated with better endovascular prognosis and treatment . ( See the images below . ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) is an accurate tool for the diagnosis of aortic dissection , but it may not be readily available in the acute setting . Unstable patients with Swan - Ganz catheters should not undergo MRI . [ 19 , 22 , 25 , 28 , 30 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 ] MRI has greater than 90 % sensitivity and specificity for aortic dissection . MRI findings of aortic dissection include the following : An intimal flap of medium signal intensity surrounded by a signal void of fast - flowing blood is evident on \" black blood \" echocardiogram - gated spin-echo or double inversion recovery single - shot fast spin-echo MRI ( see the image below ) . Sagittal gradient - echo MRI image obtained in early systole shows a jet of blood flowing through the intimal tear from the smaller anterior true lumen into the larger posterior false lumen . The intimal flap is recognized as the medium signal intensity linear structure that divides the true and false lumens . An aortic stent - graft could be placed across the intimal / entry tear in the descending thoracic aorta to redirect blood into the anterior true lumen . Courtesy of Joel L Fishman , MD . With cine gradient echo imaging , the intimal flap appears as a dark line against the high signal intensity of flowing blood ; its configuration may change during the cardiac cycle . It is important that a careful examination of the aortic flap be conducted during the cardiac cycle with cine MRI so as to detect the presence of \" true lumen collapse , \" which may be associated with end-organ ischemia . In some cases , the intima is stripped 360\u00b0 from the media and is essentially \" free floating \" ; this may result in catastrophic intimo-intimo intussusception , a potentially fatal event . Newer pulse sequences such as true FISP or FIESTA offer very fast cine imaging . Basic MRI sequences for evaluating aortic dissection include spin-echo T1 - weighted or breath - hold double inversion recovery sequences , cardiac - gated gradient - echo sequences , and 3-dimensional ( 3 - D ) thin -section MR angiography ( MRA ) with a bolus injection of a single or double dose of gadolinium - based contrast agent . MRI findings of acute intramural hematoma ( AIH ) include a crescent of blood surrounding but not compressing the aorta . The signal intensity of the crescent varies with age on T1- weighted imaging : It is isointense to muscle in the acute setting and is markedly hyperintense after 3 - 7 days . MRI is helpful in postoperative follow - up . It may accurately depict associated complications , including the following : Thrombosis Hemorrhage Infection Pseudoaneurysm Aortoenteric fistula Ureteral obstruction Potential drawbacks of MRI include reported artifacts on cardiac-triggered thoracic spin-echo phase images . These may appear as an artifactual borderlike feature across the aorta ( caused by helical flow in the aorta ) that may be interpreted as a dissection . Other potential causes of misinterpretation include an atypical configuration of the intimal flap seen in short dissections and multiple false channels in cases in which the flaps are complex . Aortic anomalies also may cause confusion . False- positive findings seen in gadolinium - enhanced MRA include a central line or \" maki \" artifact . This occurs when the acquisition is performed too early , as intra-aortic gadolinium concentration is rising . This artifact may be readily differentiated from an aortic dissection because it does not take a spiral course in contrast to a true intimal flap . Electrocardiography and Ultrasonography Electrocardiography is helpful in the diagnosis of aortic dissection . It is particularly helpful in cases of ascending thoracic dissection , cardiac tamponade , and aortic regurgitation ; transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) has a greater sensitivity and specificity than CT or MRI in detecting coronary arterial occlusion , aortic insufficiency , and cardiac tamponade , with a sensitivity of 97- 99 % and a specificity of 97 - 100 % . [ 40 , 41 ] According to a study by Mastrogiovanni and colleagues , TEE was the favored study for the evaluation of aortic dissection . [ 42 ] In their report of 54 patients , TEE findings confirmed diagnostic dissection in all but 1 patient . TEE noted the site of the intimal tear , as well as the extension of the dissection , pericardial effusion , aortic incompetence , and left ventricular function . Because of the high level of correspondence between the diagnosis made at TEE and surgical anatomic findings , these authors favored the use of TEE \u2014 for many cases , as the sole diagnostic modality . A tortuous aorta may result in a false - positive diagnosis of dissection . In cases involving a massive dilated ascending aorta ( usually occurring as a result of cystic medial necrosis ) , it may be difficult to identify a small intimal flap . Intravascular ultrasonography ( IVUS ) plays an essential role in diagnosis and classification of aortic dissection , as well as in evaluation of the dissection flap and assessment of whether or not it exhibits dynamic or static obstruction of the aortic branches . IVUS provides imaging guidance for fenestration in treatment of aortic dissection and in endograft placement . Angiography Aortography was the reference standard for preoperative evaluation and diagnosis of aortic dissection . With the advent of TEE , CT , and MRI , its role has become important only if nonsurgical interventional procedures are indicated . Aortographic findings are less sensitive than those of newer noninvasive techniques , especially for aortic intramural hematoma ( AIH ) , which is almost impossible to diagnose with aortography because no compression of the lumen exists . [ 21 ] Chest CT angiography ( CTA ) is essential in the diagnosis of acute aortic syndromes . Acute aortic syndromes are associated with high morbidity and mortality , particularly when involving the ascending aorta , and include classic aortic dissection , penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer , and acute intramural hematoma . An understanding of the pathogenesis and distinguishing imaging features of acute aortic syndromes and aortic rupture and some of the less common manifestations is helpful when one is interpreting imaging findings . [ 43 ] It is controversial whether coronary angiography should be performed before sternotomy in a stable patient with aortic dissection , inasmuch as concomitant coronary bypass grafting may be performed if diseased vessels are present . Diagnostic criteria include visualization of a lucent flap and delayed filling and washout of the false lumen . The expanding false lumen may compress the true lumen , causing it to become narrowed . A dual - lumen aorta is noted when both the true lumen and the false lumen are opacified ( see the image below ) . Pitfalls of angiography include lack of visualization of the false lumen due to thrombosis or inadequate opacification with contrast material . Streak artifacts secondary to aortic or cardiac motion or opacification of the sinus of Valsalva may be confused with thrombus . Pitfalls also include missed diagnosis of an intramural hematoma ( frequently associated with progression to frank dissection ) and misdiagnosis when the false lumen is thrombosed . Future Directions Aortic dissection remains a serious cardiovascular emergency with significant early and late mortality and morbidity . Improving outcomes is directly linked to early clinical diagnosis , swift confirmation by appropriate imaging , and management by dedicated teams with high levels of expertise in a complex clinical condition . [ 14 ] New concepts regarding the diagnosis , classification , and treatment of aortic dissection have emerged . [ 44 ] Evolving imaging modalities ( such as 4 - dimensional [ 4 - D ] flow MRI and hybrid positron-emission tomography [ PET ] - CT ) afford more comprehensive insight into anatomic , hemodynamic , and molecular features of the aorta and have shown promise for detecting vessel wall instability at an early stage . [ 45 ] Finally , new treatment options for aortic dissection include the frozen elephant trunk approach , thoracic endovascular repair , and the endo- Bentall concept .

It is important that a careful examination of the aortic flap be conducted during the cardiac cycle with cine MRI so as to detect the presence of \" true lumen collapse , \" which may be associated with end-organ ischemia . In some cases , the intima is stripped 360\u00b0 from the media and is essentially \" free floating \" ; this may result in catastrophic intimo-intimo intussusception , a potentially fatal event . Newer pulse sequences such as true FISP or FIESTA offer very fast cine imaging . Basic MRI sequences for evaluating aortic dissection include spin-echo T1 - weighted or breath - hold double inversion recovery sequences , cardiac - gated gradient - echo sequences , and 3-dimensional ( 3 - D ) thin -section MR angiography ( MRA ) with a bolus injection of a single or double dose of gadolinium - based contrast agent . MRI findings of acute intramural hematoma ( AIH ) include a crescent of blood surrounding but not compressing the aorta . The signal intensity of the crescent varies with age on T1- weighted imaging : It is isointense to muscle in the acute setting and is markedly hyperintense after 3 - 7 days . MRI is helpful in postoperative follow - up . It may accurately depict associated complications , including the following : Thrombosis Hemorrhage Infection Pseudoaneurysm Aortoenteric fistula Ureteral obstruction Potential drawbacks of MRI include reported artifacts on cardiac-triggered thoracic spin-echo phase images . These may appear as an artifactual borderlike feature across the aorta ( caused by helical flow in the aorta ) that may be interpreted as a dissection . Other potential causes of misinterpretation include an atypical configuration of the intimal flap seen in short dissections and multiple false channels in cases in which the flaps are complex . Aortic anomalies also may cause confusion . False- positive findings seen in gadolinium - enhanced MRA include a central line or \" maki \" artifact . This occurs when the acquisition is performed too early , as intra-aortic gadolinium concentration is rising . This artifact may be readily differentiated from an aortic dissection because it does not take a spiral course in contrast to a true intimal flap . Electrocardiography and Ultrasonography Electrocardiography is helpful in the diagnosis of aortic dissection . It is particularly helpful in cases of ascending thoracic dissection , cardiac tamponade , and aortic regurgitation ; transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) has a greater sensitivity and specificity than CT or MRI in detecting coronary arterial occlusion , aortic insufficiency , and cardiac tamponade , with a sensitivity of 97- 99 % and a specificity of 97 - 100 % . [ 40 , 41 ] According to a study by Mastrogiovanni and colleagues , TEE was the favored study for the evaluation of aortic dissection . [ 42 ] In their report of 54 patients , TEE findings confirmed diagnostic dissection in all but 1 patient . TEE noted the site of the intimal tear , as well as the extension of the dissection , pericardial effusion , aortic incompetence , and left ventricular function . Because of the high level of correspondence between the diagnosis made at TEE and surgical anatomic findings , these authors favored the use of TEE \u2014 for many cases , as the sole diagnostic modality . A tortuous aorta may result in a false - positive diagnosis of dissection . In cases involving a massive dilated ascending aorta ( usually occurring as a result of cystic medial necrosis ) , it may be difficult to identify a small intimal flap . Intravascular ultrasonography ( IVUS ) plays an essential role in diagnosis and classification of aortic dissection , as well as in evaluation of the dissection flap and assessment of whether or not it exhibits dynamic or static obstruction of the aortic branches . IVUS provides imaging guidance for fenestration in treatment of aortic dissection and in endograft placement . Angiography Aortography was the reference standard for preoperative evaluation and diagnosis of aortic dissection . With the advent of TEE , CT , and MRI , its role has become important only if nonsurgical interventional procedures are indicated . Aortographic findings are less sensitive than those of newer noninvasive techniques , especially for aortic intramural hematoma ( AIH ) , which is almost impossible to diagnose with aortography because no compression of the lumen exists . [ 21 ] Chest CT angiography ( CTA ) is essential in the diagnosis of acute aortic syndromes . Acute aortic syndromes are associated with high morbidity and mortality , particularly when involving the ascending aorta , and include classic aortic dissection , penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer , and acute intramural hematoma . An understanding of the pathogenesis and distinguishing imaging features of acute aortic syndromes and aortic rupture and some of the less common manifestations is helpful when one is interpreting imaging findings . [ 43 ] It is controversial whether coronary angiography should be performed before sternotomy in a stable patient with aortic dissection , inasmuch as concomitant coronary bypass grafting may be performed if diseased vessels are present . Diagnostic criteria include visualization of a lucent flap and delayed filling and washout of the false lumen . The expanding false lumen may compress the true lumen , causing it to become narrowed . A dual - lumen aorta is noted when both the true lumen and the false lumen are opacified ( see the image below ) . Pitfalls of angiography include lack of visualization of the false lumen due to thrombosis or inadequate opacification with contrast material . Streak artifacts secondary to aortic or cardiac motion or opacification of the sinus of Valsalva may be confused with thrombus . Pitfalls also include missed diagnosis of an intramural hematoma ( frequently associated with progression to frank dissection ) and misdiagnosis when the false lumen is thrombosed . Future Directions Aortic dissection remains a serious cardiovascular emergency with significant early and late mortality and morbidity . Improving outcomes is directly linked to early clinical diagnosis , swift confirmation by appropriate imaging , and management by dedicated teams with high levels of expertise in a complex clinical condition . [ 14 ] New concepts regarding the diagnosis , classification , and treatment of aortic dissection have emerged . [ 44 ] Evolving imaging modalities ( such as 4 - dimensional [ 4 - D ] flow MRI and hybrid positron-emission tomography [ PET ] - CT ) afford more comprehensive insight into anatomic , hemodynamic , and molecular features of the aorta and have shown promise for detecting vessel wall instability at an early stage . [ 45 ] Finally , new treatment options for aortic dissection include the frozen elephant trunk approach , thoracic endovascular repair , and the endo- Bentall concept .

It is now common in open areas on roadsides , rangeland , wildlands , hay fields , pastures , and waste areas . Recent reports indicate that yellow starthistle infests between 10 and 15 million acres in California . Disturbances created by cultivation , poorly timed mowing , road building and maintenance , or overgrazing favor this rapid colonizer . It forms dense infestations and rapidly depletes soil moisture , thus preventing the establishment of other species . It is also poisonous to horses , causing a nervous disorder called \u201c chewing disease \u201d ( nigropallidal encephalomalacia ) , which is fatal once symptoms develop . Horses are the only animal known to be affected in this manner and should not be allowed to graze on yellow starthistle . IDENTIFICATION Yellow starthistle is a gray-green to blue- green plant with a deep , vigorous taproot . It produces bright , thistlelike yellow flowers with sharp spines surrounding the base . Yellow starthistle grows to heights varying from 6 inches to 5 feet . The stems of mature plants are rigid , spreading , and typically branching from the base in open areas . Stems and leaves are covered with a loose , cottony wool that gives them a whitish appearance . Stems appear winged due to leaf bases that extend beyond the nodes . Basal leaves are 2 to 3 inches long and deeply lobed . Upper leaves are short ( 0.5 to 1 inch long ) and narrow with few lobes . BIOLOGY Yellow starthistle is a long - lived winter annual that is usually found below 7,000 feet elevation in dry , light - intensive areas where average annual rainfall is between 10 and 60 inches . Seed output can be as high at 30,000 seeds per square meter , with about 95 % of the seed being viable soon after dispersal . Most seeds germinate within a year of dispersal , but some can remain viable in the soil for more than 3 years . Yellow starthistle seeds germinate from fall through spring , which corresponds to the normal rainy season in California . After germinating , the plant initially allocates most of its resources to root growth . By late spring , roots can extend over 3 feet into the soil profile , although the portion above ground is a relatively small basal rosette . This allows yellow starthistle to out - compete shallow - rooted annual species during the drier summer months when moisture availability is limited near the soil surface . It also helps explain why yellow starthistle survives well into the summer , long after other annual species have dried up , and why it can regrow after top removal from mowing or grazing . The competitive ability of yellow starthistle also depends on light intensity at the soil surface during the seedling and rosette stages of development . Yellow starthistle proliferates at high light intensity and does poorly in low light . High light conditions often occur along roadsides , in disturbed sites , grasslands , and on south - facing slopes at higher elevations . MANAGEMENT Control of yellow starthistle cannot be accomplished with a single treatment or in a single year . Effective management requires control of the current population and suppression of seed production , combined with establishment of competitive , desirable vegetation . Prevention Yellow starthistle proliferates along roadsides . Invasion by this weed may be increased with disturbances created by road building and maintenance . Seeds are often spread by vehicles or with the transportation of livestock or contaminated soil . Survey roadsides for the presence of this weed and immediately control new infestations to prevent seed production and its subsequent spread . Yellow starthistle also can be spread as a contaminant in grass seed . Only certified seed should be used for range or pasture seeding . Seed may also come as a contaminant in all classes of hay , particularly grass hay . Carefully check hay shipments for evidence of yellow starthistle . Hay used as mulch along roadsides or disturbed areas can be a source of yellow starthistle introduction . When feeding hay is suspected of containing yellow starthistle , place bales in one area and periodically check around feeding areas for signs of starthistle seedlings . Livestock that have fed in yellow starthistle - infested areas should not be pastured or shipped to uninfested areas . Control newly emerged seedlings to prevent establishment . It is important to control new infestations when they are small because spot eradication is least expensive and most effective at this time . Biological Control Four natural enemies of yellow starthistle have been imported from Europe and by 2003 were well established in California . These biological control agents include two weevils ( Bangasternus orientalis and Eustenopus villosus ) and two flies ( Urophora sirunaseva and Chaetorellia succinea ) . They all attack the flower / seed head and directly or indirectly reduce seed production , the only means of reproduction and spread of the weed . The insects lay their eggs in , on , or near flower / seed heads and complete their development within them . Eustenopus villosus adults also directly reduce seed production by feeding on immature flower heads . All of these insects are highly host-specific to yellow starthistle and do not attack commercially valuable crops or native plants . These insects already occur in most areas of California that are infested with yellow starthistle . If additional releases of these natural enemies are made , protect the release area from practices that may damage the insects . Such practices include insecticide applications , soil cultivation , summer - prescribed burning , or mowing when the plants are in the flowering stage . After establishment , the insects are capable of building up to high numbers and spreading on their own . These insects do best in areas with warm , dry summer climates . The most recent releases , Eustenopus villosus and Chaetorellia succinea , have proven to be the most effective agents for yellow starthistle seed suppression . These insects are becoming more widespread throughout the state . However , they only suppress yellow starthistle seed production by about 50 % , so they should not be considered as the sole method of control . It is possible that a combination of herbicides and biologicial control will provide more sustainable control than either technique used alone . Landowners and managers with yellow starthistle problems may contact their county agricultural commissioner 's office about obtaining these biological control insects . Most recently a rust , Puccinea jaceae var . solstitialis , was approved for release in California . Trials are under way to determine the potential effectiveness of this organism on yellow starthistle . Cultural Control Yellow starthistle begins emergence with fall rains and continues to germinate throughout the rainy season . A single cultivation after the rainy season when soils are dry effectively controls yellow starthistle seedlings and rosettes . This treatment must be made after the last rains but before seeds are produced . If cultivation is carried out too early ( e.g. , before the last rains ) seed will continue to germinate and another cultivation will be needed to control each new flush of seedlings that results from a spring rain . Mowing can be used to manage yellow starthistle , provided it is well timed and used on plants with a high branching pattern . Mowing early growth stages results in increased light penetration and rapid regrowth of the weed . If plants branch from near the base , regrowth will occur from recovering branches . Repeated mowing of plants too early in their life cycles ( rosette or bolting stages ) or when branches are below the mowing height will not prevent seed production , as flowers will develop below the mower cutting height . Plants with a high branching pattern are easier to control , as recovery will be greatly reduced . Even plants with this growth pattern must be mowed in the late spiny or early flowering stage to be successful . An additional mowing may be necessary in some cases . To encourage growth of desirable vegetation , let these species set seed before mowing , but be sure to mow well before starthistle is in full flower . In general , mowing is most effective when soil moisture is low and no irrigation or rainfall follows mowing . Grazing is effective in reducing yellow starthistle seed production . Sheep , goats , or cattle eat yellow starthistle before spines form on the plant . Goats will eat starthistle even in the spiny stage . The plant 's crude protein concentration is variable , but ranges from 28 % at the rosette stage down to 11 % at the bud stage and should be sufficient to meet the general maintenance requirements for most ruminants . When it is abundant , yellow starthistle appears to have the ability to sustain animals several weeks beyond annual grass \u201c dry down . \u201d Intensive grazing in late May and June using large numbers of animals for short duration can reduce plant height , canopy size , and seed production . Avoid overgrazing , however ; do not allow more than half the grass forage to be removed . Grazing more than this will reduce the grasses ' recovery rate and ability to shade out yellow starthistle . Burning is best performed at the end of the rainy season when flowers first appear . Yellow starthistle should be green at this time and will require desiccated vegetation to burn . Most annual vegetation other than yellow starthistle , particularly grasses , should have dried and shed their seeds by this time . The foliage of these plants serves as a fuel source to allow a more complete burn . Burning for 2 or more consecutive years helps suppress yellow starthistle and deplete the soil seedbank . Burning can also increase the recovery and density of perennial grasses . Burning can damage biological control agents , but insects from adjacent areas will readily move back into the site the following year . Revegetation Control practices are capable of reducing yellow starthistle populations , but in the absence of competition , starthistle will often reestablish . Effective management requires that desirable plant species be encouraged or planted and managed to prevent yellow starthistle germination or growth . Species choice for revegetation will depend on the intended use of that site . Resident vegetation such as perennial bunchgrasses or wildflowers may be desirable along roadsides , abandoned pastures , or in rangelands and wildlands . In these situations , cultural , biological , or chemical methods can be used to reduce yellow starthistle while encouraging other plant species , if possible , with practices such as fertilization . Research efforts to reestablish native perennial grasses are in progress . Perennial grasses are slow to establish and may require herbicide treatments to assist yellow starthistle or annual grass control during establishment , but once well established , alternative controls such as properly timed grazing , mowing , or burning can be used effectively . In pastures , eliminate dense stands of yellow starthistle and reseed the area with a fast -growing , competitive forage species . Although annual legumes work well for this purpose , the lack of selective herbicides makes follow - up treatments difficult . Therefore , grasses are best because selective herbicides can then be used to control yellow starthistle plants not eliminated by grass competition . In areas with scattered yellow starthistle infestations , eliminate scattered plants and overseed with a desirable species to provide enough competition to prevent yellow starthistle from reestablishing . In all instances , choose desirable species that are well adapted to the site and not likely to become invasive themselves . Species that grow well are the best competitors . Chemical Control Both postemergent and preemergent herbicides are available to control yellow starthistle along roadsides , rights - of - way , and noncrop areas . Most herbicides registered for use in rangeland and pastures are only active postemergence . Clopyralid , however , has both preemergence and postemergence activity on yellow starthistle . Postemergent Herbicides Postemergent herbicide treatments generally work best on seedlings . The long germination period of yellow starthistle makes control with a single application almost impossible . A treatment following the first flush of seedlings opens a site up for later flushes . Waiting until later in the rainy season to apply a postemergent herbicide allows a greater number of seedlings to be treated , but larger plants will require higher herbicide rates and may not be controlled . Aminopyralid and clopyralid are growth regulator herbicides for use in noncrop areas , including rangeland and pastures . Unlike other growth regulator herbicides , these are effective on yellow starthistle both postemergence and preemergence . The most effective timing for aminopyralid application is from December to March , when yellow starthistle is in the seedling to midrosette stage ; its soil residual should last until the end of the rainy season . Clopyralid has a shorter soil residual and should be applied January to March . For both chemicals , earlier applications ( i.e. , in fall ) may not provide full - season control , and later applications ( bolting to early spiny stage ) will require higher rates . A single application at the recommended time will provide season - long control . Aminopyralid is used at 0.75 to 1.75 oz acid equivalent / acre , and clopyralid is used at 2 to 3.96 oz acid equivalent / acre . Both chemicals are selective on many members of the sunflower family , particularly thistles , but can also injure legumes , including clovers . Most other broadleaf species and all grasses are not injured . There are no grazing restrictions after aminopyralid or clopyralid use in rangelands . While not registered for use around the home , aminopyralid and clopyralid do have registration for use in pastures , rangelands , rights - of - way , roadsides , and other noncrop areas . Clippings from treated areas should not be used as compost ; these herbicides degrade slowly in compost and can be a problem when used as a mulch or fertilizer source in sensitive crops or landscapes . 2,4-D can provide acceptable control of yellow starthistle if it is applied at the proper rate and time . Treatment in the rosette growth stage provides better control than later applications . Amine formulations are as effective as ester formulations at the small rosette growth stage , and amine formulations reduce the chance of off-target movement . Application rates of 0.5 to 0.75 lb active ingredient / acre will control small rosettes . Applications made later in the season , when rosettes are larger or after bolting has been initiated , require a higher application rate ( 1 to 2 lb active ingredient / acre ) to achieve equivalent control . 2,4-D is a growth regulator and a selective herbicide that controls many other broadleaf plants , but has minimal effect on clovers and generally does not harm grasses . It has little , if any , soil activity . Drift from 2,4-D applications is common , particularly from ester formulations . Use caution when applying near sensitive vegetation or during windy or high temperature conditions . Certain formulations of 2,4-D require a restricted materials permit ; generally formulations that are sold in small quantities ( i.e. , liquid formulations that do not exceed 1 quart and dry formulations that do not exceed 1 pound ) do not require a permit . Dicamba is very effective at controlling yellow starthistle at rates as low as 0.25 lb active ingredient / acre . When yellow starthistle rosettes are small , about 1 to 1.5 inches across , the 0.25 lb active ingredient / acre rate works well , but higher rates ( 0.5 to 0.75 lb active ingredient / acre ) are needed if plants are larger . Applications made in late rosette to early bolting stages have provided excellent control , although earlier treatments are better . Dicamba is also a growth regulator and selective herbicide that controls many broadleaf plants , including clovers , but does not harm grasses . Its soil activity is very short . Like 2,4- D , it is available as both an amine and as an ester formulation . Drift from dicamba applications is common , especially from the ester formulation . Some formulations have lower drift potential than others . Use caution when applying near sensitive vegetation . Certain formulations of dicamba require a restricted materials permit ; generally formulations that are sold in small quantities ( i.e. , liquid formulations that do not exceed 1 quart and dry formulations that do not exceed 1 pound ) do not require a permit . Triclopyr at 0.5 lb active ingredient / acre provides complete control of yellow starthistle seedlings but is not as effective on larger plants . More mature plants require rates up to 1.5 lb active ingredient / acre . Like 2,4-D and dicamba , triclopyr is a growth regulator herbicide with little or no residual activity . It is foliar - absorbed and active on broadleaf species , including clovers , but typically does not harm grasses . Triclopyr is formulated as both an amine and ester . The ester formulation is more sensitive to drift than the amine form . Caution should be observed when using the ester formulation . This material is registered for use around the home as well as for pastures , rangelands , rights - of - way , roadsides , and other noncrop areas . Glyphosate controls yellow starthistle at 1 lb active ingredient / acre . Good coverage , clean water , and actively growing yellow starthistle plants are all essential for adequate control . Unlike growth regulator herbicides , glyphosate is nonselective and controls most plants , including grasses . It has no soil activity . A 1 % solution of glyphosate also provides effective control and is used at this concentration for spot treatment of small patches . An application of glyphosate is a very effective method of controlling starthistle plants in the bolting , spiny , and early flowering stages at 1 to 2 lb active ingredient / acre . However , glyphosate will severely damage desirable perennial grasses if they are sprayed as well . Glyphosate is registered for use around the home as well as for pastures , rangelands , rights - of - way , roadsides , and other noncrop areas . Preemergent Herbicides Preemergent herbicides must be applied before seeds germinate to be effective . The long germination period of yellow starthistle requires that a preemergent material have a lengthy residual activity . Make applications before a rain , which will move the material into the soil . Because these materials adhere to soil particles , off - site movement and possible injury of susceptible plants could occur if the soil is dry and wind occurs before rain . When yellow starthistle plants have already emerged , it is possible to combine a postemergent herbicide ( to control emerged plants ) with a preemergent herbicide ( to provide residual control of any subsequent germination ) for an effective control strategy . Chlorsulfuron and sulfometuron are preemergent herbicides registered for roadsides and other noncrop uses . Chlorsulfuron was recently registered for use in rangelands . Both are very effective at controlling yellow starthistle when applied at 1 to 2 oz active ingredient / acre . Little postemergence activity occurs on yellow starthistle with these two compounds . Best control is achieved when applications are made before weeds emerge . They may not be used around the home . Integrated Approaches Combinations of prescribed burning and clopyralid can be very effective for yellow starthistle control . However , when using this integrated approach it is important that a prescribed burn be conducted the first year ( or possibly for 2 years ) and that clopyralid be applied in the last year of the program . Treating in the first year and burning in the second year may increase the starthistle problem because burning has been shown to increase seed germination during the following rainy season . Continued control of yellow starthistle after the last year of treatment can be accomplished by either mowing , spot spraying , or hand - pulling .

Most seeds germinate within a year of dispersal , but some can remain viable in the soil for more than 3 years . Yellow starthistle seeds germinate from fall through spring , which corresponds to the normal rainy season in California . After germinating , the plant initially allocates most of its resources to root growth . By late spring , roots can extend over 3 feet into the soil profile , although the portion above ground is a relatively small basal rosette . This allows yellow starthistle to out - compete shallow - rooted annual species during the drier summer months when moisture availability is limited near the soil surface . It also helps explain why yellow starthistle survives well into the summer , long after other annual species have dried up , and why it can regrow after top removal from mowing or grazing . The competitive ability of yellow starthistle also depends on light intensity at the soil surface during the seedling and rosette stages of development . Yellow starthistle proliferates at high light intensity and does poorly in low light . High light conditions often occur along roadsides , in disturbed sites , grasslands , and on south - facing slopes at higher elevations . MANAGEMENT Control of yellow starthistle cannot be accomplished with a single treatment or in a single year . Effective management requires control of the current population and suppression of seed production , combined with establishment of competitive , desirable vegetation . Prevention Yellow starthistle proliferates along roadsides . Invasion by this weed may be increased with disturbances created by road building and maintenance . Seeds are often spread by vehicles or with the transportation of livestock or contaminated soil . Survey roadsides for the presence of this weed and immediately control new infestations to prevent seed production and its subsequent spread . Yellow starthistle also can be spread as a contaminant in grass seed . Only certified seed should be used for range or pasture seeding . Seed may also come as a contaminant in all classes of hay , particularly grass hay . Carefully check hay shipments for evidence of yellow starthistle . Hay used as mulch along roadsides or disturbed areas can be a source of yellow starthistle introduction . When feeding hay is suspected of containing yellow starthistle , place bales in one area and periodically check around feeding areas for signs of starthistle seedlings . Livestock that have fed in yellow starthistle - infested areas should not be pastured or shipped to uninfested areas . Control newly emerged seedlings to prevent establishment . It is important to control new infestations when they are small because spot eradication is least expensive and most effective at this time . Biological Control Four natural enemies of yellow starthistle have been imported from Europe and by 2003 were well established in California . These biological control agents include two weevils ( Bangasternus orientalis and Eustenopus villosus ) and two flies ( Urophora sirunaseva and Chaetorellia succinea ) . They all attack the flower / seed head and directly or indirectly reduce seed production , the only means of reproduction and spread of the weed . The insects lay their eggs in , on , or near flower / seed heads and complete their development within them . Eustenopus villosus adults also directly reduce seed production by feeding on immature flower heads . All of these insects are highly host-specific to yellow starthistle and do not attack commercially valuable crops or native plants . These insects already occur in most areas of California that are infested with yellow starthistle . If additional releases of these natural enemies are made , protect the release area from practices that may damage the insects . Such practices include insecticide applications , soil cultivation , summer - prescribed burning , or mowing when the plants are in the flowering stage . After establishment , the insects are capable of building up to high numbers and spreading on their own . These insects do best in areas with warm , dry summer climates . The most recent releases , Eustenopus villosus and Chaetorellia succinea , have proven to be the most effective agents for yellow starthistle seed suppression . These insects are becoming more widespread throughout the state . However , they only suppress yellow starthistle seed production by about 50 % , so they should not be considered as the sole method of control . It is possible that a combination of herbicides and biologicial control will provide more sustainable control than either technique used alone . Landowners and managers with yellow starthistle problems may contact their county agricultural commissioner 's office about obtaining these biological control insects . Most recently a rust , Puccinea jaceae var . solstitialis , was approved for release in California . Trials are under way to determine the potential effectiveness of this organism on yellow starthistle . Cultural Control Yellow starthistle begins emergence with fall rains and continues to germinate throughout the rainy season . A single cultivation after the rainy season when soils are dry effectively controls yellow starthistle seedlings and rosettes . This treatment must be made after the last rains but before seeds are produced . If cultivation is carried out too early ( e.g. , before the last rains ) seed will continue to germinate and another cultivation will be needed to control each new flush of seedlings that results from a spring rain . Mowing can be used to manage yellow starthistle , provided it is well timed and used on plants with a high branching pattern . Mowing early growth stages results in increased light penetration and rapid regrowth of the weed . If plants branch from near the base , regrowth will occur from recovering branches . Repeated mowing of plants too early in their life cycles ( rosette or bolting stages ) or when branches are below the mowing height will not prevent seed production , as flowers will develop below the mower cutting height . Plants with a high branching pattern are easier to control , as recovery will be greatly reduced . Even plants with this growth pattern must be mowed in the late spiny or early flowering stage to be successful . An additional mowing may be necessary in some cases . To encourage growth of desirable vegetation , let these species set seed before mowing , but be sure to mow well before starthistle is in full flower . In general , mowing is most effective when soil moisture is low and no irrigation or rainfall follows mowing . Grazing is effective in reducing yellow starthistle seed production . Sheep , goats , or cattle eat yellow starthistle before spines form on the plant . Goats will eat starthistle even in the spiny stage . The plant 's crude protein concentration is variable , but ranges from 28 % at the rosette stage down to 11 % at the bud stage and should be sufficient to meet the general maintenance requirements for most ruminants . When it is abundant , yellow starthistle appears to have the ability to sustain animals several weeks beyond annual grass \u201c dry down . \u201d Intensive grazing in late May and June using large numbers of animals for short duration can reduce plant height , canopy size , and seed production . Avoid overgrazing , however ; do not allow more than half the grass forage to be removed . Grazing more than this will reduce the grasses ' recovery rate and ability to shade out yellow starthistle . Burning is best performed at the end of the rainy season when flowers first appear . Yellow starthistle should be green at this time and will require desiccated vegetation to burn . Most annual vegetation other than yellow starthistle , particularly grasses , should have dried and shed their seeds by this time . The foliage of these plants serves as a fuel source to allow a more complete burn . Burning for 2 or more consecutive years helps suppress yellow starthistle and deplete the soil seedbank . Burning can also increase the recovery and density of perennial grasses . Burning can damage biological control agents , but insects from adjacent areas will readily move back into the site the following year . Revegetation Control practices are capable of reducing yellow starthistle populations , but in the absence of competition , starthistle will often reestablish . Effective management requires that desirable plant species be encouraged or planted and managed to prevent yellow starthistle germination or growth . Species choice for revegetation will depend on the intended use of that site . Resident vegetation such as perennial bunchgrasses or wildflowers may be desirable along roadsides , abandoned pastures , or in rangelands and wildlands . In these situations , cultural , biological , or chemical methods can be used to reduce yellow starthistle while encouraging other plant species , if possible , with practices such as fertilization . Research efforts to reestablish native perennial grasses are in progress . Perennial grasses are slow to establish and may require herbicide treatments to assist yellow starthistle or annual grass control during establishment , but once well established , alternative controls such as properly timed grazing , mowing , or burning can be used effectively . In pastures , eliminate dense stands of yellow starthistle and reseed the area with a fast -growing , competitive forage species . Although annual legumes work well for this purpose , the lack of selective herbicides makes follow - up treatments difficult . Therefore , grasses are best because selective herbicides can then be used to control yellow starthistle plants not eliminated by grass competition . In areas with scattered yellow starthistle infestations , eliminate scattered plants and overseed with a desirable species to provide enough competition to prevent yellow starthistle from reestablishing . In all instances , choose desirable species that are well adapted to the site and not likely to become invasive themselves . Species that grow well are the best competitors . Chemical Control Both postemergent and preemergent herbicides are available to control yellow starthistle along roadsides , rights - of - way , and noncrop areas . Most herbicides registered for use in rangeland and pastures are only active postemergence . Clopyralid , however , has both preemergence and postemergence activity on yellow starthistle . Postemergent Herbicides Postemergent herbicide treatments generally work best on seedlings . The long germination period of yellow starthistle makes control with a single application almost impossible . A treatment following the first flush of seedlings opens a site up for later flushes . Waiting until later in the rainy season to apply a postemergent herbicide allows a greater number of seedlings to be treated , but larger plants will require higher herbicide rates and may not be controlled . Aminopyralid and clopyralid are growth regulator herbicides for use in noncrop areas , including rangeland and pastures . Unlike other growth regulator herbicides , these are effective on yellow starthistle both postemergence and preemergence . The most effective timing for aminopyralid application is from December to March , when yellow starthistle is in the seedling to midrosette stage ; its soil residual should last until the end of the rainy season . Clopyralid has a shorter soil residual and should be applied January to March . For both chemicals , earlier applications ( i.e. , in fall ) may not provide full - season control , and later applications ( bolting to early spiny stage ) will require higher rates . A single application at the recommended time will provide season - long control . Aminopyralid is used at 0.75 to 1.75 oz acid equivalent / acre , and clopyralid is used at 2 to 3.96 oz acid equivalent / acre . Both chemicals are selective on many members of the sunflower family , particularly thistles , but can also injure legumes , including clovers . Most other broadleaf species and all grasses are not injured . There are no grazing restrictions after aminopyralid or clopyralid use in rangelands . While not registered for use around the home , aminopyralid and clopyralid do have registration for use in pastures , rangelands , rights - of - way , roadsides , and other noncrop areas . Clippings from treated areas should not be used as compost ; these herbicides degrade slowly in compost and can be a problem when used as a mulch or fertilizer source in sensitive crops or landscapes . 2,4-D can provide acceptable control of yellow starthistle if it is applied at the proper rate and time . Treatment in the rosette growth stage provides better control than later applications . Amine formulations are as effective as ester formulations at the small rosette growth stage , and amine formulations reduce the chance of off-target movement . Application rates of 0.5 to 0.75 lb active ingredient / acre will control small rosettes . Applications made later in the season , when rosettes are larger or after bolting has been initiated , require a higher application rate ( 1 to 2 lb active ingredient / acre ) to achieve equivalent control . 2,4-D is a growth regulator and a selective herbicide that controls many other broadleaf plants , but has minimal effect on clovers and generally does not harm grasses . It has little , if any , soil activity . Drift from 2,4-D applications is common , particularly from ester formulations . Use caution when applying near sensitive vegetation or during windy or high temperature conditions . Certain formulations of 2,4-D require a restricted materials permit ; generally formulations that are sold in small quantities ( i.e. , liquid formulations that do not exceed 1 quart and dry formulations that do not exceed 1 pound ) do not require a permit . Dicamba is very effective at controlling yellow starthistle at rates as low as 0.25 lb active ingredient / acre . When yellow starthistle rosettes are small , about 1 to 1.5 inches across , the 0.25 lb active ingredient / acre rate works well , but higher rates ( 0.5 to 0.75 lb active ingredient / acre ) are needed if plants are larger . Applications made in late rosette to early bolting stages have provided excellent control , although earlier treatments are better . Dicamba is also a growth regulator and selective herbicide that controls many broadleaf plants , including clovers , but does not harm grasses . Its soil activity is very short . Like 2,4- D , it is available as both an amine and as an ester formulation . Drift from dicamba applications is common , especially from the ester formulation . Some formulations have lower drift potential than others . Use caution when applying near sensitive vegetation . Certain formulations of dicamba require a restricted materials permit ; generally formulations that are sold in small quantities ( i.e. , liquid formulations that do not exceed 1 quart and dry formulations that do not exceed 1 pound ) do not require a permit . Triclopyr at 0.5 lb active ingredient / acre provides complete control of yellow starthistle seedlings but is not as effective on larger plants . More mature plants require rates up to 1.5 lb active ingredient / acre . Like 2,4-D and dicamba , triclopyr is a growth regulator herbicide with little or no residual activity . It is foliar - absorbed and active on broadleaf species , including clovers , but typically does not harm grasses . Triclopyr is formulated as both an amine and ester . The ester formulation is more sensitive to drift than the amine form . Caution should be observed when using the ester formulation . This material is registered for use around the home as well as for pastures , rangelands , rights - of - way , roadsides , and other noncrop areas . Glyphosate controls yellow starthistle at 1 lb active ingredient / acre . Good coverage , clean water , and actively growing yellow starthistle plants are all essential for adequate control . Unlike growth regulator herbicides , glyphosate is nonselective and controls most plants , including grasses . It has no soil activity . A 1 % solution of glyphosate also provides effective control and is used at this concentration for spot treatment of small patches . An application of glyphosate is a very effective method of controlling starthistle plants in the bolting , spiny , and early flowering stages at 1 to 2 lb active ingredient / acre . However , glyphosate will severely damage desirable perennial grasses if they are sprayed as well . Glyphosate is registered for use around the home as well as for pastures , rangelands , rights - of - way , roadsides , and other noncrop areas . Preemergent Herbicides Preemergent herbicides must be applied before seeds germinate to be effective . The long germination period of yellow starthistle requires that a preemergent material have a lengthy residual activity . Make applications before a rain , which will move the material into the soil . Because these materials adhere to soil particles , off - site movement and possible injury of susceptible plants could occur if the soil is dry and wind occurs before rain . When yellow starthistle plants have already emerged , it is possible to combine a postemergent herbicide ( to control emerged plants ) with a preemergent herbicide ( to provide residual control of any subsequent germination ) for an effective control strategy . Chlorsulfuron and sulfometuron are preemergent herbicides registered for roadsides and other noncrop uses . Chlorsulfuron was recently registered for use in rangelands . Both are very effective at controlling yellow starthistle when applied at 1 to 2 oz active ingredient / acre . Little postemergence activity occurs on yellow starthistle with these two compounds . Best control is achieved when applications are made before weeds emerge . They may not be used around the home . Integrated Approaches Combinations of prescribed burning and clopyralid can be very effective for yellow starthistle control . However , when using this integrated approach it is important that a prescribed burn be conducted the first year ( or possibly for 2 years ) and that clopyralid be applied in the last year of the program . Treating in the first year and burning in the second year may increase the starthistle problem because burning has been shown to increase seed germination during the following rainy season . Continued control of yellow starthistle after the last year of treatment can be accomplished by either mowing , spot spraying , or hand - pulling .

Before that time , Czech Christmas was different . Nevertheless , solidarity , abundance of food and folk traditions had always been part of it . People Used to Fast on Christmas Day Dominant feature of Czech Christmas is Christmas tree decorated with home - made sweets , gingerbread or wooden , straw or glass decorations . However , most of the Czechs have no idea that the tradition of decorating Christmas trees had come from Germany and was introduced in Czech countries in the course of the 19th century , together with eating fish . Christmas day used to be a day of fasting , until dinner people were eating only modest meals or no food at all , and definitely avoided meat . Formerly , Freshwater Fish had to be Served with a Sweet Sauce In the 18th century , fish was a luxurious expensive meal , while festive menu used to be more modest . Carp , tench or catfish , if already served , was prepared very often sweet . For example , the so-called \u201c black carp \u201d , traditional and still preserved recipe , is prepared with plum butter , almonds and nuts ; its sauce can even be seasoned with gingerbread . Christmas Menu Today Traditional Christmas dinner , served before people start unpacking Christmas presents they will find under the Christmas tree , starts usually with fish soup . Though rather tricky to prepare , this soup with eggs and roe is perceived by many Czechs an indispensable part of the menu . The main course consists of fillets of carp fried in egg batter and bread crumbs , accompanied with potato salad made with root vegetables , eggs , mayonnaise , spices and possibly some other ingredients . To get the carp meat tender and free of its distinctive fish smell , it is usually dipped in milk ; prior to frying it is salted and sprinkled with lemon juice .

Before that time , Czech Christmas was different . Nevertheless , solidarity , abundance of food and folk traditions had always been part of it . People Used to Fast on Christmas Day Dominant feature of Czech Christmas is Christmas tree decorated with home - made sweets , gingerbread or wooden , straw or glass decorations . However , most of the Czechs have no idea that the tradition of decorating Christmas trees had come from Germany and was introduced in Czech countries in the course of the 19th century , together with eating fish . Christmas day used to be a day of fasting , until dinner people were eating only modest meals or no food at all , and definitely avoided meat . Formerly , Freshwater Fish had to be Served with a Sweet Sauce In the 18th century , fish was a luxurious expensive meal , while festive menu used to be more modest . Carp , tench or catfish , if already served , was prepared very often sweet . For example , the so-called \u201c black carp \u201d , traditional and still preserved recipe , is prepared with plum butter , almonds and nuts ; its sauce can even be seasoned with gingerbread . Christmas Menu Today Traditional Christmas dinner , served before people start unpacking Christmas presents they will find under the Christmas tree , starts usually with fish soup . Though rather tricky to prepare , this soup with eggs and roe is perceived by many Czechs an indispensable part of the menu . The main course consists of fillets of carp fried in egg batter and bread crumbs , accompanied with potato salad made with root vegetables , eggs , mayonnaise , spices and possibly some other ingredients . To get the carp meat tender and free of its distinctive fish smell , it is usually dipped in milk ; prior to frying it is salted and sprinkled with lemon juice . The meat is then crisp and tasty , the only disadvantage being its tiny bones . Nevertheless , the necessity to eat slowly and watch for the bones will help you enjoy every single bite .

If you made some research on Google , you probably found hundreds of recipes that claim to be authentic and traditional . Unfortunately , most of them are not . If you 've never made Moroccan mint tea the Moroccan way , prepare yourself to have a culinary revelation in your kitchen . The steps are easy , the ingredients are simple and you will be amazed at the deliciousness you will be able to create . To make Moroccan mint tea , you need to use the right tea leaves , a teapot or kettle with a few requirements , all while following a specific technique . It might look complicated but it 's really not . In fact , making authentic Moroccan mint tea is neither complicated or expensive . All it takes is 3 ingredients and less than 10 minutes of preparation . Once you make it to your friends , I can assure they will long for your invitations , as your mint tea will taste like being on vacation in Morocco . Growing up in Morocco , Moroccan mint tea was part of my everyday life as it is for the majority of Moroccans . It 's the symbol of family and friend gatherings and the first thing prepared to welcome guests . The smell of this sweet aromatic tea announces a good moment of chilling , catching up , and connecting . Traditionally in Morocco , the family head male was the person in charge of making Moroccan mint tea . Now things have changed and women are mostly the ones in charge of making it , at least on non-special occasions . In fact , during celebrations and in some traditional families , Moroccan mint tea is still men 's specialty . They prepare it with great care following a definite ceremony . They would bring the equipment and ingredients to the living room and chat with the guests while preparing tea with high finesse . At least three glasses will be served , each one stronger than the previous one as tea continues infusing . A saying in Morocco states that the first glass of Moroccan mint tea is as soft as life , the second as strong as love , and the last as bitter as death . If you already had a mint tea in Morocco or in a traditional Moroccan restaurant , you probably noticed it is poured from a height . Pouring Moroccan mint tea from a height is an important part of the Moroccan tea ceremony . The higher the tea is poured , the more foam you will get on top of your drink , the closer it will be to the traditional Moroccan mint tea cup . What is Moroccan Mint Tea Made of ? To make Moroccan mint tea , the ingredients are Gunpowder loose tea , a generous bunch of fresh mint leaves , and sugar . You can also flavor your tea with some aromatics as I will show you to give it a more interesting flavor and some health benefits . Choosing the right kettle or teapot is also primordial to make real Moroccan mint tea . Authentic Moroccan mint tea is very sweet , but you can adjust sugar quantity to match your taste and diet . Personally , I tend to cut sugar quantity by half , sometimes more , and leave the classic sweet version to special occasions or when I have sweet cravings . What Teapot to Use for Moroccan Mint Tea ? To make traditional Moroccan mint tea , you will need either a Moroccan teapot or a heat-resistant teapot . The reason is simple : Moroccan mint tea is prepared by active infusion , which means tea leaves infuse in boiling water for many minutes . A regular teapot cannot support the stove 's heat and can break . I learned the hard way and lost some beautiful teapots in the process . So make sure your teapot is heat-resistant . If that is not the case , I recommend looking for a good quality stainless steel Moroccan teapot . You can use it to make Moroccan mint tea but also any other teas or infusions . It also makes a great pitcher for serving coffee or wine . For affordable Moroccan teapots , you can check our baby platform Little Moroccan Things where we feature Morocco -imported artisanal products . We do n't restock often but when we do , we make sure our teapots are qualitative with competitive pricing , ranging from $ 40 to $ 80 . What Kind of Tea is Used for Moroccan Mint Tea ? The tea used to make authentic Moroccan mint tea is the Chinese green gunpowder loose tea . It 's what gives mint tea the best results . As I consume tea quite regularly , I always choose organic gunpowder as many brands use radiated or low-quality leaves . What Kind of Mint is Used for Moroccan Tea ? The mint used in traditional Moroccan mint tea is Spearmint , also called Nana Mint . This mint variety brings a strong flavor and delicate sweetness . If you ca n't find Spearmint in your local store , no worries , you can use other mint varieties and your Moroccan mint tea will still be delicious ! Do n't forget to wash the brunches thoroughly before use . Moroccan people use a generous quantity of mint and sometimes , they have to bend the branches and squeeze them to make them enter the teapot . Be generous with your mint , that 's how you 'll get the strong minty flavor of Moroccan mint tea . I grow Spearmint in my apartment in a small pot , that way I have fresh mint leaves always available . It also decorates and perfumes the kitchen beautifully . If you want to give it a try , these are the seeds I use . How to Flavor Moroccan Mint Tea ? Moroccans love to flavor their Moroccan mint tea . While the basic Moroccan mint tea is a go -to drink for every day , Moroccans like to add herbs , spices , and aromatics on special occasions or to get some health benefits . As an example , during the cold season , Moroccans tend to add herbs known for their warming properties , like a variety of Pennyroyal mint and absinthe . On special occasions like engagement parties and marriages , the most used herbs and spices are rosebuds , verbena , and / or cinnamon . They are known for enhancing the mood , encouraging a more relaxed and joyful gathering . Authentic Moroccan Mint Tea Recipe Ingredients - 1 tbsp Chinese Gunpowder tea leaves - 4 branches fresh mint - \u00bd tsp orange blossom water ( optional but adds a delicious fragrance ! ) - 2 tbsp white sugar adjust to taste and diet - 3 cups water Instructions - Put the green tea leaves in your teapot . - Boil water in a separate kettle . - Once water is boiling , pour 1 cup of water in your teapot and swish it around a few times to clean the tea leaves . This helps get rid of tea 's strong and sour flavors . - Pour that water in the sink through the teapot spout . - Now that your tea leaves are clean and the flavors milder , pour the remaining boiling water in the teapot . Do n't fill the teapot to the brim keeping one inch space . Add the sugar . - Position the teapot on the stove .

When incorporating metal into a product , one of the most essential steps to consider is that of the final finish bestowed upon the metal 's surface . In most cases , especially when working with steel , one will choose to polish the workpiece . This process can be controlled to have a wide range of finishes . Some prefer a dull polish , as is provided by either polishing to a satin finish or by brushing ; others would rather incorporate a bit of a shine , giving the metal a nice , bright mirror finish . Both can look aesthetically pleasing , but a bright , highly - polished finish will ensure that the metal will produce less friction and remain durable over time . In addition to polishing , one may elect to take an additional step and passivate the metal workpiece . Both electropolishing and passivation work to remove any potential contaminants from the surface of the metal , thereby preventing it from degrading prematurely . They also both work to sterilize the metal surface and mitigate further contamination and corrosion that may occur in the future . To those unfamiliar with the processes , electropolishing and passivation might sound quite similar , and , although they work together toward the same goal , they are strikingly different . Want to learn more ? Here is the breakdown for anyone interested in purchasing metal finishing solutions : Electropolishing During the electropolishing process , the product is placed into a temperature - controlled electrolyte bath and exposed to an electric current . This exposure causes the metal surface to ionize and begin dissolving into the electrolyte solution , starting at any exposed metal burrs . As this leaves the surface microscopically - smooth and sterile , electropolishing is a favored process in the production of metal for the pharmaceutical and food industries . It is a scientific principle that smooth surfaces create less friction than rough surfaces . When applied to metal machinery , this translates into a product with greater durability and efficiency that will last longer than products without an electropolished finish . This smooth surface is incredibly valuable in the manufacturing of any consumer machinery , such as washing machines , or in aerospace and automotive engineering , as in the body of a car or passenger plane . As an electropolished piece has very minimal dents and divots , it is extremely easy to clean . This feature is highly valued in clinical and dental environments , where metals must be sterilized . From a visual standpoint , electropolishing can completely remove any heat spots or other forms of discoloration caused by the manufacturing process . High performance electropolishing The ingredients used in electropolishing solutions vary with the metal intended to be polished , meaning you can manufacture a chemical solution for the electropolishing of stainless steel that is specifically designed for a high - performance finish on stainless steel products \u2013 we even have options for 300 Series Austenitic ( non-magnetic ) stainless steel and 400 Series Martensitic stainless steel . If you have another metal such as copper , nickel , or iron , a different solution is available to ensure the metal receives the best possible finish . Large and complex metal finishing Lots of companies are now opting to use electropolishing to finish their products due to its application on metals of all sizes and complexities . Electropolishing tanks ( containers used to hold the electropolishing solution ) can be designed for all shapes and sizes and allow for partial or complete submersion of the metal 's surface during the polishing process . Whether you 're working with nuts , screws and needles , large sheet metals , or metals with narrow channels and difficult to reach areas , an electropolishing bath is an easy - to- implement option for your manufacturing process . Passivation Passivation is much like electropolishing in that it also uses a chemical bath . However , rather than stripping away metal from the surface of a workpiece , passivation is the process of treating or coating a metal surface to reduce its chemical reactivity . Unlike electropolishing , passivation is not designed to remove material from a metal surface and does not change the appearance of the metal .

When incorporating metal into a product , one of the most essential steps to consider is that of the final finish bestowed upon the metal 's surface . In most cases , especially when working with steel , one will choose to polish the workpiece . This process can be controlled to have a wide range of finishes . Some prefer a dull polish , as is provided by either polishing to a satin finish or by brushing ; others would rather incorporate a bit of a shine , giving the metal a nice , bright mirror finish . Both can look aesthetically pleasing , but a bright , highly - polished finish will ensure that the metal will produce less friction and remain durable over time . In addition to polishing , one may elect to take an additional step and passivate the metal workpiece . Both electropolishing and passivation work to remove any potential contaminants from the surface of the metal , thereby preventing it from degrading prematurely . They also both work to sterilize the metal surface and mitigate further contamination and corrosion that may occur in the future . To those unfamiliar with the processes , electropolishing and passivation might sound quite similar , and , although they work together toward the same goal , they are strikingly different . Want to learn more ? Here is the breakdown for anyone interested in purchasing metal finishing solutions : Electropolishing During the electropolishing process , the product is placed into a temperature - controlled electrolyte bath and exposed to an electric current . This exposure causes the metal surface to ionize and begin dissolving into the electrolyte solution , starting at any exposed metal burrs . As this leaves the surface microscopically - smooth and sterile , electropolishing is a favored process in the production of metal for the pharmaceutical and food industries . It is a scientific principle that smooth surfaces create less friction than rough surfaces . When applied to metal machinery , this translates into a product with greater durability and efficiency that will last longer than products without an electropolished finish . This smooth surface is incredibly valuable in the manufacturing of any consumer machinery , such as washing machines , or in aerospace and automotive engineering , as in the body of a car or passenger plane . As an electropolished piece has very minimal dents and divots , it is extremely easy to clean . This feature is highly valued in clinical and dental environments , where metals must be sterilized . From a visual standpoint , electropolishing can completely remove any heat spots or other forms of discoloration caused by the manufacturing process . High performance electropolishing The ingredients used in electropolishing solutions vary with the metal intended to be polished , meaning you can manufacture a chemical solution for the electropolishing of stainless steel that is specifically designed for a high - performance finish on stainless steel products \u2013 we even have options for 300 Series Austenitic ( non-magnetic ) stainless steel and 400 Series Martensitic stainless steel . If you have another metal such as copper , nickel , or iron , a different solution is available to ensure the metal receives the best possible finish . Large and complex metal finishing Lots of companies are now opting to use electropolishing to finish their products due to its application on metals of all sizes and complexities . Electropolishing tanks ( containers used to hold the electropolishing solution ) can be designed for all shapes and sizes and allow for partial or complete submersion of the metal 's surface during the polishing process . Whether you 're working with nuts , screws and needles , large sheet metals , or metals with narrow channels and difficult to reach areas , an electropolishing bath is an easy - to- implement option for your manufacturing process . Passivation Passivation is much like electropolishing in that it also uses a chemical bath . However , rather than stripping away metal from the surface of a workpiece , passivation is the process of treating or coating a metal surface to reduce its chemical reactivity . Unlike electropolishing , passivation is not designed to remove material from a metal surface and does not change the appearance of the metal . As a result , passivation will not necessarily make a product non-stick or make it easier to clean . It will look and feel much like what it did before passivation was carried out . Which Is Best ? Although both passivation and electropolishing employ a chemical bath , they may be thought of as being complementary to each other , rather than the same process .

More particularly , it relates to a process in which a particular coating is applied to and cured on aluminum sheet prior to drawing and ironing . The term \" aluminum \" as used herein includes aluminum and its alloys containing at least 50 percent by weight aluminum U.S. Pat. No. 3,206,848 discloses precoating of aluminum sheet with vinyl organosols , solution vinyls , vinyl phenolics and epoxy phenolics prior to drawing the coated sheet into a shallow cup , heating the shallow cup to a temperature of around 275\u00b0- 380\u00b0 F which is below the initial hardening temperature of the coating for 1 - 20 minutes to relieve the stresses in the coating and the aluminum alloy and thereby providing greater coating elongation and minimizing the possibility of subsequent fracture , cooling and then drawing again to a depth of about 21/4 inches . According to the patentee , additional drawing operations may be performed provided there are baking steps between each of the draws . Such a baking operation tends to result in possible marring or decomposition of the coating as well as reducing the tensile properties of the side wall of the shallow cup formed . Therefore , development of a process which would minimize possible coating and metal partial anneal and also permit formation of a deep cup from precoated sheet represents a highly desirable result . SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is accordingly one object of this invention to provide a method of forming a deep article such as a beverage container from precoated aluminum sheet . A further object is to provide a method of minimizing the formation of cracks and fractures in the coating of precoated aluminum articles such as cans of beverage depth during or subsequent to the drawing and ironing steps used in forming such articles . Further objects will be apparent from the description and claims which follow . DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In its broader aspects , my invention involves precoating aluminum sheet with a preselected composition capable of withstanding substantial deformation in subsequent drawing and ironing steps without substantial fracture or exfoliation , drawing the cured coated sheet into shallow cup and then ironing the shallow cup to a can of beverage can depth . I have found surprisingly that by ironing the precoated shallow cup to a deeper can size , I produce a can that retains a smooth , substantially unfractured coating without any heating above room temperature of about 20\u00b0- 30\u00b0 C except when the coating is thermosetting and requires heating for curing before the drawing step as applied to the sheet . This is particularly suprising in view of the fact that it has heretofore been generally believed that heating prior to or during forming is necessary to permit sufficient elongation of the metal and flexibility for the coating to assume the shape of the can into which the blank sheet is formed without a substantial amount of cracking or removal of coating , especially when ironing of the side wall is involved rather than metal drawing . The composition which I use for precoating according to my invention must be able to accept the strain of deformation resulting from drawing followed by ironing , yet remain integral without undergoing substantial fracture or exfoliation . Resins which I have found to have such a property and be especially useful according to my invention are certain specific vinyl or epoxy resin types which apparently allow the required degree of coating elongation or coating flow ( without heating ) during the drawing and ironing steps which follow the curing of the resin on the aluminum sheet . Representative vinyl resins useful according to my invention include those having a vinyl chloride content of 81 to 97 % and a vinyl acetate content of 3 to 14 % . Such vinyl polymers may be modified with appropriate dibasic acids such as maleic acid or anhydride or vinyl alcohol . The foregoing resins may also be modified with plasticizers , stabililizers , solvating agents or pigments as desired . When cross-linking is desired prior to coating , it can be obtained by modifying the vinyl polymers , particularly those containing free hydroxyl or carboxyl groups , with a resin which is capable of cross-linking therewith . For example , urea-formaldehyde , triazine , melamine - formaldehyde , epoxy resins , phenolic resins or combinations thereof may be used for cross-linking and to obtain desired physical and chemical properties . Uncross-linked epoxy resins having a molecular weight of at least 50,000 or more are such as epichlorohydrin-bisphenol polymers also useful in practicing my invention . Lower molecular wieght epoxy resins of about at least 5,000 molecular weight can also be used in accordance with the invention when cross-linked with amino resins such as urea-formaldehyde or melamine - formaldehyde or with vinyl resins such as described above . However when such cross-linked resins are used the cross-linking should not exceed about 80 % of the theoretical equivalency . This helps maintain elongation of film under stress and compression and prevents excessive brittleness . The coating resins useful according to my invention may be applied by direct or reverse roller coat application , by spraying or by curtain coating . Conventional catalysts may also be used to facilitate curing . When solvents are used , heating is desirable to assist solvent evaporation and cross-linking . A lubricant such as paraffin wax , low-molecular weight polyethylene , or the like , may be incorporated in the coating resin . Preferred range of lubricant concentration is from 1 % to 5 % based on resin solids composition . The lubricant may be applied as a separate step by dispersion in a suitable liquid . It may be applied by roller coating , spraying or cascading . The preferred range of lubricant on the coating surface is from 5 to 40 mg / ft2 of coated surface . The ironing step according to my invention is capable of reducing the metal thickness from as great as 17 mils to as little as 4 mils . The aluminum which I use may be either of the hard ( H ) or annealed ( O ) temper , and the resin coating may be applied to one or both sides of the sheet . If desired , before the resin is applied , the aluminum sheet may be precleaned and be subjected to a conversion coating treatment . An alkaline or acid - base cleaner may be used . It may contain sodium or potassium hydroxide , tetrasodium pyrophosphate or other effective alkaline salts combined with conventional wetting agents , buffers and chelating chemicals . If of acid base , the cleaner may contain nitric or sulfuric acid , for example . The conversion coating may be an electrochemically produced aluminum oxide film such as produced by sulfuric acid anodizing or a complex metal oxide film such as produced by chemical conversion coating of the chromium - phosphate type , for example , as described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,438,877 . The anodically produced coating may be conventionally sealed in boiling , de-ionized water but is preferably left unsealed to obtain maximum adhesion of the subsequently applied resin coating . The drawing prior to ironing may be in more than one step . For example , a reverse drawing step may be used . The following examples are illustrative of my invention : EXAMPLE 1 To illustrate the prior art , chromium - phosphate conversion - coated 3004 - H19 0.0145 \" aluminum was used for this example . Six-inch strip was cleaned with an alkaline soidum pyrophosphate cleaner and coated with a chromium - phosphate conversion coating solution to obtain a film weight of 14 mg / ft2 . The strip was blanked , drawn , redrawn and sized , and then ironed into beverage cans . The finish was bright on the outer wall and wall thickness was equivalent to uncoated cans ( about 0.0055 \" ) . The cans were solvent cleaned to remove excess lubricant . To study metal flow and conversion coating uniformity , X -ray fluorescence and microprobe surface studies were made on the bottom and side wall exterior and interior of the 211 - 12 oz. container . These tests showed very uniform metal and surface flow . Distribution of conversion coating was substantially uniform when comparing variations of chromium between the unworked bottom and the worked side wall . There was a 3:1 surface conversion coating reduction . There were little differences between metal flow on the mandrel side ( interior ) and the ring side ( exterior ) of the can . To assess the surface optically for conversion coating uniformity , cans were heated to 800\u00b0 F for 15 minutes to develop color in the conversion coating . This converted the transparent chromium - phosphate film to a strongly colored layer . Color uniformity on the side wall was excellent and in agreement with the shade attained on surfaces with similar conversion coating thickness not mechanically worked . Microscopic studies showed that the surface of the pretreated drawn and ironed can was somewhat more broken up than the surface of the drawn and ironed can post-treated with chromium - phosphate . EXAMPLE 2 Aluminum Alloy 3004 - H19 , 0.0145 \" was cleaned and pre-treated with a chromium - phosphate conversion coating and one side of this sheet was subsequently coated with a solution vinyl coating . The vinyl coating consisted of a mixture of a vinyl chloride resin having about 87 % vinyl chloride content and 13 % vinyl acetate content and a second resin having 86 % vinyl chloride content , 13 % vinyl acetate content and 1 % maleic acid content . Equal portions of each resin were blended with about 20 % dioctyl phthalate to plasticize the coating , and this mixture was dissolved in methyl ethyl ketone / toluol to obtain a suitable solution coating . This solution coating was applied at 7 mg / in and the solvent portion of this coating was evaporated by force drying the coating at 300\u00b0 F for 5 minutes . The resulting sheet was coated with a paraffin wax dissolved in hexane to obtain a wax weight of 20 mg / ft2 . The coated and waxed sheet was drawn , redrawn , sized and ironed without further heating or waxing to 211\u00d7408 beverage cans . EXAMPLE 3 A sheet of Aluminum Alloy 3004 - H19 , 0.0145 \" was cleaned and pretreated as in Examples 1 and 2 and subsequently coated with a vinyl resin dispersion - type coating of the following composition . ______________________________________ Parts by Weight Components ______________________________________ 100 Vinyl chloride dispersion resin ( fine particle size ) 60 Vinyl solution resin ( 86 % vinyl chloride , 13 % vinyl acetate , 1 % maleic acid ) 45 Med MW epichlorohydrin-bisphenol resin 35 Triazine resin 25 Non-reactive polymeric plasticizer 200 Titanium dioxide pigment 600 Methylethyl ketone ( MEK ) : toluol:xylol 1:1:1 1 Phosphoric acid catalyst 8 Paraffinic lubricant ______________________________________ This coating composition was applied to one side of the sheet at 8 mg / in2 dry film weight , and the coating was heated for 1 minute at 500\u00b0 F oven temperature to facilitate solvent evaporation and cross-linking of the reactive portions of the resin solution . The coated sheet was then drawn into a cup , redrawn , sized and ironed into a 211\u00d7400 can without substantially disrupting the continuity of the coating on the inside side wall . EXAMPLE 4 A sheet of Aluminum Alloy 3004 - H19 , 0.0145 \" was cleaned and pretreated with a chromium - phosphate conversion coating having a film weight of 25 mg / ft2 and subsequently coated with a high molecular weight noncross -linked epoxy resin . The epoxy resin ( epichlorin - bisphenol type ) had an average molecular weight of 36,000 and was dissolved in a mixture of methyl ethyl ketone ( MEK ) and cellusolve acetate , the final coating having a resin content of 18 per cent by weight and a solvent content of 82 per cent by weight . The resin was applied to obtain a dry coating film weight of 8 mg / in2 . The resulting coating was heated for 5 minutes at 400\u00b0 F to facilitate solvent evaporation and curing on the aluminum sheet . A solution lubricant consisting of paraffin dissolved in hexane was subsequently applied by roller coat application . The sheet containing the lubricated cured resin was drawn into a cup , redrawn , sized and ironed without reheating . The resulting surface inside the can was substantially free of pinholes . Adhesion was judged excellent as measured by scotch tape adhesion tests , and the coated metal surface withstood beer pasteurization of 20 minutes at 180\u00b0 F in beer without loss of coating adhesion . Film weight measurements on the side wall were approximately 3 mg / in2 , whereas film weight on the bottom surface was about 9 mg / in. EXAMPLE 5 3004 conversion - coated aluminum sheet , 0.0145 \" was coated with a solution polymer consisting of a high molecular weight epoxy resin of the epichlorohydrin- bisphenol type as in Example 4 except that the polymer was blended with 10 % by weight urea-formaldehyde resin ( Uformite F240 ) to facilitate partial cross-linking . The resin was dissolved in MEK / butyl cellusolve to facilitate application . The coating was applied at 8 mg / in and heated for 5 minutes at 425\u00b0 F to facilitate solvent evaporation and resin cross-linking . The resulting precoated sheet was then handled substantially as described in Example 3 with substantially the same results . EXAMPLE 6 3004 alloy conversion - coated aluminum sheet was coated with a solution polymer consisting of a medium molecular weight epoxy resin ( epichlorohydrin - bisphenol type ) modified with a urea-formaldehyde resin as in Example 3 except for modification to obtain a cross-linking of 70 % of that theoretically available based on the equivalent weight of the epoxy and urea-formaldehyde resin . The resin was dissolved in MEK / toluol / isopropyl alcohol , applied to a dry film weight of 7 mg / in2 and heated for 5 minutes at 400\u00b0 F to facilitate solvent evaporation and cross-linking . A lubricant consisting of paraffin wax dissolved in hexane was applied to obtain a dry lubricant weight of 15 mg / ft2 . The sheet so prepared was drawn , redrawn , sized and ironed to obtain a 211\u00d7400 beverage can . The coating was somewhat milky after ironing but adhered well to the substrate . EXAMPLE 7 To both sides of 3004 - H19 , 0.0145 \" pretreated aluminum sheet was applied a solution vinyl coating as in Example 2 . The sheet was lubricated and subsequently drawn and ironed to a 211\u00d7408 beverage can . Both inside and outside coating adhered well to the pretreated sheet . Film continuity and dry adhesion were acceptable for commercial use .

More particularly , it relates to a process in which a particular coating is applied to and cured on aluminum sheet prior to drawing and ironing . The term \" aluminum \" as used herein includes aluminum and its alloys containing at least 50 percent by weight aluminum U.S. Pat. No. 3,206,848 discloses precoating of aluminum sheet with vinyl organosols , solution vinyls , vinyl phenolics and epoxy phenolics prior to drawing the coated sheet into a shallow cup , heating the shallow cup to a temperature of around 275\u00b0- 380\u00b0 F which is below the initial hardening temperature of the coating for 1 - 20 minutes to relieve the stresses in the coating and the aluminum alloy and thereby providing greater coating elongation and minimizing the possibility of subsequent fracture , cooling and then drawing again to a depth of about 21/4 inches . According to the patentee , additional drawing operations may be performed provided there are baking steps between each of the draws . Such a baking operation tends to result in possible marring or decomposition of the coating as well as reducing the tensile properties of the side wall of the shallow cup formed . Therefore , development of a process which would minimize possible coating and metal partial anneal and also permit formation of a deep cup from precoated sheet represents a highly desirable result . SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is accordingly one object of this invention to provide a method of forming a deep article such as a beverage container from precoated aluminum sheet . A further object is to provide a method of minimizing the formation of cracks and fractures in the coating of precoated aluminum articles such as cans of beverage depth during or subsequent to the drawing and ironing steps used in forming such articles . Further objects will be apparent from the description and claims which follow . DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In its broader aspects , my invention involves precoating aluminum sheet with a preselected composition capable of withstanding substantial deformation in subsequent drawing and ironing steps without substantial fracture or exfoliation , drawing the cured coated sheet into shallow cup and then ironing the shallow cup to a can of beverage can depth . I have found surprisingly that by ironing the precoated shallow cup to a deeper can size , I produce a can that retains a smooth , substantially unfractured coating without any heating above room temperature of about 20\u00b0- 30\u00b0 C except when the coating is thermosetting and requires heating for curing before the drawing step as applied to the sheet . This is particularly suprising in view of the fact that it has heretofore been generally believed that heating prior to or during forming is necessary to permit sufficient elongation of the metal and flexibility for the coating to assume the shape of the can into which the blank sheet is formed without a substantial amount of cracking or removal of coating , especially when ironing of the side wall is involved rather than metal drawing . The composition which I use for precoating according to my invention must be able to accept the strain of deformation resulting from drawing followed by ironing , yet remain integral without undergoing substantial fracture or exfoliation . Resins which I have found to have such a property and be especially useful according to my invention are certain specific vinyl or epoxy resin types which apparently allow the required degree of coating elongation or coating flow ( without heating ) during the drawing and ironing steps which follow the curing of the resin on the aluminum sheet . Representative vinyl resins useful according to my invention include those having a vinyl chloride content of 81 to 97 % and a vinyl acetate content of 3 to 14 % . Such vinyl polymers may be modified with appropriate dibasic acids such as maleic acid or anhydride or vinyl alcohol . The foregoing resins may also be modified with plasticizers , stabililizers , solvating agents or pigments as desired . When cross-linking is desired prior to coating , it can be obtained by modifying the vinyl polymers , particularly those containing free hydroxyl or carboxyl groups , with a resin which is capable of cross-linking therewith . For example , urea-formaldehyde , triazine , melamine - formaldehyde , epoxy resins , phenolic resins or combinations thereof may be used for cross-linking and to obtain desired physical and chemical properties . Uncross-linked epoxy resins having a molecular weight of at least 50,000 or more are such as epichlorohydrin-bisphenol polymers also useful in practicing my invention . Lower molecular wieght epoxy resins of about at least 5,000 molecular weight can also be used in accordance with the invention when cross-linked with amino resins such as urea-formaldehyde or melamine - formaldehyde or with vinyl resins such as described above . However when such cross-linked resins are used the cross-linking should not exceed about 80 % of the theoretical equivalency . This helps maintain elongation of film under stress and compression and prevents excessive brittleness . The coating resins useful according to my invention may be applied by direct or reverse roller coat application , by spraying or by curtain coating . Conventional catalysts may also be used to facilitate curing . When solvents are used , heating is desirable to assist solvent evaporation and cross-linking . A lubricant such as paraffin wax , low-molecular weight polyethylene , or the like , may be incorporated in the coating resin . Preferred range of lubricant concentration is from 1 % to 5 % based on resin solids composition . The lubricant may be applied as a separate step by dispersion in a suitable liquid . It may be applied by roller coating , spraying or cascading . The preferred range of lubricant on the coating surface is from 5 to 40 mg / ft2 of coated surface . The ironing step according to my invention is capable of reducing the metal thickness from as great as 17 mils to as little as 4 mils . The aluminum which I use may be either of the hard ( H ) or annealed ( O ) temper , and the resin coating may be applied to one or both sides of the sheet . If desired , before the resin is applied , the aluminum sheet may be precleaned and be subjected to a conversion coating treatment . An alkaline or acid - base cleaner may be used . It may contain sodium or potassium hydroxide , tetrasodium pyrophosphate or other effective alkaline salts combined with conventional wetting agents , buffers and chelating chemicals . If of acid base , the cleaner may contain nitric or sulfuric acid , for example . The conversion coating may be an electrochemically produced aluminum oxide film such as produced by sulfuric acid anodizing or a complex metal oxide film such as produced by chemical conversion coating of the chromium - phosphate type , for example , as described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,438,877 . The anodically produced coating may be conventionally sealed in boiling , de-ionized water but is preferably left unsealed to obtain maximum adhesion of the subsequently applied resin coating . The drawing prior to ironing may be in more than one step . For example , a reverse drawing step may be used . The following examples are illustrative of my invention : EXAMPLE 1 To illustrate the prior art , chromium - phosphate conversion - coated 3004 - H19 0.0145 \" aluminum was used for this example .

Philip Sheridan , 1864 The Union victory at Cedar Creek had substantial military and political impacts . The Beginning of the End A series of battles fought in eastern Virginia during May and June 1864 resulted in massive Union casualties and stalemate before Richmond and Petersburg . With much of the North frustrated with Grant 's war efforts , Abraham Lincoln 's reelection prospects looked grim . Only after successes at Cedar Creek and in Sherman 's Atlanta Campaign did the situation improve . Victory from the Jaws of Defeat Cedar Creek was a turning point of the war . An extremely daring pre-dawn surprise Confederate attack routed the Union army . Feeling he had achieved a spectacular victory , General Early called a halt to reorganize around 10:30 a.m. Meanwhile , General Sheridan , riding from Winchester , was completely unaware of the disaster . Upon hearing the growing sounds of battle , however , he quickened his pace and rode hard to the field . Rallying his defeated forces , he then ordered a counterattack at 4:00 p.m. which swept the Confederates from the field . Sheridan 's timely arrival and charismatic leadership completely reversed the tide of battle . The Union victory ended further Confederate military resistance in the Valley . Combined with the capture in Atlanta , the Battle of Cedar Creek reignited optimism in the North and paved the way for Lincoln 's reelection three weeks later . \" A victory turned from disaster \u2026 \" Philip Sheridan Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan followed his victories in the Shenandoah Valley by laying waste to the \u201c Breadbasket of the Confederacy . \u201d In September and October of 1864 , Sheridan and his 32,000 - man Army of the Shenandoah destroyed a 75 - mile swath of the Shenandoah Valley . Confident the campaign was over , Sheridan camped his army north of Cedar Creek , around Belle Grove Plantation near Middletown , before traveling to Washington , D.C. to confer with his superiors . Morning Attack Lt. Gen. Jubal Early , commander of the Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley , and his army \u2014 poorly equipped , ill-fed , and reduced to 14,000 or 15,000 men \u2014 posed little apparent threat . Desperate for a victory , Early and his commanders planned a daring assault on Sheridan 's soldiers encamped around Belle Grove Plantation . In the pre-dawn hours of October 19 , after an all - night march and two river crossings along the base of the Massanutten Mountain , the Confederates came out of a dense fog to attack the Federal positions . Early 's Confederates caught many Federal soldiers sleeping . Their onslaught overran the U.S. 8th Corps , then the 19th Corps , and pushed the Federals north of Belle Grove Plantation . The U.S. 6th Corps , with more warning , offered stiffer resistance \u2014 including a determined stand among the stones of the Middletown cemetery ) \u2014 but by 10:30 a.m. the stunned Federal forces were in full retreat . Fatal Halt Early felt his troops had won a spectacular victory . He halted their advance just north of Middletown . The Confederates used the pause to secure their captured spoils , including 24 cannon and over 1,000 prisoners , and to solidify their positions . Exhaustion , and looting of the captured camps , lessened the strength of the already outnumbered Confederate army . Sheridan 's Ride Sheridan rode from Winchester back to Middletown that same morning , unaware of the disaster befalling his army . Hearing the growing sounds of battle , he quickened his pace and rode hard to the battlefield . \" Sheridan 's Ride , \" later celebrated in art and poetry , forever cemented his status as a great American general . Sheridan rallied his defeated forces , then ordered a counterattack at 4:00 p.m. which swept the Confederates from the field . The Federals recaptured their lost artillery \u2014 with 24 Confederate cannons \u2014 and took more than 1,200 prisoners . The Battle of Cedar Creek ended with 5,700 Federal and 2,900 Confederate casualties , making it the second bloodiest of the Shenandoah Valley campaigns .

Philip Sheridan , 1864 The Union victory at Cedar Creek had substantial military and political impacts . The Beginning of the End A series of battles fought in eastern Virginia during May and June 1864 resulted in massive Union casualties and stalemate before Richmond and Petersburg . With much of the North frustrated with Grant 's war efforts , Abraham Lincoln 's reelection prospects looked grim . Only after successes at Cedar Creek and in Sherman 's Atlanta Campaign did the situation improve . Victory from the Jaws of Defeat Cedar Creek was a turning point of the war . An extremely daring pre-dawn surprise Confederate attack routed the Union army . Feeling he had achieved a spectacular victory , General Early called a halt to reorganize around 10:30 a.m. Meanwhile , General Sheridan , riding from Winchester , was completely unaware of the disaster . Upon hearing the growing sounds of battle , however , he quickened his pace and rode hard to the field . Rallying his defeated forces , he then ordered a counterattack at 4:00 p.m. which swept the Confederates from the field . Sheridan 's timely arrival and charismatic leadership completely reversed the tide of battle . The Union victory ended further Confederate military resistance in the Valley . Combined with the capture in Atlanta , the Battle of Cedar Creek reignited optimism in the North and paved the way for Lincoln 's reelection three weeks later . \" A victory turned from disaster \u2026 \" Philip Sheridan Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan followed his victories in the Shenandoah Valley by laying waste to the \u201c Breadbasket of the Confederacy . \u201d In September and October of 1864 , Sheridan and his 32,000 - man Army of the Shenandoah destroyed a 75 - mile swath of the Shenandoah Valley . Confident the campaign was over , Sheridan camped his army north of Cedar Creek , around Belle Grove Plantation near Middletown , before traveling to Washington , D.C. to confer with his superiors . Morning Attack Lt. Gen. Jubal Early , commander of the Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley , and his army \u2014 poorly equipped , ill-fed , and reduced to 14,000 or 15,000 men \u2014 posed little apparent threat . Desperate for a victory , Early and his commanders planned a daring assault on Sheridan 's soldiers encamped around Belle Grove Plantation . In the pre-dawn hours of October 19 , after an all - night march and two river crossings along the base of the Massanutten Mountain , the Confederates came out of a dense fog to attack the Federal positions . Early 's Confederates caught many Federal soldiers sleeping . Their onslaught overran the U.S. 8th Corps , then the 19th Corps , and pushed the Federals north of Belle Grove Plantation . The U.S. 6th Corps , with more warning , offered stiffer resistance \u2014 including a determined stand among the stones of the Middletown cemetery ) \u2014 but by 10:30 a.m. the stunned Federal forces were in full retreat . Fatal Halt Early felt his troops had won a spectacular victory . He halted their advance just north of Middletown . The Confederates used the pause to secure their captured spoils , including 24 cannon and over 1,000 prisoners , and to solidify their positions . Exhaustion , and looting of the captured camps , lessened the strength of the already outnumbered Confederate army . Sheridan 's Ride Sheridan rode from Winchester back to Middletown that same morning , unaware of the disaster befalling his army . Hearing the growing sounds of battle , he quickened his pace and rode hard to the battlefield . \" Sheridan 's Ride , \" later celebrated in art and poetry , forever cemented his status as a great American general . Sheridan rallied his defeated forces , then ordered a counterattack at 4:00 p.m. which swept the Confederates from the field . The Federals recaptured their lost artillery \u2014 with 24 Confederate cannons \u2014 and took more than 1,200 prisoners . The Battle of Cedar Creek ended with 5,700 Federal and 2,900 Confederate casualties , making it the second bloodiest of the Shenandoah Valley campaigns . Consequences The Federal victory shattered Early 's army . Further Confederate resistance in the Valley ended . Coming just three weeks before the U.S. presidential election , news of the Battle of Cedar Creek gave sagging Northern morale a much needed boost and helped carry Abraham Lincoln to a landslide reelection .","annotations":[{"text":"General Early","span":[994,1006],"token_span":[173,174],"role":"Victim","label":"Victim","role_definition":"This role is the being or entity that is injured by the Assailant's attack."},{"text":"the Confederates","span":[1344,1359],"token_span":[235,236],"role":"Victim","label":"Victim","role_definition":"This role is the being or entity that is injured by the Assailant's attack."},{"text":"General Sheridan","span":[1066,1081],"token_span":[185,186],"role":"Assailant","label":"Assailant","role_definition":"The person (or other self-directed entity) that is responding to a prior attack by attempting physical harm to the Victim."},{"text":"Union","span":[1477,1481],"token_span":[256,256],"role":"Assailant","label":"Assailant","role_definition":"The person (or other self-directed entity) that is responding to a prior attack by attempting physical harm to the Victim."},{"text":"1864","span":[305,308],"token_span":[56,56],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the Assailant attacks the Victim."},{"text":"Cedar Creek","span":[331,341],"token_span":[61,62],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the place where the Assailant makes an assault on the Victim."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-0012-13108-frame-Counterattack","frame":"Counterattack","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Assailant physically attacks a Victim (which is usually but not always sentient), causing or intending to cause the Victim physical damage.","frame_ancestors":["Attack","Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"By the end of the Marne-Rheims offensive , the German manpower advantage had been spent and their supplies and troops were exhausted .

The battle took place over the course of 15 July -5 August 1918 , in the final year of the war . Erich Ludendorff , effectively the German Chief -of - Staff ( although Paul von Hindenburg was the ostensible commander ) , was convinced that the war could best be won by an attack in Flanders . To that end he determined to lure Allied forces from Belgium to the Marne in a huge diversionary attack , preparatory to a renewed offensive further north . The second Marne offensive was launched on the back of an earlier push towards Paris which recaptured the Chemin des Dames ridge en route , a formidable position held by the Germans in 1914 and lost , at great cost to the French , during the 1917 Nivelle Offensive . On the day of the offensive 's launch , on 15 July , 23 German divisions of the First and Third Armies , under Mudra and Einem , attacked the French Fourth Army ( commanded by Gouraud ) to the east of Reims , while a further 17 divisions of the Seventh Army , under Boehm , assisted by the new Ninth Army under Eben , attacked the French Sixth Army ( Degoutte ) in the west .

The result ? A mass experiment on girls and young women . Veronica started using filters to edit pictures of herself on social media when she was 14 years old . She remembers everyone in her middle school being excited by the technology when it became available , and they had fun playing with it . \u201c It was kind of a joke , \u201d she says . \u201c People were n't trying to look good when they used the filters . \u201d But her younger sister , Sophia , who was a fifth grader at the time , disagrees . \u201c I definitely was \u2014 me and my friends definitely were , \u201d she says . \u201c Twelve -year - old girls having access to something that makes you not look like you 're 12 ? Like , that 's the coolest thing ever . You feel so pretty . \u201d When augmented - reality face filters first appeared on social media , they were a gimmick . They allowed users to play a kind of virtual dress - up : change your face to look like an animal , or suddenly grow a mustache , for example . Today , though , more and more young people \u2014 and especially teenage girls \u2014 are using filters that \u201c beautify \u201d their appearance and promise to deliver model - esque looks by sharpening , shrinking , enhancing , and recoloring their faces and bodies . Veronica and Sophia are both avid users of Snapchat , Instagram , and TikTok , where these filters are popular with millions of people . Through swipes and clicks , the array of face filters enable them to adjust their own image , and even sift through different identities , with new ease and flexibility . Veronica , now 19 , scrolls back to check pictures from the time on her i Phone . \u201c Wait , \u201d she says , stopping on one . \u201c Oh yeah ... I was definitely trying to look good . \u201d She shows me a picture of a glammed - up version of herself . She looks seductive . Her eyes are wide , lips slightly parted , and her skin looks tanned and airbrushed . \u201c That 's me when I 'm 14 , \u201d Veronica says . She seems distressed by the picture . Still , she says , she 's using filters almost every day . \u201c When I 'm going to use a face filter , it 's because there are certain things that I want to look different , \u201d she explains . \u201c So if I 'm not wearing makeup or if I think I do n't necessarily look my best , the beauty filter sort of changes certain things about your appearance and can fix certain parts of you . \u201d The face filters that have become commonplace across social media are perhaps the most widespread use of augmented reality . Researchers do n't yet understand the impact that sustained use of augmented reality may have , but they do know there are real risks \u2014 and with face filters , young girls are the ones taking that risk . They are subjects in an experiment that will show how the technology changes the way we form our identities , represent ourselves , and relate to others . And it 's all happening without much oversight . The rise of selfie culture Beauty filters are essentially automated photo editing tools that use artificial intelligence and computer vision to detect facial features and change them . They use computer vision to interpret the things the camera sees , and tweak them according to rules set by the filters ' creator . A computer detects a face and then overlays an invisible facial template consisting of dozens of dots , creating a sort of topographic mesh . Once that has been built , a universe of fantastical graphics can be attached to the mesh . The result can be anything from changing eye colors to planting devil horns on a person 's head . These real - time video filters are a recent advance , but beauty filters more broadly are an extension of the decades - old selfie phenomenon . The movement is rooted in Japanese \u201c kawaii \u201d culture , which obsesses over ( typically girly ) cuteness , and it developed when purikura \u2014 photo booths that allowed customers to decorate self - portraits \u2014 became staples in Japanese video arcades in the mid-1990s . In May of 1999 , Japanese electronics manufacturer Kyocera released the first mobile phone with a front - facing camera , and selfies started to break out to the mainstream . The rise of MySpace and Facebook internationalized selfies in the early 2000s , and the launch of Snapchat in 2011 marked the beginning of the iteration that we see today . The app offered quick messaging through pictures , and the selfie was an ideal medium for visually communicating one 's reactions , feelings , and moods . In 2013 , Oxford Dictionaries selected \u201c selfie \u201d as the word of the year , and by 2015 Snapchat had acquired the Ukrainian company Looksery and released the \u201c Lenses \u201d feature , much to the delight of Veronica 's middle school clique . Filters are now common across social media , though they take different forms . Instagram bundles beauty filters with its other augmented - reality facial filters , like those that add a dog 's ears and tongue to a person 's face . Snapchat offers a gallery of filters where users can swipe through beauty - enhancing effects on their selfie camera . Tik Tok 's beauty filter , meanwhile , is part of a setting called \u201c Enhance , \u201d where users can enable a standard beautification on any subject . And they are incredibly popular . Facebook and Instagram alone claim that over 600 million people have used at least one of the AR effects associated with the company 's products : a spokesperson said that beauty filters are a \u201c popular category \u201d of effects but would not elaborate further . Today , according to Bloomberg , almost a fifth of Facebook 's employees \u2014 about 10,000 people \u2014 are working on AR or VR products , and Mark Zuckerberg recently told The Information , \u201c I think it really makes sense for us to invest deeply to help shape what I think is going to be the next major computing platform , this combination of augmented and virtual reality . \u201d Snapchat boasts its own stunning numbers . A spokesperson said that \u201c 200 million daily active users play with or view Lenses every day to transform the way they look , augment the world around them , play games , and learn about the world , \u201d adding that more than 90 % of young people in the US , France , and the UK use the company 's AR products . Another measure of popularity might be how many filters exist . The majority of filters on Facebook 's various products are created by third - party users , and in the first year its tools were available , more than 400,000 creators released a total of over 1.2 million effects . By September 2020 , more than 150 creator accounts had each passed the milestone of 1 billion views . Face filters on social media might seem technologically unimpressive compared with some other uses of AR , but Jeremy Bailenson , the founding director of Stanford University 's Virtual Human Interaction Lab , says the real - time puppy filters are actually quite a technological feat . \u201c It 's hard to do that technically , \u201d he says . But thanks to neural networks , AI can now help achieve the kind of data processing required for real - time video altering . And the way it 's taken off in recent years surprises even longtime researchers like him . A \" beautiful \" community Many people enjoy filters and lenses \u2014 both as users and creators . Caroline Rocha , a makeup artist and photographer , says that social media filters \u2014 and Instagram 's in particular \u2014 provided her a lifeline at a crucial moment . In 2018 , she was at a personal low point : someone very dear to her had died , and then she suffered a stroke that resulted in temporary paralysis of her leg and permanent paralysis of her hand . Things got so overwhelming that she attempted suicide . \u201c I just wanted to come out of my reality , \u201d she says . \u201c My reality was dark . It was deep . I passed my days inside four walls . \u201d Filters felt like a breakthrough . They gave her \u201c the chance to travel \u2026 to experiment , to try on makeup , to try a piece of jewelry , \u201d she says . \u201c It opened a big window for me . \u201d She had studied art history in school , and Instagram filters felt like a deeply human and artistic world , full of opportunity and connection . She became friends with AR creators whose aesthetic spoke to her . Through that , she became a \u201c filters influencer , \u201d though she says she hates that term : she would try different filters and critique them for a growing audience of followers . Eventually , she started creating filters herself . Rocha became connected with creators like Marc Wakefield , an artist and AR designer who specializes in dark , fantastical effects . ( One of his hits is \u201c Hole in the Head , \u201d in which a see-through hole replaces the subject 's face . ) The community was \u201c so close and so helpful , \u201d she says \u2014 \u201c beautiful , \u201d even . She had no technical expertise when she started creating AR effects , and spent hours poring over help documents with help from others . Her first viral filter was called \u201c Alive \u201d : it overlaid the electrical pulse of a heartbeat right across the face of its subject . After a moment , the line distorts into a heart that encircles one eye before flashes of colored light illuminate the screen . Rocha says Alive was an homage to her own story of mental illness . Rocha 's experience is not unusual : many people enjoy the playfulness of the technology . Facebook describes AR effects as a way to \u201c make any moment more fun to share , \u201d while Snapchat says the goal of Lens \u201c is to provide fun and playful creative effects that allow our community to express themselves freely . \u201d But Rocha has changed her view . This artistic conception of filters now seems idealistic to her , not least because it is not necessarily representative of how the majority of people use filters . Artistic or funny filters may be popular , but they are dwarfed by beauty filters . Facebook and Snapchat were both hesitant to provide any data breaking out filters that are solely appearance enhancing from those that are more novel . Facebook 's creators categorize their own filters into 17 ambiguous buckets , whose names include \u201c Appearance , \u201d \u201c Selfies , \u201d \u201c Moods , \u201d and \u201c Camera styles . \u201d \u201c Appearance \u201d is in the top 10 most popular categories , said the Facebook spokesperson , but refused to elaborate further . Rocha says she sees many women on social media using filters nonstop . \u201c They refuse to be seen without these filters , because in their mind they think that they look like that , \u201d she says . \u201c It became , for me , a bit sick . \u201d In fact , she struggled with it herself . \u201c I've always fought against this kind of fakeness , \u201d she says , but \u201c I 'd say , ' Okay , I have to change my picture . I have to make my nose thinner and give myself a big lip because I feel ugly . ' And I was like , ' Whoa , Whoa , no , I 'm not like that . I want to feel beautiful without changing these things . ' \u201d She says the beauty - obsessed culture of AR filters has become increasingly disappointing : \u201c It has changed because , in my point of view ... the new generation of creators just want money and fame . \u201d \u201c There is a bad mood in the community , \u201d she says . \u201c It 's all about fame and number of followers , and I think it 's sad , because we are making art , and it 's about our emotions \u2026 It 's very sad what 's happening right now . \u201d Veronica , the teenager , sees the same patterns . \u201c If someone is completely portraying themselves in one filter and has only posted photos in a filter meeting all of the beauty standards and gaining followers and making money off of the beauty standard that we have right now \u2014 I do n't know if that 's , like , genius or if that 's terrible , \u201d she says . Claire Pescott is a researcher at the University of South Wales who studies the behavior of preteens on social media . In focus groups , she 's observed a gender difference when it comes to filters . \u201c All of the boys said , ' These are really fun . I like to put on these funny ears , I like to share them with my friends and we have a laugh , '\u201d she says . Young girls , however , see AR filters primarily as a tool for beautification : \u201c [ The girls ] were all saying things like , ' I put this filter on because I have flawless skin . It takes away my scars and spots . ' And these were children of 10 and 11 . \u201d \u201c I do n't think it 's just filtering your actual image , \u201d she says . \u201c It 's filtering your whole life . \u201d And this change is only just beginning . AR filters on social media are part of a rapidly growing suite of automated digital beauty technologies . The app Facetune has been downloaded over 60 million times and exists simply for easy video and photo editing . Presets are a recent phenomenon in which creators \u2014 and established influencers in particular \u2014 create and sell custom filters in Adobe Lightroom . Even Zoom has a \u201c touch up my appearance \u201d feature that gives the appearance of smoother skin in video calls . Many have heralded the option to buff your appearance as a low - effort savior during the pandemic . Reality distortion field During our conversations , I asked Veronica to define what an \u201c Instagram Face \u201d looks like . She replied quickly and confidently : \u201c Small nose , big eyes , clear skin , big lips . \u201d This aesthetic relies on categories of AR effects called \u201c deformation \u201d and \u201c face distortion . \u201d As opposed to the Zoom-like touch - up that simply blends skin tones or saturates eye color , distortion effects allow creators to easily change the shape and size of certain facial features , creating things like a \u201c bigger lip , \u201d a \u201c lifted eyebrow , \u201d or a \u201c narrower jaw , \u201d according to Rocha . Teenagers Sophia and Veronica say they prefer distortion filters . One of Sophia 's favorites makes her look like singer and influencer Madison Beer . \u201c It has these massive lashes that make my eyes look beautiful . My lips triple in size and my nose is tinier , \u201d she says . But she 's cautious : \u201c Nobody looks like that unless you are Madison Beer or someone who has a really , really good nose job . \u201d Veronica 's \u201c ideal \u201d filter , meanwhile , is a distortion filter called Naomi Beauty on Snapchat , which she says all her friends use . \u201c It is one of the top filters for two reasons , \u201d she says . \u201c It clears your skin and it makes your eyes huge . \u201d There are thousands of distortion filters available on major social platforms , with names like La Belle , Natural Beauty , and Boss Babe . Even the goofy Big Mouth on Snapchat , one of social media 's most popular filters , is made with distortion effects . In October 2019 , Facebook banned distortion effects because of \u201c public debate about potential negative impact . \u201d Awareness of body dysmorphia was rising , and a filter called FixMe , which allowed users to mark up their faces as a cosmetic surgeon might , had sparked a surge of criticism for encouraging plastic surgery . But in August 2020 , the effects were re-released with a new policy banning filters that explicitly promoted surgery . Effects that resize facial features , however , are still allowed . ( When asked about the decision , a spokesperson directed me to Facebook 's press release from that time . ) When the effects were re-released , Rocha decided to take a stand and began posting condemnations of body shaming online . She committed to stop using deformation effects herself unless they are clearly humorous or dramatic rather than beautifying and says she did n't want to \u201c be responsible \u201d for the harmful effects some filters were having on women : some , she says , have looked into getting plastic surgery that makes them look like their filtered self . \u201c I wish I was wearing a filter right now \" Krista Crotty is a clinical education specialist at the Emily Program , a leading center on eating disorders and mental health based in St. Paul , Minnesota . Much of her job over the past five years has focused on educating patients about how to consume media in a healthier way . She says that when patients present themselves differently online and in person , she sees an increase in anxiety . \u201c People are putting up information about themselves \u2014 whether it 's size , shape , weight , whatever \u2014 that is n't anything like what they actually look like , \u201d she says . \u201c In between that authentic self and digital self lives a lot of anxiety , because it 's not who you really are . You do n't look like the photos that have been filtered . \u201d For young people , who are still working out who they are , navigating between a digital and authentic self can be particularly complicated , and it 's not clear what the long - term consequences will be . \u201c Identity online is kind of like an artifact , almost , \u201d says Claire Pescott , the researcher from the University of South Wales . \u201c It 's a kind of projected image of yourself . \u201d Pescott 's observations of children have led her to conclude that filters can have a positive impact on them . \u201c They can kind of try out different personas , \u201d she explains . \u201c They have these ' of the moment ' identities that they could change , and they can evolve with different groups . \u201d But she doubts that all young people are able to understand how filters affect their sense of self . And she 's concerned about the way social media platforms grant immediate validation and feedback in the form of likes and comments . Young girls , she says , have particular difficulty differentiating between filtered photos and ordinary ones . Pescott 's research also revealed that while children are now often taught about online behavior , they receive \u201c very little education \u201d about filters . Their safety training \u201c was linked to overt physical dangers of social media , not the emotional , more nuanced side of social media , \u201d she says , \u201c which I think is more dangerous . \u201d Bailenson expects that we can learn about some of these emotional unknowns from established VR research . In virtual environments , people 's behavior changes with the physical characteristics of their avatar , a phenomenon called the Proteus effect . Bailenson found , for example , that people who had taller avatars were more likely to behave confidently than those with shorter avatars . \u201c We know that visual representations of the self , when used in a meaningful way during social interactions , do change our attitudes and behaviors , \u201d he says . But sometimes those actions can play on stereotypes . A well - known study from 1988 found that athletes who wore black uniforms were more aggressive and violent while playing sports than those wearing white uniforms . And this translates to the digital world : one recent study showed that video game players who used avatars of the opposite sex actually behaved in a way that was gender stereotypical . Bailenson says we should expect to see similar behavior on social media as people adopt masks based on filtered versions of their own faces , rather than entirely different characters . \u201c The world of filtered video , in my opinion \u2014 and we have n't tested this yet \u2014 is going to behave very similarly to the world of filtered avatars , \u201d he says . Selfie regulation Considering the power and pervasiveness of filters , there is very little hard research about their impact \u2014 and even fewer guardrails around their use . I asked Bailenson , who is the father of two young girls , how he thinks about his daughters ' use of AR filters . \u201c It 's a real tough one , \u201d he says , \u201c because it goes against everything that we 're taught in all of our basic cartoons , which is ' Be yourself . ' \u201d Bailenson also says that playful use is different from real-time , constant augmentation of ourselves , and understanding what these different contexts mean for kids is important . What few regulations and restrictions there are on filter use rely on companies to police themselves . Facebook 's filters , for example , have to go through an approval process that , according to the spokesperson , uses \u201c a combination of human and automated systems to review effects as they are submitted for publishing . \u201d They are reviewed for certain issues , such as hate speech or nudity , and users are also able to report filters , which then get manually reviewed . The company says it consults regularly with expert groups , such as the National Eating Disorders Association and the JED Foundation , a mental - health nonprofit . \" We know people may feel pressure to look a certain way on social media , and we 're taking steps to address this across Instagram and Facebook , \" said a statement from Instagram . \" We know effects can play a role , so we ban ones that clearly promote eating disorders or that encourage potentially dangerous cosmetic surgery procedures \u2026 And we 're working on more products to help reduce the pressure people may feel on our platforms , like the option to hide like counts . \" Facebook and Snapchat also label filtered photos to show that they 've been transformed \u2014 but it 's easy to get around the labels by simply applying the edits outside of the apps , or by downloading and reuploading a filtered photo . Labeling might be important , but Pescott says she does n't think it will dramatically improve an unhealthy beauty culture online . \u201c I do n't know whether it would make a huge amount of difference , because I think it 's the fact we 're seeing it , even though we know it 's not real . We still have that aspiration to look that way , \u201d she says . Instead , she believes that the images children are exposed to should be more diverse , more authentic , and less filtered . There 's another concern , too , especially since the majority of users are very young : the amount of biometric data that TikTok , Snapchat and Facebook have collected through these filters . Though both Facebook and Snapchat say they do not use filter technology to collect personally identifiable data , a review of their privacy policies shows that they do indeed have the right to store data from the photographs and videos on the platforms . Snapchat 's policy says that snaps and chats are deleted from its servers once the message is opened or expires , but stories are stored longer . Instagram stores photo and video data as long as it wants or until the account is deleted ; Instagram also collects data on what users see through its camera . Meanwhile , these companies continue to concentrate on AR . In a speech made to investors in February 2021 , Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel said \u201c our camera is already capable of extraordinary things . But it is augmented reality that 's driving our future \u201d , and the company is \u201c doubling down \u201d on augmented reality in 2021 , calling the technology \u201c a utility \u201d . And while both Facebook and Snapchat say that the facial detection systems behind filters do n't connect back to the identity of users , it 's worth remembering that Facebook 's smart photo tagging feature \u2014 which looks at your pictures and tries to identify people who might be in them \u2014 was one of the earliest large - scale commercial uses of facial recognition . And Tik Tok recently settled for $ 92 million in a lawsuit that alleged the company was misusing facial recognition for ad targeting . A spokesperson from Snapchat said \" Snap 's Lens product does not collect any identifiable information about a user and we ca n't use it to tie back to , or identify , individuals . \" And Facebook in particular sees facial recognition as part of it 's AR strategy . In a January 2021 blog post titled \u201c No Looking Back , \u201d Andrew Bosworth , the head of Facebook Reality Labs , wrote : \u201c It 's early days , but we 're intent on giving creators more to do in AR and with greater capabilities . \u201d The company 's planned release of AR glasses is highly anticipated , and it has already teased the possible use of facial recognition as part of the product . In light of all the effort it takes to navigate this complex world , Sophia and Veronica say they just wish they were better educated about beauty filters . Besides their parents , no one ever helped them make sense of it all . \u201c You should n't have to get a specific college degree to figure out that something could be unhealthy for you , \u201d Veronica says .

Still , she says , she 's using filters almost every day . \u201c When I 'm going to use a face filter , it 's because there are certain things that I want to look different , \u201d she explains . \u201c So if I 'm not wearing makeup or if I think I do n't necessarily look my best , the beauty filter sort of changes certain things about your appearance and can fix certain parts of you . \u201d The face filters that have become commonplace across social media are perhaps the most widespread use of augmented reality . Researchers do n't yet understand the impact that sustained use of augmented reality may have , but they do know there are real risks \u2014 and with face filters , young girls are the ones taking that risk . They are subjects in an experiment that will show how the technology changes the way we form our identities , represent ourselves , and relate to others . And it 's all happening without much oversight . The rise of selfie culture Beauty filters are essentially automated photo editing tools that use artificial intelligence and computer vision to detect facial features and change them . They use computer vision to interpret the things the camera sees , and tweak them according to rules set by the filters ' creator . A computer detects a face and then overlays an invisible facial template consisting of dozens of dots , creating a sort of topographic mesh . Once that has been built , a universe of fantastical graphics can be attached to the mesh . The result can be anything from changing eye colors to planting devil horns on a person 's head . These real - time video filters are a recent advance , but beauty filters more broadly are an extension of the decades - old selfie phenomenon . The movement is rooted in Japanese \u201c kawaii \u201d culture , which obsesses over ( typically girly ) cuteness , and it developed when purikura \u2014 photo booths that allowed customers to decorate self - portraits \u2014 became staples in Japanese video arcades in the mid-1990s . In May of 1999 , Japanese electronics manufacturer Kyocera released the first mobile phone with a front - facing camera , and selfies started to break out to the mainstream . The rise of MySpace and Facebook internationalized selfies in the early 2000s , and the launch of Snapchat in 2011 marked the beginning of the iteration that we see today . The app offered quick messaging through pictures , and the selfie was an ideal medium for visually communicating one 's reactions , feelings , and moods . In 2013 , Oxford Dictionaries selected \u201c selfie \u201d as the word of the year , and by 2015 Snapchat had acquired the Ukrainian company Looksery and released the \u201c Lenses \u201d feature , much to the delight of Veronica 's middle school clique . Filters are now common across social media , though they take different forms . Instagram bundles beauty filters with its other augmented - reality facial filters , like those that add a dog 's ears and tongue to a person 's face . Snapchat offers a gallery of filters where users can swipe through beauty - enhancing effects on their selfie camera . Tik Tok 's beauty filter , meanwhile , is part of a setting called \u201c Enhance , \u201d where users can enable a standard beautification on any subject . And they are incredibly popular . Facebook and Instagram alone claim that over 600 million people have used at least one of the AR effects associated with the company 's products : a spokesperson said that beauty filters are a \u201c popular category \u201d of effects but would not elaborate further . Today , according to Bloomberg , almost a fifth of Facebook 's employees \u2014 about 10,000 people \u2014 are working on AR or VR products , and Mark Zuckerberg recently told The Information , \u201c I think it really makes sense for us to invest deeply to help shape what I think is going to be the next major computing platform , this combination of augmented and virtual reality . \u201d Snapchat boasts its own stunning numbers . A spokesperson said that \u201c 200 million daily active users play with or view Lenses every day to transform the way they look , augment the world around them , play games , and learn about the world , \u201d adding that more than 90 % of young people in the US , France , and the UK use the company 's AR products . Another measure of popularity might be how many filters exist . The majority of filters on Facebook 's various products are created by third - party users , and in the first year its tools were available , more than 400,000 creators released a total of over 1.2 million effects . By September 2020 , more than 150 creator accounts had each passed the milestone of 1 billion views . Face filters on social media might seem technologically unimpressive compared with some other uses of AR , but Jeremy Bailenson , the founding director of Stanford University 's Virtual Human Interaction Lab , says the real - time puppy filters are actually quite a technological feat . \u201c It 's hard to do that technically , \u201d he says . But thanks to neural networks , AI can now help achieve the kind of data processing required for real - time video altering . And the way it 's taken off in recent years surprises even longtime researchers like him . A \" beautiful \" community Many people enjoy filters and lenses \u2014 both as users and creators . Caroline Rocha , a makeup artist and photographer , says that social media filters \u2014 and Instagram 's in particular \u2014 provided her a lifeline at a crucial moment . In 2018 , she was at a personal low point : someone very dear to her had died , and then she suffered a stroke that resulted in temporary paralysis of her leg and permanent paralysis of her hand . Things got so overwhelming that she attempted suicide . \u201c I just wanted to come out of my reality , \u201d she says . \u201c My reality was dark . It was deep . I passed my days inside four walls . \u201d Filters felt like a breakthrough . They gave her \u201c the chance to travel \u2026 to experiment , to try on makeup , to try a piece of jewelry , \u201d she says . \u201c It opened a big window for me . \u201d She had studied art history in school , and Instagram filters felt like a deeply human and artistic world , full of opportunity and connection . She became friends with AR creators whose aesthetic spoke to her . Through that , she became a \u201c filters influencer , \u201d though she says she hates that term : she would try different filters and critique them for a growing audience of followers . Eventually , she started creating filters herself . Rocha became connected with creators like Marc Wakefield , an artist and AR designer who specializes in dark , fantastical effects . ( One of his hits is \u201c Hole in the Head , \u201d in which a see-through hole replaces the subject 's face . ) The community was \u201c so close and so helpful , \u201d she says \u2014 \u201c beautiful , \u201d even . She had no technical expertise when she started creating AR effects , and spent hours poring over help documents with help from others . Her first viral filter was called \u201c Alive \u201d : it overlaid the electrical pulse of a heartbeat right across the face of its subject . After a moment , the line distorts into a heart that encircles one eye before flashes of colored light illuminate the screen . Rocha says Alive was an homage to her own story of mental illness . Rocha 's experience is not unusual : many people enjoy the playfulness of the technology . Facebook describes AR effects as a way to \u201c make any moment more fun to share , \u201d while Snapchat says the goal of Lens \u201c is to provide fun and playful creative effects that allow our community to express themselves freely . \u201d But Rocha has changed her view . This artistic conception of filters now seems idealistic to her , not least because it is not necessarily representative of how the majority of people use filters . Artistic or funny filters may be popular , but they are dwarfed by beauty filters . Facebook and Snapchat were both hesitant to provide any data breaking out filters that are solely appearance enhancing from those that are more novel . Facebook 's creators categorize their own filters into 17 ambiguous buckets , whose names include \u201c Appearance , \u201d \u201c Selfies , \u201d \u201c Moods , \u201d and \u201c Camera styles . \u201d \u201c Appearance \u201d is in the top 10 most popular categories , said the Facebook spokesperson , but refused to elaborate further . Rocha says she sees many women on social media using filters nonstop . \u201c They refuse to be seen without these filters , because in their mind they think that they look like that , \u201d she says . \u201c It became , for me , a bit sick . \u201d In fact , she struggled with it herself . \u201c I've always fought against this kind of fakeness , \u201d she says , but \u201c I 'd say , ' Okay , I have to change my picture . I have to make my nose thinner and give myself a big lip because I feel ugly . ' And I was like , ' Whoa , Whoa , no , I 'm not like that . I want to feel beautiful without changing these things . ' \u201d She says the beauty - obsessed culture of AR filters has become increasingly disappointing : \u201c It has changed because , in my point of view ... the new generation of creators just want money and fame . \u201d \u201c There is a bad mood in the community , \u201d she says . \u201c It 's all about fame and number of followers , and I think it 's sad , because we are making art , and it 's about our emotions \u2026 It 's very sad what 's happening right now . \u201d Veronica , the teenager , sees the same patterns . \u201c If someone is completely portraying themselves in one filter and has only posted photos in a filter meeting all of the beauty standards and gaining followers and making money off of the beauty standard that we have right now \u2014 I do n't know if that 's , like , genius or if that 's terrible , \u201d she says . Claire Pescott is a researcher at the University of South Wales who studies the behavior of preteens on social media . In focus groups , she 's observed a gender difference when it comes to filters . \u201c All of the boys said , ' These are really fun . I like to put on these funny ears , I like to share them with my friends and we have a laugh , '\u201d she says . Young girls , however , see AR filters primarily as a tool for beautification : \u201c [ The girls ] were all saying things like , ' I put this filter on because I have flawless skin . It takes away my scars and spots . ' And these were children of 10 and 11 . \u201d \u201c I do n't think it 's just filtering your actual image , \u201d she says . \u201c It 's filtering your whole life . \u201d And this change is only just beginning . AR filters on social media are part of a rapidly growing suite of automated digital beauty technologies . The app Facetune has been downloaded over 60 million times and exists simply for easy video and photo editing . Presets are a recent phenomenon in which creators \u2014 and established influencers in particular \u2014 create and sell custom filters in Adobe Lightroom . Even Zoom has a \u201c touch up my appearance \u201d feature that gives the appearance of smoother skin in video calls . Many have heralded the option to buff your appearance as a low - effort savior during the pandemic . Reality distortion field During our conversations , I asked Veronica to define what an \u201c Instagram Face \u201d looks like . She replied quickly and confidently : \u201c Small nose , big eyes , clear skin , big lips . \u201d This aesthetic relies on categories of AR effects called \u201c deformation \u201d and \u201c face distortion . \u201d As opposed to the Zoom-like touch - up that simply blends skin tones or saturates eye color , distortion effects allow creators to easily change the shape and size of certain facial features , creating things like a \u201c bigger lip , \u201d a \u201c lifted eyebrow , \u201d or a \u201c narrower jaw , \u201d according to Rocha . Teenagers Sophia and Veronica say they prefer distortion filters . One of Sophia 's favorites makes her look like singer and influencer Madison Beer . \u201c It has these massive lashes that make my eyes look beautiful . My lips triple in size and my nose is tinier , \u201d she says . But she 's cautious : \u201c Nobody looks like that unless you are Madison Beer or someone who has a really , really good nose job . \u201d Veronica 's \u201c ideal \u201d filter , meanwhile , is a distortion filter called Naomi Beauty on Snapchat , which she says all her friends use . \u201c It is one of the top filters for two reasons , \u201d she says . \u201c It clears your skin and it makes your eyes huge . \u201d There are thousands of distortion filters available on major social platforms , with names like La Belle , Natural Beauty , and Boss Babe . Even the goofy Big Mouth on Snapchat , one of social media 's most popular filters , is made with distortion effects . In October 2019 , Facebook banned distortion effects because of \u201c public debate about potential negative impact . \u201d Awareness of body dysmorphia was rising , and a filter called FixMe , which allowed users to mark up their faces as a cosmetic surgeon might , had sparked a surge of criticism for encouraging plastic surgery . But in August 2020 , the effects were re-released with a new policy banning filters that explicitly promoted surgery . Effects that resize facial features , however , are still allowed . ( When asked about the decision , a spokesperson directed me to Facebook 's press release from that time . ) When the effects were re-released , Rocha decided to take a stand and began posting condemnations of body shaming online . She committed to stop using deformation effects herself unless they are clearly humorous or dramatic rather than beautifying and says she did n't want to \u201c be responsible \u201d for the harmful effects some filters were having on women : some , she says , have looked into getting plastic surgery that makes them look like their filtered self . \u201c I wish I was wearing a filter right now \" Krista Crotty is a clinical education specialist at the Emily Program , a leading center on eating disorders and mental health based in St. Paul , Minnesota . Much of her job over the past five years has focused on educating patients about how to consume media in a healthier way . She says that when patients present themselves differently online and in person , she sees an increase in anxiety . \u201c People are putting up information about themselves \u2014 whether it 's size , shape , weight , whatever \u2014 that is n't anything like what they actually look like , \u201d she says . \u201c In between that authentic self and digital self lives a lot of anxiety , because it 's not who you really are . You do n't look like the photos that have been filtered . \u201d For young people , who are still working out who they are , navigating between a digital and authentic self can be particularly complicated , and it 's not clear what the long - term consequences will be . \u201c Identity online is kind of like an artifact , almost , \u201d says Claire Pescott , the researcher from the University of South Wales . \u201c It 's a kind of projected image of yourself . \u201d Pescott 's observations of children have led her to conclude that filters can have a positive impact on them . \u201c They can kind of try out different personas , \u201d she explains . \u201c They have these ' of the moment ' identities that they could change , and they can evolve with different groups . \u201d But she doubts that all young people are able to understand how filters affect their sense of self . And she 's concerned about the way social media platforms grant immediate validation and feedback in the form of likes and comments . Young girls , she says , have particular difficulty differentiating between filtered photos and ordinary ones . Pescott 's research also revealed that while children are now often taught about online behavior , they receive \u201c very little education \u201d about filters . Their safety training \u201c was linked to overt physical dangers of social media , not the emotional , more nuanced side of social media , \u201d she says , \u201c which I think is more dangerous . \u201d Bailenson expects that we can learn about some of these emotional unknowns from established VR research . In virtual environments , people 's behavior changes with the physical characteristics of their avatar , a phenomenon called the Proteus effect . Bailenson found , for example , that people who had taller avatars were more likely to behave confidently than those with shorter avatars . \u201c We know that visual representations of the self , when used in a meaningful way during social interactions , do change our attitudes and behaviors , \u201d he says . But sometimes those actions can play on stereotypes . A well - known study from 1988 found that athletes who wore black uniforms were more aggressive and violent while playing sports than those wearing white uniforms . And this translates to the digital world : one recent study showed that video game players who used avatars of the opposite sex actually behaved in a way that was gender stereotypical . Bailenson says we should expect to see similar behavior on social media as people adopt masks based on filtered versions of their own faces , rather than entirely different characters . \u201c The world of filtered video , in my opinion \u2014 and we have n't tested this yet \u2014 is going to behave very similarly to the world of filtered avatars , \u201d he says . Selfie regulation Considering the power and pervasiveness of filters , there is very little hard research about their impact \u2014 and even fewer guardrails around their use . I asked Bailenson , who is the father of two young girls , how he thinks about his daughters ' use of AR filters . \u201c It 's a real tough one , \u201d he says , \u201c because it goes against everything that we 're taught in all of our basic cartoons , which is ' Be yourself . ' \u201d Bailenson also says that playful use is different from real-time , constant augmentation of ourselves , and understanding what these different contexts mean for kids is important . What few regulations and restrictions there are on filter use rely on companies to police themselves . Facebook 's filters , for example , have to go through an approval process that , according to the spokesperson , uses \u201c a combination of human and automated systems to review effects as they are submitted for publishing . \u201d They are reviewed for certain issues , such as hate speech or nudity , and users are also able to report filters , which then get manually reviewed . The company says it consults regularly with expert groups , such as the National Eating Disorders Association and the JED Foundation , a mental - health nonprofit . \" We know people may feel pressure to look a certain way on social media , and we 're taking steps to address this across Instagram and Facebook , \" said a statement from Instagram . \" We know effects can play a role , so we ban ones that clearly promote eating disorders or that encourage potentially dangerous cosmetic surgery procedures \u2026 And we 're working on more products to help reduce the pressure people may feel on our platforms , like the option to hide like counts . \" Facebook and Snapchat also label filtered photos to show that they 've been transformed \u2014 but it 's easy to get around the labels by simply applying the edits outside of the apps , or by downloading and reuploading a filtered photo . Labeling might be important , but Pescott says she does n't think it will dramatically improve an unhealthy beauty culture online . \u201c I do n't know whether it would make a huge amount of difference , because I think it 's the fact we 're seeing it , even though we know it 's not real . We still have that aspiration to look that way , \u201d she says . Instead , she believes that the images children are exposed to should be more diverse , more authentic , and less filtered . There 's another concern , too , especially since the majority of users are very young : the amount of biometric data that TikTok , Snapchat and Facebook have collected through these filters . Though both Facebook and Snapchat say they do not use filter technology to collect personally identifiable data , a review of their privacy policies shows that they do indeed have the right to store data from the photographs and videos on the platforms . Snapchat 's policy says that snaps and chats are deleted from its servers once the message is opened or expires , but stories are stored longer . Instagram stores photo and video data as long as it wants or until the account is deleted ; Instagram also collects data on what users see through its camera . Meanwhile , these companies continue to concentrate on AR . In a speech made to investors in February 2021 , Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel said \u201c our camera is already capable of extraordinary things . But it is augmented reality that 's driving our future \u201d , and the company is \u201c doubling down \u201d on augmented reality in 2021 , calling the technology \u201c a utility \u201d . And while both Facebook and Snapchat say that the facial detection systems behind filters do n't connect back to the identity of users , it 's worth remembering that Facebook 's smart photo tagging feature \u2014 which looks at your pictures and tries to identify people who might be in them \u2014 was one of the earliest large - scale commercial uses of facial recognition . And Tik Tok recently settled for $ 92 million in a lawsuit that alleged the company was misusing facial recognition for ad targeting . A spokesperson from Snapchat said \" Snap 's Lens product does not collect any identifiable information about a user and we ca n't use it to tie back to , or identify , individuals . \" And Facebook in particular sees facial recognition as part of it 's AR strategy . In a January 2021 blog post titled \u201c No Looking Back , \u201d Andrew Bosworth , the head of Facebook Reality Labs , wrote : \u201c It 's early days , but we 're intent on giving creators more to do in AR and with greater capabilities . \u201d The company 's planned release of AR glasses is highly anticipated , and it has already teased the possible use of facial recognition as part of the product . In light of all the effort it takes to navigate this complex world , Sophia and Veronica say they just wish they were better educated about beauty filters . Besides their parents , no one ever helped them make sense of it all . \u201c You should n't have to get a specific college degree to figure out that something could be unhealthy for you , \u201d Veronica says .

Illustration by Kojima from our Castlevania : Symphony of the Night art gallery . Although Ayami Kojima has also created art for several Koei games through the years , such as S\u00f6ldnerschild and Dynasty Warriors , it is Castlevania that has become inseparably attached to her name .

The artist has also admitted to being a long - time fan of shounen manga , despite the majority of it catering toward a young male audience . Regarding her unique drawing style and affinity for using acrylic gouache , Kojima says she began painting with watercolor paints and colored pencils while she was still attending school . She used to enjoy visiting painting shops and buying new drawing materials based on how attractive the packaging was , even if she had little knowledge of how to use it . In this way , she became familiar with many traditional drawing media and learned how to use them through trial and error . Tools of an artist . Ayami Kojima 's workspace is stocked with traditional drawing media . Kojima has been featured in several art technique books , such as the Japanese Color Kingdom series and the Comickers magazine series , which showcase techniques used by popular Japanese manga artists as well as western comic artists . The series of personal techniques Kojima typically employs in her paintings is to first make a rough sketch with cont\u00e9 crayon sticks or pastels , then create shadows with more cont\u00e9 and india ink . Depth and textures are often added , usually to the background , by spreading and shaping molding paste with a palette knife to create her three - dimensional signature style . Base colors are then painted into the work using diluted acrylics . As more prominant coloring is added , finger smudging is used to create glows . The work is then brought to completion with metallic paint highlights and finishing touches , and enhanced with a gloss polymer finish .

The artist has also admitted to being a long - time fan of shounen manga , despite the majority of it catering toward a young male audience . Regarding her unique drawing style and affinity for using acrylic gouache , Kojima says she began painting with watercolor paints and colored pencils while she was still attending school . She used to enjoy visiting painting shops and buying new drawing materials based on how attractive the packaging was , even if she had little knowledge of how to use it . In this way , she became familiar with many traditional drawing media and learned how to use them through trial and error . Tools of an artist . Ayami Kojima 's workspace is stocked with traditional drawing media . Kojima has been featured in several art technique books , such as the Japanese Color Kingdom series and the Comickers magazine series , which showcase techniques used by popular Japanese manga artists as well as western comic artists . The series of personal techniques Kojima typically employs in her paintings is to first make a rough sketch with cont\u00e9 crayon sticks or pastels , then create shadows with more cont\u00e9 and india ink . Depth and textures are often added , usually to the background , by spreading and shaping molding paste with a palette knife to create her three - dimensional signature style . Base colors are then painted into the work using diluted acrylics . As more prominant coloring is added , finger smudging is used to create glows . The work is then brought to completion with metallic paint highlights and finishing touches , and enhanced with a gloss polymer finish . A detailed step-by-step look at the whole process is featured in the third issue of the Japanese Color Kingdom art technique book series , which also features the process of fellow game artist Shinkiro ( Toshiaki Mori ) .

Kojima 's involvement in the games industry has been fairly absent in recent years , and sorely missed , but the Kickstarter for Bloodstained : Ritual of the Night has secured her cooperation for a special packaging artwork for backers at the $ 100 level .

Read , quoted in Magritte : Paintings , Drawings , Gouaches , exh. cat. , Obelisk Gallery , London , 1961 , p. 33 ) . Les compagnons de la peur was painted in 1942 and therefore ranks as one of the earliest of Ren\u00e9 Magritte 's pictures of what would become one of his most recognised motifs : the leaf - bird . This painting has featured in a string of important exhibitions of Magritte 's works , including several lifetime shows . Among these , of particular note were the exhibition at the Obelisk Gallery in London in 1961 , which resulted in his first visit to the British capital since before the Second World War , and his 1966 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art , New York . That show later travelled to a number of destinations - as did Magritte himself , when he visited the United States for the opening . Of the early examples featuring images of the ' leaf - bird ' , Les compagnons de la peur is the largest ; three other paintings dating from around 1942 are all significantly smaller . Of those , L'\u00eele au tr\u00e9sor ( Sylvester ; no. 498 ) is now in the collection of the Mus\u00e9es Royaux des Beaux - Arts de Belgique , Brussels , having been bequeathed by Magritte 's widow , Georgette , who herself had bought the picture back from a collector ( see D. Sylvester , Ren\u00e9 Magritte Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 , vol. II , London , 1993 , p. 294 ) . Another image showing owls and entitled Les compagnons de la peur is the gouache version , also of 1942 , likewise now held by the Mus\u00e9es Royaux des Beaux - Arts de Belgique , Brussels . There are several clear differences between Les compagnons de la peur and L'\u00eele au tr\u00e9sor and the various pictures that have been given that title . Crucially , those other works show birds rooted into the soil of an island , as opposed to the alpine landscape of Les compagnons de la peur . Perhaps it is in keeping with this mountainous backdrop that in Les compagnons de la peur Magritte has chosen to depict owls , rather than pigeons . These vigilant , predatory creatures , more frequently heard at night than seen during the day , are here presented in a watchful cluster , surveying their surroundings . The birds clearly have an affinity with their setting . At the same time , the nature of their new incarnation , part fauna and part flora , reveals a new incongruity . These are birds : fight is one of their key properties and characteristics . Yet here they have been melded with the sphere of plant life and become rooted to the ground . In this way , the ' leaf - bird ' can be seen as an extension of Magritte 's long - standing fascination with fight and buoyancy . Some of Magritte 's paintings would show , say , clouds sitting on the ground or a castle perched on an impossibly floating rock . In the 1930s , he had also explored the motif of mountains formed as though resembling a petrified eagle in works entitled Le pr\u00e9curseur , a theme that would later be transported into other works named Le domaine d'Arnheim . In a sense , those mountain - hawks are a form of precedent to Les compagnons de la peur : here , instead of blending the realms of mineral and animal , though , Magritte has fused animal and vegetable , creating hybrid entities which help the viewer to understand more about birds , about fight and about the slow vertical climb of plants as they grow . At the same time , the link between birds and plants may have been suggested in part by the similarity in shape of leaves and feathers that clad them . Certainly , in other works , Magritte would show birds perching on the veins of his leaf-trees , underscoring this connection between flora and fauna in his mind . In another group of works , he even showed cut-out - like silhouettes of birds made of the forest , showing the profundity with which trees and birds are linked , bringing this natural affinity to the attention of his viewer through unusual and unorthodox means . Les compagnons de la peur was painted in 1942 , during the Occupation of Belgium in the midst of the Second World War . Magritte did not really paint the war in the way that some artists felt compelled to do . However , during the earlier years of the conflict , an atmosphere of foreboding entered some of his pictures ; this may well be perceived in the apparent watchfulness of the owl - plants in Les compagnons de la peur - and indeed in its title . The birds are huddled together , half predators , half targets , bound to the ground they occupy . These largely solitary birds are here shown seeking safety in numbers in their mountain fastness . Even in the companion pictures showing birds on an island , there is a sense of both stranding and refuge that may well reflect some of the ambience in Belgium at the time . This would be all the more true considering the number of Magritte 's associates in international Surrealism whose works had fallen foul to the Nazi authorities , being deemed ' Entartete Kunst ' . This had caused a number of his contemporaries to fee France when the war had begun ; Magritte had also fed to France , but , separated from his wife Georgette , had turned back and undertaken an epic journey to return home to be with her . Throughout this period , despite being in Nazi-occupied Belgium , he continued to paint and indeed to publish his works - a monograph written during this time even featured surprisingly lavish colour illustrations . It was only shortly after Les compagnons de la peur was painted that Magritte , having long struggled with the question of how to respond to the war as an artist , developed his faux - Impressionist technique , a visual idiom that was intended to bring light and humour to his viewers - as well as a shock . The pictures worked on all these fronts , outraging even some of his loyal supporters . However , Les compagnons de la peur was painted before this epiphany , making it all the rarer , remaining rooted in a more sinister moment . It is the product of a time of intense questioning on Magritte 's part , a period during which he sought inspiration and found a number of pictorial solutions . Many of these would continue to remain in his visual arsenal for the rest of his life , not least the bird - leaf itself . This motif 's importance would be reaffirmed on a monumental scale when it became one of the subjects that Magritte included in his large - scale mural programme for the Casino communal de Knokke just over a decade after he had painted Les compagnons de la peur . When Les compagnons de la peur was owned by Jack Stafford , a London - based collector , it was lent to the Obelisk Gallery for its 1961 show of Magritte 's works . Magritte himself travelled to London for the opening , albeit reluctantly , as he wrote to his friend Harry Torczyner earlier : ' I have no desire at all to go to London , but I will probably have to give in to the pressure of my wife , who feels that my presence at the opening is indispensable and that I must respond to the invitations I receive , too many to my taste ' ( Magritte , letter to Torczyner , 9 September 1961 , quoted in R. Magritte , Magritte / Torczyner : Letters Between Friends , New York , 1994 , p. 66 ) . The show was a significant event . At one point , it was advertised in The Arts Review in conjunction with another exhibition showing a group of works largely taken from the collection of E.L.T. Mesens , held at the Grosvenor Gallery . The two shows became very separate , however , in part a legacy of the changing relationship between Mesens and Philip M. Laski , the main organiser of the Obelisk exhibition . This reached a culmination when the Daily Express reported that Laski had told Mesens to steer clear of his own show , in response to which Magritte himself had said : ' It is very much in the surrealist tradition to have a row . I would have been disappointed if there had n't been one ' ( Magritte , quoted in D. Sylvester , Ren\u00e9 Magritte Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 , vol. III , London , 1993 , p. 115 ) . For the Obelisk Gallery exhibition in which Les compagnons de la peur was featured - and was one of only eight pictures selected for illustration in the catalogue - Laski worked hard to prepare a significant show , borrowing works from a wide range of collectors . He also assembled an impressive catalogue that contained an essay written by Magritte which was translated by Laski himself . In addition to this there were important bibliographies and exhibition histories as well as a range of statements , quotes and poems from a number of significant figures from the avant garde including poets , critics , collectors and artists alike , such as Jean Arp , Andr\u00e9 Breton , Paul Eluard , Max Ernst , Ren\u00e9 Gaff\u00e9 , Wifredo Lam , Man Ray and Roland Penrose . The inclusion of Breton 's text in particular revealed the steady rapprochement between he and Magritte over the preceding years . In the aftermath of these shows and of his visit , Magritte would write to Torczyner , saying that , ' Both of my London exhibitions inspired reviews ( favourable but devoid of intelligence ) in the major newspapers . There seem to have been many visitors ' ( Magritte , letter to Torczyner , 12 October 1961 , quoted in R. Magritte , Magritte / Torczyner : Letters Between Friends , New York , 1994 , pp. 67 - 68 ) . Almost half a decade later , Les compagnons de la peur was included in one of the most important large - scale retrospectives of Magritte 's lifetime , held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1965 , organised by James Thrall Soby and William C. Seitz . This show later travelled extensively through the United States and helped to consolidate Magritte 's subsequent international reputation . Soby had the advantage of Magritte 's own input in the preparations for the exhibition and the catalogue alike ; similarly , Torczyner took Seitz to visit Magritte in Belgium in order to discuss plans for the show ( see D. Sylvester , op. cit. , vol. III , 1993 , pp. 130 - 32 ) . Again , Magritte travelled to the opening of this exhibition , apparently benefitting from the airline Sabena 's use of his images in their publicity to be able to fly in some comfort . A cover letter to the press announced : ' Ren\u00e9 Magritte , famous Surrealist artist will be guest of honor at the preview of his exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art this evening . Mr. and Mrs. Magritte arrived from Belgium a few days ago accompanied by their dog ' ( press release , reproduced at www.moma.org). Indeed , Loulou - the canine in question \u2013 was permitted to travel in the passenger compartment with the artist and Georgette . Following this exhibition , Magritte also travelled to Houston , visiting the Menil family , who were great supporters of his work . Les compagnons de la peur was also featured in what was to become one of the last lifetime retrospectives of Magritte 's work , held in 1967 in Rotterdam . ( H.

However , during the earlier years of the conflict , an atmosphere of foreboding entered some of his pictures ; this may well be perceived in the apparent watchfulness of the owl - plants in Les compagnons de la peur - and indeed in its title . The birds are huddled together , half predators , half targets , bound to the ground they occupy . These largely solitary birds are here shown seeking safety in numbers in their mountain fastness . Even in the companion pictures showing birds on an island , there is a sense of both stranding and refuge that may well reflect some of the ambience in Belgium at the time . This would be all the more true considering the number of Magritte 's associates in international Surrealism whose works had fallen foul to the Nazi authorities , being deemed ' Entartete Kunst ' . This had caused a number of his contemporaries to fee France when the war had begun ; Magritte had also fed to France , but , separated from his wife Georgette , had turned back and undertaken an epic journey to return home to be with her . Throughout this period , despite being in Nazi-occupied Belgium , he continued to paint and indeed to publish his works - a monograph written during this time even featured surprisingly lavish colour illustrations . It was only shortly after Les compagnons de la peur was painted that Magritte , having long struggled with the question of how to respond to the war as an artist , developed his faux - Impressionist technique , a visual idiom that was intended to bring light and humour to his viewers - as well as a shock . The pictures worked on all these fronts , outraging even some of his loyal supporters . However , Les compagnons de la peur was painted before this epiphany , making it all the rarer , remaining rooted in a more sinister moment . It is the product of a time of intense questioning on Magritte 's part , a period during which he sought inspiration and found a number of pictorial solutions . Many of these would continue to remain in his visual arsenal for the rest of his life , not least the bird - leaf itself . This motif 's importance would be reaffirmed on a monumental scale when it became one of the subjects that Magritte included in his large - scale mural programme for the Casino communal de Knokke just over a decade after he had painted Les compagnons de la peur . When Les compagnons de la peur was owned by Jack Stafford , a London - based collector , it was lent to the Obelisk Gallery for its 1961 show of Magritte 's works . Magritte himself travelled to London for the opening , albeit reluctantly , as he wrote to his friend Harry Torczyner earlier : ' I have no desire at all to go to London , but I will probably have to give in to the pressure of my wife , who feels that my presence at the opening is indispensable and that I must respond to the invitations I receive , too many to my taste ' ( Magritte , letter to Torczyner , 9 September 1961 , quoted in R. Magritte , Magritte / Torczyner : Letters Between Friends , New York , 1994 , p. 66 ) . The show was a significant event . At one point , it was advertised in The Arts Review in conjunction with another exhibition showing a group of works largely taken from the collection of E.L.T. Mesens , held at the Grosvenor Gallery . The two shows became very separate , however , in part a legacy of the changing relationship between Mesens and Philip M. Laski , the main organiser of the Obelisk exhibition . This reached a culmination when the Daily Express reported that Laski had told Mesens to steer clear of his own show , in response to which Magritte himself had said : ' It is very much in the surrealist tradition to have a row . I would have been disappointed if there had n't been one ' ( Magritte , quoted in D. Sylvester , Ren\u00e9 Magritte Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 , vol. III , London , 1993 , p. 115 ) . For the Obelisk Gallery exhibition in which Les compagnons de la peur was featured - and was one of only eight pictures selected for illustration in the catalogue - Laski worked hard to prepare a significant show , borrowing works from a wide range of collectors . He also assembled an impressive catalogue that contained an essay written by Magritte which was translated by Laski himself . In addition to this there were important bibliographies and exhibition histories as well as a range of statements , quotes and poems from a number of significant figures from the avant garde including poets , critics , collectors and artists alike , such as Jean Arp , Andr\u00e9 Breton , Paul Eluard , Max Ernst , Ren\u00e9 Gaff\u00e9 , Wifredo Lam , Man Ray and Roland Penrose . The inclusion of Breton 's text in particular revealed the steady rapprochement between he and Magritte over the preceding years . In the aftermath of these shows and of his visit , Magritte would write to Torczyner , saying that , ' Both of my London exhibitions inspired reviews ( favourable but devoid of intelligence ) in the major newspapers . There seem to have been many visitors ' ( Magritte , letter to Torczyner , 12 October 1961 , quoted in R. Magritte , Magritte / Torczyner : Letters Between Friends , New York , 1994 , pp. 67 - 68 ) . Almost half a decade later , Les compagnons de la peur was included in one of the most important large - scale retrospectives of Magritte 's lifetime , held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1965 , organised by James Thrall Soby and William C. Seitz . This show later travelled extensively through the United States and helped to consolidate Magritte 's subsequent international reputation . Soby had the advantage of Magritte 's own input in the preparations for the exhibition and the catalogue alike ; similarly , Torczyner took Seitz to visit Magritte in Belgium in order to discuss plans for the show ( see D. Sylvester , op. cit. , vol. III , 1993 , pp. 130 - 32 ) . Again , Magritte travelled to the opening of this exhibition , apparently benefitting from the airline Sabena 's use of his images in their publicity to be able to fly in some comfort . A cover letter to the press announced : ' Ren\u00e9 Magritte , famous Surrealist artist will be guest of honor at the preview of his exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art this evening . Mr. and Mrs. Magritte arrived from Belgium a few days ago accompanied by their dog ' ( press release , reproduced at www.moma.org). Indeed , Loulou - the canine in question \u2013 was permitted to travel in the passenger compartment with the artist and Georgette . Following this exhibition , Magritte also travelled to Houston , visiting the Menil family , who were great supporters of his work . Les compagnons de la peur was also featured in what was to become one of the last lifetime retrospectives of Magritte 's work , held in 1967 in Rotterdam . ( H. Read , quoted in Magritte : Paintings , Drawings , Gouaches , exh. cat. , Obelisk Gallery , London , 1961 , p. 33 ) . Les compagnons de la peur was painted in 1942 and therefore ranks as one of the earliest of Ren\u00e9 Magritte 's pictures of what would become one of his most recognised motifs : the leaf - bird . This painting has featured in a string of important exhibitions of Magritte 's works , including several lifetime shows . Among these , of particular note were the exhibition at the Obelisk Gallery in London in 1961 , which resulted in his first visit to the British capital since before the Second World War , and his 1966 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art , New York . That show later travelled to a number of destinations - as did Magritte himself , when he visited the United States for the opening . Of the early examples featuring images of the ' leaf - bird ' , Les compagnons de la peur is the largest ; three other paintings dating from around 1942 are all significantly smaller . Of those , L'\u00eele au tr\u00e9sor ( Sylvester ; no. 498 ) is now in the collection of the Mus\u00e9es Royaux des Beaux - Arts de Belgique , Brussels , having been bequeathed by Magritte 's widow , Georgette , who herself had bought the picture back from a collector ( see D. Sylvester , Ren\u00e9 Magritte Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 , vol. II , London , 1993 , p. 294 ) . Another image showing owls and entitled Les compagnons de la peur is the gouache version , also of 1942 , likewise now held by the Mus\u00e9es Royaux des Beaux - Arts de Belgique , Brussels . There are several clear differences between Les compagnons de la peur and L'\u00eele au tr\u00e9sor and the various pictures that have been given that title . Crucially , those other works show birds rooted into the soil of an island , as opposed to the alpine landscape of Les compagnons de la peur . Perhaps it is in keeping with this mountainous backdrop that in Les compagnons de la peur Magritte has chosen to depict owls , rather than pigeons . These vigilant , predatory creatures , more frequently heard at night than seen during the day , are here presented in a watchful cluster , surveying their surroundings . The birds clearly have an affinity with their setting . At the same time , the nature of their new incarnation , part fauna and part flora , reveals a new incongruity . These are birds : fight is one of their key properties and characteristics . Yet here they have been melded with the sphere of plant life and become rooted to the ground . In this way , the ' leaf - bird ' can be seen as an extension of Magritte 's long - standing fascination with fight and buoyancy . Some of Magritte 's paintings would show , say , clouds sitting on the ground or a castle perched on an impossibly floating rock . In the 1930s , he had also explored the motif of mountains formed as though resembling a petrified eagle in works entitled Le pr\u00e9curseur , a theme that would later be transported into other works named Le domaine d'Arnheim . In a sense , those mountain - hawks are a form of precedent to Les compagnons de la peur : here , instead of blending the realms of mineral and animal , though , Magritte has fused animal and vegetable , creating hybrid entities which help the viewer to understand more about birds , about fight and about the slow vertical climb of plants as they grow . At the same time , the link between birds and plants may have been suggested in part by the similarity in shape of leaves and feathers that clad them . Certainly , in other works , Magritte would show birds perching on the veins of his leaf-trees , underscoring this connection between flora and fauna in his mind . In another group of works , he even showed cut-out - like silhouettes of birds made of the forest , showing the profundity with which trees and birds are linked , bringing this natural affinity to the attention of his viewer through unusual and unorthodox means . Les compagnons de la peur was painted in 1942 , during the Occupation of Belgium in the midst of the Second World War . Magritte did not really paint the war in the way that some artists felt compelled to do . However , during the earlier years of the conflict , an atmosphere of foreboding entered some of his pictures ; this may well be perceived in the apparent watchfulness of the owl - plants in Les compagnons de la peur - and indeed in its title .

DUNPHY Springhouse The recent features in Springhouse , \" The Madstones \" ( Nov- Dec 1985 , Jan - Feb 1986 ) have sparked renewed interest in the folk medicine of the Ozarks . Many of the region 's older residents who personally witnessed or - even experienced ! - treatment by the so-called \" power doctors \" ( individuals who claimed the ability to cure certain ailments by paranormal means ) are taking the time and trouble to commit their accounts of these matters to paper . And we folklorists are deeply indebted to them for doing so . Perhaps these old - timers ( and I am using the term affectionately ! ) have begun to realize just what a tragic , inestimable loss it would be to the cultural legacy of southern Illinois if their wonderful memories were forever denied to future generations . In \" The Titan of Elm Trees \" ( Nov - Dec , 1985 ) , I noted that many of the natural wonders of Egypt have been \" irretrievably lost ; \" unfortunately , this is also true of our region 's history and folklore . A great deal of the legends , folktales , and customs , which defined and shaped southern Illinoisans for generations have vanished . The remainder will survive only if we care enough to trans-literate the rapidly dwindling oral tradition into the written word . It is a task we cannot refuse . Undoubtedly , one of the most fascinating aspects of this oral tradition are the tales of the fabled \" blood stoppers , \" a group of healers who claimed the power to halt the \" unnatural \" flow of blood . Although a great many accounts of the blood stoppers have yet to be recorded , there has been a considerable degree of research on the subject . Nor is the practice of blood - stopping peculiar to the Ozark country of Illinois , Missouri , and Arkansas . Eliot Wigginton devoted much of the \" Faith Healing \" chapter in the first Foxfire book to blood - stopping while Margo Holden , in her article \" The Bloodstopppers \" published in the 1982 edition of The Old Farmer 's Almanac , observed that \" The use of Bloodstoppers was standard practice all over the North Woods of Maine and Canada . \" The late Vance Randolph dealt with blood - stopping in the \" Power Doctors \" chapter of his Ozark Superstitions and related the most commonly - used method employed by the old - time blood -stoppers . All one need supposedly do was read aloud the sixth verse of the sixteenth chapter of the book of Ezekiel while walking toward the East : \" And when I passed by thee , and saw thee polluted in thine own blood , I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood , Live ; yea , I said unto thee when thou vast in thy blood , Live . \" The bleeding then purportedly stopped ! This particular method is also cited in Foxfire as having been practiced as recently as 1968 by a woman in Dillard , Georgia , who even claimed to be able to halt bleeding merely by reading the verse silently while on the phone ! She also maintained that she possessed the power to stop the bleeding of injured farm animals . When reading the verse , however , she noted that she always substituted the victim 's name for the word \" thee \" when it appeared in the verse , a device frequently reported among old - time blood -stoppers . One can only surmise what on Earth she did in the cases of those farm animals she claimed to have healed ! One example of blood - stopping contained in the Foxfire chapter on faith - healing almost defies any sort of rational belief . Supposedly , a wellknown blood - stopper had visited a hotel where some skeptics had challenged his purported ability to bring about this extraordinary thing . \" All right , \" they said , \" We 'll just let ya ' try your luck on this beef . \" The blood - stopper replied , \" All right , but it 'll ruin yer beef , man . \" The Foxfire informant concluded the tale by noting that \" They killed it 'n stuck it . It never bled a drop . Blood stayed right in th' flesh an' ruined it . Could n't eat it . \" A true story ? As I said at the end of my account of madstones in the January - February 1986 Ozark Echoes , \" You decide . \" But the Biblical method was not the only way to stop bleeding . According to Randolph , an old woman with a reputation as the best blood - stopper in McDonald County , Missouri , simply held up both hands and cried : \" Upon Christ 's grave three roses bloom , Stop , blood , stop ! \" Margo Holden , in her Old Farmer 's Almanac article , told she once asked a blood - stopper how he accomplished this miracle . He candidly replied that he \" forgot everything and concentrated on the person hurt , \" imagining himself \" right there holding the blood back and saying , ' It 's stopping , it 's stopping , it 's stopped . ' \" This particular blood - stopper allegedly did not even have to be present at the scene to work his magic . Holden also related an astonishing and most touching story of a celebrated blood - stopper who continued her practice from the grave . It seems that she had only recently died when one of her young grandchildren cut himself and all efforts to halt the terrible bleeding failed . In desperation and longing , a family member murmured , \" If only Grandma were here now . How I wish she were here to help us . \" At that moment , the bleeding suddenly stopped ! Yet another tale of a blood - stopper 's compassion concerned the mother of a little boy who had suffered from nosebleeds for three days and nights , conventional medical science having failed completely to help the poor child . In a desperate gamble , she drove her son to the house of a well - known blood -stopper . The old man supposedly hobbled out onto his front porch when he saw the car pull up and \" took the scene in at once - the wan little boy holding a bloody rag to his nose , the distraught mother . He raised his hand as in salute and said , ' The bleeding is stopped . ' So it had . The little fellow did not have another nosebleed for two years . \" As a supernatural gift , the art of blood - stopping allegedly could be shared with others but only to a very limited extent ; according to the Ozarks blood - stoppers Randolph interviewed , the secret could be passed just to persons of the opposite sex . A few blood - stoppers assured him that it could be \" told \" to only three people and the third person would \" take the charm . \" Although I have never seen a blood - stopper perform this wonder , I have talked with a Southern Illinoisan who claimed to have witnessed the phenomenon during his youth in the 1920s . He told me that he and some other men had been constructing a storage shed when one fellow seriously cut his hand while sawing a board . The wound was long and deep , the blood \" flowing like a river , \" as he put it , and all efforts to stop the bleeding were futile . A man who enjoyed a reputation as a blood - stopper was finally summoned from a nearby farm . As my informant tells it , this blood - stopper apparently used the basic \" Ezekiel verse \" method , reading the sixth verse of the sixteenth chapter aloud from a Bible he had brought with him , and simply substituting the man 's name for the word \" thee \" when it appeared in the text . And yes , as this gentleman told me during our conversation , the bleeding from the saw wound indeed stopped . He conceded that he had previously been something of a skeptic in the matter of blood - stoppers but he had seen the \" miracle \" ( his word ) occur with his own two eyes . \" I would n't have believed it if I had n't seen it myself , \" he concluded . \" I've never seen anything quite like it since . \" I have no doubt he was telling me the truth about this long - ago incident - or , at least , what he sincerely believed to be the truth . Whether genuine supernatural gift , some bizarre manifestation of psychic ability , or merely superstition , the practice of blood - stopping virtually begs for further investigation . Perhaps some of our readers have heard tales of blood - stoppers in the Illinois Ozarks or even witnessed a blood - stopper at his or her task ! If so , Springhouse would enjoy hearing from you . As for myself , well , if there is one thing my scholarly research has taught me , it is the sagacity of keeping an open mind in regard to these matters . My love of folklore makes me especially fond of quoting Henry David Thoreau who once poignantly observed , \" Men are probably nearer the central truth in their superstitions than in their science . \" Experience has pretty much convinced me of the veracity of that remark .

All one need supposedly do was read aloud the sixth verse of the sixteenth chapter of the book of Ezekiel while walking toward the East : \" And when I passed by thee , and saw thee polluted in thine own blood , I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood , Live ; yea , I said unto thee when thou vast in thy blood , Live . \" The bleeding then purportedly stopped ! This particular method is also cited in Foxfire as having been practiced as recently as 1968 by a woman in Dillard , Georgia , who even claimed to be able to halt bleeding merely by reading the verse silently while on the phone ! She also maintained that she possessed the power to stop the bleeding of injured farm animals . When reading the verse , however , she noted that she always substituted the victim 's name for the word \" thee \" when it appeared in the verse , a device frequently reported among old - time blood -stoppers . One can only surmise what on Earth she did in the cases of those farm animals she claimed to have healed ! One example of blood - stopping contained in the Foxfire chapter on faith - healing almost defies any sort of rational belief . Supposedly , a wellknown blood - stopper had visited a hotel where some skeptics had challenged his purported ability to bring about this extraordinary thing . \" All right , \" they said , \" We 'll just let ya ' try your luck on this beef . \" The blood - stopper replied , \" All right , but it 'll ruin yer beef , man . \" The Foxfire informant concluded the tale by noting that \" They killed it 'n stuck it . It never bled a drop . Blood stayed right in th' flesh an' ruined it . Could n't eat it . \" A true story ? As I said at the end of my account of madstones in the January - February 1986 Ozark Echoes , \" You decide . \" But the Biblical method was not the only way to stop bleeding . According to Randolph , an old woman with a reputation as the best blood - stopper in McDonald County , Missouri , simply held up both hands and cried : \" Upon Christ 's grave three roses bloom , Stop , blood , stop ! \" Margo Holden , in her Old Farmer 's Almanac article , told she once asked a blood - stopper how he accomplished this miracle . He candidly replied that he \" forgot everything and concentrated on the person hurt , \" imagining himself \" right there holding the blood back and saying , ' It 's stopping , it 's stopping , it 's stopped . ' \" This particular blood - stopper allegedly did not even have to be present at the scene to work his magic . Holden also related an astonishing and most touching story of a celebrated blood - stopper who continued her practice from the grave . It seems that she had only recently died when one of her young grandchildren cut himself and all efforts to halt the terrible bleeding failed . In desperation and longing , a family member murmured , \" If only Grandma were here now . How I wish she were here to help us . \" At that moment , the bleeding suddenly stopped ! Yet another tale of a blood - stopper 's compassion concerned the mother of a little boy who had suffered from nosebleeds for three days and nights , conventional medical science having failed completely to help the poor child . In a desperate gamble , she drove her son to the house of a well - known blood -stopper . The old man supposedly hobbled out onto his front porch when he saw the car pull up and \" took the scene in at once - the wan little boy holding a bloody rag to his nose , the distraught mother . He raised his hand as in salute and said , ' The bleeding is stopped . ' So it had . The little fellow did not have another nosebleed for two years . \" As a supernatural gift , the art of blood - stopping allegedly could be shared with others but only to a very limited extent ; according to the Ozarks blood - stoppers Randolph interviewed , the secret could be passed just to persons of the opposite sex . A few blood - stoppers assured him that it could be \" told \" to only three people and the third person would \" take the charm . \" Although I have never seen a blood - stopper perform this wonder , I have talked with a Southern Illinoisan who claimed to have witnessed the phenomenon during his youth in the 1920s . He told me that he and some other men had been constructing a storage shed when one fellow seriously cut his hand while sawing a board . The wound was long and deep , the blood \" flowing like a river , \" as he put it , and all efforts to stop the bleeding were futile . A man who enjoyed a reputation as a blood - stopper was finally summoned from a nearby farm . As my informant tells it , this blood - stopper apparently used the basic \" Ezekiel verse \" method , reading the sixth verse of the sixteenth chapter aloud from a Bible he had brought with him , and simply substituting the man 's name for the word \" thee \" when it appeared in the text . And yes , as this gentleman told me during our conversation , the bleeding from the saw wound indeed stopped . He conceded that he had previously been something of a skeptic in the matter of blood - stoppers but he had seen the \" miracle \" ( his word ) occur with his own two eyes . \" I would n't have believed it if I had n't seen it myself , \" he concluded . \" I've never seen anything quite like it since . \" I have no doubt he was telling me the truth about this long - ago incident - or , at least , what he sincerely believed to be the truth . Whether genuine supernatural gift , some bizarre manifestation of psychic ability , or merely superstition , the practice of blood - stopping virtually begs for further investigation . Perhaps some of our readers have heard tales of blood - stoppers in the Illinois Ozarks or even witnessed a blood - stopper at his or her task ! If so , Springhouse would enjoy hearing from you . As for myself , well , if there is one thing my scholarly research has taught me , it is the sagacity of keeping an open mind in regard to these matters . My love of folklore makes me especially fond of quoting Henry David Thoreau who once poignantly observed , \" Men are probably nearer the central truth in their superstitions than in their science . \" Experience has pretty much convinced me of the veracity of that remark .

It 's being built using the Unreal Engine 3 and it 's probably one of the more imaginative uses for this particular piece of kit . Gaming Union was fortunate enough to get some lengthy hands - on time with the game at GamesCom 2009 and it 's certainly an interesting prospect . The basic premise is that many of the characters from famous Fairy Tales have lost their fame and they are on a quest to become famous again . However , this world is much more brutal than the one told to children and they will literally do whatever it takes . Gameplay focuses around a 4 - player mechanic , with an emphasis on drop - in and drop-out play . It 's possible to play the game as a single player , but also to have some buddies round , but it does highlight one of the flaws in the game 's design . It 's far too easy to kill the other characters , and players might find themselves constantly being killed by others . It 's something that can get exceedingly frustrating , and it does hamper progression through the level . The controls are exceedingly simple . The left analogue stick is used for movement , and the right analogue stick is used to attack . The basic melee attack is quite weak though , so it 's a good idea to pick up one of the various melee weapons that appear throughout levels . These can range from swordfish to samurai swords and they are much more brutal . Do n't be surprised to find seas of blood around the levels ; something which the developers expect to happen as they 've put in a mechanic which allows players to slide across it . It 's not surprising to learn that this game will be award the highest age rating possible when it 's released . To further compound the brutality , all of the characters have been configured using a full skeletal model . This means that when using special attacks , it 's possible to slice people up , break their bones and pretty much destroy them . There will even be an achievement for cutting an enemy into a certain amount of pieces and this is due to a 1 to 1 simulation with the analogue stick . Graphically the game looks a bit lacking , but it could be due to the selected art style . There were also a few design issues which could become a problem later on , like the ability to walk infinitely off the screen . Hopefully they will be sorted out as the game comes closer to its prospective launch period , which is currently touted as Fall 2009 . It 's good to see developers toying with interesting ideas , and it 's also good to see developers embracing the hack - and - slash genre . Hopefully we 'll find out more about the game as it gets closer to its launch .

The basic premise is that many of the characters from famous Fairy Tales have lost their fame and they are on a quest to become famous again . However , this world is much more brutal than the one told to children and they will literally do whatever it takes . Gameplay focuses around a 4 - player mechanic , with an emphasis on drop - in and drop-out play . It 's possible to play the game as a single player , but also to have some buddies round , but it does highlight one of the flaws in the game 's design . It 's far too easy to kill the other characters , and players might find themselves constantly being killed by others . It 's something that can get exceedingly frustrating , and it does hamper progression through the level . The controls are exceedingly simple . The left analogue stick is used for movement , and the right analogue stick is used to attack . The basic melee attack is quite weak though , so it 's a good idea to pick up one of the various melee weapons that appear throughout levels . These can range from swordfish to samurai swords and they are much more brutal . Do n't be surprised to find seas of blood around the levels ; something which the developers expect to happen as they 've put in a mechanic which allows players to slide across it . It 's not surprising to learn that this game will be award the highest age rating possible when it 's released . To further compound the brutality , all of the characters have been configured using a full skeletal model . This means that when using special attacks , it 's possible to slice people up , break their bones and pretty much destroy them . There will even be an achievement for cutting an enemy into a certain amount of pieces and this is due to a 1 to 1 simulation with the analogue stick . Graphically the game looks a bit lacking , but it could be due to the selected art style . There were also a few design issues which could become a problem later on , like the ability to walk infinitely off the screen . Hopefully they will be sorted out as the game comes closer to its prospective launch period , which is currently touted as Fall 2009 . It 's good to see developers toying with interesting ideas , and it 's also good to see developers embracing the hack - and - slash genre . Hopefully we 'll find out more about the game as it gets closer to its launch .

The field of this invention is the preparation and use of comminuted cheese on pizzas and other baked food products . In the United States , many retail operations engaged in preparation and baking of pizzas desire to use cheese in a comminuted form . Consequently , producers of mozzarella and other cheese used on pizzas shred or dice block cheese for delivery to the pizza restaurants . To provide improved storage and keeping qualities , comminuted cheese for use on pizzas can be frozen and delivered in frozen or semi-frozen condition . However , the cheese must at least be thawed to the extent that the shreds or granules can be separated . Moreover , further thawing is needed to improve functionality . The use of comminuted cheese in frozen or partially frozen condition on pizzas frequently results in baked products showing excessive browning and blistering . Not only is this appearance unattractive to the consumer , but the flavor and eating quality can also be adversely affected . The recommended practice involves slow thawing of the frozen cheese . Where thawing is carried out during non-freezing refrigerated storage , as is a common practice , a minimum of two to three days of thawing - holding is usually required . Moreover , the best practice involves holding of the granular cheese for four to five days , until thawing is completed . Because of the problems associated with the use of frozen comminuted cheese for preparing pizza , certain franchised cheese restaurants require that the comminuted cheese be packaged non-frozen in specially designed packages . This adds considerably to packaging and distribution expenses , although it does avoid the necessity of slow thawing . As far as is known , no one heretofore has produced frozen comminuted cheese which can be applied to pizzas in frozen or partially frozen condition and baked to produce a pizza product of as good quality as with fully thawed cheese . The high standards of appearance , quality and taste for large scale pizza preparation have not been satisfied by the use of comminuted cheese which has not been completely thawed . It has also been desired to modify the properties of granular cheese for use on pizzas and as toppings or ingredients in other baked food products . Such modifications include the incorporation of emulsifiers and flavor additives . Heretofore , however , no method or product has been provided in which such additives are provided a components of frozen comminuted cheese . The coated frozen cheese produced in accordance with this invention is in a particulate free-flowing condition . Modification of taste and functional properties of the cheese is obtained by applying coatings to the outsides of the cheese particles . The coatings can be applied so as to encapsulate the individual granules . More specifically , it has been found that a new kind of frozen granular cheese product can be prepared by coating frozen free - flowing cheese granules with an aqueous carrier containing one or more cheese additives , such as flavor modifiers , emulsifiers , etc . The additive can be distributed in an aqueous carrier in the form of a solution , dispersion , or emulsion . The carrier containing the additive is applied as a thin coating to the granules . On contact with the granules , the coating freezes , thereby fixing the additive in distributed form around the outer surfaces of the granules . The coated frozen granules have a variety of uses in addition to application to pizzas . They can be used as toppings or ingredients in other food products . By application in frozen or semi-frozen condition , the coatings remain distributed on the granules . When the food product is baked , the coatings will liquify and the additive will be spread over and into the cheese granules or into and through the food product . In other words , the desired modification occurs during baking use of the coated frozen granules . A method and product are thereby provided which achieve efficient and uniform modification of granular cheese for use in baked food products . The term \" comminuted cheese \" as used herein refers to shredded or diced cheese of the kind which heretofore has been sold for use in producing pizza products . The term \" granule \" is used generically as referring to the particulate form of such shredded or diced cheese . The granules are usually of cubical or an elongated rectilinear shape . However , the granules may also be slivers of irregular shape . In practicing the method of this invention , any cheese may be employed of the kind used on pizzas or in other baked food products . In the United States , varieties of mozzarella are the most common type cheese for pizza use , and are used alone or in cheese blends . The term \" pizza cheese \" usually refers to a semi-soft part skim milk cheese which is similar to but not the same as mozzarella . Other varieties of cheeses used on pizzas include cheddar , Muenster , Swiss , and Provolone . Such cheeses are usually produced in block form . For purpose of this invention , the cheese blocks are comminuted to shreds or granules . For example , the block cheese can be sliced and then diced to form cubical or elongated granules . Alternatively , cheese shredding equipment can be used . The granules may have dimensions in inches of from 0.1\u00d70.1\u00d70.5 up to 0.25\u00d70.25 \u00d71.5 . Examples of representative granule shapes are : ( 1 ) 1/8\u00d73/16\u00d73/4 inches ; and ( 2 ) 1/8\u00d71/8\u00d71/8 inches . In carrying out the method of this invention , the comminuted cheese can be rapidly frozen by direct contact with low temperature air . The freezing air is preferably at a temperature below - 10\u00b0 F. , such as below - 20\u00b0 F . For example , an optimum air temperature can be as low as - 35\u00b0 to - 45\u00b0 F . To accomplish rapid freezing of the comminuted cheese , a bed of the granules can be directly contacted by freezing air . For example , the cheese granules may be contacted in a fluidized bed , or in an agitated bed for rapidly exposing all exterior surfaces of the granules to the freezing air . By passing the freezing air upwardly through beds in which the cheese particles are agitated , or preferably fludized , the air flow can contact all of the exterior surfaces of the particles . With air at a sufficiently low temperature , surface crusts will rapidly form on the granules , thereby locking in the moisture . Similar results can be obtained with other methods of rapid freezing . For example , instead of contact with freezing air , the granules may be contacted with other fluid freezing agents , such as liquid carbon dioxide , liquid nitrogen , etc . Air freezing , however , is preferred . Commercially available air freezing equipment can be used . This equipment is of the kind sold for individual quick freezing ( IQF ) of granular food products . Heretofore , \" IQF \" equipment has been employed primarily for freezing vegetables , and the freezing step has usually been accompanied by partial drying of the product . In preparing the frozen cheese for the purpose of this invention , as explained above , it is desirable to avoid moisture loss from the cheese as it is being frozen . In one preferred method of freezing the comminuted cheese , fluidized bed - type IQF equipment is employed . Such fluidized bed equipment is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,169,381 , 4,265,096 , and 4,478, 141 . Commercially , suitable IQF fluidized bed equipment is available from Frigoscandia ( Frigoscandia Contracting , Inc. , Bellevue , Wash . ) . Expanded bed- type freezing equipment is available from several suppliers , including Cloud & Britton , Inc. , Mountlake Terrace , Wash . In preparing the comminuted cheese for freezing , precooling of the cheese is not required , that is , the cheese may be at temperatures substantially above 32\u00b0 F . For example , temperatures in the range of 35\u00b0- 55\u00b0 F. can be used , up to ambient room temperature . After the comminuted cheese is completely frozen , typically requiring from five to ten minutes , the cheese granules will be at very cold temperatures , but somewhat above the temperature of the freezing air . For example , the temperature of the frozen cheese will usually be below 0\u00b0 F. , such as at a temperature of from about - 10\u00b0 to - 20\u00b0 F . After the cheese is frozen as described , the shreds or granules will be in an individual free-flowing form . The particulate cheese is then further processed in accordance with this invention . For example , a conveyor belt , or rotating drum , or other equipment may be used . In one embodiment , the cheese particles may be sprayed with an aqueous carrier containing one or more cheese additives , such as flavor modifiers or functional modifiers , including emsulifiers , surfactants , defoamers , preservatives , etc . Any GRAS - approved food additive can be used . The additive may be in an aqueous solution , dispersion , or emulsion , and a plurality of additives may be applied in a single layer or a plurality of layers . The carrier should contain sufficient water so that it will freeze on the cheese particles . Granules of different kinds of cheese may be mixed in frozen condition , either before or after coating . It is desirable to mix or agitate the cheese while the coatings are being applied . When properly applied , the individual granules become encapsulated by the frozen coating . A conveyor belt can be equipped with devices for mixing the cheese particles as they are coated . Spray application of the coatings will usually be most convenient . As the aqueous carrier is distributed over the outer surfaces of the cheese granules , the carrier can be rapidly converted to frozen layers . At the same time , the coated granules can remain free-flowing . In a preferred embodiment , the coatings are in the form of thin continuous layers and comprise from 0.5 to 4.0 % by weight based on the uncoated cheese granules , that is , from 0.5 to 4 parts of the aqueous coating are used per 100 parts by weight of cheese . Although distribution of the coatings is enhanced because the aqueous carrier is not absorbed by the frozen granules . A series of coatings , such as a two - layer coating , may be applied , each layer containing one or more different additives . The use of such frozen coatings can be in addition to application of a preservative or other agent to the granules before freezing , when immediate granule penetration is desired . For example , an aqueous solution of sodium citrate may be sprayed on the granules prior to freezing . Sodium citrate is a sequestrant which functions like phosphates to modify the functional properties of cheese . Such sequestrants attract cations in the cheese protein . The resulting modified protein structure has an improved melt characteristic , being more fluid , and resulting in a baked cheese which is more tender and has less stretch . When the coated frozen cheese is applied to pizzas and baked thereon , the coatings will liquify first . This permits the flavor additive , and / or emulsifier or other functional modifier , to spread over and into the cheese particles as their outer surfaces become thawed and melted . The water in the coating will flash off . In this way , special flavor characteristics and / or functional characteristics can be imparted with relative uniformity to the melted cheese layer on the pizza . For example , cheese emulsifiers applied in this way can function to soften the outer portions of the cheese granules . This will improve melting and fusing of the granules . The emulsifier functions as a surface active agent . Surface active agents such as emulsifiers and defoamers reduce surface tension between the protein , fat , and water - phases of the cheese thereby changing its melt performance . With a coating containing a surface active agent , more oiling off will occur and less blistering will result , as the granules melt and fuse during baking . These functionability features are also of importance in toppings for other baked food products . Further , the improved melting and flavor distribution are generally advantages where the frozen granules are mixed into food products prior to baking . Some of the advantages of the present invention can also be achieved in other uses of the coated frozen granules , such as in the home preparation of salads or salad dressings . Coated frozen granules may be mixed into a dressing or applied to a salad . They will rapidly thaw , and as they thaw the surface coating containing the flavor additive will become distributed and impart the desired flavor characteristics to the dressing , salad , etc . The coated frozen granules may be packed in plastic bags and the bags placed in cartons for shipment or storage . In prior practice , frozen storage of granular cheese was limited to about six months without loss of quality . It is a significant improvement that the coated frozen cheese granules of this invention can be stored for periods of over 12 months without any quality deterioriation . This storability feature facilitates production by the cheese manufacturer in the seasons of the year when milk is abundant . As stated above , to maintain the cheese in optimum condition , it has been found desirable to utilize successively higher ranges of storage temperatures . This avoids storage holding in which the granules are stored at a lower temperature than the initial frozen storage temperature . When the coated frozen product reaches a retail pizza outlet , for example , it is not necessary to completely thaw the cheese prior to use . For example , the cheese may be taken directly from frozen storage and applied to pizzas just prior to baking . However , handling practices and available cheese storage facilities vary consdierably . Some restaurants may not be equipped for frozen storage , and / or the cheese may have been permitted to become partially thawed before it reaches the restaurant . These differences are not matters for concern when employing the frozen comminuted cheese of this invention . Excellent results can be obtained without regard to whether the coated cheese is in fully frozen or partially frozen condition as used on the pizzas . The baked pizzas will have as good or better appearance when preapred by the method of this invention as those prepared from thawed and equilibrated cheese . Of course , the degree of browning of the cheese on the baked pizzas depends in part on the baking equipment and temperatures used . But on a comparative basis the pizzas prepared from the frozen granules will exhibit no more browning or blistering than pizzas prepared from fully thawed and equilibrated granules . Shredded mozzarella cheese is prepared in a granule size of about 1/8\u00d73/16\u00d73/4 inches . The granules are subjected to IQF fluidized bed freezing in a \" FloFREEZE \" odel 300 WS - ADF supplied by Frigoscandia Contracting , Inc. , Bellevue , Wash . The freezing and fluidizing air which is blown upwardly through the bed of granules can have a velocity of around 400 ft /min . and a temperature of about - 40\u00b0 F. Frozen crusts form rapidly around the outside of the granules , viz . in one to two minutes or less . The time required for completion of the freezing is of the order of 7 minutes . The frozen granules leaving the fluidized bed have a temperature of around - 20\u00b0 F. Weight loss due to moisture evaporation during the freezing process is less than 0.5 % . Baffles along the sides and over the fluidized bed to minimize loss of cheese fines are provided . The frozen granules are packed in bags and boxed for storage , for example , at a temperature from - 10 to 0\u00b0 F. Coatings for the frozen cheese can include one or more of the following flavor additives : lactose , glucose , diacetyl , free fatty acids ( i.e. , butyric , propionic , capric , caproic acids ) , cheese flavors ( cheddar , Swiss , Provolone , etc. ) , meat flavors ( bacone , pepperoni , sausage , etc. ) , spices ( basil , oregano , garlic , dill , cinnamon , fennel , etc. ) , vegetable flavors ( tomato , onion , pimiento , pepper , etc. ) , and fruit flavors ( strawberry , pineapple , cherry , lemon , etc. ) . Functional cheese modifiers , such as emulsifier additives , may be used either alone or with the flavor additives , include : surfactants , disodium phosphate , sodium citrate , silicone emulsifiers , and other GRAS - approved modifiers . The following formulations are illustrative . A silicone emulsifier ( Dow Corning FG- 10 ) is mixed with water to form a 0.05 % emulsifier solution . This solution is sprayed on the frozen cheese granuels at a rate of 1.75 parts of solution per 100 parts by weight of cheese . This should achieve a final content of around 0.09 % emulsifier on the cheese . A cheese having the flavor characteristics of provolone on cooking is prepared from mozzarella cheese as follows . Mozzarella cheese is first shredded or diced to a granular form , as previously described . For example , two different kinds of mozzarella cheese may be combined in equal parts by weight , such as 70 % skim mozzarella and 30 % low moisture mozzarella , to provide the granular cheese mixture which is subjected to rapid freezing as described above . After the granules are frozen , a series of two coatings is applied . The first comprises a 1 % coating ( based on the weight of the cheese granules ) of an 0.85 % solution of liquid smoke ( Arrow P - 50 ) . After the first coating has been distributed in the form of a frozen layer around the cheese granules , a second coating is applied comprising a 1 to 1.5 % application of an aqueous solution containing 2 % defoamer and 1 % sodium citrate dihydrate . A suitable defoamer is Union Carbide SAG 710 Food Grade , which is a silicone ( dimethylpolysiloxane ) emulsion . A cheese having flavor characteristics similar to cheddar cheese on cooking is prepared from mozzarella cheese . In one embodiment , 100 % part skim mozzarella cheese is converted to comminuted form . These granules after freezing are coated with two layers . The first layer comprises a 1 to 1.5 % application of an aqueous solution containing 2 % defoamer ( Mazu ) and 1 % sodium citrate dihydrate . The same defoamer may be used as in the Provolone substitute . The second layer comprises a 2 % application of a 50 % solution of a cheddar cheese flavor including Annatto coloring . Suitable flavor ingredients include the following obtainable from H&R Corp. , Springfield , N.J. : ( 1 ) R-9219 , National Cheddar Cheese Flavor ( Mild Type ) , and / or ( 2 ) R-9217 , National Cheddar Cheese Flavor ( Sharp Type ) . The above solutions should be applied gradually while the frozen cheese granules are being mixed to distribute the solution over the outer surfaces of the granules . This produces thin frozen coatings around the outside of the granules while the granules remain in individual free-flowing condition . The silicone antifoamers tend to minimize blister formation and to increase oiling off in the baking of pizzas from the coated cheese granules . The formulations which may be used to modify the properties of the cheese granules during baking also include Formulations I to IV , as set out below . Aqueous solutions are prepared using the ingredients and concentrations shown . The solutions are applied to the cheese granules at the rate of two parts of solution per 100 parts by weight of the granules . Applications are preferably made after freezing of the granules , but solutions may also be applied at the same rate before freezing . With each of these formulations the granules exhibit a modified melt characteristic , the melting and fusing of the granules being promoted by the functional additive , such as sodium citrate , dimethylpolysiloxane , hexametaphosphate , and trisodium phosphate . Additional baked characteristics are noted below each formulation . | ______________________________________| | Wt/ Wt | |______________________________________| I.

In addition to commercial pizza preparations for sale in restaurants , the coated frozen cheese granules of the present invention are applicable to the home baking of pizzas sold in frozen condition . A manufacturer preparing pizzas for sale through retail outlets to home consumders can apply the coated frozen cheese granules to unbaked , unfrozen pizza , then without thawing the cheese the rest of the pizza is frozen by any suitable procedure . The unbaked frozen pizzas are distributed and sold in frozen condition . When a frozen pizza is purchased and baked at home without thawing , the advantages of this invention for baking the cheese in frozen or partially frozen condition will be obtained . By applying the frozen coated cheese granules to unbaked , unfrozen pizzas , a further advantage is provided . The frozen granules do not absorb the tomato or other liquid sauces . This protects the baking properties of the cheese granule against deterioration by absorption of an acidic sauce . In still another application of the method of this invention , the coated comminuted frozen cheese may be packaged for sale to home users . As with commercial pizza manufacturers , the home user may apply the frozen or partially frozen cheese granules to pizza , and then bake the pizza without further holding . The coated frozen cheese granules may also be used as toppings on other food products which can be baked without thawing of the cheese . It should be understood that these alternative uses of the present invention are included within the scope of this application . \u00a9 2004-2022 FreePatentsOnline.com . All rights reserved .

Heretofore , however , no method or product has been provided in which such additives are provided a components of frozen comminuted cheese . The coated frozen cheese produced in accordance with this invention is in a particulate free-flowing condition . Modification of taste and functional properties of the cheese is obtained by applying coatings to the outsides of the cheese particles . The coatings can be applied so as to encapsulate the individual granules . More specifically , it has been found that a new kind of frozen granular cheese product can be prepared by coating frozen free - flowing cheese granules with an aqueous carrier containing one or more cheese additives , such as flavor modifiers , emulsifiers , etc . The additive can be distributed in an aqueous carrier in the form of a solution , dispersion , or emulsion . The carrier containing the additive is applied as a thin coating to the granules . On contact with the granules , the coating freezes , thereby fixing the additive in distributed form around the outer surfaces of the granules . The coated frozen granules have a variety of uses in addition to application to pizzas . They can be used as toppings or ingredients in other food products . By application in frozen or semi-frozen condition , the coatings remain distributed on the granules . When the food product is baked , the coatings will liquify and the additive will be spread over and into the cheese granules or into and through the food product . In other words , the desired modification occurs during baking use of the coated frozen granules . A method and product are thereby provided which achieve efficient and uniform modification of granular cheese for use in baked food products . The term \" comminuted cheese \" as used herein refers to shredded or diced cheese of the kind which heretofore has been sold for use in producing pizza products . The term \" granule \" is used generically as referring to the particulate form of such shredded or diced cheese . The granules are usually of cubical or an elongated rectilinear shape . However , the granules may also be slivers of irregular shape . In practicing the method of this invention , any cheese may be employed of the kind used on pizzas or in other baked food products . In the United States , varieties of mozzarella are the most common type cheese for pizza use , and are used alone or in cheese blends . The term \" pizza cheese \" usually refers to a semi-soft part skim milk cheese which is similar to but not the same as mozzarella . Other varieties of cheeses used on pizzas include cheddar , Muenster , Swiss , and Provolone . Such cheeses are usually produced in block form . For purpose of this invention , the cheese blocks are comminuted to shreds or granules . For example , the block cheese can be sliced and then diced to form cubical or elongated granules . Alternatively , cheese shredding equipment can be used . The granules may have dimensions in inches of from 0.1\u00d70.1\u00d70.5 up to 0.25\u00d70.25 \u00d71.5 . Examples of representative granule shapes are : ( 1 ) 1/8\u00d73/16\u00d73/4 inches ; and ( 2 ) 1/8\u00d71/8\u00d71/8 inches . In carrying out the method of this invention , the comminuted cheese can be rapidly frozen by direct contact with low temperature air . The freezing air is preferably at a temperature below - 10\u00b0 F. , such as below - 20\u00b0 F . For example , an optimum air temperature can be as low as - 35\u00b0 to - 45\u00b0 F . To accomplish rapid freezing of the comminuted cheese , a bed of the granules can be directly contacted by freezing air . For example , the cheese granules may be contacted in a fluidized bed , or in an agitated bed for rapidly exposing all exterior surfaces of the granules to the freezing air . By passing the freezing air upwardly through beds in which the cheese particles are agitated , or preferably fludized , the air flow can contact all of the exterior surfaces of the particles . With air at a sufficiently low temperature , surface crusts will rapidly form on the granules , thereby locking in the moisture . Similar results can be obtained with other methods of rapid freezing . For example , instead of contact with freezing air , the granules may be contacted with other fluid freezing agents , such as liquid carbon dioxide , liquid nitrogen , etc . Air freezing , however , is preferred . Commercially available air freezing equipment can be used . This equipment is of the kind sold for individual quick freezing ( IQF ) of granular food products . Heretofore , \" IQF \" equipment has been employed primarily for freezing vegetables , and the freezing step has usually been accompanied by partial drying of the product . In preparing the frozen cheese for the purpose of this invention , as explained above , it is desirable to avoid moisture loss from the cheese as it is being frozen . In one preferred method of freezing the comminuted cheese , fluidized bed - type IQF equipment is employed . Such fluidized bed equipment is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,169,381 , 4,265,096 , and 4,478, 141 . Commercially , suitable IQF fluidized bed equipment is available from Frigoscandia ( Frigoscandia Contracting , Inc. , Bellevue , Wash . ) . Expanded bed- type freezing equipment is available from several suppliers , including Cloud & Britton , Inc. , Mountlake Terrace , Wash . In preparing the comminuted cheese for freezing , precooling of the cheese is not required , that is , the cheese may be at temperatures substantially above 32\u00b0 F . For example , temperatures in the range of 35\u00b0- 55\u00b0 F. can be used , up to ambient room temperature . After the comminuted cheese is completely frozen , typically requiring from five to ten minutes , the cheese granules will be at very cold temperatures , but somewhat above the temperature of the freezing air . For example , the temperature of the frozen cheese will usually be below 0\u00b0 F. , such as at a temperature of from about - 10\u00b0 to - 20\u00b0 F . After the cheese is frozen as described , the shreds or granules will be in an individual free-flowing form . The particulate cheese is then further processed in accordance with this invention . For example , a conveyor belt , or rotating drum , or other equipment may be used . In one embodiment , the cheese particles may be sprayed with an aqueous carrier containing one or more cheese additives , such as flavor modifiers or functional modifiers , including emsulifiers , surfactants , defoamers , preservatives , etc . Any GRAS - approved food additive can be used . The additive may be in an aqueous solution , dispersion , or emulsion , and a plurality of additives may be applied in a single layer or a plurality of layers . The carrier should contain sufficient water so that it will freeze on the cheese particles . Granules of different kinds of cheese may be mixed in frozen condition , either before or after coating . It is desirable to mix or agitate the cheese while the coatings are being applied . When properly applied , the individual granules become encapsulated by the frozen coating . A conveyor belt can be equipped with devices for mixing the cheese particles as they are coated . Spray application of the coatings will usually be most convenient . As the aqueous carrier is distributed over the outer surfaces of the cheese granules , the carrier can be rapidly converted to frozen layers . At the same time , the coated granules can remain free-flowing . In a preferred embodiment , the coatings are in the form of thin continuous layers and comprise from 0.5 to 4.0 % by weight based on the uncoated cheese granules , that is , from 0.5 to 4 parts of the aqueous coating are used per 100 parts by weight of cheese . Although distribution of the coatings is enhanced because the aqueous carrier is not absorbed by the frozen granules . A series of coatings , such as a two - layer coating , may be applied , each layer containing one or more different additives . The use of such frozen coatings can be in addition to application of a preservative or other agent to the granules before freezing , when immediate granule penetration is desired . For example , an aqueous solution of sodium citrate may be sprayed on the granules prior to freezing . Sodium citrate is a sequestrant which functions like phosphates to modify the functional properties of cheese . Such sequestrants attract cations in the cheese protein . The resulting modified protein structure has an improved melt characteristic , being more fluid , and resulting in a baked cheese which is more tender and has less stretch . When the coated frozen cheese is applied to pizzas and baked thereon , the coatings will liquify first . This permits the flavor additive , and / or emulsifier or other functional modifier , to spread over and into the cheese particles as their outer surfaces become thawed and melted . The water in the coating will flash off . In this way , special flavor characteristics and / or functional characteristics can be imparted with relative uniformity to the melted cheese layer on the pizza . For example , cheese emulsifiers applied in this way can function to soften the outer portions of the cheese granules . This will improve melting and fusing of the granules . The emulsifier functions as a surface active agent . Surface active agents such as emulsifiers and defoamers reduce surface tension between the protein , fat , and water - phases of the cheese thereby changing its melt performance . With a coating containing a surface active agent , more oiling off will occur and less blistering will result , as the granules melt and fuse during baking . These functionability features are also of importance in toppings for other baked food products . Further , the improved melting and flavor distribution are generally advantages where the frozen granules are mixed into food products prior to baking . Some of the advantages of the present invention can also be achieved in other uses of the coated frozen granules , such as in the home preparation of salads or salad dressings . Coated frozen granules may be mixed into a dressing or applied to a salad . They will rapidly thaw , and as they thaw the surface coating containing the flavor additive will become distributed and impart the desired flavor characteristics to the dressing , salad , etc . The coated frozen granules may be packed in plastic bags and the bags placed in cartons for shipment or storage . In prior practice , frozen storage of granular cheese was limited to about six months without loss of quality . It is a significant improvement that the coated frozen cheese granules of this invention can be stored for periods of over 12 months without any quality deterioriation . This storability feature facilitates production by the cheese manufacturer in the seasons of the year when milk is abundant . As stated above , to maintain the cheese in optimum condition , it has been found desirable to utilize successively higher ranges of storage temperatures . This avoids storage holding in which the granules are stored at a lower temperature than the initial frozen storage temperature . When the coated frozen product reaches a retail pizza outlet , for example , it is not necessary to completely thaw the cheese prior to use . For example , the cheese may be taken directly from frozen storage and applied to pizzas just prior to baking . However , handling practices and available cheese storage facilities vary consdierably . Some restaurants may not be equipped for frozen storage , and / or the cheese may have been permitted to become partially thawed before it reaches the restaurant . These differences are not matters for concern when employing the frozen comminuted cheese of this invention . Excellent results can be obtained without regard to whether the coated cheese is in fully frozen or partially frozen condition as used on the pizzas . The baked pizzas will have as good or better appearance when preapred by the method of this invention as those prepared from thawed and equilibrated cheese . Of course , the degree of browning of the cheese on the baked pizzas depends in part on the baking equipment and temperatures used . But on a comparative basis the pizzas prepared from the frozen granules will exhibit no more browning or blistering than pizzas prepared from fully thawed and equilibrated granules . Shredded mozzarella cheese is prepared in a granule size of about 1/8\u00d73/16\u00d73/4 inches . The granules are subjected to IQF fluidized bed freezing in a \" FloFREEZE \" odel 300 WS - ADF supplied by Frigoscandia Contracting , Inc. , Bellevue , Wash . The freezing and fluidizing air which is blown upwardly through the bed of granules can have a velocity of around 400 ft /min . and a temperature of about - 40\u00b0 F. Frozen crusts form rapidly around the outside of the granules , viz . in one to two minutes or less . The time required for completion of the freezing is of the order of 7 minutes . The frozen granules leaving the fluidized bed have a temperature of around - 20\u00b0 F. Weight loss due to moisture evaporation during the freezing process is less than 0.5 % . Baffles along the sides and over the fluidized bed to minimize loss of cheese fines are provided . The frozen granules are packed in bags and boxed for storage , for example , at a temperature from - 10 to 0\u00b0 F. Coatings for the frozen cheese can include one or more of the following flavor additives : lactose , glucose , diacetyl , free fatty acids ( i.e. , butyric , propionic , capric , caproic acids ) , cheese flavors ( cheddar , Swiss , Provolone , etc. ) , meat flavors ( bacone , pepperoni , sausage , etc. ) , spices ( basil , oregano , garlic , dill , cinnamon , fennel , etc. ) , vegetable flavors ( tomato , onion , pimiento , pepper , etc. ) , and fruit flavors ( strawberry , pineapple , cherry , lemon , etc. ) . Functional cheese modifiers , such as emulsifier additives , may be used either alone or with the flavor additives , include : surfactants , disodium phosphate , sodium citrate , silicone emulsifiers , and other GRAS - approved modifiers . The following formulations are illustrative . A silicone emulsifier ( Dow Corning FG- 10 ) is mixed with water to form a 0.05 % emulsifier solution . This solution is sprayed on the frozen cheese granuels at a rate of 1.75 parts of solution per 100 parts by weight of cheese . This should achieve a final content of around 0.09 % emulsifier on the cheese . A cheese having the flavor characteristics of provolone on cooking is prepared from mozzarella cheese as follows . Mozzarella cheese is first shredded or diced to a granular form , as previously described . For example , two different kinds of mozzarella cheese may be combined in equal parts by weight , such as 70 % skim mozzarella and 30 % low moisture mozzarella , to provide the granular cheese mixture which is subjected to rapid freezing as described above . After the granules are frozen , a series of two coatings is applied . The first comprises a 1 % coating ( based on the weight of the cheese granules ) of an 0.85 % solution of liquid smoke ( Arrow P - 50 ) . After the first coating has been distributed in the form of a frozen layer around the cheese granules , a second coating is applied comprising a 1 to 1.5 % application of an aqueous solution containing 2 % defoamer and 1 % sodium citrate dihydrate . A suitable defoamer is Union Carbide SAG 710 Food Grade , which is a silicone ( dimethylpolysiloxane ) emulsion . A cheese having flavor characteristics similar to cheddar cheese on cooking is prepared from mozzarella cheese . In one embodiment , 100 % part skim mozzarella cheese is converted to comminuted form . These granules after freezing are coated with two layers . The first layer comprises a 1 to 1.5 % application of an aqueous solution containing 2 % defoamer ( Mazu ) and 1 % sodium citrate dihydrate . The same defoamer may be used as in the Provolone substitute . The second layer comprises a 2 % application of a 50 % solution of a cheddar cheese flavor including Annatto coloring . Suitable flavor ingredients include the following obtainable from H&R Corp. , Springfield , N.J. : ( 1 ) R-9219 , National Cheddar Cheese Flavor ( Mild Type ) , and / or ( 2 ) R-9217 , National Cheddar Cheese Flavor ( Sharp Type ) . The above solutions should be applied gradually while the frozen cheese granules are being mixed to distribute the solution over the outer surfaces of the granules . This produces thin frozen coatings around the outside of the granules while the granules remain in individual free-flowing condition . The silicone antifoamers tend to minimize blister formation and to increase oiling off in the baking of pizzas from the coated cheese granules . The formulations which may be used to modify the properties of the cheese granules during baking also include Formulations I to IV , as set out below . Aqueous solutions are prepared using the ingredients and concentrations shown . The solutions are applied to the cheese granules at the rate of two parts of solution per 100 parts by weight of the granules . Applications are preferably made after freezing of the granules , but solutions may also be applied at the same rate before freezing . With each of these formulations the granules exhibit a modified melt characteristic , the melting and fusing of the granules being promoted by the functional additive , such as sodium citrate , dimethylpolysiloxane , hexametaphosphate , and trisodium phosphate . Additional baked characteristics are noted below each formulation . | ______________________________________| | Wt/ Wt | |______________________________________| I.

In addition to commercial pizza preparations for sale in restaurants , the coated frozen cheese granules of the present invention are applicable to the home baking of pizzas sold in frozen condition . A manufacturer preparing pizzas for sale through retail outlets to home consumders can apply the coated frozen cheese granules to unbaked , unfrozen pizza , then without thawing the cheese the rest of the pizza is frozen by any suitable procedure . The unbaked frozen pizzas are distributed and sold in frozen condition . When a frozen pizza is purchased and baked at home without thawing , the advantages of this invention for baking the cheese in frozen or partially frozen condition will be obtained . By applying the frozen coated cheese granules to unbaked , unfrozen pizzas , a further advantage is provided . The frozen granules do not absorb the tomato or other liquid sauces . This protects the baking properties of the cheese granule against deterioration by absorption of an acidic sauce . In still another application of the method of this invention , the coated comminuted frozen cheese may be packaged for sale to home users . As with commercial pizza manufacturers , the home user may apply the frozen or partially frozen cheese granules to pizza , and then bake the pizza without further holding . The coated frozen cheese granules may also be used as toppings on other food products which can be baked without thawing of the cheese . It should be understood that these alternative uses of the present invention are included within the scope of this application . \u00a9 2004-2022 FreePatentsOnline.com . All rights reserved .
