But it was not an important enough issue for the western powers to intervene over . And the outsiders who did consider the Buddhas important were not prepared to contemplate the kind of intervention that might have worked . The Buddhas were abandoned , argues our guest blogger Michael Semple ( * ) who has been in the midst of these events . Taleban officials , acting under the direct authority of their leader Mullah Omar , and with encouragement from their international and Pakistani jihadi allies , detonated the explosives under the Buddhas ten years ago . They thus take the blame for the destruction of these monuments . But there are some co-accused . The international community , through its disengagement and lack of seriousness in rendering effective assistance in Afghanistan , takes the blame for failing to prevent the destruction of the Buddhas . As the rock - cut figures were clearly a piece of world heritage , the failure to prevent the destruction was a lapse in ' duty of care ' . Of course , the world protested - both during the run up to the destruction and afterwards . But this was rhetorical . At no stage did any serious international actor ask what has to be done to save the Buddhas . There were options available . But they would have required a different kind of engagement from the rhetorical protests . And apparently no sufficiently vital interest was at sake to push people who counted into finding the means to achieve the objective . At the time that the Taleban declared war on the Buddhas , I was serving as a United Nations Regional Coordination Officer , with responsibility including Bamian . I interacted with many of the Taleban figures involved , as well as the armed resistance to the Taleban and the ordinary people of Bamian who were horrified at what was being done literally over their heads . I also briefed the range of international players who expressed concern on the issue , including UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan who visited Islamabad just as we received confirmation that the deed had been done . From what I saw during that episode I was convinced that we could help Afghans to save the Buddhas . But it would have required rather more lateral thinking that strait - jacketed diplomacy was capable of . The first point to make is that many Afghans , including figures inside the Taleban Movement , took pride in the Buddhas as a part of their heritage and were fully opposed to the idea of destroying them . In 1997 , when Taleban commander Abdul Wahed led a Taleban column attacking Bamian , then held by the Shia alliance Hezb-e Wahdat , he declared his intention to destroy the Buddhas . The Director of Archaeology of the Hazarajat regional government ( such an entity operated , de facto ) got on the phone to the BBC and triggered an international media alert . However it was sacrifices by Afghan young men on the front line against the Taleban which , that time , kept the barbarians out of Bamian . The Hazara front line held , the Taleban failed to capture Bamian and Abdul Wahed was forced to bide his time . In 1998 when the Taleban did shoot their way into the Bamian valley , Abdul Wahed established a presence in the town and prepared to deliver on his threat . He had holes drilled around the head of the small Buddha ready for the placing of explosives . However Mullah Omar appointed Maulawi Muhammad Islam of Ru-ye Doab as Bamian governor . As a Tatar from neighbouring Samangan Province , the Maulawi had connections with all the commanders of Bamian from the jihad era . Whatever his other sins , Bamian was also a part of Maulawi Islam 's heritage . His deputies described to me how , when they saw what Abdul Wahed was doing , they contacted Mullah Omar in Kandahar and he gave the order to stop further drilling . That time round the combination of local mujahedin commanders within the Taleban structure and a supportive Mullah Omar saved the Buddhas before the world was even aware of the threat . In those days about the worse thing that happened was that a group of Taleban burnt tyres on top of the great Buddha . I managed to photograph the blackened head in early summer of 1999 , when inspecting the havoc which the Taleban had wreaked on the civilian infrastructure . Thousands of houses and numerous Shia places of worship had been burnt down . Taleban had deliberately devastated the town after a brief Hezb-e Wahdat - led rebellion . But the Buddhas escaped with a black eye . In the autumn of 2000 , in one of my meetings with the Taleban authorities in Bamian , among other projects which they proposed , they requested United Nations assistance to reconstruct the network of drainage ditches around the top of the niches in which the Buddhas rested . They were concerned at the prospect of erosion damage if the ditches were not maintained . I agreed to pass on the various projects ( our bit of the UN of course did not have any money ! ) meanwhile I recall quipping that in the current atmosphere Buddas were troublesome and so it might be better to brick up the niches and pretend to the Kandahari brothers that the Buddhas had left . The Taleban leadership was by then lumbering along the path of confrontation , with moves to browbeat the UN and rather fantastic ordinances and prohibitions to control the population . However , war had not yet been declared on idols . The first sign of this war on idols came when news leaked out of the Kabul Museum that a party of senior Taleban had forced their way in and sledge - hammered part of the museum 's collection of ancient statues . There was much speculation over whether this was genuine iconoclasm or a cover for smuggling antiques . However it inspired the first level of international response . Concerned Afghans tipped off an enthusiastic NGO , the Society for Preservation of Afghan Cultural Heritage ( SPACH ) which managed to trigger a troika of European ambassadors to travel from Islamabad to Kabul to intercede with the Taleban authorities . They stayed for nearly a week . But we knew that there was trouble when affable Taleban Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmad Mutawakel came back with the response that he required the clearance of higher authorities to be allowed to visit the museum . Meanwhile , Mullah Omar signed off on a rapidly composed new ordinance which provided the Taleban version of legal cover for the idol-smashing . Now the Buddhas of Bamian really were in trouble . Things turned bad during the winter of 2000/01 . For me , the most horrendous sign that the Taleban were prepared to sanction atrocities from the top came with the Yakaolang massacre in January 2001 . During 1999 and 2000 those of us who were on the ground had documented a sort of war against the civilian population , including the burning of houses in areas deemed hostile , the summary execution of groups of prisoners and mass round - ups into detention . But in Yakaolang , a district centre west of Bamian town , with Mullah Omar 's sanction , the Taleban commander operated a firing squad and had one hundred and sixty - six Hazara civilians machine - gunned . Next the Taleban rhetoric started against idols in general and the Bamian Buddhas in particular . It was widely discussed and commented on . Everyone knew it was coming . Various Taleban friends also described meetings they participated in , in which some tried to argue in favour of saving the heritage again , until it became clear that , unlike 1998 , this time the leadership had decided to sanction an assault on the Buddhas . But there still were Afghans who could have been helped to intervene . The centre of Bamian was indeed garrisoned by the Taleban . The garrison consisted of mixed forces of local mujahedin , mainly Sunni Tajiks ( from Bamian province ) and a few Hazaras who had sided with the Emirate , plus core Taleban troops from Helmand and Kandahar . But there was also a resistance front operating in the vicinity . The Hazaras had struggled to rekindle armed resistance after the defeat in 1999 . By early 2001 , the tenuous supply lines had been re-established . Ustad Abdul Karim Khalili - now the Second Vice President of Afghanistan - was back in the field at the head of an out - gunned and out - numbered army which , when under pressure , had to disappear into the mist . But in winter / spring 2001 they were keeping Bamian under threat and even managed to capture it briefly for a couple of days . The Tajik Taleban commanders laughed loudly as they described to me how they had lost Bamian . They described it as going home for the weekend . When they saw the Tajiks retreating , the Kandahari forces , fearing having their throats cut by the wild Hazaras , had pulled out in panic . Hezb-e Wahdat moved in . The Tajiks and Kandaharis contacted Defence Minister Mullah Obaidullah , asking for more supplies . He obliged them . And the Hazara forces discretely pulled out again before the Taleban returned . A reverse replay of this was all that was needed to save the Buddhas . The Tajik commanders pointed out that Khalil 's front - line was not far from the centre of the valley where the Buddhas were located . It just required someone to orchestrate a modest advance from Khalili , a choreographed retreat by the Tajiks , another panic among the Kandaharis - and the Buddhas could be left in no-man 's land , looking down on the two parties . The Taleban could promise to Mullah Omar that they would blow up the Buddhas whenever they got the chance . And they would wait , in classic Afghan style , for something to happen which would get them all out of the stand off . Parking the issue , it is called in the jargon . As part of my duties in aid coordination I met regularly with Ustad Khalili . His cooperation was essential to our efforts to assist the displaced population in the growing area which his resistance forces controlled . I asked him if he thought that such a choreographed move might be possible . He knew the Tajik commanders I had talked to and said yes . He was happy with the idea . It is Afghanistan . There was of course a question of money . Afghan commanders and armies rarely move without money . Who was going to pay to get the Tajik commanders to fall into line ? I never went into the costing or the mechanics of who in the command chains needed to receive money to shift the frontline by a kilometre or so . I guessed that they were talking in the range of a hundred thousand dollars . We thought that was a lot of money in those days - but after September we realised it was peanuts . It seemed plausible that a cash injection would be part of any successful deal . I was careful not to ask too many questions on that as the UN certainly did not have the money and in Afghanistan the wise man should never boost expectations . When the Taleban really did start to prepare to blow up the Buddhas , the rhetorical international operation , for all and sundry to be seen to be condemning it , started . The most sincere effort was , I believe , that of a Japanese parliamentary delegation . Three parliamentarians based themselves in Islamabad and started a shuttle diplomacy to Kandahar where they met with the same Mutawakil who had failed to get permission to visit Kabul Museum . Mullah Omar enjoyed teasing them , international supplicants whom he could string along with impunity . I had multiple sessions discussing with this pure-hearted delegation . They kept on thinking of new theological arguments to persuade the mullahs , even as they shifted their demands , just to be allowed to pay respect one last time before the demolition . And at one rather pathetic moment , even before the destruction , the delegation asked my assessment of the prospects of Japanese technology being able to piece the Buddhas together again . But the issue was not about theology . Politics were destroying the Buddhas . An isolated regime , which had foisted itself on its own population and was being encouraged by al - Qaida to take on the world , had found a brilliant source of international publicity where it could strike a successful pose of defiance . Our condemnation made it all the more important for the confrontationist leadership to go ahead with the destruction . The public arguments were barely relevant . Parliamentarians do not have executive authority or budgets . I explained to the delegation how the Afghans could be helped to subvert Mullah Omar 's authority and dodge their way out of having to blow up the Buddhas . And I passed on Khalili 's number to the embassy 's political officer and explained that if they really wanted to save the Buddhas the only option was to cut a deal with both sides . Many other people claimed to be interested . The Pakistan Government did its bit . The UNESCO envoy worked the case . Various Arab figures spoke out and visited . But it all amounted to so much hot air . If they had wanted to get something done in Afghanistan , they would have had to analyse the motives and capabilities of the different parties involved and come up with a strategy which worked with the grain of Afghan society , rather than against it . A strategy which worked rather than looked good was needed . The Buddhas could have been saved . If we failed to stop the demolition it was because no one cared to deploy the means necessary to save them . This failure occurred partly because those who cared , like the deeply sincere Japanese , remained stuck in a rhetorical engagement . They simply did not address Afghan reality . They appealed to the altruism or logic of Mullah Omar , while failing to engage and support the pragmatism of the Afghans who had the power to help , but would not risk doing so on their own . And of course the failure also occurred because other powers , who had a proven capacity to intervene in Afghanistan , were barely even on the case . During the days that the Taleban were blowing up the Buddhas , I spent much of my time sitting in a Taleban base in Kabul , listening to the radio reports and graphic descriptions coming in from their men in Bamian . I was frustrated that as a humble mid-level UN staffer , neither I nor , even more , my organisation had been able to do anything . But the old mujahedin around me who , for intricate reasons , had been re-branded as Taleban felt exactly the same regret . They identified with these monuments far more than us outsiders . Needless to say , my regrets were not just for the Buddhas . Their destruction symbolises the thousands of lives lost and homes destroyed in Afghanistan when we either do nothing or do the wrong thing , remaining wedded to approaches which seem good in international fora but which do not actually work on the ground in Afghanistan . Me thinks the risk has not gone away . ( *) Michael Semple has worked in Afghanistan pre- and post -Taleban , with NGOs and the UN .

Many of its phrases are well known and a surprising number have found their way into our liturgies , ranging from the Marriage Service to the Liturgy of Committal . It describes itself as a Song of Victory , and there are undoubtedly martial overtones in some of the verses . But as I read it , the overwhelming impression that it leaves on my mind is as an expression of gratitude , dependence and optimism . And those are the sentiments uppermost in my own mind and heart today as I take up the office of Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland . Gratitude to God for calling me to ordained ministry and for the knowledge that his love and forgiveness are always moving ahead of me . Gratitude to my fellow bishops for their encouragement and support . Thankfulness to the hundreds of people from every corner of Ireland who have written , emailed , messaged or in some other way communicated their congratulations , good wishes and the assurance of their prayers . Since the day of my election on 11 March I have felt buoyed up by wave upon wave of goodwill \u2013 a silver surfer . I am hoping people will hold onto that goodwill even as I make my first mistakes . Along with goodwill goes a strong sense of unworthiness and dependence . I almost said , \u201c an overwhelming sense \u201d , and so it would be were it not for the expressions of goodwill I have already mentioned . And , like the psalmist , a sense of dependence on the dependability of God . I am conscious too of the long line of very distinguished predecessors who have held the office of Primate of All Ireland , and whose scholarship , dedication and spirituality have been an inspiration to me . Most especially I would wish to mention my immediate predecessor , the Rt Rev'd Richard Clarke , from whom I learned so much and whose friendship I value enormously . If that phrase , \u201c John , by Divine Providence , Archbishop of Armagh \u201d has an air of grandiloquence about it , it also has a promise that his making hand will always be on you and me and on the Church we serve , moulding the clay of our vocation to meet the needs of the day . And perhaps , in cases where the clay has hardened with age , to break it and start again . But I also hold a great degree of optimism , because of the role which God , through the processes of history , has opened out for us \u2013 the Church of Ireland \u2013 to take in the years to come . In more normal times I would have had an enthronement sermon and a first Presidential Address at the General Synod to have shared some thoughts about our Church and the societies in which we live . You may be relieved to hear that I 'm not going to roll them into one diatribe now ; but I do want to say a couple of things to do with our distinctiveness and our role in Ireland today . As a Church we have the potential to model ( and in some instances to create ) a witness of deep\u2013seated unity that transcends political , social and generational categories . But we can only do so by being true to ourselves , so that we may more fully \u201c become what we are \u201d . We need to become what Our Lord most certainly was . Someone who listened with supernatural patience . And I 'm not necessarily talking about formal indaba type conferring , but simply in our own everyday encounters , both formal and informal . There 's a fair bit of truth in the observation that , in Ireland , we listen to others ( especially to those with whom we differ ) in order to gather ammunition for criticism . We do not listen to hear . Had the plans for the General Synod gone ahead we would have been presented , as a Church , with many opportunities to explain and to listen ; to speak and to hear . Some of those opportunities would have been , on the face of it , very ordinary . I am thinking here of the opportunity to consider the final pieces of legislation in relation to the amalgamation of the Dioceses of Limerick and Killaloe and Tuam , Killala and Achonry , where the General Synod made space for careful listening and a deepening of communion ( koinonia ) between those who would be most immediately affected by the transition . A period of true dialogue and listening ( adroitly led by the two bishops concerned ) and leading to the building of trust and to positive outcomes with warm feelings likely to germinate seeds for the future . In this category I 'm thinking also of the final stages of the Bill on Diocesan Representation on the General Synod . This was where a group of people from every diocese in Ireland listened patiently to the \u201c whys and wherefores \u201d of equitable ( rather than strictly proportionate ) representation . In so doing , they had to acknowledge that the voice of Jesus is at least as likely to be heard where we are numerically weak as in places where we are strong . To be both the Church of Christ and the Church of Ireland , we need to respect all its people and to sideline none . In such inclusion , we may become more truly ourselves by being an all\u2013island church which incorporates the characteristics of all its regions proudly , rather than being seen as primarily a \u201c Northern \u201d or a \u201c Southern \u201d church . It is appropriate to recall this seminal statement from the Lambeth Conference of 1948 : \u201c The positive nature of the authority which binds the Anglican Communion together is \u2026 moral and spiritual , resting on the truth of the Gospel , and on a charity which is patient , and willing to defer to the common mind \u201d . If a meeting of the General Synod had been possible this year , we would also have had some quite extraordinary opportunities to speak and to listen provided by the chances of history . Here I am thinking , first , of the fact that it was to be held in the venue of Croke Park . This would have offered an opportunity to acknowledge the role which the GAA plays in every corner of this island \u2013 surely the most remarkable and influential cultural and sporting organisation in Ireland today . Also perhaps it would have been appropriate in the setting of Croke Park , and given the current Decade of Centenaries , to have reflected on the tragic loss of life which was occurring all over Ireland in 1920 ; to have listened and spoken about the acknowledgements needed and the lessons learned . And , also historically significant : the dates of the General Synod were to have coincided with the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day . This would have provided the right sort of space to listen to some balanced words on both the end of that particular phase of the war against Fascism and on the rationale behind Neutrality in that time . As a Christian alternative to a rush to judgement , the Synod might have accommodated a ' listening to hear ' , rather than a listening to judge . We are a Church that has traditionally cast its mission in the form of pastoral care . Of course that pastoral care needs to take the form not only of feeding and caring for the sheep but also of finding them . I know many parishes fufill this role by being deeply involved in their local communities and contributing to the common good . And to be true to ourselves , ours must always be a pastoral evangelization : caring , patient , even perhaps quiet ; drawing people to Jesus by the beauty of his person and the depth of his Sacrifice , not by the notion of a competition for souls . And as we reflect on the Sacrifice of Christ , I want to pause for just a moment to notice and give heartfelt thanks for those people , especially those working in hospitals and care homes , who have put the saving of the lives of others above the protection of their own lives . Some have already paid the ultimate price for their bravery and their compassion . So , if you are reading this , perhaps you would now stop for a moment and say a ' thank you ' for all they have done for us . Almost exactly 100 years ago , another postponed Lambeth Conference took place . It had been due to meet in 1918 but had been deferred due to the Great War . One of the main themes the Conference considered was the relationships between Churches , many of which had worked closely together during the appalling suffering of the war years . As the Conference met , an exhausted Europe ( still conscious in some sense of being \u201c Christendom \u201d ) was beginning to recover . The fatalities were infinitely greater and the period of suffering much longer , but the sense of dislocation which the whole world is experiencing at the minute due to the Covid\u2013 19 emergency may be comparable to the trauma of the First World War . In some senses , it is even more destabilising . Although the 1920 Lambeth Conference was unable to make much progress on the matter of formal church unity , it famously issued The Appeal to All Christian People . Rather than addressing itself to formal church structures , the appeal was made to the consciences of individual believers . It ended with these words , hinting at a different form of reconciliation : \u201c We do not ask that any one Communion should consent to be absorbed in another . We do ask that all should unite in a new and great endeavor : to recover and to manifest to the world the unity of the Body of Christ for which he prayed \u201d . We are now most certainly a post \u2013 Christendom , if never quite a post \u2013 Christian , society . Perhaps it is for us , a church of a northern majority but insisting on and valuing the voices of southern brothers and sisters in all the councils of our Church , to work towards a coherent understanding and a living\u2013out of reconciliation . Perhaps it is time to allow us , with credibility , to be in our pastoral mission a living Appeal to All People , and to find in that reconciliation both the work of the Spirit and an enduring public good . Reconciliation is one of the big words of the Gospel . In one sense it was completed with nothing left to do when Our Lord uttered the words , \u201c It is finished \u201d ; and found those words vindicated on Easter Day . In another sense , reconciliation is always unfinished , with a need to begin anew every day . And this beginning involves acknowledging the prejudices and faults which have failed to make us One , as he and the Father are One , as a Church , let alone as Churches . Reconciliation is the great work ( of heart , of brain , and of practicalities ) which is crying out for our commitment as children of \u201c the God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus , that Great Shepherd of the sheep \u201d . Those who are the agents of reconciliation will always have some kind of destructive energy to absorb ; they will always have something to bear that is not , strictly speaking , their own . Without wishing to be too dramatic , the scars of suffering are the tokens of peacemaking , at the very least peacemakers risk bearing the emotional scars of being ridiculed . Just as Dietrich Bonhoeffer reminded European Christianity about the costliness of grace , those of us who talk about and plead the urgency of a deepened sense of reconciliation need to make no bones about the cost . And the price to be paid is in no small part the demonstration of the process itself . Not long before the Second World War , the children 's writer A A Milne wrote a book called Peace with Honour . By then a pacifist , he made a plea that was shared by many who did not agree with his political views : \u201c Tell us what to do , not what to think . We have done our thinking ; we are all of one mind as to what we want \u2013 Peace ; and now the problem in front of us is how to obtain it \u201d . And just in case anyone is smiling at the thought of the creator of Winnie the Pooh and Christopher Robin and Tigger having anything serious to tell the world about reconciliation and peace , we would do well to remember the simple pictorial language of the parables and to think about the child whom \u201c Jesus set in the midst of them \u201d . Sometimes the most challenging and important questions are the most simple . We all want peace , how do we obtain it ? If someone was to ask me that same question about Ireland , or about the world that will emerge from the profound insecurity caused by the coronavirus , I 'm not sure I would have the answer . A great sifting process is going on in the world at present . We are at the end of an epoch never mind an era . Old social systems and ways of life are being unmade and new systems and habits and attitudes will have to be brought together to replace them . On top of our historical and social divisions in Ireland , we are being caught in the down draught of a global wind . New animosities will evolve and old ones may survive . How blessed we would be if we as a Church , amid such unprecedented times of flux , can show ourselves worthy of our calling as peacemakers and reconcilers \u2013 even if it is costly \u2013 because we rest in his steadfast love which \u201c endures for ever \u201d . Only then might we be able to stand and answer the plea that calls across generations , not least here in Ireland : \u201c We want peace \u2026 tell us what to do \u201d . + John Armagh 28 April 2020 Church of Ireland Press Office Email : Press Office +44 ( 0 ) 7774 295 369 For further information please contact : Church of Ireland House 61\u201367 Donegall Street Belfast , BT1 2QH Peter Cheney Church of Ireland Press Office Email : Press Office +44 ( 0 ) 7774 295 369","annotations":[{"text":"Archbishop John McDowell","span":[30,53],"token_span":[5,7],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The abstract or concrete thing or situation that the Agent causes to change."},{"text":"his post","span":[111,118],"token_span":[19,20],"role":"Attribute","label":"Attribute","role_definition":"A characteristic of the Entity for which a value can be assigned or determined by calculation, measurement , or observation."},{"text":"Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland","span":[761,807],"token_span":[145,152],"role":"Final_category","label":"Final_category","role_definition":"The category that the Entity belongs to after it has undergone the change."},{"text":"election","span":[1250,1257],"token_span":[231,231],"role":"Cause","label":"Cause","role_definition":"An event that causes a change in the Entity."},{"text":"in Ireland","span":[13211,13220],"token_span":[2554,2555],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the change of the Entity is caused."},{"text":"28 April 2020","span":[13279,13291],"token_span":[2572,2574],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the change of the Entity is caused."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"In the Church of Ireland , the archbishop is John McDowell , who is the ecclesiastical head of the Church of Ireland and the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Armagh .

Many of its phrases are well known and a surprising number have found their way into our liturgies , ranging from the Marriage Service to the Liturgy of Committal . It describes itself as a Song of Victory , and there are undoubtedly martial overtones in some of the verses . But as I read it , the overwhelming impression that it leaves on my mind is as an expression of gratitude , dependence and optimism . And those are the sentiments uppermost in my own mind and heart today as I take up the office of Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland . Gratitude to God for calling me to ordained ministry and for the knowledge that his love and forgiveness are always moving ahead of me . Gratitude to my fellow bishops for their encouragement and support . Thankfulness to the hundreds of people from every corner of Ireland who have written , emailed , messaged or in some other way communicated their congratulations , good wishes and the assurance of their prayers . Since the day of my election on 11 March I have felt buoyed up by wave upon wave of goodwill \u2013 a silver surfer . I am hoping people will hold onto that goodwill even as I make my first mistakes . Along with goodwill goes a strong sense of unworthiness and dependence . I almost said , \u201c an overwhelming sense \u201d , and so it would be were it not for the expressions of goodwill I have already mentioned . And , like the psalmist , a sense of dependence on the dependability of God . I am conscious too of the long line of very distinguished predecessors who have held the office of Primate of All Ireland , and whose scholarship , dedication and spirituality have been an inspiration to me . Most especially I would wish to mention my immediate predecessor , the Rt Rev'd Richard Clarke , from whom I learned so much and whose friendship I value enormously . If that phrase , \u201c John , by Divine Providence , Archbishop of Armagh \u201d has an air of grandiloquence about it , it also has a promise that his making hand will always be on you and me and on the Church we serve , moulding the clay of our vocation to meet the needs of the day . And perhaps , in cases where the clay has hardened with age , to break it and start again . But I also hold a great degree of optimism , because of the role which God , through the processes of history , has opened out for us \u2013 the Church of Ireland \u2013 to take in the years to come . In more normal times I would have had an enthronement sermon and a first Presidential Address at the General Synod to have shared some thoughts about our Church and the societies in which we live . You may be relieved to hear that I 'm not going to roll them into one diatribe now ; but I do want to say a couple of things to do with our distinctiveness and our role in Ireland today . As a Church we have the potential to model ( and in some instances to create ) a witness of deep\u2013seated unity that transcends political , social and generational categories . But we can only do so by being true to ourselves , so that we may more fully \u201c become what we are \u201d . We need to become what Our Lord most certainly was . Someone who listened with supernatural patience . And I 'm not necessarily talking about formal indaba type conferring , but simply in our own everyday encounters , both formal and informal . There 's a fair bit of truth in the observation that , in Ireland , we listen to others ( especially to those with whom we differ ) in order to gather ammunition for criticism . We do not listen to hear . Had the plans for the General Synod gone ahead we would have been presented , as a Church , with many opportunities to explain and to listen ; to speak and to hear . Some of those opportunities would have been , on the face of it , very ordinary . I am thinking here of the opportunity to consider the final pieces of legislation in relation to the amalgamation of the Dioceses of Limerick and Killaloe and Tuam , Killala and Achonry , where the General Synod made space for careful listening and a deepening of communion ( koinonia ) between those who would be most immediately affected by the transition . A period of true dialogue and listening ( adroitly led by the two bishops concerned ) and leading to the building of trust and to positive outcomes with warm feelings likely to germinate seeds for the future . In this category I 'm thinking also of the final stages of the Bill on Diocesan Representation on the General Synod . This was where a group of people from every diocese in Ireland listened patiently to the \u201c whys and wherefores \u201d of equitable ( rather than strictly proportionate ) representation . In so doing , they had to acknowledge that the voice of Jesus is at least as likely to be heard where we are numerically weak as in places where we are strong . To be both the Church of Christ and the Church of Ireland , we need to respect all its people and to sideline none . In such inclusion , we may become more truly ourselves by being an all\u2013island church which incorporates the characteristics of all its regions proudly , rather than being seen as primarily a \u201c Northern \u201d or a \u201c Southern \u201d church .

He is a consummate survivor , our correspondent says , but he was overwhelmed by the scale of the financial crisis which has engulfed Italy . After losing his parliamentary majority on Tuesday , Mr Berlusconi promised to resign when austerity measures , demanded by the EU and designed to restore markets ' confidence in the country 's economy , were passed by both houses of parliament . Members of the lower house voted 380 - 26 with two abstentions on Saturday , a day after the Senate approved the measures that have now been signed into law . Sluggish growth Mr Napolitano 's spokesman Donato Marra said the president had invited the outgoing government to \" remain in power in order to finish current business \" . Consultations on forming a new government would begin on Sunday , he said . Mr Napolitano is expected to formally ask Mr Monti or another candidate to form a government of technocrats . Mr Monti , a well respected economist , is exactly the sort of man that the money markets would like to see take charge at this time of crisis , our correspondent says , and he has support in many quarters . But there is significant opposition to him within the country , and a feeling that Italy 's troubles are just too deep for a mere change of government to make any rapid , significant difference . The austerity package foresees 59.8 bn euros in savings from a mixture of spending cuts and tax rises , with the aim of balancing the budget by 2014 . Measures include : - An increase in VAT , from 20 % to 21 % - A freeze on public-sector salaries until 2014 - The retirement age for women in the private sector will gradually rise , from 60 in 2014 until it reaches 65 in 2026 , the same age as for men - Measures to fight tax evasion will be strengthened , including a limit of 2,500 euros on cash transactions - There will be a special tax on the energy sector On Wednesday , the interest rate on 10 - year Italian government bonds touched 7 % , the rate at which Greece , Ireland and Portugal were forced to seek bailouts from the EU . An EU team has begun work in Rome , monitoring how Italy plans to cut its crushing debt burden , 120 % of annual economic output ( GDP ) . The Italian economy has grown at an average of 0.75 % a year over the past 15 years . Mr Berlusconi has been prime minister three times since he first took office in 1994 . He has described himself as Italy 's best head of government since the country was created nearly 150 years ago .

He said he felt \" embittered \" after hearing the insults . Mr Berlusconi is Italy 's longest-serving post - war prime minister . His premiership has recently been marred by many scandals . He is a consummate survivor , our correspondent says , but he was overwhelmed by the scale of the financial crisis which has engulfed Italy . After losing his parliamentary majority on Tuesday , Mr Berlusconi promised to resign when austerity measures , demanded by the EU and designed to restore markets ' confidence in the country 's economy , were passed by both houses of parliament . Members of the lower house voted 380 - 26 with two abstentions on Saturday , a day after the Senate approved the measures that have now been signed into law . Sluggish growth Mr Napolitano 's spokesman Donato Marra said the president had invited the outgoing government to \" remain in power in order to finish current business \" . Consultations on forming a new government would begin on Sunday , he said . Mr Napolitano is expected to formally ask Mr Monti or another candidate to form a government of technocrats . Mr Monti , a well respected economist , is exactly the sort of man that the money markets would like to see take charge at this time of crisis , our correspondent says , and he has support in many quarters . But there is significant opposition to him within the country , and a feeling that Italy 's troubles are just too deep for a mere change of government to make any rapid , significant difference . The austerity package foresees 59.8 bn euros in savings from a mixture of spending cuts and tax rises , with the aim of balancing the budget by 2014 . Measures include : - An increase in VAT , from 20 % to 21 % - A freeze on public-sector salaries until 2014 - The retirement age for women in the private sector will gradually rise , from 60 in 2014 until it reaches 65 in 2026 , the same age as for men - Measures to fight tax evasion will be strengthened , including a limit of 2,500 euros on cash transactions - There will be a special tax on the energy sector On Wednesday , the interest rate on 10 - year Italian government bonds touched 7 % , the rate at which Greece , Ireland and Portugal were forced to seek bailouts from the EU . An EU team has begun work in Rome , monitoring how Italy plans to cut its crushing debt burden , 120 % of annual economic output ( GDP ) . The Italian economy has grown at an average of 0.75 % a year over the past 15 years . Mr Berlusconi has been prime minister three times since he first took office in 1994 . He has described himself as Italy 's best head of government since the country was created nearly 150 years ago . But he is currently involved in several trials for fraud , corruption and having sex with an under - age girl , and has attracted media attention for so - called \" bunga - bunga \" parties which young women were allegedly paid to attend .","annotations":[{"text":"Silvio Berlusconi","span":[15,31],"token_span":[3,4],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The person who causes an entity (Item) to change its positon on a scale with respect to some property (Variable)."},{"text":"The retirement age for women","span":[2543,2570],"token_span":[465,469],"role":"Attribute","label":"Attribute","role_definition":"The scale along which the Item ranges in value."},{"text":"2026","span":[2655,2658],"token_span":[487,487],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the event occurs."},{"text":"Italy","span":[0,4],"token_span":[0,0],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the Agent changes the value of an Attribute."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-2486-899-frame-Cause_change_of_strength","frame":"Cause_change_of_strength","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Agent causes a Patient to be more strong, often resulting in something that is more secure and safe.","frame_ancestors":["Transitive_action","Objective_influence","Event"],"frame_descendants":["Change_resistance"],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"While writing the episodes , Takumi ranked the importance of each .

From Mr. Iwamoto 's dev blog ( click on \u201c \u5ca9\u5143\u30b3\u30e9\u30e0 \u201d ) for AA3 , we have this little gem \u2026 How did Mr. Kamiya 's drawing turn out ? Well , in the spirit of fairness , only click on this little Mr. Kamiya head if you really want to see ! And on that note , here are some notes of interest about the Trilogy games ! I 'm only including things that I have rarely or never seen on the internet , so hopefully , these will be all new for even you super-fans . Be warned that there are some spoilers for the games , so proceed at your own risk ! Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney \u2013 The secret to Ace Attorney 's simple game design is that Mr. Takumi wanted to make games that were easy enough for even his non-gamer mother to pick up and play . \u2013 When sitting down to write an Ace Attorney , Mr. Takumi has an internal ranking system of each episode 's importance that he follows . The most important episode is always episode 1 , followed by episode 2 , followed by the final episode of the game . While people may wonder why the first and second episodes are more important than the final episode , Mr. Takumi says that it 's because the role of the first episode is to make players like the game , followed by the second episode , which is to solidify their interest . \u2013 The original Japanese version of AA1 only had four episodes . The fifth episode , \u201c Rise from the Ashes \u201d , was added 4 years later when the game was brought to the Nintendo DS . When creating episode 5 , Mr. Takumi wanted to make sure it linked up story - wise with why Edgeworth disappeared in AA2 , so he approached it from the angle of \u201c what would be the most damaging to Edgeworth 's psyche ? \u201d Therefore , despite the seriousness of a topic like police corruption , he felt that corruption and betrayal from within the prosecutor 's office was the way to go . \u2013 The class trial in episode 4 is based on something that happened to Mr. Takumi in real life when he was in 2 nd grade . Here 's what he had to say about it in his AA1 dev blog : I was playing in my school 's courtyard when I found a small piggy bank out by the trash area . Inside was a single 5 - yen coin . Thinking nothing of it , I put the coin in my pocket . The next day , I was forced by a teacher I did n't know to stand before a girl I did n't know in a homeroom I did n't know . The teacher turned to me and scolded , \u201c Stealing is bad ! Now , apologize at once ! \u201d Apparently , the girl 's piggy bank had been stolen and someone had spotted me fiddling with it by the trash cans \u2026 At least , that 's what I gathered after the fact . \u2026 No ! It was n't me ! All I did was find it \u2026! My mind went blank . I did n't know what to do . \u201c Hurry up and apologize ! \u201d the teacher insisted hysterically as everyone in that unfamiliar homeroom glared coldly at me . \u201c \u2026 I 'm sorry . \u201d Tears rolled down my cheeks as I bowed and apologized profusely , over and over . All for picking up a single , stupid , 5 - yen coin . Because there was no \u201c Miles Edgeworth \u201d for me in that homeroom that day , I never became a lawyer . Instead , I was able to use that incident to write a bigger story , so I guess things turned out all right in the end . \u2013 \u201c It could be said that the protagonist of AA1 is Edgeworth because , in a manner of speaking , ' Turnabout Samurai ' exists for Edgeworth 's sake , \u201d penned Mr. Takumi in an AA1 dev blog . \u201c And then , with the theme of the [ fourth ] episode being ' rekindling the relationship ' , I tried to paint a picture of the intensely strong bond of friendship that two men can share , but I wonder if that 's what people got out of it ? There seems to be those who would suggest that Phoenix and Edgeworth 's ' intensely strong bond ' is more of an ' intensely passionate bond ' of sorts \u2026 \u201d \u2013 Episode 3 was originally going to feature a male culprit until AA1 's lead character designer Ms. Kumiko Suekane pointed out that all of the villains were male , to which Mr. Takumi half - joked in his dev blog that \u201c if this were America , we 'd probably get sued for gender discrimination . \u201d Keeping in mind that this is Japan from over 10 years ago and that attitudes have changed since then , there was debate among the team members over what to do with the now female character . Some suggested that it would be odd to have a female director for an action show , while others wondered what they should do about the director role in the story if she could n't fill it . In the end , Mr. Takumi promoted the scriptwriter character to director and really went for it when he transformed the culprit into a \u201c strong , glamorous , fashionable , and cool - headed \u201d female producer . \u2013 Maya was always going to be Phoenix 's partner in crime , but she was originally supposed to be a lawyer - in - training who was preparing to take the bar exam . \u2013 Mr. Takumi claims that he hardly wrote out any sort of backstory for Gumshoe before he started writing . Instead , Gumshoe 's personality and certain aspects of his character just sort of fell into place after Mr. Takumi decided on the \u201c pal \u201d ending of his sentences , while others grew organically out of the story . For example , one time Mr. Takumi was writing a scene when suddenly , Edgeworth blurts out , \u201c I 'm cutting your salary ! \u201d And thus , that aspect of Gumshoe 's backstory was born . \u2013 Ever wonder why Gumshoe always has a red pencil tucked behind his left ear ? That 's because it 's a holdover from when he was going to be a big fan of horse racing . \u2013 Larry was going to be just a normal 9 to 5 office worker who only appeared in episode 4 , but because he was drafted to be in episode 1 when it was added after the fact , his character went through a lot of changes and became the Larry we know today . \u2013 The three medals pinned to Lana Skye 's chest are proof of her three \u201c Prosecutor of the Year \u201d commendations . \u2013 Jake Marshall is meant to be a parallel of Godot in the \u201c Skye / Fey sisters \u201d analogy . \u2013 All of the cacti in Jake Marshall 's guard station have names such as \u201c Billy \u201d , \u201c Bogey \u201d , and \u201c Marilyn \u201d . \u2013 Angel Starr 's eyes change colors from black to blue when she changes moods . \u201c Rise from the Ashes \u201d art director Mr. Kazuya Nuri says that it 's colored contacts that make her eyes turn blue . Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney \u2013 Justice For All \u2013 The opening of the game did not originally feature the Judge . In fact , it was supposed to be a demon . From Mr. Takumi 's original storyboards : Apparently , Mr. Takumi was playing Devil May Cry 1 at the time and was struck by how awesome its opening was . \u2013 Pearl was originally going to be around the same age as Maya and would 've been a one - shot , snooty rival character , but at the suggestion of one of the designers who said it would be more dramatic if Pearl was a lot younger than Maya , Mr. Takumi channeled his inner little girl and tried writing Pearl as an 8- year -old . To his surprise , he found Pearl to be so adorable that he included her in more than just the second episode . \u2013 Episode 3 contains the two elements Mr. Takumi really wanted to include : the circus and magic ( in particular because performing magic is a hobby of his 1 .) It also contains two themes he wanted to explore : the difficulties in bringing different people together to form one cohesive team and a person who tries against the odds to make something whole . The first theme is reflected in the way everyone in the circus comes together in the end and the second theme is reflected in Moe the clown . Mr. Takumi said that he felt a little sad and would tear up sometimes as he wrote when he thought about how hard Moe kept trying despite the failures of his terrible jokes and the various props in his room to bring the troupe together . \u2013 There are roughly 3 different versions of episode 4 because of two big reasons : 1 ) Edgeworth 's popularity and 2 ) running out of memory on the game cartridge . Mr. Takumi had written a version of episode 4 in his initial prototype draft , but it was n't until they were already in full production that the team heard about how popular Edgeworth had become . Thinking that he had to use Edgeworth more carefully and sparingly , he created Franziska as a way to avoid having the supposed prodigy lose every case and to save him for the end . As for running out of memory , that leads me to the next bit of trivia \u2026 \u2013 The ideas for the mysterious fifth episode they could n't fit into AA2 due to a lack of cartridge memory were saved for AA3 . So , what was supposed to be AA2 , episode 4 ended up being AA3 , episode 3 . In fact , you can see for yourself that one of the pigeons in Vitamin Square is white . That white pigeon , or should I say \u201c dove \u201d , was supposed to make you wonder , \u201c Could that bird have escaped from a certain magician \u2026 ? \u201d Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney \u2013 Trials and Tribulations \u2013 AA3 was full of ideas that had to be cut due to memory issues . One of them was rookie Gumshoe . Along with sprites for younger Mia , Phoenix , and Edgeworth , there were going to be rookie detective Gumshoe ones with his tie tied up nice and tight and just one spike sticking out of his head . In the end , all he got was a new coat , but even just that had enough of an impact visually . \u2013 Because of a miscalculation regarding the size of all of the game assets , the team wound up having to make Bikini short as a way to save on memory . \u2013 Oldbag was supposed to appear in this game but she was cut due to memory issues , too . However , it turned out they had just enough for her to come back for a cameo at the very end , so they stuck her in . Mr. Takumi had wanted to give her a lei because she had just come back from a vacation to Hawaii , but they could n't squeeze that aspect in . \u2013 Because Larry 's \u201c thumbs up \u201d sprite has him doing the gesture with his left hand , he officially became a left - handed character when the team put a brush in that hand . \u2013 Grossberg 's suit got a color change strictly because he blended in too much with the brown courtroom in his brown suit , so he was given a red suit to help him stand out a little more . ( For those of you who do n't remember , GBA screens were not backlit and frontlit screens would not appear until the GBA SP , so sometimes it was hard to make things out if the sprite contrast was too low . ) \u2013 Mr. Takumi admits he gave Grossberg his hemorrhoids on a fluke . He says that had he written Grossberg on a different day , he might not have been in the mindset to give him that quirk . \u2013 Godot was originally going to drink bourbon whiskey and smoke to match his \u201c hard - boiled \u201d image , but the team realized these things could have a bad influence on kids so they switched his drink of choice to coffee . Localization Trivia \u2013 Dahlia Hawthorne 's nickname name is a nod to the fan translation effort , and I 'm glad that some people at the time did pick up on the Dolly \u2192 Dollie connection . As for her full name , as a fan of X Japan , I really liked the name Dahlia and was listening to that album of theirs at the time . Hawthorne is a reference to \u201c Rappaccini 's Daughter \u201d , though this was n't my first reference to him . Pearl is also a reference to one of his other famous works , \u201c The Scarlet Letter \u201d . \u2013 Diego Armando 's initial name ideas included Joseph Cuppa , Xavier Barstucks , and William Havamug . I especially could n't take Havamug seriously , so , um \u2026 have a mug \u2026 ? A doodle from 2007 \u2026 Also , why I 'm not an artist . \u2013 Jean Armstrong is not actually French in either the Japanese or English versions , which is why Tr\u00e9s Bien is spelled wrong in the English version and he speaks atrociously bad French . \u2013 Speaking of Monsieur Armstrong , I 'd just like to clear up some misconceptions and localization issues surrounding his gender and sexuality . Before I begin though , please keep in mind that societal attitudes and definitions change over time , and that the original Japanese version was made over 10 years ago . Furthermore , Japanese concepts of gender and sexuality do NOT map 1 to 1 onto Western ideas due to vastly different religious , cultural , and historical influences . In the Japanese version , Jean is a typical \u201c okama \u201d character . At the time , the word \u201c okama \u201d was the generally used catchall word for an \u201c effeminate - acting man \u201d , and had been the go-to word since the Edo period . While that usually implied that the man in question was gay , the word was also used for any biologically male person who did drag or spoke like a woman regardless of their gender or sexuality , and even trans women . Nowadays , similar to the way the word \u201c q u eer \u201d is used in the West ( but not entirely the same ) , \u201c okama \u201d is considered derogatory and discriminatory , though some people will still call themselves \u201c okama \u201d . Since adopting the English word \u201c gay \u201d , it has become more culturally acceptable to refer to actual gay men as \u201c gei \u201d ( \u30b2\u30a4 ) or the more formal word \u201c douseiaisha \u201d ( \u540c\u6027\u611b\u8005 \u2013 literally : \u201c person who loves the same sex \u201d ) . Given all of this , what that meant for the localized version was that I had to take a very vague and different concept of \u201c gay \u201d and localize it in a way that would be understandable to a Western audience . Using all of the info we get about Jean in the game , the answer I came up with was that he is a gay , cis man who enjoys performing non-passing drag \u2026 Or to put it in a more concrete way , think Conchita Wurst . Jean 's drag persona , which I have dubbed \u201c Campy French Maiden Jean \u201d , is all we ever see during the investigation segments , but in court , he identifies himself as a man to the judge when he is asked what gender he is . Unfortunately , back in 2007 , the general public 's understanding of gender and sexuality was not as informed or as nuanced as it is today , so I think Jean still caused a lot of confusion in the English version , but I hope this has cleared it up somewhat . In terms of how the characters reference Jean , I admit it would 've been better if they used female pronouns out of respect for his drag persona once they realized it was a persona , but in addition to the fact that I ca n't add any extra text boxes to the game , I felt it would 've been too controversial and hard to explain in - game back then . Furthermore , because he and his persona are not given separate names , it becomes very confusing very quickly as to when the characters are talking about \u201c Campy French Maiden Jean \u201d and when they 're talking about the man / legal witness \u201c Mr. Jean Armstrong \u201d . That said , I feel that society is making progress \u2014 to the point where things like calling people by their preferred gender pronoun is slowly becoming the socially correct thing to do \u2014 so I hope that someday I wo n't need to provide an in- game explanation . As a side note , given what type of character he is , you can see how he ties into the overall theme of the game , which is \u201c not everything is always what it seems on the surface \u201d . And speaking of people who are not what people think they are , here 's a bonus fact : Klavier Gavin is not German , but he did study in Germany for a while . We tried to hint at his true nationality with Phoenix saying that Klavier 's accent is \u201c affected \u201d but in hindsight , that may have been too subtle of a hint . \u2191 Awkward Zombie \u2013 \u201c Culture Schlock \u201d by Katie Tiedrich ( awkwardzombie.com/index.php?page=0&comic\u2026 ) \u2013 While I 'm sure that every fan on the planet has seen this wonderful comic by now , I just wanted to say one thing in my defense \u2013 OBJECTION ! When I took over the series ' localization direction starting with the second game , one of the first things I had to deal with was what to do with Maya 's hometown and all the mysticism surrounding the Fey clan . It was then that I created a little headcanon for myself ( which I suppose is actually real canon now for the localized version ) : while \u201c Gyakuten Saiban \u201d takes place in Japan , the Los Angeles that \u201c Ace Attorney \u201d takes place in is an alternate universe where anti-Japanese sentiments and anti-immigrant laws were not enacted , and Japanese culture was allowed to flourish and blend into the local culture in the same manner as other immigrant cultures . Not counting budget and time restraints , this little headcanon has pretty much dictated what I would keep as Japanese and what to completely localize . For example , anything related to Maya 's clan and the Kurain Channeling Technique is pretty much guaranteed to stay Japanese because that 's her heritage while Japanese foods that are not commonly known in the West will probably be localized in the interest of keeping the game from needing a 50 - page explanatory booklet . By the way , random facts : I adore the fandom name \u201c Japanifornia \u201d , and imagine my surprise when I first saw the \u201c Big Hero 6 \u201d movie trailer ! No matter what anyone says , Japanifornia will always be THE ORIGINAL San Fransokyo to me . * grin* \u2013 The Judge 's Canadian brother came about because fellow localization director Andrew Alfonso , who helped edit AA3 , is Canadian himself and wanted to show his Maple Pride . \u2013 Luke Atmey 's catchphrase at one point during the translation process was \u201c Schwing ! \u201d , but I changed it to \u201c Zvarri ! \u201d because I felt it was catchy and eccentric like Atmey himself , and a ton of fun to say ! The word itself does n't mean anything in any language that I 'm aware of , but sounds identical to the Japanese word Atmey uses . The original Japanese word \u201c zuvari \u201d ( \u30ba\u30f4\u30a1\u30ea ) is also not exactly a real word , but is based on the word \u201c zubari \u201d ( \u30ba\u30d0\u30ea \u2013 lit . \u201c frankly \u201d , \u201c decisively \u201d ) which is often used on Japanese infomercials as a sort of catchphrase / sound effect along the lines of \u201c BAM ! \u201d as in , \u201c And the price of this dice - n-chopper is only \u2026 BAM ! $ 9.99 ! \u201d \u2013 Ever wanted to see a few of the other fonts we could 've gone with for Feenie and his ridiculous sweater \u2026? Can you tell which one we eventually went with ? ===================================== Phew , that was a lot of trivia , but I hope everyone enjoyed them ! There is so much more that I did n't get to share , but there is also always the future ! Join me next time \u2013 As Phoenix said , Happy Halloween , everyone ! I 'm looking forward to seeing your pumpkins and cosplays 2 ! And finally , here 's the absolute last tidbit I 'll be sharing today . TAKE THAT ! Edgeworth : Gnrk ! Why do you have rough design sketches of me as a child ?! And what is Wright doing there , blushing like that ?! Janet : \u2026 You 're going to have to ask your designer , Ms. Suekane , about that , because I 'm not going to speculate . Edgeworth : This entire entry has been one abominable trick from start to finish ! Janet : Maybe for you , but just remember : one person 's trick is another person 's treat ! Join me next time for another of Mr. Takumi 's blogs . I promise it will be of special interest to people interested in game mechanic design ! Until then ! 1 You can see Mr. Takumi in action in these \u201c Ghost Trick : Phantom Detective \u201d promo videos : \u201c Takumi na Magic \u201d pt. 1 , pt. 2 , pt. 3 , pt. 4 ( Please ignore how terrible of an audience we on the Ghost Trick team were \u2013 Mr. Takumi had to prompt us to respond more and clap , haha \u2013 and stick around after the 4 th video for Mr. Takumi's Top Pomeranian \u2014 Missile ! ) . By the way , \u201c Takumi na Magic \u201d is a pun on his name and the word \u201c takumi \u201d , which means \u201c clever \u201d , \u201c masterful \u201d , and even \u201c ingenious \u201d , depending on the context . Mr. Takumi says he often feels the need to state that despite his name sounding like a pen name that literally translates into \u201c Clever Ship \u201d ( \u5de7 \u821f ) , his name really is \u201c Takumi Shu \u201d . 2 Please excuse my horrible pumpkin pics that were taken with my phone 3 years ago under terrible lighting and were not supposed to see the light of day \u2026 Catch up on previous blog entries here ! - Brands : Tags : Loading ...

From Mr. Iwamoto 's dev blog ( click on \u201c \u5ca9\u5143\u30b3\u30e9\u30e0 \u201d ) for AA3 , we have this little gem \u2026 How did Mr. Kamiya 's drawing turn out ? Well , in the spirit of fairness , only click on this little Mr. Kamiya head if you really want to see ! And on that note , here are some notes of interest about the Trilogy games ! I 'm only including things that I have rarely or never seen on the internet , so hopefully , these will be all new for even you super-fans . Be warned that there are some spoilers for the games , so proceed at your own risk ! Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney \u2013 The secret to Ace Attorney 's simple game design is that Mr. Takumi wanted to make games that were easy enough for even his non-gamer mother to pick up and play . \u2013 When sitting down to write an Ace Attorney , Mr. Takumi has an internal ranking system of each episode 's importance that he follows . The most important episode is always episode 1 , followed by episode 2 , followed by the final episode of the game . While people may wonder why the first and second episodes are more important than the final episode , Mr. Takumi says that it 's because the role of the first episode is to make players like the game , followed by the second episode , which is to solidify their interest . \u2013 The original Japanese version of AA1 only had four episodes . The fifth episode , \u201c Rise from the Ashes \u201d , was added 4 years later when the game was brought to the Nintendo DS . When creating episode 5 , Mr. Takumi wanted to make sure it linked up story - wise with why Edgeworth disappeared in AA2 , so he approached it from the angle of \u201c what would be the most damaging to Edgeworth 's psyche ? \u201d Therefore , despite the seriousness of a topic like police corruption , he felt that corruption and betrayal from within the prosecutor 's office was the way to go . \u2013 The class trial in episode 4 is based on something that happened to Mr. Takumi in real life when he was in 2 nd grade . Here 's what he had to say about it in his AA1 dev blog : I was playing in my school 's courtyard when I found a small piggy bank out by the trash area . Inside was a single 5 - yen coin . Thinking nothing of it , I put the coin in my pocket . The next day , I was forced by a teacher I did n't know to stand before a girl I did n't know in a homeroom I did n't know . The teacher turned to me and scolded , \u201c Stealing is bad ! Now , apologize at once ! \u201d Apparently , the girl 's piggy bank had been stolen and someone had spotted me fiddling with it by the trash cans \u2026 At least , that 's what I gathered after the fact . \u2026 No ! It was n't me ! All I did was find it \u2026! My mind went blank . I did n't know what to do . \u201c Hurry up and apologize ! \u201d the teacher insisted hysterically as everyone in that unfamiliar homeroom glared coldly at me . \u201c \u2026 I 'm sorry . \u201d Tears rolled down my cheeks as I bowed and apologized profusely , over and over . All for picking up a single , stupid , 5 - yen coin . Because there was no \u201c Miles Edgeworth \u201d for me in that homeroom that day , I never became a lawyer . Instead , I was able to use that incident to write a bigger story , so I guess things turned out all right in the end . \u2013 \u201c It could be said that the protagonist of AA1 is Edgeworth because , in a manner of speaking , ' Turnabout Samurai ' exists for Edgeworth 's sake , \u201d penned Mr. Takumi in an AA1 dev blog . \u201c And then , with the theme of the [ fourth ] episode being ' rekindling the relationship ' , I tried to paint a picture of the intensely strong bond of friendship that two men can share , but I wonder if that 's what people got out of it ? There seems to be those who would suggest that Phoenix and Edgeworth 's ' intensely strong bond ' is more of an ' intensely passionate bond ' of sorts \u2026 \u201d \u2013 Episode 3 was originally going to feature a male culprit until AA1 's lead character designer Ms. Kumiko Suekane pointed out that all of the villains were male , to which Mr. Takumi half - joked in his dev blog that \u201c if this were America , we 'd probably get sued for gender discrimination . \u201d Keeping in mind that this is Japan from over 10 years ago and that attitudes have changed since then , there was debate among the team members over what to do with the now female character . Some suggested that it would be odd to have a female director for an action show , while others wondered what they should do about the director role in the story if she could n't fill it . In the end , Mr. Takumi promoted the scriptwriter character to director and really went for it when he transformed the culprit into a \u201c strong , glamorous , fashionable , and cool - headed \u201d female producer . \u2013 Maya was always going to be Phoenix 's partner in crime , but she was originally supposed to be a lawyer - in - training who was preparing to take the bar exam . \u2013 Mr. Takumi claims that he hardly wrote out any sort of backstory for Gumshoe before he started writing . Instead , Gumshoe 's personality and certain aspects of his character just sort of fell into place after Mr. Takumi decided on the \u201c pal \u201d ending of his sentences , while others grew organically out of the story . For example , one time Mr. Takumi was writing a scene when suddenly , Edgeworth blurts out , \u201c I 'm cutting your salary ! \u201d And thus , that aspect of Gumshoe 's backstory was born . \u2013 Ever wonder why Gumshoe always has a red pencil tucked behind his left ear ? That 's because it 's a holdover from when he was going to be a big fan of horse racing . \u2013 Larry was going to be just a normal 9 to 5 office worker who only appeared in episode 4 , but because he was drafted to be in episode 1 when it was added after the fact , his character went through a lot of changes and became the Larry we know today . \u2013 The three medals pinned to Lana Skye 's chest are proof of her three \u201c Prosecutor of the Year \u201d commendations . \u2013 Jake Marshall is meant to be a parallel of Godot in the \u201c Skye / Fey sisters \u201d analogy . \u2013 All of the cacti in Jake Marshall 's guard station have names such as \u201c Billy \u201d , \u201c Bogey \u201d , and \u201c Marilyn \u201d . \u2013 Angel Starr 's eyes change colors from black to blue when she changes moods . \u201c Rise from the Ashes \u201d art director Mr. Kazuya Nuri says that it 's colored contacts that make her eyes turn blue . Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney \u2013 Justice For All \u2013 The opening of the game did not originally feature the Judge . In fact , it was supposed to be a demon . From Mr. Takumi 's original storyboards : Apparently , Mr. Takumi was playing Devil May Cry 1 at the time and was struck by how awesome its opening was . \u2013 Pearl was originally going to be around the same age as Maya and would 've been a one - shot , snooty rival character , but at the suggestion of one of the designers who said it would be more dramatic if Pearl was a lot younger than Maya , Mr. Takumi channeled his inner little girl and tried writing Pearl as an 8- year -old . To his surprise , he found Pearl to be so adorable that he included her in more than just the second episode . \u2013 Episode 3 contains the two elements Mr. Takumi really wanted to include : the circus and magic ( in particular because performing magic is a hobby of his 1 .) It also contains two themes he wanted to explore : the difficulties in bringing different people together to form one cohesive team and a person who tries against the odds to make something whole . The first theme is reflected in the way everyone in the circus comes together in the end and the second theme is reflected in Moe the clown . Mr. Takumi said that he felt a little sad and would tear up sometimes as he wrote when he thought about how hard Moe kept trying despite the failures of his terrible jokes and the various props in his room to bring the troupe together . \u2013 There are roughly 3 different versions of episode 4 because of two big reasons : 1 ) Edgeworth 's popularity and 2 ) running out of memory on the game cartridge . Mr. Takumi had written a version of episode 4 in his initial prototype draft , but it was n't until they were already in full production that the team heard about how popular Edgeworth had become . Thinking that he had to use Edgeworth more carefully and sparingly , he created Franziska as a way to avoid having the supposed prodigy lose every case and to save him for the end . As for running out of memory , that leads me to the next bit of trivia \u2026 \u2013 The ideas for the mysterious fifth episode they could n't fit into AA2 due to a lack of cartridge memory were saved for AA3 . So , what was supposed to be AA2 , episode 4 ended up being AA3 , episode 3 . In fact , you can see for yourself that one of the pigeons in Vitamin Square is white . That white pigeon , or should I say \u201c dove \u201d , was supposed to make you wonder , \u201c Could that bird have escaped from a certain magician \u2026 ? \u201d Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney \u2013 Trials and Tribulations \u2013 AA3 was full of ideas that had to be cut due to memory issues . One of them was rookie Gumshoe . Along with sprites for younger Mia , Phoenix , and Edgeworth , there were going to be rookie detective Gumshoe ones with his tie tied up nice and tight and just one spike sticking out of his head . In the end , all he got was a new coat , but even just that had enough of an impact visually . \u2013 Because of a miscalculation regarding the size of all of the game assets , the team wound up having to make Bikini short as a way to save on memory . \u2013 Oldbag was supposed to appear in this game but she was cut due to memory issues , too . However , it turned out they had just enough for her to come back for a cameo at the very end , so they stuck her in . Mr. Takumi had wanted to give her a lei because she had just come back from a vacation to Hawaii , but they could n't squeeze that aspect in . \u2013 Because Larry 's \u201c thumbs up \u201d sprite has him doing the gesture with his left hand , he officially became a left - handed character when the team put a brush in that hand . \u2013 Grossberg 's suit got a color change strictly because he blended in too much with the brown courtroom in his brown suit , so he was given a red suit to help him stand out a little more . ( For those of you who do n't remember , GBA screens were not backlit and frontlit screens would not appear until the GBA SP , so sometimes it was hard to make things out if the sprite contrast was too low . ) \u2013 Mr. Takumi admits he gave Grossberg his hemorrhoids on a fluke . He says that had he written Grossberg on a different day , he might not have been in the mindset to give him that quirk . \u2013 Godot was originally going to drink bourbon whiskey and smoke to match his \u201c hard - boiled \u201d image , but the team realized these things could have a bad influence on kids so they switched his drink of choice to coffee . Localization Trivia \u2013 Dahlia Hawthorne 's nickname name is a nod to the fan translation effort , and I 'm glad that some people at the time did pick up on the Dolly \u2192 Dollie connection . As for her full name , as a fan of X Japan , I really liked the name Dahlia and was listening to that album of theirs at the time . Hawthorne is a reference to \u201c Rappaccini 's Daughter \u201d , though this was n't my first reference to him . Pearl is also a reference to one of his other famous works , \u201c The Scarlet Letter \u201d . \u2013 Diego Armando 's initial name ideas included Joseph Cuppa , Xavier Barstucks , and William Havamug . I especially could n't take Havamug seriously , so , um \u2026 have a mug \u2026 ? A doodle from 2007 \u2026 Also , why I 'm not an artist . \u2013 Jean Armstrong is not actually French in either the Japanese or English versions , which is why Tr\u00e9s Bien is spelled wrong in the English version and he speaks atrociously bad French . \u2013 Speaking of Monsieur Armstrong , I 'd just like to clear up some misconceptions and localization issues surrounding his gender and sexuality . Before I begin though , please keep in mind that societal attitudes and definitions change over time , and that the original Japanese version was made over 10 years ago . Furthermore , Japanese concepts of gender and sexuality do NOT map 1 to 1 onto Western ideas due to vastly different religious , cultural , and historical influences . In the Japanese version , Jean is a typical \u201c okama \u201d character . At the time , the word \u201c okama \u201d was the generally used catchall word for an \u201c effeminate - acting man \u201d , and had been the go-to word since the Edo period . While that usually implied that the man in question was gay , the word was also used for any biologically male person who did drag or spoke like a woman regardless of their gender or sexuality , and even trans women . Nowadays , similar to the way the word \u201c q u eer \u201d is used in the West ( but not entirely the same ) , \u201c okama \u201d is considered derogatory and discriminatory , though some people will still call themselves \u201c okama \u201d . Since adopting the English word \u201c gay \u201d , it has become more culturally acceptable to refer to actual gay men as \u201c gei \u201d ( \u30b2\u30a4 ) or the more formal word \u201c douseiaisha \u201d ( \u540c\u6027\u611b\u8005 \u2013 literally : \u201c person who loves the same sex \u201d ) . Given all of this , what that meant for the localized version was that I had to take a very vague and different concept of \u201c gay \u201d and localize it in a way that would be understandable to a Western audience . Using all of the info we get about Jean in the game , the answer I came up with was that he is a gay , cis man who enjoys performing non-passing drag \u2026 Or to put it in a more concrete way , think Conchita Wurst . Jean 's drag persona , which I have dubbed \u201c Campy French Maiden Jean \u201d , is all we ever see during the investigation segments , but in court , he identifies himself as a man to the judge when he is asked what gender he is . Unfortunately , back in 2007 , the general public 's understanding of gender and sexuality was not as informed or as nuanced as it is today , so I think Jean still caused a lot of confusion in the English version , but I hope this has cleared it up somewhat . In terms of how the characters reference Jean , I admit it would 've been better if they used female pronouns out of respect for his drag persona once they realized it was a persona , but in addition to the fact that I ca n't add any extra text boxes to the game , I felt it would 've been too controversial and hard to explain in - game back then . Furthermore , because he and his persona are not given separate names , it becomes very confusing very quickly as to when the characters are talking about \u201c Campy French Maiden Jean \u201d and when they 're talking about the man / legal witness \u201c Mr. Jean Armstrong \u201d . That said , I feel that society is making progress \u2014 to the point where things like calling people by their preferred gender pronoun is slowly becoming the socially correct thing to do \u2014 so I hope that someday I wo n't need to provide an in- game explanation . As a side note , given what type of character he is , you can see how he ties into the overall theme of the game , which is \u201c not everything is always what it seems on the surface \u201d . And speaking of people who are not what people think they are , here 's a bonus fact : Klavier Gavin is not German , but he did study in Germany for a while . We tried to hint at his true nationality with Phoenix saying that Klavier 's accent is \u201c affected \u201d but in hindsight , that may have been too subtle of a hint . \u2191 Awkward Zombie \u2013 \u201c Culture Schlock \u201d by Katie Tiedrich ( awkwardzombie.com/index.php?page=0&comic\u2026 ) \u2013 While I 'm sure that every fan on the planet has seen this wonderful comic by now , I just wanted to say one thing in my defense \u2013 OBJECTION ! When I took over the series ' localization direction starting with the second game , one of the first things I had to deal with was what to do with Maya 's hometown and all the mysticism surrounding the Fey clan . It was then that I created a little headcanon for myself ( which I suppose is actually real canon now for the localized version ) : while \u201c Gyakuten Saiban \u201d takes place in Japan , the Los Angeles that \u201c Ace Attorney \u201d takes place in is an alternate universe where anti-Japanese sentiments and anti-immigrant laws were not enacted , and Japanese culture was allowed to flourish and blend into the local culture in the same manner as other immigrant cultures . Not counting budget and time restraints , this little headcanon has pretty much dictated what I would keep as Japanese and what to completely localize . For example , anything related to Maya 's clan and the Kurain Channeling Technique is pretty much guaranteed to stay Japanese because that 's her heritage while Japanese foods that are not commonly known in the West will probably be localized in the interest of keeping the game from needing a 50 - page explanatory booklet . By the way , random facts : I adore the fandom name \u201c Japanifornia \u201d , and imagine my surprise when I first saw the \u201c Big Hero 6 \u201d movie trailer ! No matter what anyone says , Japanifornia will always be THE ORIGINAL San Fransokyo to me . * grin* \u2013 The Judge 's Canadian brother came about because fellow localization director Andrew Alfonso , who helped edit AA3 , is Canadian himself and wanted to show his Maple Pride . \u2013 Luke Atmey 's catchphrase at one point during the translation process was \u201c Schwing ! \u201d , but I changed it to \u201c Zvarri ! \u201d because I felt it was catchy and eccentric like Atmey himself , and a ton of fun to say ! The word itself does n't mean anything in any language that I 'm aware of , but sounds identical to the Japanese word Atmey uses . The original Japanese word \u201c zuvari \u201d ( \u30ba\u30f4\u30a1\u30ea ) is also not exactly a real word , but is based on the word \u201c zubari \u201d ( \u30ba\u30d0\u30ea \u2013 lit . \u201c frankly \u201d , \u201c decisively \u201d ) which is often used on Japanese infomercials as a sort of catchphrase / sound effect along the lines of \u201c BAM ! \u201d as in , \u201c And the price of this dice - n-chopper is only \u2026 BAM ! $ 9.99 ! \u201d \u2013 Ever wanted to see a few of the other fonts we could 've gone with for Feenie and his ridiculous sweater \u2026? Can you tell which one we eventually went with ? ===================================== Phew , that was a lot of trivia , but I hope everyone enjoyed them ! There is so much more that I did n't get to share , but there is also always the future ! Join me next time \u2013 As Phoenix said , Happy Halloween , everyone ! I 'm looking forward to seeing your pumpkins and cosplays 2 ! And finally , here 's the absolute last tidbit I 'll be sharing today . TAKE THAT ! Edgeworth : Gnrk ! Why do you have rough design sketches of me as a child ?! And what is Wright doing there , blushing like that ?! Janet : \u2026 You 're going to have to ask your designer , Ms. Suekane , about that , because I 'm not going to speculate . Edgeworth : This entire entry has been one abominable trick from start to finish ! Janet : Maybe for you , but just remember : one person 's trick is another person 's treat ! Join me next time for another of Mr. Takumi 's blogs . I promise it will be of special interest to people interested in game mechanic design ! Until then ! 1 You can see Mr. Takumi in action in these \u201c Ghost Trick : Phantom Detective \u201d promo videos : \u201c Takumi na Magic \u201d pt. 1 , pt. 2 , pt. 3 , pt. 4 ( Please ignore how terrible of an audience we on the Ghost Trick team were \u2013 Mr. Takumi had to prompt us to respond more and clap , haha \u2013 and stick around after the 4 th video for Mr. Takumi's Top Pomeranian \u2014 Missile ! ) . By the way , \u201c Takumi na Magic \u201d is a pun on his name and the word \u201c takumi \u201d , which means \u201c clever \u201d , \u201c masterful \u201d , and even \u201c ingenious \u201d , depending on the context . Mr. Takumi says he often feels the need to state that despite his name sounding like a pen name that literally translates into \u201c Clever Ship \u201d ( \u5de7 \u821f ) , his name really is \u201c Takumi Shu \u201d . 2 Please excuse my horrible pumpkin pics that were taken with my phone 3 years ago under terrible lighting and were not supposed to see the light of day \u2026 Catch up on previous blog entries here ! - Brands : Tags : Loading ...

The truth is that Terrell , a hulking 6 ft 6in 200lb fighter from Chicago , was on the receiving end of the nastiest display of Ali 's celebrated ring career , after he had persistently referred to his opponent by his old slave name Cassius Clay in the run - up to their savage encounter at the Houston Astrodome on February 6 1967 , when Terrell 's World Boxing Association title was on the line . Ali himself was not blameless in stoking the pre-fight tensions , casually referring to Terrell as \u201c an Uncle Tom n----- who is gonna get his ass whupped \u201d . Many found his words inexcusable even if they proved prophetic . For Terrell paid a high price for his temerity from the opening bell . He took a beating over 15 rounds and was the victim of every trick Ali contrived to pull \u2013 and inexplicably got away with \u2013 in an attempt to break his opponent 's will . Having grown up on Chicago 's notorious south side , Terrell could never have been described as an angel , but the way Ali seized him in a headlock and , in one deft manoeuvre , dragged his eye along the top rope , revealed a dark side the \u201c The Louisville Lip \u201d had not displayed before . The fight will be remembered for Ali 's constant taunts of \u201c what 's my name ? \u201d to an opponent he was apparently content not merely to defeat , but also to belittle and humiliate . It was an unedifying spectacle and Terrell 's anguish was prolonged . Ali 's attitude might also have been spawned by the fact that the World Boxing Association had recognised Terrell as its champion for the preceding two years , having refused to sanction Ali 's somewhat farcical rematch with Sonny Liston in March 1965 , at a time when Ali was unpopular with the American establishment for aligning himself with the Nation of Islam . The subsequent headlines were the worst of Ali 's career , while the referee , Harry Kessler , also drew criticism for failing to protect Terrell and for allowing the fight to continue even after the wilting champion was battered by 30 unanswered punches in round 13 . Terrell 's career never recovered , and for a while there were genuine concerns that his eyesight would be permanently affected . Born into a farming family at Belzoni , Mississippi , on April 4 1939 , Ernest Terrell moved to Chicago as an infant and launched his professional career at the age of 18 . Steadily putting together a string of victories in his adopted home city , Ernie had the bulk and stature , plus an 82in reach , to trouble any of the best heavyweights of the day . But he seemingly lacked the killer instinct , while his mauling , spoiling style would never make him a box-office favourite . Nevertheless , he was good enough to beat rated contenders such as Zora Folley , Jefferson Davis and Cleveland ( \u201c Big Cat \u201d ) Williams ( who in 1962 had knocked him out ) . With Ali frozen out of the title picture , he took on Eddie Machen for the vacant WBA crown at Chicago 's International Amphitheatre on March 5 1965 . Terrell was crowned champion after outpointing Machen over 15 hard - fought rounds , and saw off challenges from George Chuvalo and Doug Jones before his fateful title defence against Ali. Terrell and Ali in the ring , February 6 1967 ( GETTY / HULTON ARCHIVE ) Terrell hung up the gloves soon afterwards , having lost to Thad Spencer in a WBA eliminating tournament but , following a three - year lay-off , attempted an ill-advised comeback in 1970 . Eleven successive victories against largely mediocre opposition seemed to have brought the big man back into title contention again , before a shocking first - round knockout by the unranked Jeff Merritt at Madison Square Gardens on September 10 1973 ended his career . In 55 professional fights , Terrell had 46 wins ( 21 by knockout ) and nine losses . Unlike some of his contemporaries , Terrell carved out a respectable post-boxing career , becoming for a time a record producer . Even during his fighting days he had occasionally sung with his group The Heavyweights , which included his brothers J C and Leonard as well as his sister Velma . He was also a successful fight promoter in the Chicago area . He is survived by his wife , Maxine , a son and a daughter .

The truth is that Terrell , a hulking 6 ft 6in 200lb fighter from Chicago , was on the receiving end of the nastiest display of Ali 's celebrated ring career , after he had persistently referred to his opponent by his old slave name Cassius Clay in the run - up to their savage encounter at the Houston Astrodome on February 6 1967 , when Terrell 's World Boxing Association title was on the line . Ali himself was not blameless in stoking the pre-fight tensions , casually referring to Terrell as \u201c an Uncle Tom n----- who is gonna get his ass whupped \u201d . Many found his words inexcusable even if they proved prophetic . For Terrell paid a high price for his temerity from the opening bell . He took a beating over 15 rounds and was the victim of every trick Ali contrived to pull \u2013 and inexplicably got away with \u2013 in an attempt to break his opponent 's will . Having grown up on Chicago 's notorious south side , Terrell could never have been described as an angel , but the way Ali seized him in a headlock and , in one deft manoeuvre , dragged his eye along the top rope , revealed a dark side the \u201c The Louisville Lip \u201d had not displayed before . The fight will be remembered for Ali 's constant taunts of \u201c what 's my name ? \u201d to an opponent he was apparently content not merely to defeat , but also to belittle and humiliate . It was an unedifying spectacle and Terrell 's anguish was prolonged . Ali 's attitude might also have been spawned by the fact that the World Boxing Association had recognised Terrell as its champion for the preceding two years , having refused to sanction Ali 's somewhat farcical rematch with Sonny Liston in March 1965 , at a time when Ali was unpopular with the American establishment for aligning himself with the Nation of Islam . The subsequent headlines were the worst of Ali 's career , while the referee , Harry Kessler , also drew criticism for failing to protect Terrell and for allowing the fight to continue even after the wilting champion was battered by 30 unanswered punches in round 13 . Terrell 's career never recovered , and for a while there were genuine concerns that his eyesight would be permanently affected . Born into a farming family at Belzoni , Mississippi , on April 4 1939 , Ernest Terrell moved to Chicago as an infant and launched his professional career at the age of 18 . Steadily putting together a string of victories in his adopted home city , Ernie had the bulk and stature , plus an 82in reach , to trouble any of the best heavyweights of the day . But he seemingly lacked the killer instinct , while his mauling , spoiling style would never make him a box-office favourite . Nevertheless , he was good enough to beat rated contenders such as Zora Folley , Jefferson Davis and Cleveland ( \u201c Big Cat \u201d ) Williams ( who in 1962 had knocked him out ) . With Ali frozen out of the title picture , he took on Eddie Machen for the vacant WBA crown at Chicago 's International Amphitheatre on March 5 1965 . Terrell was crowned champion after outpointing Machen over 15 hard - fought rounds , and saw off challenges from George Chuvalo and Doug Jones before his fateful title defence against Ali. Terrell and Ali in the ring , February 6 1967 ( GETTY / HULTON ARCHIVE ) Terrell hung up the gloves soon afterwards , having lost to Thad Spencer in a WBA eliminating tournament but , following a three - year lay-off , attempted an ill-advised comeback in 1970 . Eleven successive victories against largely mediocre opposition seemed to have brought the big man back into title contention again , before a shocking first - round knockout by the unranked Jeff Merritt at Madison Square Gardens on September 10 1973 ended his career . In 55 professional fights , Terrell had 46 wins ( 21 by knockout ) and nine losses . Unlike some of his contemporaries , Terrell carved out a respectable post-boxing career , becoming for a time a record producer . Even during his fighting days he had occasionally sung with his group The Heavyweights , which included his brothers J C and Leonard as well as his sister Velma . He was also a successful fight promoter in the Chicago area . He is survived by his wife , Maxine , a son and a daughter .

Pittsburgh , October 1 PENNSYLVANIA justice had spoken . The courtroom was stunned . The three defendants stood immobile . Counsel were amazed . The widow Barkoski stared . Judge Gray turned white . \" Gentlemen of the jury , \" the clerk droned , \" you say you find the defendants not guilty ? \" \" Yes , \" they chorused . Walter J. Lyster and Harold P. Watts turned and nodded to their mothers . Frank Slapikis heaved a sigh of relief . Tears stole down the cheeks of the widow Barkoski . Judge Gray thanked the jury , and the normal courtroom sounds replaced the hush . Thus ended what had started out to be the exercise of justice by a sovereign State \u2013 the fixing of responsibility for the savage killing of John Barkoski , Allegheny County miner . \" This , \" said Prosecutor Roy T. Clunk when be got his breath , \" is the most shocking miscarriage of justice in the history of this or any other country . I am glad the verdict is not on my conscience . \" John Barkoski worked at Montour mine No. 9 of the Pittsburgh Coal Company at Santiago . He had rented a farm , which he worked in his off hours . He hoped eventually to leave the mine forever and spend his days peacefully on his farm . But on February 9 , 1929 , he stepped into his mother - in - laws home , House No. 210 , near the mine , and there fell into the hands of two coal and iron policemen employed by the Pittsburgh Coal Company , Harold Watts and Frank Slapikis . The defense said Barkoski had stabbed Watts . Eyewitnesses for the prosecution said Watts had launched an unprovoked attack on Barkoski . At any rate , Barkoski was delivered to the barracks of the coal and iron police at Imperial with the following injuries : Laceration of the left cheek , five or six head wounds , two broken ribs and a fractured nose . Dr. J. M. Patterson , coal company physician , ascertained these injuries and treated them . He testified on the witness stand that he observed Lieutenant Lyster , who was in charge of the police , kicking and beating Barkoski while the miner lay semiconscious on the floor . Lyster , the physician said , beat Barkoski with a strap , twisted his ears until the man cried aloud , and twisted his broken nose until he lapsed again into unconsciousness . \" All this time , \" testified the seventy - six- year - old doctor , \" he seemed to be trying to make him say something . I warned Lyster ' This will have to stop , now , because his condition is serious . ' Dr. Patterson left the barracks after that . The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania resumed its testimony through another eye-witness , John Higgins , himself a former coal and iron policeman . \" They beat him , they kicked him , they used everything imaginable on him until they took him to the hospital , \" was the way Higgins summed it up . Lyster , the witness said , beat Barkoski over the chest with a poker . He beat him until the poker bent , then straightened the implement and beat the man again . He stripped the miner to the waist , the better to use a strap . He kicked him until the miner 's body rolled over and over on the floor of the barracks . Watts , too , Higgins said , beat Barkoski , kicked him , struck him aver the head with knucklers , and while Lyster grilled him for a confession , slapped him on the arms and legs and neck with his blackjack . The miner , Higgins told the jury , was helpless and unable to answer when the Pittsburgh coal officers said : \" If you do n't admit you stabbed our man , you Hunky \u2013we 'll kill you . \" For more than four hours John Barkoski was in the barracks . He had been examined by Dr. Patterson soon after being brought in . At six in the morning , following his night of torture , he was taken directly to the Sewickley Valley Hospital . On his arrival there , Dr. Herbert M. Fleming , hospital surgeon , examined him . His report follows : He was in a very critical condition , pulseless and unconscious . His left lung was perforated , several ribs were fractured , and he had a possible skull fracture . He was covered with bruises and bleeding from numerous cuts . He was bleeding at the mouth , his eyes were glassy , there was a depression in his head , and the left side of his chest was crushed in . His left lung had evidently collapsed . He was suffering from extreme shock and was on the verge of death , with heart action failing . There was also an injury to the abdomen , accompanied by paralysis of the intestinal tract . According to the testimony of the defense , Watts had been cut by Barkoski and the two grappled . He was forced to strike the miner with his gun . They struggled over hard frozen ground . During this scuffle , the defense maintained , the injuries that killed Barkoski were sustained . There were sweeping denials that any violence had taken place in the barracks , or at any time after Barkoski was arrested . The jury of eleven men and one graying , matronly woman listened attentively to the testimony , but gave no noticeable reaction , except that the woman smiled upon the mother of Watts every time their eyes met , and that a young salesman , Juror No. 10 smiled frequently at a comely young woman who sat in the front row with the defendants ' relatives . The jury was out for eighteen hours , and on the morning of September 28 brought in their verdict . At the next court session , two days after the verdict , District Attorney Samuel H. Gardner went before Judge Gray and moved the court to discharge the jury from further service as \" incompetent and without moral stamina . \" Judge Gray , a man of liberal outlook and independent political affiliations , replied . : ' Your suggestion is altogether proper . I was never more surprised in my life . It seems to me that nothing less than second - degree verdicts should have been returned against Lyster and Watts , although the evidence may have justified such a verdict for Slapikis . I quite agree with you that the jurors were not competent and were without moral stamina . Public condemnation of the verdict was universal and violent .... In a front - page editorial the Scripps - Howard Pittsburgh Press said : \" The State which so freely commissioned armed guards for private authority cannot escape responsibility for the death of Barkoski , even though a Jury says he was not murdered . \" The Pittsburgh Post - Gazette called the action of the Jury \" a miserable travesty on justice , \" but added that it has served \" through the general indignation it has aroused to emphasize one significant point to the lawmakers and other public authorities . The feeling against the private police system that produces such outrages as the one in this case is both wide and deep . It is a feeling that will not abate until the unsound and unjustifiable practice of delegating public authority to private hands is eliminated . \" When the fight to abolish the coal police started last February , Governor Fisher admitted the need of reform and pointed to the fact that he had revoked thousands of commissions during his term . Representative Michael A. Musmanno , defender of Sacco and Vanzetti , first proposed a bill to do away with the system entirely and then consented to introduce a bill sponsored by the Governor which proposed no drastic changes . A similar bill was introduced In the Senate by W. D. Mansfield . Neither measure , however , satisfied the people who sought to wipe out the chief evil of the system \u2013 the right of the coal and iron officers to roam at large and enjoy the powers of a policeman of a first - class city . Musmanno succeeded m having his bill amended so as to grant some of the changes demanded . The Mansfield bill remained as it was . It gave the mine guards powers of inestimable value to coal companies in time of strike : the power to place prisoners in their own or any jail without a commitment by a magistrate ; the right to be a coal and iron policeman and a peace officer of the Commonwealth at the same time . The only changes proposed were that three citizens of the State\u2013officials of the coal companies not excluded \u2013 should indorse each candidate for a commission , and a change in name from Coal and Iron Police to Industrial Police . The Musmanno measure restricted the activities of the police to the property of the coal company except when guarding pay rolls ; required that all prisoners be committed before magistrates ; prohibited the coal policemen from holding other governmental jobs ; and limited the applicants to citizens of the United States indorsed by three reputable Citizens , only one of whom could be an employee of the hiring coal company . With the Musmanno bill amended , the public relaxed its vigilance . The coal operators and other industrial interests then began to put in their silent but effective work to preserve the status quo . The session of the Assembly was nearing its end when the correspondents of the Pittsburgh newspapers at the capital discovered that the Musmanno bill was being allowed to die in committee and that only superhuman efforts could save it . A superhuman effort was made . The public , in press and pulpit , voiced the demand of an outraged community that the Musmanno bill be made law . The members of the Senate judiciary committee grew panicky and hastily reported the bill out . Simultaneously , on orders of the political overlords , the Mansfield bill was revived in the House committee . Both measures were passed and the whole matter laid squarely at the Governor 's door . He signed the Mansfield bill and hurriedly left the capital on a fishing - trip . As far as the Governor and the legislature were concerned , then , the system was to be continued with little change , but the public hoped that the court action in the Ratkoski case would prove an effective deterrent to coal and iron officers in the future .

Pittsburgh , October 1 PENNSYLVANIA justice had spoken . The courtroom was stunned . The three defendants stood immobile . Counsel were amazed . The widow Barkoski stared . Judge Gray turned white . \" Gentlemen of the jury , \" the clerk droned , \" you say you find the defendants not guilty ? \" \" Yes , \" they chorused . Walter J. Lyster and Harold P. Watts turned and nodded to their mothers . Frank Slapikis heaved a sigh of relief . Tears stole down the cheeks of the widow Barkoski . Judge Gray thanked the jury , and the normal courtroom sounds replaced the hush . Thus ended what had started out to be the exercise of justice by a sovereign State \u2013 the fixing of responsibility for the savage killing of John Barkoski , Allegheny County miner . \" This , \" said Prosecutor Roy T. Clunk when be got his breath , \" is the most shocking miscarriage of justice in the history of this or any other country . I am glad the verdict is not on my conscience . \" John Barkoski worked at Montour mine No. 9 of the Pittsburgh Coal Company at Santiago . He had rented a farm , which he worked in his off hours . He hoped eventually to leave the mine forever and spend his days peacefully on his farm . But on February 9 , 1929 , he stepped into his mother - in - laws home , House No. 210 , near the mine , and there fell into the hands of two coal and iron policemen employed by the Pittsburgh Coal Company , Harold Watts and Frank Slapikis . The defense said Barkoski had stabbed Watts . Eyewitnesses for the prosecution said Watts had launched an unprovoked attack on Barkoski . At any rate , Barkoski was delivered to the barracks of the coal and iron police at Imperial with the following injuries : Laceration of the left cheek , five or six head wounds , two broken ribs and a fractured nose . Dr. J. M. Patterson , coal company physician , ascertained these injuries and treated them . He testified on the witness stand that he observed Lieutenant Lyster , who was in charge of the police , kicking and beating Barkoski while the miner lay semiconscious on the floor . Lyster , the physician said , beat Barkoski with a strap , twisted his ears until the man cried aloud , and twisted his broken nose until he lapsed again into unconsciousness . \" All this time , \" testified the seventy - six- year - old doctor , \" he seemed to be trying to make him say something . I warned Lyster ' This will have to stop , now , because his condition is serious . ' Dr. Patterson left the barracks after that . The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania resumed its testimony through another eye-witness , John Higgins , himself a former coal and iron policeman . \" They beat him , they kicked him , they used everything imaginable on him until they took him to the hospital , \" was the way Higgins summed it up . Lyster , the witness said , beat Barkoski over the chest with a poker . He beat him until the poker bent , then straightened the implement and beat the man again . He stripped the miner to the waist , the better to use a strap . He kicked him until the miner 's body rolled over and over on the floor of the barracks . Watts , too , Higgins said , beat Barkoski , kicked him , struck him aver the head with knucklers , and while Lyster grilled him for a confession , slapped him on the arms and legs and neck with his blackjack . The miner , Higgins told the jury , was helpless and unable to answer when the Pittsburgh coal officers said : \" If you do n't admit you stabbed our man , you Hunky \u2013we 'll kill you . \" For more than four hours John Barkoski was in the barracks . He had been examined by Dr. Patterson soon after being brought in . At six in the morning , following his night of torture , he was taken directly to the Sewickley Valley Hospital . On his arrival there , Dr. Herbert M. Fleming , hospital surgeon , examined him . His report follows : He was in a very critical condition , pulseless and unconscious . His left lung was perforated , several ribs were fractured , and he had a possible skull fracture . He was covered with bruises and bleeding from numerous cuts . He was bleeding at the mouth , his eyes were glassy , there was a depression in his head , and the left side of his chest was crushed in . His left lung had evidently collapsed . He was suffering from extreme shock and was on the verge of death , with heart action failing . There was also an injury to the abdomen , accompanied by paralysis of the intestinal tract . According to the testimony of the defense , Watts had been cut by Barkoski and the two grappled . He was forced to strike the miner with his gun . They struggled over hard frozen ground . During this scuffle , the defense maintained , the injuries that killed Barkoski were sustained . There were sweeping denials that any violence had taken place in the barracks , or at any time after Barkoski was arrested . The jury of eleven men and one graying , matronly woman listened attentively to the testimony , but gave no noticeable reaction , except that the woman smiled upon the mother of Watts every time their eyes met , and that a young salesman , Juror No. 10 smiled frequently at a comely young woman who sat in the front row with the defendants ' relatives . The jury was out for eighteen hours , and on the morning of September 28 brought in their verdict . At the next court session , two days after the verdict , District Attorney Samuel H. Gardner went before Judge Gray and moved the court to discharge the jury from further service as \" incompetent and without moral stamina . \" Judge Gray , a man of liberal outlook and independent political affiliations , replied . : ' Your suggestion is altogether proper . I was never more surprised in my life . It seems to me that nothing less than second - degree verdicts should have been returned against Lyster and Watts , although the evidence may have justified such a verdict for Slapikis . I quite agree with you that the jurors were not competent and were without moral stamina . Public condemnation of the verdict was universal and violent .... In a front - page editorial the Scripps - Howard Pittsburgh Press said : \" The State which so freely commissioned armed guards for private authority cannot escape responsibility for the death of Barkoski , even though a Jury says he was not murdered . \" The Pittsburgh Post - Gazette called the action of the Jury \" a miserable travesty on justice , \" but added that it has served \" through the general indignation it has aroused to emphasize one significant point to the lawmakers and other public authorities . The feeling against the private police system that produces such outrages as the one in this case is both wide and deep . It is a feeling that will not abate until the unsound and unjustifiable practice of delegating public authority to private hands is eliminated . \" When the fight to abolish the coal police started last February , Governor Fisher admitted the need of reform and pointed to the fact that he had revoked thousands of commissions during his term . Representative Michael A. Musmanno , defender of Sacco and Vanzetti , first proposed a bill to do away with the system entirely and then consented to introduce a bill sponsored by the Governor which proposed no drastic changes . A similar bill was introduced In the Senate by W. D. Mansfield . Neither measure , however , satisfied the people who sought to wipe out the chief evil of the system \u2013 the right of the coal and iron officers to roam at large and enjoy the powers of a policeman of a first - class city . Musmanno succeeded m having his bill amended so as to grant some of the changes demanded . The Mansfield bill remained as it was . It gave the mine guards powers of inestimable value to coal companies in time of strike : the power to place prisoners in their own or any jail without a commitment by a magistrate ; the right to be a coal and iron policeman and a peace officer of the Commonwealth at the same time . The only changes proposed were that three citizens of the State\u2013officials of the coal companies not excluded \u2013 should indorse each candidate for a commission , and a change in name from Coal and Iron Police to Industrial Police . The Musmanno measure restricted the activities of the police to the property of the coal company except when guarding pay rolls ; required that all prisoners be committed before magistrates ; prohibited the coal policemen from holding other governmental jobs ; and limited the applicants to citizens of the United States indorsed by three reputable Citizens , only one of whom could be an employee of the hiring coal company . With the Musmanno bill amended , the public relaxed its vigilance . The coal operators and other industrial interests then began to put in their silent but effective work to preserve the status quo . The session of the Assembly was nearing its end when the correspondents of the Pittsburgh newspapers at the capital discovered that the Musmanno bill was being allowed to die in committee and that only superhuman efforts could save it . A superhuman effort was made . The public , in press and pulpit , voiced the demand of an outraged community that the Musmanno bill be made law . The members of the Senate judiciary committee grew panicky and hastily reported the bill out . Simultaneously , on orders of the political overlords , the Mansfield bill was revived in the House committee . Both measures were passed and the whole matter laid squarely at the Governor 's door . He signed the Mansfield bill and hurriedly left the capital on a fishing - trip . As far as the Governor and the legislature were concerned , then , the system was to be continued with little change , but the public hoped that the court action in the Ratkoski case would prove an effective deterrent to coal and iron officers in the future . With the acquittal of the former employees of the Pittsburgh Coal Company this last hope for immediate relief from oppression in the mining towns has vanished . The three coal and iron policemen are still to be tried for involuntary manslaughter , indeed . But by this time the public has lost hope . Few expect convictions . Few expect reform .

Making kombucha tea at home involves making tea , adding a starter culture ( SCOBY ) and letting it culture in a warm spot for 7 - 30 days . You can find instructions and a How - To Video on our page for How to Make Kombucha . Q. How long should I brew my kombucha ? A. Kombucha can be brewed from 7 to 30 days , depending on personal preference . A longer brewing time results in less sugar and a more vinegary - flavored beverage . Keep in mind that temperature will play a role in how quickly the kombucha cultures . Q. Can I use less sugar or alter any ingredients used to make kombucha ? A. We strongly recommend following the tea : sugar : water : starter tea ratios indicated in the instructions . These ratios encourage a proper balance , which discourages the growth of mold and the spoiling of the batch . It also helps ensure the SCOBY gets enough food to culture properly . Q. Can I use a plastic container to brew kombucha and plastic bottles to store it ? A. We recommend glass containers when working with starter cultures , because of the potential of plastic to leach undesirable chemicals . Additionally , plastic is more easily damaged , often without your knowledge , which can result in hidden bacteria that may disrupt the culturing process . Q. Can I culture my kombucha tea in a cupboard , or on a windowsill , etc .? A. Brewing kombucha tea in a cupboard is perfectly fine . However , do not put kombucha tea in sunlight . It is important to keep fermenting kombucha out of direct sunlight and away from excessive heat or cold . Q. Can I make kombucha without a starter tea ? A. Yes , you can use an equal portion of distilled white vinegar in place of starter tea . Alternatively you may use bottled raw , unflavored kombucha tea , which can be purchased at many health food and grocery stores . However , when activating a dehydrated scoby , use distilled white vinegar only . Q. I 'm brewing my first batch of kombucha using the dehydrated culture . It does n't seem to be doing anything . How can I know if it 's working properly ? A. Click here for Kombucha Scoby Activation Troubleshooting or contact Customer Support . Q. What signs should I look for to determine the kombucha is culturing properly ? A. A few good signs the kombucha fermentation process is proceeding normally include the formation of a new kombucha culture over the opening of the brewing container , development of brown stringy yeast particles , and the liquid becoming less sweet and more vinegar-like . NOTE : For the initial batch when using a dehydrated culture , there may be no visible signs of culturing . The best way to check progress of the brew is to test aroma and flavor . Q. If I 'm making other cultured foods ( yogurt , sourdough , kombucha , etc. ) , how far apart do I need to keep the cultures ? A. We suggest keeping a distance of at least 4 feet between items . When your cultured items are being stored in the refrigerator with tight - fitting lids , there is no need to keep distance between them . Q. Where can I view the instructions for making kombucha ? A. Click here to view the kombucha instructions . Caring for Your SCOBY Q. Will kombucha tea starters multiply ? A. Kombucha tea cultures multiply . Each time you brew a batch of Kombucha tea a new starter culture will form . The original starter culture ( \" the mother \" ) and the new starter culture ( \" the baby \" ) can each be used to brew a new batch of kombucha tea . Note : It may take several batches for a baby to form after initial rehydration . Q. My kombucha has been fermenting for a period of time and is developing a cloudy layer on top . Is this normal ? A. Yes . The cloudy white layer is the beginning of a new baby kombucha culture . The formation of a new culture is one sign that your batch of kombucha is fermenting properly . Q. My kombucha tea has been fermenting for a period of time and is developing brown stringy particles . Is this normal ? A. The brown stringy particles are yeast particles and are harmless . They are a natural byproduct of the fermentation process . You can strain them out of the finished kombucha if desired . Q. My kombucha culture sank to the bottom of my container , is floating sideways , rose to the top of the liquid , etc . Is this normal ? A. Depending on a number of factors , the culture may sink , float or sit sideways . Any of these is normal and will not affect the brewing process . Q. The new baby kombucha culture seems to have detached from the container opening . Will this affect the fermentation process ? A. Having the baby kombucha culture detach from the container opening does not affect the fermentation process . Q. I 've been storing a batch of finished kombucha for a few days and it seems to be developing a jelly - like mass on top . Is this normal ? What is it ? A. The jelly - like mass is the beginning of a new baby kombucha culture . Even after the main kombucha culture is removed , the kombucha remains full of living yeast and bacteria which continue to ferment slowly on their own . As a result , idle kombucha will eventually form a new baby culture . Q. One of my kombucha cultures has a hole in it or is split into pieces because I had to separate it from mother culture after they fused . Can I still use it ? A. Kombucha cultures will work just fine even with holes or if they have been torn in half . Q. Does the size of the kombucha culture matter in relation to how much kombucha I will be brewing ? A. No , even a small kombucha culture will effectively ferment a full gallon of kombucha . We recommend using a culture or a piece of a culture . The culture should be at least 3 inches in diameter . Q. I 've been brewing kombucha for awhile and am overrun with kombucha scobys . What can I do with them ? A. Do n't worry , there are lots of ways to use leftover scobys .

Summary : This version adds the log-structured NILFS2 filesystem , a filesystem for object - based storage devices , a caching layer for local caching of NFS data , the RDS protocol which delivers high - performance reliable connections between the servers of a cluster , a distributed networking filesystem ( POHMELFS ) , automatic flushing of files on renames / truncates in ext3 , ext4 and btrfs , preliminary support for the 802.11 w drafts , support for the Microblaze architecture , the Tomoyo security module , DRM support for the Radeon R6xx / R7xx graphic cards , asynchronous scanning of devices and partitions for faster bootup , MD support for switching between raid 5/6 modes , the preadv / pwritev syscalls , several new drivers and many other small improvements . Contributor : NTT Labs ( Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation ) NILFS2 is a new filesystem which uses a log-structured design . What makes log-structured filesystems different is that they treat the whole disk as a consecutive list of blocks ( called log ) . All the operations append data at the end of the log , they never rewrite blocks ( except when there 's no space left - in that case , new blocks are reclaimed from the start of the log ) . The advantage of this approach is that all modifications an creations are converted into sequential operations , which are faster . Crashes ca n't corrupt the filesystem . On mount , the filesystem detects the real end of the log , and continues working from that point . Another advantage of this approach is that the log offers a coherent historical view of all the operations done in the disk in the past . This is called \" continuous snapshotting \" - snapshots of modifications done in all the filesystem at any time are created automatically due to the log-structure design , with no requirement of intervention from an admin , and with the filesystem size as the only limit . NILFS2 allows to access those snapshots and even mount them ( on read - only mode ) . POHMELFS stands for Parallel Optimized Host Message Exchange Layered File System . It is a high performance and network distributed filesystem with ability to balance reading from multiple hosts and simultaneously write data to different remote nodes , with a local writeback cache of data and metadata , which greatly speeds up every IO operation . It beats NFS by a big margin in most , if not all , operations . You can find more details and benchmarks about it in its home page . POHMELFS is hosted in the \" staging \" section of the kernel code , although it 's already quite mature . Code : drivers / staging / pohmelfs / DST stands for Distributed ( network ) STorage . DST allows the creation of high - performance storage networks in a reliable and easy manner . DST allows to form a storage on top of local and remote nodes and combine them into linear or mirroring setup , which in turn can be exported to remote nodes , an equivalent of much of the functionality offered by the device mapper , iSCSI , and network block device ( NBD ) layers . It works on top of any network media and protocol . DST may fully encrypt the data channel in case of untrusted channel and implement strong checksum of the transferred data . DST is hosted in the \" staging \" section of the kernel code . Code : drivers / staging / dst / 1.3 . Reliable Datagram Sockets ( RDS ) protocol support RDS provides a high bandwidth , low latency , reliable inter-process communication protocol and transport system between the servers in a cluster . It provides a reliable connection between any two nodes in the cluster . This allows applications to use a single socket to talk to any other process in the cluster - so in a cluster with N processes you need N sockets , in contrast to N*N if you use a connection - oriented socket transport like TCP . In beta testing , RDS over infiniBand provided up to 60 percent performance improvement over Gigabit Ethernet for interconnect - intensive applications . RDS is already used by some products like Oracle and in Silverstorm 's Quicksilver . Some parts of the kernel boot process can delay the whole process too many time ( by kernel 's standards ) : scanning in search of storage devices for a given controller , and searching for partitions , for example , can be slow , because the scanning is synchronous , only one device is scanned at a time , and the kernel has to wait for the devices . With this feature , those steps are done asynchronously , so the kernel can keep booting the rest of the kernel while the storage devices are scanned in parallel . This feature speeds up the total kernel boot time significantly The IEEE 802.11 w standard is a proposed ( still not approved ) amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard ( wifi ) that increase the security of its management frames . In this version Linux adds a preliminary implementation for this future standard , developed according to the current drafts . Traditional storage devices offer a block - based interface . However , there 's a new generation of experimental storage devices that are trying to offload some work from the host , and offer a higher - level interface : an array of objects . The OS interfaces with the objects , and the drive hides all the storage details , removing most of the low-level details of the filesystem . A traditional filesystem can then be easily implemented on top of this interface . The OSD interface works on top of SCSI . In this release Linux adds support for the OSD protocol on the SCSI stack , and exofs , an implementation of a traditional unix filesystem that works on top of OSD storage devices . NFS 4.1 is being developed at the IETF . From the many new features in NFSv4.1 , this Linux version adds the mandatory - to - implement NFSv4.1 Sessions . Other features , Parallel NFS in particular , are still under development out of tree and will be added in later releases . To enable this experimental new protocol ( which is disabled by default ) you need an updated nfs-utils . FS - Cache is the Linux implementation of a cache layer for networking filesystems , similar to the CacheFS of other Unixes . With FS - Cache , data from the networked filesystems can be cached on the disk , speeding up operations . This version adds support for NFS and AFS , but it 's a generic layer that could be used by other networking filesystems or even non-networking ( such as ISO9660 ) . Shortly after the 2.6.29 release , lots of discussions occurred on LKML about disk I /O ( summary available at LWN ) , how ( and why ) a fsync ( ) call can take minutes , and the effect of getting a file zeroed rebooting just after a rename or a truncate . Some changes have been done to fix those problems : implicit internal fsync of a file after a rename or truncate in ext3 , ext 4 and btrfs , faster fsync ( ) in ext3 , default to data=writeback mode in Ext3 , and improvements to CFQ . The flame has also brought the topic of atimes updates , and which has resulted into merging relatime and making it a default . 1.12 . LZMA / BZIP2 kernel image compression Contributor : Alain Knaff The kernel compresses the kernel with GZIP , but this version adds support to compress the kernel image with the LZMA or BZIP2 compression algorithms . The kernel size is about 10 per cent smaller with bzip2 in comparison to gzip , and about 33 per cent smaller with lzma . The Trusted Computing Group ( TCG ) runtime Integrity Measurement Architecture ( IMA ) maintains a list of hash values of executables and other sensitive system files , as they are read or executed . If an attacker manages to change the contents of an important system file being measured , we can tell . If your system has a TPM chip , then IMA also maintains an aggregate integrity value over this list inside the TPM hardware , so that the TPM can prove to a third party whether or not critical system files have been modified . percpu : implement new dynamic percpu allocator ( commit ) kmemtrace , a kernel memory tracer . kmemtrace provides tracing for slab allocator functions , such as kmalloc , kfree , kmem_cache_alloc , kmem_cache_free etc .. Collected data is then fed to the userspace application in order to analyze allocation hotspots , internal fragmentation and so on , making it possible to see how well an allocator performs , as well as debug and profile kernel code ( commit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) loop : support barrier writes ( commit ) , add ioctl to resize a loop device ( commit ) ramfs : add support for \" mode= \" mount option ( commit ) udf : implement mode and dmode mounting options ( commit ) ipc namespaces : Implement multiple mounts of the mqueue file system , and link it to usage of CLONE_NEWIPC .

Summary : This version adds the log-structured NILFS2 filesystem , a filesystem for object - based storage devices , a caching layer for local caching of NFS data , the RDS protocol which delivers high - performance reliable connections between the servers of a cluster , a distributed networking filesystem ( POHMELFS ) , automatic flushing of files on renames / truncates in ext3 , ext4 and btrfs , preliminary support for the 802.11 w drafts , support for the Microblaze architecture , the Tomoyo security module , DRM support for the Radeon R6xx / R7xx graphic cards , asynchronous scanning of devices and partitions for faster bootup , MD support for switching between raid 5/6 modes , the preadv / pwritev syscalls , several new drivers and many other small improvements . Contributor : NTT Labs ( Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation ) NILFS2 is a new filesystem which uses a log-structured design . What makes log-structured filesystems different is that they treat the whole disk as a consecutive list of blocks ( called log ) . All the operations append data at the end of the log , they never rewrite blocks ( except when there 's no space left - in that case , new blocks are reclaimed from the start of the log ) . The advantage of this approach is that all modifications an creations are converted into sequential operations , which are faster . Crashes ca n't corrupt the filesystem . On mount , the filesystem detects the real end of the log , and continues working from that point . Another advantage of this approach is that the log offers a coherent historical view of all the operations done in the disk in the past . This is called \" continuous snapshotting \" - snapshots of modifications done in all the filesystem at any time are created automatically due to the log-structure design , with no requirement of intervention from an admin , and with the filesystem size as the only limit . NILFS2 allows to access those snapshots and even mount them ( on read - only mode ) . POHMELFS stands for Parallel Optimized Host Message Exchange Layered File System . It is a high performance and network distributed filesystem with ability to balance reading from multiple hosts and simultaneously write data to different remote nodes , with a local writeback cache of data and metadata , which greatly speeds up every IO operation . It beats NFS by a big margin in most , if not all , operations . You can find more details and benchmarks about it in its home page . POHMELFS is hosted in the \" staging \" section of the kernel code , although it 's already quite mature . Code : drivers / staging / pohmelfs / DST stands for Distributed ( network ) STorage . DST allows the creation of high - performance storage networks in a reliable and easy manner . DST allows to form a storage on top of local and remote nodes and combine them into linear or mirroring setup , which in turn can be exported to remote nodes , an equivalent of much of the functionality offered by the device mapper , iSCSI , and network block device ( NBD ) layers . It works on top of any network media and protocol . DST may fully encrypt the data channel in case of untrusted channel and implement strong checksum of the transferred data . DST is hosted in the \" staging \" section of the kernel code . Code : drivers / staging / dst / 1.3 . Reliable Datagram Sockets ( RDS ) protocol support RDS provides a high bandwidth , low latency , reliable inter-process communication protocol and transport system between the servers in a cluster . It provides a reliable connection between any two nodes in the cluster . This allows applications to use a single socket to talk to any other process in the cluster - so in a cluster with N processes you need N sockets , in contrast to N*N if you use a connection - oriented socket transport like TCP . In beta testing , RDS over infiniBand provided up to 60 percent performance improvement over Gigabit Ethernet for interconnect - intensive applications . RDS is already used by some products like Oracle and in Silverstorm 's Quicksilver . Some parts of the kernel boot process can delay the whole process too many time ( by kernel 's standards ) : scanning in search of storage devices for a given controller , and searching for partitions , for example , can be slow , because the scanning is synchronous , only one device is scanned at a time , and the kernel has to wait for the devices . With this feature , those steps are done asynchronously , so the kernel can keep booting the rest of the kernel while the storage devices are scanned in parallel . This feature speeds up the total kernel boot time significantly The IEEE 802.11 w standard is a proposed ( still not approved ) amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard ( wifi ) that increase the security of its management frames . In this version Linux adds a preliminary implementation for this future standard , developed according to the current drafts . Traditional storage devices offer a block - based interface . However , there 's a new generation of experimental storage devices that are trying to offload some work from the host , and offer a higher - level interface : an array of objects . The OS interfaces with the objects , and the drive hides all the storage details , removing most of the low-level details of the filesystem . A traditional filesystem can then be easily implemented on top of this interface . The OSD interface works on top of SCSI . In this release Linux adds support for the OSD protocol on the SCSI stack , and exofs , an implementation of a traditional unix filesystem that works on top of OSD storage devices . NFS 4.1 is being developed at the IETF . From the many new features in NFSv4.1 , this Linux version adds the mandatory - to - implement NFSv4.1 Sessions . Other features , Parallel NFS in particular , are still under development out of tree and will be added in later releases . To enable this experimental new protocol ( which is disabled by default ) you need an updated nfs-utils . FS - Cache is the Linux implementation of a cache layer for networking filesystems , similar to the CacheFS of other Unixes . With FS - Cache , data from the networked filesystems can be cached on the disk , speeding up operations . This version adds support for NFS and AFS , but it 's a generic layer that could be used by other networking filesystems or even non-networking ( such as ISO9660 ) . Shortly after the 2.6.29 release , lots of discussions occurred on LKML about disk I /O ( summary available at LWN ) , how ( and why ) a fsync ( ) call can take minutes , and the effect of getting a file zeroed rebooting just after a rename or a truncate . Some changes have been done to fix those problems : implicit internal fsync of a file after a rename or truncate in ext3 , ext 4 and btrfs , faster fsync ( ) in ext3 , default to data=writeback mode in Ext3 , and improvements to CFQ . The flame has also brought the topic of atimes updates , and which has resulted into merging relatime and making it a default . 1.12 . LZMA / BZIP2 kernel image compression Contributor : Alain Knaff The kernel compresses the kernel with GZIP , but this version adds support to compress the kernel image with the LZMA or BZIP2 compression algorithms . The kernel size is about 10 per cent smaller with bzip2 in comparison to gzip , and about 33 per cent smaller with lzma . The Trusted Computing Group ( TCG ) runtime Integrity Measurement Architecture ( IMA ) maintains a list of hash values of executables and other sensitive system files , as they are read or executed . If an attacker manages to change the contents of an important system file being measured , we can tell . If your system has a TPM chip , then IMA also maintains an aggregate integrity value over this list inside the TPM hardware , so that the TPM can prove to a third party whether or not critical system files have been modified . percpu : implement new dynamic percpu allocator ( commit ) kmemtrace , a kernel memory tracer . kmemtrace provides tracing for slab allocator functions , such as kmalloc , kfree , kmem_cache_alloc , kmem_cache_free etc .. Collected data is then fed to the userspace application in order to analyze allocation hotspots , internal fragmentation and so on , making it possible to see how well an allocator performs , as well as debug and profile kernel code ( commit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) loop : support barrier writes ( commit ) , add ioctl to resize a loop device ( commit ) ramfs : add support for \" mode= \" mount option ( commit ) udf : implement mode and dmode mounting options ( commit ) ipc namespaces : Implement multiple mounts of the mqueue file system , and link it to usage of CLONE_NEWIPC . Each ipc ns has a corresponding mqueuefs superblock . When a user does clone ( CLONE_NEWIPC ) or unshare ( CLONE_NEWIPC ) , the unshare will cause an internal mount of a new mqueuefs sb linked to the new ipc ns . When a user does ' mount -t mqueue mqueue / dev /mqueue ' , he mounts the mqueuefs superblock ( commit ) , ( commit ) dynamic debug : combine dprintk and dynamic printk ( commit ) NOMMU : Make it possible for RomFS to use MTD devices directly ( commit ) 3 .

Stewart Home , Re-Enter The Dragon . Genre Theory , Bruceploitation and the Sleazy Joys of Lowbrow Cinema . Leda Tape Organisation , 2018 . Stewart Home knows there are these things happening everywhere , all the time , throughout modern capitalist history , and Bruceploitation is a good way of showing what and how . His are the reflections not only of a certain personal attitude , stuffed with feelings and psychological vim , but a philosophical \u2013 explicitly Marxist \u2013 one as well . Reading Home can be a strange and electrifying experience , one tinged by the sense you 're reading works by a maniac writing towards the edge of an abyss that is more and more your own . His vision is unreconstructedly Marxist , his approach unrelenting and remorseless as he hunts down the capitalist program from within the repeater asskicking . He 's diagnosing the ways in which reason underdetermines belief , and appeals to a speculative psychological hypotheses to explain belief fixation even in the absence of rational evidence through deconstructing a set of carefully selected kung fu films . And importantly the work is a passionate affair . He 's driven by affection for the films which gives the work its authority and force as well its intensity and hilarious jouissance . It 's also swaggery too , well able to take care of itself . As he writes at the start : ' Others with different views will just have to argue their own corner . \u201c Your kung fu , sorry I mean bullshit theory , is pretty good \u2014 but it ca n't beat my trash cinema dialectics ! \u201d He 's not worried . This new book covers this wild landscape of a minor genre of pulp films that few readers will have seen or known about to the obsessive depth Home has , so the detail and fine - pointed nuances in selection reminds us that here 's a writer thinking about the point of uttering half - truths , about the existence of numbers , about mental content , about scientific laws and models , about the existence of fictional entities , like Tong Fu , and about metaphysical and logical impossibility without caring a toss whether we were interested in any of it the first place . ( Although he does reckon that if you 're reading the book you 're either interested in genre theory or action movies , or both . But it 's just as likely that you 're interested in Home and neither of the other things ! ) He 's going point to point so we can start learning up . In fact this kind of point- to - pointing is typical in Home , who often lays down detail after detail , even when his first is damning enough . The technique and approach he uses for capturing his phenomena is part of the curious feeling you often get when reading him that he 's strangling whatever it is in the cradle ; in his relentlessness you feel he 's using a cannon to kill a mouse , but that it misses the mouse to hit neighbouring mice instead . Deliberately . Home is out to cause trouble . Or what others might call fun . The publicity from Leda Tape sets the scene : ' HEAD KICKING BRICK BREAKING MAYHEM ! This is the first in - depth look at movies that riff on tropes associated with Bruce Lee and that sometimes transformed this actor into a mythical superman . The period with the greatest cluster of Brucesploitaton productions lasted less than a decade from the mid-seventies to the early - eighties , but the genre spluttered on into the twenty - first century ; and although it did n't exist as a category before Bruce Lee 's death , there are several films that pre-date the Little Dragon 's demise that clearly belong to it . While death added another dimension to Bruce Lee 's celebrity status , he was already a huge star in South East Asia before he passed away ; so cynical movie producers did not need to wait for his death to exploit popular interest in Lee \u2013 even if the term Brucesploitation had yet to be coined . Within Brucesploitation actors who copy and clone Bruce Lee make up one strand of the subgenre , but their importance can and has been over-stated . Much of the writing about Brucesploitation is fan and internet based , and many of those producing this discourse make little attempt to explain why they insist certain films belong to the genre . Too many fans write as if genre is somehow natural , rather than created and shaped both through bald assertion and by more critical discussion and thinking . It is all too common to find any martial arts film featuring certain actors and themes , or with Bruce in the title , being accepted as Brucesploitation without any debate around the issue . This book systematically explores the genre and controversially takes a close look at which flicks really should be seen as belonging to it . ' Bruceploitation as Home presents it feels like an entire species of semi-beloved and once deferred - to entities has been stolen away leaving behind only persistent appearances . 146 appearences to be precise . That 's how many films he covers in the book . It 's a stunning performance . He 's out to find the representational benefits of genre objects \u2013 like Adam West 's Batman tv series , The Men From Uncle , Atom Ant etc etc , \u2013 without needing to say that such things exist . Home works to liberate readers from the oppression of the values the reader accepts . Home 's Marxism says that these readers oppress themselves in virtue of certain values and norms they accept \u2013 the reality of genius , of originality , of art as an escape from the logic of capitalism and so forth \u2013 and Home offers his books as a kind of diagnostic to understand this oppressive character of modernity . Individuals are captured by judgments of normality telling them the ways of being a normal human being . These are the judgments that tell you what to eat , what jokes are funny , who to vote for , how to raise children , what to wear and so on . In the modern era the regulation of these judgments derives from human sciences . The authority trapping us all in its iron cage is epistemic and as well as the usual religious ones modernity has added scientific ones to hold us in too . Home is out to point out the cage , make sure we can see it and understand it . His strategy has been to cast light on the area of this modern oppression where the cage seems least strong \u2013 the arts \u2013 to show that aesthetics is no less part of the iron cage than shopping , managerialism , orthodox religions and the rest . The role of art as a liberator of the self , as a place where the antinomian rebel might go to wriggle free is taken down . His strategy is to show how wherever you want to go he can show you the tactics and influence of economics , politics and moral considerations that have led to whatever art form you care to examine . And in showing that they 've been co-opted and work effectively to maintain the modern capitalist structures that are ubiquitous and currently unassailable he bursts optimistic delusions that capitalism can be breached . Yet his books are not dry , drab and depressing reads but are injected with a zoomy sense of unstoppability which mirrors the system he 's fighting , as if he 's showing that pushback taken to a limit can be effective in beginning the resistance , no matter how big or small the perceived impact . After all , resistance has to start somewhere and for all we know each little crack may end up contributing to the end game . So the fun is in this serious agenda bashing up against a wild and prolonged discussion of a genre that , as he explains in the prologue , he first became attached to growing up in the sixties and seventies . ' As a kid I watched the Batman TV series so it is probable I was exposed to Bruce Lee 's guest appearances as Kato before I learnt he was the ' king of kung fu' . There were many things to prep my interest in Lee but probably just feeling angry and disempowered was the most important factor . Constantly having teachers tell me and all the other kids at school that we were stupid and would never do anything with our lives \u2014 other than work in a factory \u2014 was more than enough to make me want to breakout from such drab surroundings . ' This is a typical Home moment mixing personal reminiscence with the underlying anger and resentment that animates his whole oeuvre . Bruce Lee 's kung fu movies and the Bruceploitation movies that followed were , he explains , a form of escape from the dismal limits of childhood . As he writes , ' Music was one way to escape this sham reality , but by the time I was twelve years - old glam rock was on its last legs , so martial arts flicks filled a void by providing a better form of contemporary escapism \u2014 at least until punk rock came along . ' One of the great things about the book is that Home writes about how he got into the films and how his motivations have threaded through his subsequent works in the many arenas in which he works \u2013 novels , conceptual art , poetry , essays , performance art , lectures , music and so forth . You get riffs like this which paint a picture of the young Home making his way into the deep waters of contemporary modernity which are fascinating for their insight into a time now fast becoming difficult to imagine for anyone of a certain age , a world without the internet , computers , mobile phones and the whole digital media paraphernalia . It 's the world on the brink of hyper- capitalism , the world that had since the 30 's seemed to be a world where perhaps capitalist logic could be tamed and defanged . The time from the 30's to the end of the 70's was the only time in recorded history where average returns on work outperformed average returns on capital in western capitalist societies . It was a period where it looked as if we were living in a different modernity to the one that had been in place ever since the French Revolution where capital always made more than work . Alas , it was n't to last . By the time the seventies had ended we were returning to the norm of the previous few hundred years . Of course now it seems obvious that capitalists \u2013 a tiny portion of the population \u2013 own the world , and that we 're stuck in our own version of the belle \u00e9poque but back then it was n't so obvious . This is of course the important message from Picketty 's book on Capital . The low tech , ziney world of the seventies is where Home 's affection and interest for these flicks began , and his asides catch the different atmosphere of those lost times . Take this riff : ' I first took a conscious interest in Bruce Lee when the London based Kung Fu Monthly began publication in 1974 . This was a fan magazine that turned into a giant fold - out poster . After seeing early issues I was desperate to catch the Little Dragon 's flicks . More than anything else in Kung Fu Monthly I found a picture of Bruce in his coffin morbidly fascinating since it was in such contrast to the other images of him as a seemingly super-fit movie star . Since I was n't old enough to see X-rated films , I had to lie about my age to gain admittance to Enter the Dragon ( 1973 ) and innumerable other martial arts movies . When I first saw Lee 's flicks , I was less sceptical about the fighting skills on display than I am now ; of course there is nothing wrong with movie kung fu , it just is n't real world fighting . Nonetheless , from the get - go one of the things I liked about these films was how ridiculous they were ; they definitely made me laugh . ' There 's an important reason why these autobiographical snaps are in there . Home is n't preaching . He obviously has normative opinions about all sorts of things \u2013 of course Home has opinions ! But he 's like Marx in this : Marx had normative opinions but never worked out a normative theory , a theory that purported to justify , discursively and systematically his normative opinions and show them to be rationally obligatory and rationally justified . Home 's views are those of the mature Marx 's views about morality and value , in particular , the view he shared with Engels that because moral opinions are determined by the existing relations of production , we can not know what morality would be characteristic of a society that did not have capitalist relations of production . He takes for granted that , at the right historical moment , circumstances will be such that large numbers of people will be motivated to undertake revolutionary change : they do not require a normative theory to help them . What they will find useful is a correct understanding of their historical situation and the causal mechanisms at work that explain its potential , and what this book does is once more work at understanding that historical situation via a detailed , serious but at the same time hilarious analysis of the Bruceploitation movies . 146 of the little evil bastards to be exact ! The autobiographical details are great but what makes the book a hoot to read \u2013 in the positive sense that all groovy thinking is a hoot \u2013 is how the reader is taken along through a whole set of subtle distinctions that require a thorough and pretty extensive knowledge of the films themselves , something that I would guess is rare outside of fandom . You need insider knowledge to know all the references in passages like this : ' Fist of Unicorn ( 1973 ) should be treated as a part of the genre , and it was made and released before Lee died on 20 July 1973 . Brucesploitation dates back to at least 1972 and includes the Ramon Zamora comedy kung fu vehicle The Pig Boss ( 1972 ) that riffs on Bruce Lee 's first adult star vehicle ; it may also encompass Zamora 's Fish and Fury \u2014 although whether this second item is actually a stand alone feature or just segment of King Plaster ( 1972 ) is currently unclear to me . These Zamora flicks belong to a Filipino tradition of parody films that include Iking Boxer ( 1973 , a slapstick version of King Boxer ) and Lasing Master ( 1980 , a spoof of Drunken Master ) , but which also encompassed off - the - wall remakes of both local and international hits that had no martial arts content whatsoever . Despite being aware of Zamora 's early involvement in the Brucesploitation genre , I have n't actually seen the titles I 've just mentioned \u2026 ' . Reading this makes you realize that this work is no less archive heavy and esoteric than the heaviest of scholarly writing on 19th century German Idealists , for example , but of course this has the advantage of including kick ass pulp genre action which 19th century German Idealism does n't . Home , as ever , has foraged the secondary literature and found it wanting \u2013 so the case for writing his own book is explicit . There 's nothing in the archives that actually understands the genre well enough to do it justice . Previous scholarship has been slap dash and been unable to pin point it , as he makes clear in this aside : '\u201d Somewhat more sophisticated in its understanding of film as a medium than Here Come the Kung Fu Clones was Leon Hunt 's Kung Fu Masters : From Bruce Lee to Crouching Tiger ( Wallflower Press , London 2003 ) but here Brucesploitation is only really touched on in passing and again the focus is very much on Bruce Li and the Hollywood bio-pic Dragon : The Bruce Lee Story ( 1993 , directed by Rob Cohen ) . Even when Hunt writes briefly about The Clones of Bruce Lee ( 1980 ) his focus is on Dragon Lee at the expense of Bruce Le , Bruce Lai and Bruce Thai ; he has nothing to say about putative director Joseph Velasco , who might be viewed as ' the king of Brucesploitation ' . Contra Hunt , Cohen 's Dragon is a Hollywood drama and is not even an exploitation film let alone Bruceploitation . ' He could n't be more explicit . Home explains why he 's written about the 146 films he has . ' Early entries in film genres inevitably have to be made before the category to which they belong comes into being . Likewise the links between the films that make up any given genre are relational and not rational , and ultimately what belongs to any given cinematic category must be argued on a case - by - case \u2014 that is a movie-by- movie \u2014 basis . ' So Home is cleaning up the territory and sharpening the contours of the category of Bruceploitation which as he sees it has not been worked out rigorously enough by early pioneers . This makes sense . If what Home is doing is forging conditions for honing revolutionary consciousness then it needs to be done efficiently . His works have always been nothing less than rigorous and formidably engineered . It has long been a complaint by Home of his critics that they take him to be some sort of yob writer who has no craft or skill in what he does . Yet this is someone who cites ' Last Year At Marienbad ' as one of his fave films and if you look carefully at what he 's up to he 's as conscious a maker as you can find , crafting his language and style to ensure that his ends are met . Returning to the autobiographic details in this work for a moment , where we 're told of his enthusiasm and his feelings for these films , we 're being given another element of how he 's constructing the work . We 're being told that the project is not a purely scholarly , academic one but rather is one born out of desires and passions . In this we find Home signaling a Humean / Nietzschean \u2013 and Marxist \u2013 motivation for what he 's doing . Not cold calculation and reason but rather , a passion , a psychological push . The role of the passions should not be underestimated in Home \u2013 nor in Marx . And this links with a serious point about the revolutionary consciousness . If you want to find the motivation for revolution it will not come from thinking it out \u2013 the dismal mistake of those many vanguard movements that attempt to impose their insights on the rest of us using whatever bullying tactics and resources of brute power they can lay their hands on \u2013 but will come from everyone feeling that enough is enough , a mass feeling that exploitation and immiseration has become too extreme to tolerate and has to stop . Communism is not for a few people with deep insights and theoretical rigour to lead , but rather is what happens when we all feel the same about the situation . Marx was clear about what he thought the conditions would be to bring about this mass revolt when he writes in the ' German Ideology ' : ' [ I]t [ capitalism ] must necessarily have rendered the great mass of humanity ' propertyless , ' and produced , at the same time , the contradiction of an existing world of wealth and culture , both of which conditions presuppose a great increase in productive power , a high degree of development \u2026. [ T]his development of productive forces \u2026 is an absolutely necessary practical premise because without it want is merely made general , and with destitution the struggle for necessities and all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced ; and furthermore , because only with this universal development of productive forces is a universal intercourse between men established , which produces in all nations simultaneously the phenomenon of the ' propertyless ' mass \u2026 Empirically , communism is only possible as the act of the dominant peoples ' all at once ' and simultaneously , which presupposes the universal development of productive forces and the world intercourse bound up with communism ( 1846/1978 , 161 - 162 ) . ' So for Marx its mass immiseration , truly global capitalism and an enormous increase in productive power that will bring the revolution . What Marx got wrong was the timing for this . He saw it coming much much quicker than it has . In fact , the depressing thing is that with now new billions joining the capitalist system as India and China become major capitalist players it 's likely to be a long while before we get the mass immiseration . And the pessimists among us might think that capitalism is pretty good at finding ways of keeping itself going . Maybe it wo n't end . But Home has always been a communist of this mature Marxist type . He has declared war many times on the various kinds of vanguardism that pop up in various sub cultures of faux Marxist , anarchist and other groups that work outside the blissed out groove of mature Marxist communist thinking ! To reiterate , instead of assuming people will need a theory to make them revolt , Marx assumes that they wo n't . As Brian Leiter explains ; ' Capitalism \u2026 unleashes the productive power and ingenuity of humanity like no other economic system ; but unlike the apologists for capitalism , Marx saw that the structure of the entire system guaranteed the misery of the vast majority . If agents ' basic needs and desires are frustrated , and you can explain to them both why and what the alternatives are , you can be confident that those agents will be motivated to change things . Instrumental rationality and some assumptions about human desires are all one needs by way of a psychology of revolution . Agents do not need to know what justice is , or fairness , or morally right action . To be sure , they may express their desires in normative language ( we all use normative language , all the time ) , but that is not the same as saying they need a discursive justification or theory of those concepts to be motivated to act . They do not , in short , need a normative theory to explain why they should revolt if Marx 's descriptive claims about the tendencies of capitalist development are correct . ' That 's why it 's important to know that Home really digs this stuff , and that his work is not some drudge scholarly work but more a labour of love . The psychological impetus for writing about the films is important because it signals that what Home knows is driving him is his own personal history and psychology and not some arid theory generated by half baked twats in a fug of idiot self- righteous aggrandizement , moralism and self-love . He 's a fan of Bruce Lee , not withstanding the critique and sharp thinking . It 's why it 's such a great read . Even if you 've never seen any of these films , or the original Lee ones , you 'll be drawn into this crazy world which Home delineates and deconstructs with verve and skill . He enjoys pressing down on the small details and at the same time boogy woogies with the whole scholarly apparatus so that his writing blends high scholarship antics with seventies jive talk which is in itself a blast . For example , take this little gem of a passage about the 1977 film ' Bruce and the Golden Chaku ' which is typical of the whole performance : ' To wrap things up , Loita , Emily and Zamora , see Bruce off at Manila International Airport . In a loop back to the film 's opening , Bruce catches a Cathay Pacific international flight . Despite the loose and unlikely plotting , the fast and furious action makes this movie fun viewing . There are enough Bruce Lee references to put Golden Chaku in the semiperiphery of the genre but the groovers who made this movie seem at least as interested in doing their own thing as ripping off the Little Dragon . ' By the time you 've read through the vast detail and endless plot lines , absorbed the asides and connections , you end up being sucked into the world of the genre , head spinning with the glut of detail and sneaking around on the net looking to watch a few of the darlings just to see . It 's a cut above the products of unintelligible and juvenile posturing in the intellectual entertainment industry from the likes of Zizek and before that Derrida . It 's class war being fought at the right level . It 's about working with those feelings which are the correct psychology for the way we live now . Sad to say , there are n't many who understand the radical position that Home has continually been setting out and exemplifying over the last few decades . He continually pushes buttons for emotional responses , and simultaneously writes from emotional ' sentimental ' forces he finds in himself . It 's no accident that his work confuses and disturbs , and that it 's difficult to place him in the current cultural milieu , especially now as classical Marxism is out of fashion . Yet if you look carefully there 's something about all of Home 's work that remains consistent . He 's interested in forms of cultural work that is marginal but marginal for a reason . It 's often a sleazy , porny , low- brow sentimentalism he develops and pivots off , one that appeals to clear- cut psychological gratifications rather than sly rational evidence for whatever . He does n't waste time on normative theory for consumption by bourgeoise academics and vanguardists of both left and right . He is trying to work out and understand the mechanisms by which Marxist psychology and epistemology works which entails in part understanding better the Marxist theory of ideology . That he is working with the materials he does and in the manner he does is all part of this serious , and seriously groovacious project . Bruceploitation helps dig the groove between Hume , Neitzsche and Marx via his use of speculative psychological reasoning . Passion makes him write the book in the first place . Come on now , who else would even try to do this ? Home is a righteous jive . ABOUT THE AUTHOR Richard Marshall is still biding his time .

Stewart Home , Re-Enter The Dragon . Genre Theory , Bruceploitation and the Sleazy Joys of Lowbrow Cinema . Leda Tape Organisation , 2018 . Stewart Home knows there are these things happening everywhere , all the time , throughout modern capitalist history , and Bruceploitation is a good way of showing what and how . His are the reflections not only of a certain personal attitude , stuffed with feelings and psychological vim , but a philosophical \u2013 explicitly Marxist \u2013 one as well . Reading Home can be a strange and electrifying experience , one tinged by the sense you 're reading works by a maniac writing towards the edge of an abyss that is more and more your own . His vision is unreconstructedly Marxist , his approach unrelenting and remorseless as he hunts down the capitalist program from within the repeater asskicking . He 's diagnosing the ways in which reason underdetermines belief , and appeals to a speculative psychological hypotheses to explain belief fixation even in the absence of rational evidence through deconstructing a set of carefully selected kung fu films . And importantly the work is a passionate affair . He 's driven by affection for the films which gives the work its authority and force as well its intensity and hilarious jouissance . It 's also swaggery too , well able to take care of itself . As he writes at the start : ' Others with different views will just have to argue their own corner . \u201c Your kung fu , sorry I mean bullshit theory , is pretty good \u2014 but it ca n't beat my trash cinema dialectics ! \u201d He 's not worried . This new book covers this wild landscape of a minor genre of pulp films that few readers will have seen or known about to the obsessive depth Home has , so the detail and fine - pointed nuances in selection reminds us that here 's a writer thinking about the point of uttering half - truths , about the existence of numbers , about mental content , about scientific laws and models , about the existence of fictional entities , like Tong Fu , and about metaphysical and logical impossibility without caring a toss whether we were interested in any of it the first place . ( Although he does reckon that if you 're reading the book you 're either interested in genre theory or action movies , or both . But it 's just as likely that you 're interested in Home and neither of the other things ! ) He 's going point to point so we can start learning up . In fact this kind of point- to - pointing is typical in Home , who often lays down detail after detail , even when his first is damning enough . The technique and approach he uses for capturing his phenomena is part of the curious feeling you often get when reading him that he 's strangling whatever it is in the cradle ; in his relentlessness you feel he 's using a cannon to kill a mouse , but that it misses the mouse to hit neighbouring mice instead . Deliberately . Home is out to cause trouble . Or what others might call fun . The publicity from Leda Tape sets the scene : ' HEAD KICKING BRICK BREAKING MAYHEM ! This is the first in - depth look at movies that riff on tropes associated with Bruce Lee and that sometimes transformed this actor into a mythical superman . The period with the greatest cluster of Brucesploitaton productions lasted less than a decade from the mid-seventies to the early - eighties , but the genre spluttered on into the twenty - first century ; and although it did n't exist as a category before Bruce Lee 's death , there are several films that pre-date the Little Dragon 's demise that clearly belong to it . While death added another dimension to Bruce Lee 's celebrity status , he was already a huge star in South East Asia before he passed away ; so cynical movie producers did not need to wait for his death to exploit popular interest in Lee \u2013 even if the term Brucesploitation had yet to be coined . Within Brucesploitation actors who copy and clone Bruce Lee make up one strand of the subgenre , but their importance can and has been over-stated . Much of the writing about Brucesploitation is fan and internet based , and many of those producing this discourse make little attempt to explain why they insist certain films belong to the genre . Too many fans write as if genre is somehow natural , rather than created and shaped both through bald assertion and by more critical discussion and thinking . It is all too common to find any martial arts film featuring certain actors and themes , or with Bruce in the title , being accepted as Brucesploitation without any debate around the issue . This book systematically explores the genre and controversially takes a close look at which flicks really should be seen as belonging to it . ' Bruceploitation as Home presents it feels like an entire species of semi-beloved and once deferred - to entities has been stolen away leaving behind only persistent appearances . 146 appearences to be precise . That 's how many films he covers in the book . It 's a stunning performance . He 's out to find the representational benefits of genre objects \u2013 like Adam West 's Batman tv series , The Men From Uncle , Atom Ant etc etc , \u2013 without needing to say that such things exist . Home works to liberate readers from the oppression of the values the reader accepts . Home 's Marxism says that these readers oppress themselves in virtue of certain values and norms they accept \u2013 the reality of genius , of originality , of art as an escape from the logic of capitalism and so forth \u2013 and Home offers his books as a kind of diagnostic to understand this oppressive character of modernity . Individuals are captured by judgments of normality telling them the ways of being a normal human being . These are the judgments that tell you what to eat , what jokes are funny , who to vote for , how to raise children , what to wear and so on . In the modern era the regulation of these judgments derives from human sciences . The authority trapping us all in its iron cage is epistemic and as well as the usual religious ones modernity has added scientific ones to hold us in too . Home is out to point out the cage , make sure we can see it and understand it . His strategy has been to cast light on the area of this modern oppression where the cage seems least strong \u2013 the arts \u2013 to show that aesthetics is no less part of the iron cage than shopping , managerialism , orthodox religions and the rest . The role of art as a liberator of the self , as a place where the antinomian rebel might go to wriggle free is taken down . His strategy is to show how wherever you want to go he can show you the tactics and influence of economics , politics and moral considerations that have led to whatever art form you care to examine . And in showing that they 've been co-opted and work effectively to maintain the modern capitalist structures that are ubiquitous and currently unassailable he bursts optimistic delusions that capitalism can be breached . Yet his books are not dry , drab and depressing reads but are injected with a zoomy sense of unstoppability which mirrors the system he 's fighting , as if he 's showing that pushback taken to a limit can be effective in beginning the resistance , no matter how big or small the perceived impact . After all , resistance has to start somewhere and for all we know each little crack may end up contributing to the end game . So the fun is in this serious agenda bashing up against a wild and prolonged discussion of a genre that , as he explains in the prologue , he first became attached to growing up in the sixties and seventies . ' As a kid I watched the Batman TV series so it is probable I was exposed to Bruce Lee 's guest appearances as Kato before I learnt he was the ' king of kung fu' . There were many things to prep my interest in Lee but probably just feeling angry and disempowered was the most important factor . Constantly having teachers tell me and all the other kids at school that we were stupid and would never do anything with our lives \u2014 other than work in a factory \u2014 was more than enough to make me want to breakout from such drab surroundings . ' This is a typical Home moment mixing personal reminiscence with the underlying anger and resentment that animates his whole oeuvre . Bruce Lee 's kung fu movies and the Bruceploitation movies that followed were , he explains , a form of escape from the dismal limits of childhood . As he writes , ' Music was one way to escape this sham reality , but by the time I was twelve years - old glam rock was on its last legs , so martial arts flicks filled a void by providing a better form of contemporary escapism \u2014 at least until punk rock came along . ' One of the great things about the book is that Home writes about how he got into the films and how his motivations have threaded through his subsequent works in the many arenas in which he works \u2013 novels , conceptual art , poetry , essays , performance art , lectures , music and so forth . You get riffs like this which paint a picture of the young Home making his way into the deep waters of contemporary modernity which are fascinating for their insight into a time now fast becoming difficult to imagine for anyone of a certain age , a world without the internet , computers , mobile phones and the whole digital media paraphernalia . It 's the world on the brink of hyper- capitalism , the world that had since the 30 's seemed to be a world where perhaps capitalist logic could be tamed and defanged . The time from the 30's to the end of the 70's was the only time in recorded history where average returns on work outperformed average returns on capital in western capitalist societies . It was a period where it looked as if we were living in a different modernity to the one that had been in place ever since the French Revolution where capital always made more than work . Alas , it was n't to last . By the time the seventies had ended we were returning to the norm of the previous few hundred years . Of course now it seems obvious that capitalists \u2013 a tiny portion of the population \u2013 own the world , and that we 're stuck in our own version of the belle \u00e9poque but back then it was n't so obvious . This is of course the important message from Picketty 's book on Capital . The low tech , ziney world of the seventies is where Home 's affection and interest for these flicks began , and his asides catch the different atmosphere of those lost times . Take this riff : ' I first took a conscious interest in Bruce Lee when the London based Kung Fu Monthly began publication in 1974 .

Marx was clear about what he thought the conditions would be to bring about this mass revolt when he writes in the ' German Ideology ' : ' [ I]t [ capitalism ] must necessarily have rendered the great mass of humanity ' propertyless , ' and produced , at the same time , the contradiction of an existing world of wealth and culture , both of which conditions presuppose a great increase in productive power , a high degree of development \u2026. [ T]his development of productive forces \u2026 is an absolutely necessary practical premise because without it want is merely made general , and with destitution the struggle for necessities and all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced ; and furthermore , because only with this universal development of productive forces is a universal intercourse between men established , which produces in all nations simultaneously the phenomenon of the ' propertyless ' mass \u2026 Empirically , communism is only possible as the act of the dominant peoples ' all at once ' and simultaneously , which presupposes the universal development of productive forces and the world intercourse bound up with communism ( 1846/1978 , 161 - 162 ) . ' So for Marx its mass immiseration , truly global capitalism and an enormous increase in productive power that will bring the revolution . What Marx got wrong was the timing for this . He saw it coming much much quicker than it has . In fact , the depressing thing is that with now new billions joining the capitalist system as India and China become major capitalist players it 's likely to be a long while before we get the mass immiseration . And the pessimists among us might think that capitalism is pretty good at finding ways of keeping itself going . Maybe it wo n't end . But Home has always been a communist of this mature Marxist type . He has declared war many times on the various kinds of vanguardism that pop up in various sub cultures of faux Marxist , anarchist and other groups that work outside the blissed out groove of mature Marxist communist thinking ! To reiterate , instead of assuming people will need a theory to make them revolt , Marx assumes that they wo n't . As Brian Leiter explains ; ' Capitalism \u2026 unleashes the productive power and ingenuity of humanity like no other economic system ; but unlike the apologists for capitalism , Marx saw that the structure of the entire system guaranteed the misery of the vast majority . If agents ' basic needs and desires are frustrated , and you can explain to them both why and what the alternatives are , you can be confident that those agents will be motivated to change things . Instrumental rationality and some assumptions about human desires are all one needs by way of a psychology of revolution . Agents do not need to know what justice is , or fairness , or morally right action . To be sure , they may express their desires in normative language ( we all use normative language , all the time ) , but that is not the same as saying they need a discursive justification or theory of those concepts to be motivated to act . They do not , in short , need a normative theory to explain why they should revolt if Marx 's descriptive claims about the tendencies of capitalist development are correct . ' That 's why it 's important to know that Home really digs this stuff , and that his work is not some drudge scholarly work but more a labour of love . The psychological impetus for writing about the films is important because it signals that what Home knows is driving him is his own personal history and psychology and not some arid theory generated by half baked twats in a fug of idiot self- righteous aggrandizement , moralism and self-love . He 's a fan of Bruce Lee , not withstanding the critique and sharp thinking . It 's why it 's such a great read . Even if you 've never seen any of these films , or the original Lee ones , you 'll be drawn into this crazy world which Home delineates and deconstructs with verve and skill . He enjoys pressing down on the small details and at the same time boogy woogies with the whole scholarly apparatus so that his writing blends high scholarship antics with seventies jive talk which is in itself a blast . For example , take this little gem of a passage about the 1977 film ' Bruce and the Golden Chaku ' which is typical of the whole performance : ' To wrap things up , Loita , Emily and Zamora , see Bruce off at Manila International Airport . In a loop back to the film 's opening , Bruce catches a Cathay Pacific international flight . Despite the loose and unlikely plotting , the fast and furious action makes this movie fun viewing . There are enough Bruce Lee references to put Golden Chaku in the semiperiphery of the genre but the groovers who made this movie seem at least as interested in doing their own thing as ripping off the Little Dragon . ' By the time you 've read through the vast detail and endless plot lines , absorbed the asides and connections , you end up being sucked into the world of the genre , head spinning with the glut of detail and sneaking around on the net looking to watch a few of the darlings just to see . It 's a cut above the products of unintelligible and juvenile posturing in the intellectual entertainment industry from the likes of Zizek and before that Derrida . It 's class war being fought at the right level . It 's about working with those feelings which are the correct psychology for the way we live now . Sad to say , there are n't many who understand the radical position that Home has continually been setting out and exemplifying over the last few decades . He continually pushes buttons for emotional responses , and simultaneously writes from emotional ' sentimental ' forces he finds in himself . It 's no accident that his work confuses and disturbs , and that it 's difficult to place him in the current cultural milieu , especially now as classical Marxism is out of fashion . Yet if you look carefully there 's something about all of Home 's work that remains consistent . He 's interested in forms of cultural work that is marginal but marginal for a reason . It 's often a sleazy , porny , low- brow sentimentalism he develops and pivots off , one that appeals to clear- cut psychological gratifications rather than sly rational evidence for whatever . He does n't waste time on normative theory for consumption by bourgeoise academics and vanguardists of both left and right . He is trying to work out and understand the mechanisms by which Marxist psychology and epistemology works which entails in part understanding better the Marxist theory of ideology . That he is working with the materials he does and in the manner he does is all part of this serious , and seriously groovacious project . Bruceploitation helps dig the groove between Hume , Neitzsche and Marx via his use of speculative psychological reasoning . Passion makes him write the book in the first place . Come on now , who else would even try to do this ? Home is a righteous jive . ABOUT THE AUTHOR Richard Marshall is still biding his time .

American Ambassador Woody Johnson 's comment to Andrew Marr on Sunday that healthcare would need to be on the table in any future trade talks only served to make agreeing a fully - fledged deal all the more difficult . That the US will drive a hard bargain in any future negotiation with the UK should come as no surprise . Only the EU , and perhaps China , have the economic heft to negotiate on near- level terms with the Americans , and even they struggle . The US 's objectives for its negotiation with the UK were published in February and \u2014 with the caveat that they were largely produced for a domestic American audience , shorn of all notion of compromise \u2014 are strikingly ambitious in their demands . For example : alongside normal talk of tariff and quota removal , the UK must jettison food hygiene rules that currently restrict US exports of beef , pork , chicken and dairy ; rules stipulating which products qualify for tariff - free treatment under the agreements must specifically incentivise production on US territory ; and the agreement should include a mechanism allowing for the US to take appropriate action if the UK negotiates an agreement with a \u201c non - market economy \u201d ( see : China ) . It should be noted , however , that healthcare is not explicitly mentioned . Despite long - running fears of a US trade deal- inspired privatisation of the National Health Service , public services are largely carved out of free trade agreements , and that is unlikely to change . Absent a free trade agreement , American healthcare providers already compete to deliver services in the UK where the NHS puts out contracts to competitive tender . This is not without its own controversy , but was a unilateral decision made by a British government seeking value for money . However , US demands regarding reimbursement regimes for pharmaceuticals and medical devices give greater cause for thought . The US has long taken issue with the fact that the NHS 's approach to drug procurement \u2014 where it makes its own assessment as to the fair value of the drugs it buys \u2014 pulls down prices worldwide . Previously , in negotiations with Australia and New Zealand , the US backed away from trade asks on drug pricing in order to get agreements over the line , but due to the NHS 's global significance and market power , the incentives for the US to push the UK harder are more pronounced . Regardless , perception is more important than reality when it comes to selling an agreement , and so long as the British public believe the NHS to be on the table any deal will struggle for legitimacy . In practice , we will not know whether the UK will be in a position to even begin negotiations with the US until at least the end of October . Without greater clarity on the nature of the UK 's future relationship with the EU , it is impossible to enter into substantive discussions with the US . This is because any relationship with the EU comprehensive enough to ensure an all - UK solution for Northern Ireland , for example , would greatly restrict the UK 's ability to concede to the US 's demands and get an agreement over the line . Yet even if the UK is to enter into a looser economic relationship with the EU following an ordered withdrawal , we should not assume that a deal with the US will be easy to come by . Agriculture remains a contentious sticking point and Conservative fears of upsetting their rural base will be difficult to overcome . Equally , stories of US chlorinated chicken and hormone beef have already permeated the public consciousness . While Trump could agree to a bare - boned agreement that excludes agriculture and controversial topics such as food safety and drug pricing , just to say he had successfully negotiated something , it seems unlikely .

American Ambassador Woody Johnson 's comment to Andrew Marr on Sunday that healthcare would need to be on the table in any future trade talks only served to make agreeing a fully - fledged deal all the more difficult . That the US will drive a hard bargain in any future negotiation with the UK should come as no surprise . Only the EU , and perhaps China , have the economic heft to negotiate on near- level terms with the Americans , and even they struggle . The US 's objectives for its negotiation with the UK were published in February and \u2014 with the caveat that they were largely produced for a domestic American audience , shorn of all notion of compromise \u2014 are strikingly ambitious in their demands . For example : alongside normal talk of tariff and quota removal , the UK must jettison food hygiene rules that currently restrict US exports of beef , pork , chicken and dairy ; rules stipulating which products qualify for tariff - free treatment under the agreements must specifically incentivise production on US territory ; and the agreement should include a mechanism allowing for the US to take appropriate action if the UK negotiates an agreement with a \u201c non - market economy \u201d ( see : China ) . It should be noted , however , that healthcare is not explicitly mentioned . Despite long - running fears of a US trade deal- inspired privatisation of the National Health Service , public services are largely carved out of free trade agreements , and that is unlikely to change . Absent a free trade agreement , American healthcare providers already compete to deliver services in the UK where the NHS puts out contracts to competitive tender . This is not without its own controversy , but was a unilateral decision made by a British government seeking value for money . However , US demands regarding reimbursement regimes for pharmaceuticals and medical devices give greater cause for thought . The US has long taken issue with the fact that the NHS 's approach to drug procurement \u2014 where it makes its own assessment as to the fair value of the drugs it buys \u2014 pulls down prices worldwide . Previously , in negotiations with Australia and New Zealand , the US backed away from trade asks on drug pricing in order to get agreements over the line , but due to the NHS 's global significance and market power , the incentives for the US to push the UK harder are more pronounced . Regardless , perception is more important than reality when it comes to selling an agreement , and so long as the British public believe the NHS to be on the table any deal will struggle for legitimacy . In practice , we will not know whether the UK will be in a position to even begin negotiations with the US until at least the end of October . Without greater clarity on the nature of the UK 's future relationship with the EU , it is impossible to enter into substantive discussions with the US . This is because any relationship with the EU comprehensive enough to ensure an all - UK solution for Northern Ireland , for example , would greatly restrict the UK 's ability to concede to the US 's demands and get an agreement over the line . Yet even if the UK is to enter into a looser economic relationship with the EU following an ordered withdrawal , we should not assume that a deal with the US will be easy to come by . Agriculture remains a contentious sticking point and Conservative fears of upsetting their rural base will be difficult to overcome . Equally , stories of US chlorinated chicken and hormone beef have already permeated the public consciousness . While Trump could agree to a bare - boned agreement that excludes agriculture and controversial topics such as food safety and drug pricing , just to say he had successfully negotiated something , it seems unlikely . The UK is not the end - game for the US . Its ultimate ambition is to open up the bigger EU market . For the UK to move to a more American approach would set a regional precedent , grant the US a regulatory foothold in the EU 's backyard , and push back against the EU 's increasingly global regulatory hegemony . Perhaps the only event that could cajole MPs and the British public into holding their noses and signing on Trump 's dotted line is a no-deal Brexit .

This time they had a leader equal to the task in Chmielniecki . On news of the disturbances in the Sich Polish commander Nicholas Potocki set out for the Ukraine and in February 1648 he camped at Korsun . He sent part of his force ( 3 - 3,500 ) comprising regular troops and registered Cossacks to meet Chmielniecki ( 10,000 ) , which they did at Zlote Wody ( Yellow Waters ) . For the first time the Cossacks had allied themselves with the Tartars and together they formed a formidable fighting force . The mainly Cossack infantry now had a superb mobile cavalry arm while the solely cavalry Tartars had the assistance of the Cossacks defensive firepower . The Poles on the other hand lacked a commander of the stature of the recently deceased Koniecpolski . At Zlote Wody the registered Cossacks deserted the Royal army and in the ensuing confusion the remaining forces were destroyed on 15th May 1648 . Eleven days later the main Polish army was defeated at Korsun and as news spread of these victories the whole of the Ukraine rose in rebellion . When he was most needed , the much respected , King Wladyslaw IV died and with the Royal commanders captured or killed Poland was without a leader . Fortunately for Poland Chmielniecki delayed while he organised his forces and his country , while the booty laden Tartars returned home . In September 1648 Chmielniecki moved further into Poland . With both Hetman 's Potocki and Kalinowski captured , the Polish forces , though substantial , were ill disciplined and badly led by a group of three and defeated at Pilawce ( 10 to 23 October 1648 ) . The improvised cavalry failed to make any impression on the masses of Cossack infantry supported by the skillful Tartars . The few regular infantry which had survived Zlote Wody and Korsun ( King 's guard regiment and ' Wybraniecka ' infantry ) did however acquit themselves well , defending the river crossings with great courage before being overwhelmed . It was a great material and morale catastrophe , and a pathetic military display . One Cossack commander noted \" these were not the Poles we knew , the victors over the Turks and Muscovites , of Tartars and Germans , but cowards and rabbits , children clad in steel . They died of fright when they saw us \" . Chmielniecki then besieged Lvov and after receiving a ransom moved on to Zamosc , but the impregnable fortress held and the Cossacks returned home for the winter . Large numbers of peasants joined the Cossack army and with the Tartars they ravaged the land ' with fire and sword ' slaughtering nobles , Polish or Ruthenian , priests and nuns and Jews in their thousands . The Tartars taught their Cossack allies many lessons in cruelty including the Moldavian custom of impaling alive , which was carried out with relish by Cossacks and Poles alike . No one was in control on either side and the whole region degenerated into mindless violence and cruelty . In Warsaw Jan Kazimierz ( John Casimir ) half - brother of Wladyslaw was elected King . The coronation Sejm of 1649 enlarged the standing army , placing its financing partly on provinces of Poland and ended the registering of Cossacks . In June 1649 the Cossacks recommenced military operations when their Tartar allies returned . Polish forces retreated to the fortified camp of Zbaraz ( 10 July to 25 August 1649 ) where a relatively small force of some 9,000 Polish troops held back the entire might of Chmielniecki and the Khan for over six weeks . The new king moved to assist but was met by Chmielniecki 's main forces in a hard and indecisive two day battle at Zborow ( 15 - 16 August 1649 ) . The Poles succeeded in buying off the Khan and with Lithuanian forces operating in the East a truce was reached which included a general amnesty . The Second Cossack War Chmielniecki spent the next year maintaining the peace while making preparations for the inevitable continuation of war . He managed to raise an army of over 100,000 Cossacks had political support from Turkey and military support from the Crimean Tartars . He also hoped his rebellion , which had taken over the Ukraine , would spread to the peasants in Poland . The Sejm agreed to the raising of a 36,000 Royal and 15,000 Lithuanian army , giving the King the authority to raise the levy . While Polish forces were concentrating Hetman Kalinowski managed to loose half of his 12,000 force in operations to shield the main army . In June 1651 the Khan Islam Giereja rejoined the Cossacks and together they marched at the Polish forces . At the three day battle of Beresteczko ( 28 to 30 June 1651 ) the Royal army ( 27,000 mercenaries and 30,000 noble levy ) achieved a decisive victory and the Cossack - Tartar army ( 60 - 80,000 Cossacks and 20 - 30,000 Tartars ) retreated back to the Dniepr . Again the noble levy cavalry showed their poor discipline with the infantry saving the day and then ensuring a decisive defeat was inflicted on the enemy . After the battle the noble levy , deciding their duty was completed , dispersed while the remaining forces moved towards the Ukraine and joined up with the equally victorious Lithuanian army . Hetman Kalinowski , with complete victory within his grasp agreed to a truce . Peace was agreed in September at Biala Cerkiew , however it was even less successful than that agreed at Zborow . The Poles carried out punitive expeditions against the Ukraine while Chmielniecki punished with death the leaders of peasant riots . In 1652 the Great Cossack Council renewed hostilities with Poland and sent envoys to the Tsar and Khan for assistance . On 2 June 1652 Hetman Kalinowski attempted to head off Chmielniecki 's move to Moldavia but was defeated at Batoh . After the battle the Cossacks paid the Tartars to give them their share of the prisoners so that they could be killed , amoungst the dead was the brother of the future King Jan Sobieski , Marek . After a short vain siege of Kamieniec Podolski the Cossack - Tartar army returned home to seek further allies . Batoh led to a new 36,000 army with a much-reorganised financial base , making forces easier to raise and maintain , the Kwarta tax was used to maintain the artillery and fortifications . New financing gave the name ' computed ' for the regular army . The noble levy remained as a last resort and there were periodic mobilisations and exercises . Although the new system was by no means perfect it gave the Commonwealth a powerful army and was a natural evolution from a mainly mercenary to standing army . The Cossack wars continued and on 18th January 1654 Chmielniecki submitted the Ukraine to the ' Tsars hand ' and Muscovy invaded Poland and Lithuania . This was in violation of the Treaty of 1634 and Jan Kazimierz sent deputations to the Sultan and the Khan for assistance against the Tsar . The Ottomans allowed a Tartar alliance with the Poles , while the Sejm of June 1654 raised noble levies of 35,000 for Poland and 18,000 for Lithuania . Start of the Muscovite Wars The Muscovite army attacked with three groups at Lithuania and one at the Ukraine . The Muscovite army was numerous and well equipped and now trained mainly in the Western manner with many foreign officers . In Lithuania they were briefly checked by Janusz Radziwill 's small force , before pushing on to Smolensk . The winter halted further operations . In the Ukraine the Polish - Tartar army met the Cossack - Muscovite army at Ochmatow ( January 1655 ) and though the Muscovite forces were broken a decisive result slipped from the Poles when the Tartars refused to fight the Cossacks . In the Summer of 1655 a new Muscovite army reached Wilno and in two weeks turned the vibrant capital into a heap of ashes , but another even more dangerous enemy appeared . 5","annotations":[{"text":"battle at Zborow","span":[3686,3701],"token_span":[665,667],"role":"Process","label":"Process","role_definition":"A Process which is ended by the Agent or Cause."},{"text":"Zborow","span":[3696,3701],"token_span":[667,667],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the Process or State is caused to end."},{"text":"16 August 1649","span":[3710,3723],"token_span":[671,673],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time when the Process or State is ended."},{"text":"The Poles","span":[3729,3737],"token_span":[676,677],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The individual who causes the Process or State to end."},{"text":"in buying off the Khan","span":[3749,3770],"token_span":[679,683],"role":"Cause","label":"Cause","role_definition":"An event that causes the Process or State to end."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"Since the defenders were also aware of their difficult situation , both sides signed a truce .

Despite the incidents reported by French troops , the peacekeepers sought to reassure nervous Serbs they could protect them . The monastery is in Srbica , about 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) west of Pristina . KFOR spokesmen said Thursday the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from the Serbian province was proceeding ahead of schedule . But the shrine 's desecration could hurt KFOR 's attempt to prevent a second flood of refugees from Kosovo -- this time , from Serb neighborhoods . French peacekeepers put the Devic monastery under guard after they said Kosovo Liberation Army fighters terrorized a priest and several nuns for four days , from Sunday to Wednesday . The KFOR troops said KLA rebels vandalized centuries - old murals and paintings in the chapel and stole two cars and all the monastery 's food . In addition , a French soldier said , the KLA stripped the clothes from a young nun and took her into a back room . The soldier said she was hysterical and appeared to be traumatized when she was found . When asked if the woman had been raped , the French soldier responded to CNN , \" What do you think ? \" The 15th - century monastery is one of the shrines from which the Serbian nation draws its cultural identity . Part of the agreement that ended NATO 's 11 - week bombing campaign provides for a handful of Yugoslav troops to return to the province later to protect sites like Devic . About 15,000 troops from NATO countries have gone into Kosovo since the end of fighting a week ago , said Lt. Col. Robin Clifford , KFOR 's spokesman in Pristina . At the same time , 35,000 Yugoslav army and Serb special police troops have left . That puts them ahead of the schedule set by the cease - fire agreement , which demands that all Yugoslav troops leave Kosovo by midnight Sunday . Fearing reprisals from the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians driven out during NATO 's air war against Yugoslavia , about 50,000 Serbs already have fled the province as their former neighbors return . KFOR commander Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson and Serbian Orthodox leader Patriarch Pavle have urged them to stay , and Clifford said the Serb exodus had slowed .

Despite the incidents reported by French troops , the peacekeepers sought to reassure nervous Serbs they could protect them . The monastery is in Srbica , about 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) west of Pristina . KFOR spokesmen said Thursday the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from the Serbian province was proceeding ahead of schedule . But the shrine 's desecration could hurt KFOR 's attempt to prevent a second flood of refugees from Kosovo -- this time , from Serb neighborhoods . French peacekeepers put the Devic monastery under guard after they said Kosovo Liberation Army fighters terrorized a priest and several nuns for four days , from Sunday to Wednesday . The KFOR troops said KLA rebels vandalized centuries - old murals and paintings in the chapel and stole two cars and all the monastery 's food . In addition , a French soldier said , the KLA stripped the clothes from a young nun and took her into a back room . The soldier said she was hysterical and appeared to be traumatized when she was found . When asked if the woman had been raped , the French soldier responded to CNN , \" What do you think ? \" The 15th - century monastery is one of the shrines from which the Serbian nation draws its cultural identity . Part of the agreement that ended NATO 's 11 - week bombing campaign provides for a handful of Yugoslav troops to return to the province later to protect sites like Devic . About 15,000 troops from NATO countries have gone into Kosovo since the end of fighting a week ago , said Lt. Col. Robin Clifford , KFOR 's spokesman in Pristina . At the same time , 35,000 Yugoslav army and Serb special police troops have left . That puts them ahead of the schedule set by the cease - fire agreement , which demands that all Yugoslav troops leave Kosovo by midnight Sunday . Fearing reprisals from the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians driven out during NATO 's air war against Yugoslavia , about 50,000 Serbs already have fled the province as their former neighbors return . KFOR commander Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson and Serbian Orthodox leader Patriarch Pavle have urged them to stay , and Clifford said the Serb exodus had slowed . KFOR will protect \" all the ordinary , decent citizens of Kosovo , regardless of their ethnic background or religious persuasion , \" Clifford said . \" I have also spoken to those who say they are perfectly content to say here , certainly those here in Pristina , as long as KFOR troops are here to protect them , \" he said .

From pregame rituals to rivalry games , from marching bands to student section chants , it 's a level of sports unrivaled in passion . The FCS is no different . Programs rich in history are proud of the traditions they 've established . HERO Sports asked around and also scoured the internet for some of the best in the FCS . What we found are traditions that range from new to old , from humorous and quirky to something that sends chills down your spine and puts a lump in your throat . Here are the best traditions in the FCS with a Top 10 ranking at the bottom : NOTE : This article was originally published in 2018 and has been re-published in 2021 after the link broke . Many of these traditions were submitted by fans , administration , or coaches . Because of that , there are sure to be some missing . If you feel one deserves to be mentioned , email sam.herder@herosports.com and we 'll consider adding it . New Hampshire The Cannon Man Dick Dewing , who graduated in 1953 and is a UNH football Hall of Famer , fired a Revolutionary War-era cannon at home games for years , and did so into the 2019 season at the age of 91 . Dressed in full regalia and with his full crew , a blank shot is fired from the cannon at the beginning of the game , after the marching band plays \u201c 1812 Overture \u201d and after every Wildcats touchdown . Dewing passed away in April 2021 , but the tradition will continue . Todd Walker Teammate Award UNH has another special tradition with the Todd Walker Teammate Award . Walker , a former receiver for the Wildcats , was shot and killed in 2011 when he stopped an attempted robbery and saved the life of a woman he was walking home . The award was created to honor his memory and recognize a player who displays the attributes of selflessness and dedication as the ideal teammate . Delaware Tubby Raymond 's Paintings Harold \u201c Tubby \u201d Raymond was a Delaware assistant coach beginning in 1954 and was the head coach from 1966-2001 , winning 300 games and three national championships . In the 1950s , Raymond began to do acrylic paintings of a senior member of the team each week during the season for most of his coaching career at Delaware . He continued to do the paintings all the way up to the 2017 season until he passed away in December . Raymond was 92 . \u201c These portraits were a treasure to all of us , \u201d Joe Purzycki , a 1969 captain , said . McNeese \u201c Jolie Blond \u201d After each touchdown , the band plays the Cajun National Anthem , Jolie Blonde . The entire stadium dances to it , swaying to the left and clapping twice , swaying right and clapping twice , and so on and so on . Firing the Cannon After the Cowboys score a touchdown , a cannon is fired by Cannon Krewe members , who dress in full costume attire . It 's a strong tradition not only for the football team but for Southwest Louisiana as a whole . The history of pirates , contraband , buccaneers , and cannon fire can be found on street names , at festivals , and within the deep treasuries of local family tales and stories . The Cannon Krewe consists of at least 10 - 12 members for every game . When the Cowboys win , the cannons are fired strategically right when the scoreboard hits zero . If the team loses , the cannons are discharged only after the band plays the McNeese Alma Mater . Kennesaw State Turnover Plank Several college football teams celebrate with some sort of prop after the defense forces a turnover . Kennesaw State has \u201c Plank , \u201d which went viral in its debut season in 2017 . Simply a piece of wood with a smiley face on it that was originally found in Florida on spring break , Plank is still a point of pride for the defense to hold up on the sidelines . Idaho American Flag Every time the Idaho football team runs onto the field , they make sure a player is carrying the American flag . This started under former head coach Robb Akey after he took a trip to Afghanistan . The Vandals still run out with the flag under current head coach Paul Petrino . Ring the Bell Idaho has another tradition inside the walls of its facilities and uses it as a rallying call with \u201c Ring the Bell . \u201d Every time the bell is rung in the weight room , it signifies a player has hit his personal best . The Serpentine Add another tradition for Idaho , one that the students love . On the night before the homecoming football game , students form a serpentine led by the marching band that snakes across campus and picks people up on the way to a bonfire and pep rally . Originally , freshmen were tasked with gathering materials for the fire . Now , it is constructed by the homecoming committee . The serpentine has been an annual event for more than 100 years . Montana State Gold Rush Game Montana State has one of the best home venues in FCS football . The Bobcats make it extra special during the first home game of the year with the Gold Rush Game . The fans all wear gold and the team wears its gold jerseys . If the first home game is also the season opener , it 's usually held on a Thursday night under the lights . Cat Prowl Another cool tradition for MSU is the Cat Prowl an hour before kickoff . Cheerleaders and the marching band lead the football team to the stadium through a tunnel of fans . Before entering the stadium , players touch a 9 - foot statute of Sonny Holland , known as the \u201c the greatest Bobcat of them all . \u201d The statue debuted in 2016 . Holland was a three - time All -American and also won 47 games in seven years as a head coach , winning the 1976 Division II national championship . And the big stat is going 10 - 1 against Montana . Colgate Cake Wednesday Former Raiders head coach Dick Biddle told his players , \u201c Do n't be cake eaters . \u201d In other words , \u201c do n't be soft . \u201d In 2012 , Biddle brought in an actual cake with frosting that said , \u201c Do n't be cake eaters . \u201d This took place on a Wednesday and the team won that Saturday . It 's now turned into a tradition with cake in the locker room after every Wednesday practice . Samford Charles Williams Memorial Jersey In 2003 , Samford defensive back Charles Williams was killed in a car accident . An extremely well - respected man by his teammates and coaches , it was decided that no player would wear his No. 5 during the 2003 and 2004 seasons . In 2005 , the first Charles Williams Memorial Jersey was awarded to a senior who had the same qualities as Williams : selflessness , perseverance , and determination . The jersey number has been given to a senior every season since . Jacksonville State \u201c I'll Fly Away \u201d This has been sung by the JSU Marching Southerners for decades . A few years ago , the football team began to join in on the tradition . After games , the Southerners gather , put their arms around each other and sing it with the fans and players . Chattanooga Singing the Alma Mater A lot of football teams sing the school 's alma mater after games with the band . But how Chattanooga began this tradition is a little more unique . In 2009 , UTC fans pointed out on the message boards that Wofford stopped in the middle of the field after the game to watch the band play the UTC alma mater while the Chattanooga players ran to the locker room . Bob Mulkey , an admin on the message boards , brought it up to then - head coach Russ Huesman as part of the \u201c question of the week . \u201d Huesman acknowledged it and since then the football team remains on the field during the alma mater and the words appear on the video boards . Northern Arizona , Northern Colorado , Western Carolina The Freshmen Run At the beginning of every season , the freshmen class runs across the football field from end zone to end zone . Known FCS schools to do this are Northern Arizona , Northern Colorado , and Western Carolina . ( James Madison also does this , but has another well - known tradition that will be on this list . ) WCU 's tradition had a special twist with beloved chancellor David Belcher leading the freshmen during his seven years at the school . Belcher , known as the biggest fan of every sport / athlete at WCU , passed away in 2018 after a year - long battle with cancer . Western Illinois Peach Blossoms \u201c ' Peach Blossoms ' is the informal name of WIU 's Veterans Club with the purpose to help student - veterans adjust to college life after their time in service . They are also a group of the most passionate Leatherneck fans out there . The Peach Blossoms , a moniker adopted in the 1960s , can be seen during home games , tailgating , and the annual parade wearing their red-dyed mop tops and purple T-shirts . Villanova Tap the Rock The \u201c Tap the Rock \u201d mantra dates back to the 2009 national championship Villanova team . Team Chaplin , Father Rob Hagen , shared the Stonecutter Parable which describes a person wanting to break down a stone using only small chipping tools . The cutter goes on for a long time tapping the stone , eventually getting the stone to crack and fall apart . The message from the story is not reaching the goal . It 's realizing that , while the final tap of the rock was the one that broke it , it was all the taps leading up to it that played a key role . The message stuck and was engraved on the national title rings . Now , the football team still uses the saying and taps a rock as a reminder that the final play did n't win the game , but it was everything that added up to that final play . South Dakota Dakota Days ( D- Days ) The first Dakota Day was held in 1914 . Also known as D-Days , it 's a prideful week where the alumni return and the current students get to know more about the past traditions of the university . The weeklong celebration culminates with a parade Saturday before the football game . Of course , the students also use it as an excuse to do what college students typically do on a Saturday night . That side of D-Days can be found here : South Dakota State Hobo Day Another Homecoming celebration for a South Dakota school . The first official Hobo Day at SDSU took place in 1912 . It originally began as a \u201c nightshirt parade \u201d in 1907 where students prepared torches after a bonfire and marched through Main Street dressed in nightshirts and bedsheets . The tradition turned into Hobo Day in 1912 , where students simply dressed as hobos . The Homecoming celebration has continued to evolve over time while still maintaining traditions such as competitive beard - growing that started in the ' 30s . The Bummobile has also been a part of the parade for more than 100 years . Activities occur throughout the week , but it 's game day when the festivities really crank it up a notch and of course , the students have their own fun with it before and after the big football game . Jackson State Sonic Boom of the South entering the stadium to \u201c Get Ready \u201d HBCU marching bands are legendary and must - see shows . Perhaps no band sets the stage better during their football game performances than Jackson State 's , who enters the stadium playing \u201c Get Ready , \u201d an old Motown favorite selected as the band 's theme song in 1974 . Princeton The Bonfire If the ceremonial bonfire takes place , that means it was a special season for the Princeton football team . The fire only happens if the Tigers beat Harvard and Yale in the same season , giving the school bragging rights out of the \u201c Big Three . \u201d This started in the 1950s and as the tradition goes , it is the responsibility of the dink - wearing freshmen to gather wood from the surrounding area and construct the bonfire . Yale The Bulldog Walk One of the top traditions in the Ivy League , the Bulldog Walk begins 80 minutes before kickoff as the football team gathers under the Walter Camp Memorial . Led by the captains and head coach , the players lock arms while following the marching band on the 1,000 - foot march into the Yale Bowl . The path is lined on both sides with fans . When the team enters the Yale Bowl , they walk along the outside walls of the stadium as they make their way onto Jensen Plaza to enter the team room . \u201c The Bulldog Walk gave me chills as all of the fans lined up to cheer the team on as we made our way to the Bowl , \u201d former linebacker Foye Oluokun said . \u201c I took visits to other Ivy Schools and none of their fan bases and community support compared to that which I have experienced at Yale . \u201d UC Davis The Helmet Rule Starting in the 1970s , legendary UC Davis head coach Jim Sochor implemented a rule that is still in place today . Sochor 's core rule was that a player 's helmet was to never hit the ground . They were to be worn , held , or placed in their lockers . \u201c Your helmet is the most critical piece of equipment , \u201d Sochor once said . \u201c It can protect you , save your life , so you must treat it with dignity and respect . \u201d Over time , it 's become more enforced by the upperclassmen rather than the coaches . The Citadel \u201c Boomer \u201d the Cannon Cannons have been a part of The Citadel tradition from the school 's founding day . During home football games , the Palmetto Battery supports the team by firing one of two cannons when the Bulldogs score a touchdown . Then , when the extra point is scored , \u201c Boomer \u201d is fired . It was first fired in 1957 . Then in 1980 , a \u201c Name the Touchdown Cannon \u201d contest was held , and \u201c Boomer \u201d was chosen . The Top 10 10 . Southern Illinois Pyramid of King Tut the Dog Southern Illinois is known geographically as \u201c Little Egypt . \u201d The SIU mascot was changed in 1951 to the Saluki , an ancient breed of Egyptian hunting dog , and the school got an actual Saluki dog as a mascot and named it King Tut . King Tut was hit by a car in 1954 and died . He was buried in the corner of the old football stadium with a cement pyramid . When the new Saluki Stadium was built in 2010 , the pyramid was cleaned up and moved to the entrance of the stadium where fans and players touch it for good luck . 9 . Magic City Classic Tailgating The Magic City Classic is routinely the most attended FCS game of the season . The annual game between Alabama A&M and Alabama State is played at Legion Field in Birmingham , nicknamed the \u201c Magic City . \u201d Attendance averages more than 60,000 people . This series began in 1924 and has been played at Legion Field since 1946 . The tailgating beforehand has turned into a special event . It resembles more of a festival as tents and RVs line the tailgating lot . Good people , good music , and good food make for a tailgate everyone needs to experience . 8 . Harvard One Captain Harvard has only one captain , a position voted by the players . It 's been that way for almost every season since 1872 . 7 . Fordham Victory Bell A classic tradition of any win by a Fordham team is ringing the Victory Bell , which is located outside of the legendary Rose Hill Gym. President Harry S. Truman became the first to ring the bell on campus in 1946 . After football wins , every senior is lifted by underclassmen to ring the bell . Fans watch as they sing the fight song . At least two players are needed to lift a senior high enough to reach it . The bell is also rung at the start of graduation ceremonies . \u201c What kind of makes it awesome , \u201d former tight end Dan Light told the New York Times , \u201c is that for three years you watch it , and then when you ring it as a senior , it makes it that much more special . \u201d 6 . HBCU bands The 5th quarter \u201c We came for the football game but stayed for the band . \u201d As odd as that sentence may sound for a college football fan , it can sometimes be reality in the world of HBCU football . The 5th Quarter has become a must - see performance and a reason to stick around if a game is a blowout . It takes place after the games when the bands of the two opposing teams battle each other for bragging rights on who has the best musical performance . Between the choreographed routines and the song selection , a lot of practice and preparation are needed in the days leading up . 5 . James Madison Streamers Starting in 2004 , when the Dukes won their first FCS national title , throwing purple and gold streamers in the air after touchdowns is a prideful tradition for JMU fans . Originally , the streamers were thrown while the Dukes ran onto the field to encourage fans to be in their seats at kickoff . Phil Cockrell , who started the tradition , handed out 1,000 of them before the season opener . Now , the tradition has evolved to not only being thrown after every touchdown but even after graduation ceremonies instead of caps . The school also hands out streamers before every home game . 4 . North Dakota State Thunderstruck / Tunnel Walk The Fargodome press box has seated many national college football writers in recent years , from ESPN commentators to feature writers . All typically have the same kind of response on Twitter after seeing the Bison take the field : \u201c Of all the college football stadiums I 've been to , I 've never seen a spectacle quite like the NDSU football entrance . \u201d With the ability to shut off the lights completely , the Fargodome almost turns into an NBA arena . A video counting down from 60 seconds with highlights and AC / DC 's \u201c Thunderstruck \u201d playing appears on the video boards . As it hits zero , the video boards cut to a camera showing the outside of the Bison 's locker room . The doors burst open and the head coach leads the team through the tunnel and onto the field to the band playing and fireworks going off . This tradition started in 2003 in Craig Bohl 's first year as head coach when the Fargodome added video boards . Bohl previously coached at Nebraska , whose tunnel walk is well known . This sparked the idea of how NDSU 's intro is done . 3 . Penn A Toast to Dear Old Penn Between the third and fourth quarter of every home football game , the Penn band plays \u201c Drink a Highball \u201d with the last line saying \u201c Here 's a toast to dear old Penn . \u201d At that point , fans throw pieces of toast toward the field , although most land on the surrounding track . The tradition started in the 1970s when alcohol was banned at Franklin Field . The fans would drink when the fight song was played . After the alcohol ban , the Penn band decided to literally toast after the song by throwing slices onto the field . It has stuck ever since and is still done today . As far as the cleanup , Penn engineering students designed a toast-eating Zamboni-like machine to help . 2 . Montana No. 37 Montana is one of the most storied programs in the FCS and is home to an awesome tradition . All - conference , All -American , or broken records be damned , there is no greater honor for a football player than wearing the No. 37 . The Griz pass down the jersey number to a player born in Montana and who represents the team on and off the field . Once the current No. 37 graduates , he decides who gets the jersey next . The tradition started in 1983 and represents the Spirit of Montana \u2013 hard work , dedication to the team , and tough play on the gridiron . Jesse Sims was the last player to wear No. 37 in 2019 . Sims tragically passed away in an ATV accident in May this year . He was 24 . 1 . Cal Poly Mustang Memorial After a game in 1960 , a plane carrying the Cal Poly football team crashed due to weather conditions , an overweight aircraft , and partial loss of power in the left engine . Of the 48 people on board , 22 died , including 16 players , a student manager , a Cal Poly football booster , and the pilots . There is a memorial outside of Cal Poly 's stadium with 18 columns to honor the Cal Poly-affiliated individuals who died in the crash , each one the height of the person that died . The columns are in a circle that resembles a huddle and they have display plaques that tell the story of each person . Before the football team departs for away games , the team stops at the Mustang Memorial . And on official visits for recruits , the first place they start is at the memorial . For home games , after warm-ups and before the football team goes back to the locker room , the team meets at a rock next to the locker room because they cannot go outside the stadium to visit the memorial . The team says a quick prayer to remind them that they have the opportunity to play and coach the game they love and that they will play and coach for someone other than just themself . Throughout the week , former head coach Tim Walsh could be seen eating lunch by himself at the memorial . If anyone asked him what he was doing , he always responded with , \u201c I 'm eating lunch with some friends . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"the Victory Bell","span":[14731,14746],"token_span":[2874,2876],"role":"Sound_maker","label":"Sound_maker","role_definition":"The entity that produces the Noise, as a result of the action of the Agent."},{"text":"outside of the legendary Rose Hill Gym.","span":[14767,14805],"token_span":[2881,2887],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location at which the sound is produced."},{"text":"After football wins","span":[14887,14905],"token_span":[2904,2906],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the noise is produced."},{"text":"at the start of graduation ceremonies","span":[15106,15142],"token_span":[2949,2954],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the noise is produced."},{"text":"every senior","span":[14909,14920],"token_span":[2908,2909],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The individual that manipulates a Sound_maker so that it makes Noise."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"Since then the bell has been rung by senior football players directly after home wins or upon returning to campus following road victories .","annotations":[{"text":"by senior football players","span":[34,59],"token_span":[7,10],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The individual that manipulates a Sound_maker so that it makes Noise."},{"text":"the bell","span":[11,18],"token_span":[2,3],"role":"Sound_maker","label":"Sound_maker","role_definition":"The entity that produces the Noise, as a result of the action of the Agent."},{"text":"directly after home wins or upon returning to campus following road victories","span":[61,137],"token_span":[11,22],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the noise is produced."}],"trigger":{"text":"rung","start_char":29,"end_char":32,"start_token":6,"end_token":6,"frame":"Cause_to_make_noise"}},"source":{"text":"What makes college athletics so great are the traditions . From pregame rituals to rivalry games , from marching bands to student section chants , it 's a level of sports unrivaled in passion . The FCS is no different . Programs rich in history are proud of the traditions they 've established . HERO Sports asked around and also scoured the internet for some of the best in the FCS . What we found are traditions that range from new to old , from humorous and quirky to something that sends chills down your spine and puts a lump in your throat . Here are the best traditions in the FCS with a Top 10 ranking at the bottom : NOTE : This article was originally published in 2018 and has been re-published in 2021 after the link broke . Many of these traditions were submitted by fans , administration , or coaches . Because of that , there are sure to be some missing . If you feel one deserves to be mentioned , email sam.herder@herosports.com and we 'll consider adding it . New Hampshire The Cannon Man Dick Dewing , who graduated in 1953 and is a UNH football Hall of Famer , fired a Revolutionary War-era cannon at home games for years , and did so into the 2019 season at the age of 91 . Dressed in full regalia and with his full crew , a blank shot is fired from the cannon at the beginning of the game , after the marching band plays \u201c 1812 Overture \u201d and after every Wildcats touchdown . Dewing passed away in April 2021 , but the tradition will continue . Todd Walker Teammate Award UNH has another special tradition with the Todd Walker Teammate Award . Walker , a former receiver for the Wildcats , was shot and killed in 2011 when he stopped an attempted robbery and saved the life of a woman he was walking home . The award was created to honor his memory and recognize a player who displays the attributes of selflessness and dedication as the ideal teammate . Delaware Tubby Raymond 's Paintings Harold \u201c Tubby \u201d Raymond was a Delaware assistant coach beginning in 1954 and was the head coach from 1966-2001 , winning 300 games and three national championships . In the 1950s , Raymond began to do acrylic paintings of a senior member of the team each week during the season for most of his coaching career at Delaware . He continued to do the paintings all the way up to the 2017 season until he passed away in December . Raymond was 92 . \u201c These portraits were a treasure to all of us , \u201d Joe Purzycki , a 1969 captain , said . McNeese \u201c Jolie Blond \u201d After each touchdown , the band plays the Cajun National Anthem , Jolie Blonde . The entire stadium dances to it , swaying to the left and clapping twice , swaying right and clapping twice , and so on and so on . Firing the Cannon After the Cowboys score a touchdown , a cannon is fired by Cannon Krewe members , who dress in full costume attire . It 's a strong tradition not only for the football team but for Southwest Louisiana as a whole . The history of pirates , contraband , buccaneers , and cannon fire can be found on street names , at festivals , and within the deep treasuries of local family tales and stories . The Cannon Krewe consists of at least 10 - 12 members for every game . When the Cowboys win , the cannons are fired strategically right when the scoreboard hits zero . If the team loses , the cannons are discharged only after the band plays the McNeese Alma Mater . Kennesaw State Turnover Plank Several college football teams celebrate with some sort of prop after the defense forces a turnover . Kennesaw State has \u201c Plank , \u201d which went viral in its debut season in 2017 . Simply a piece of wood with a smiley face on it that was originally found in Florida on spring break , Plank is still a point of pride for the defense to hold up on the sidelines . Idaho American Flag Every time the Idaho football team runs onto the field , they make sure a player is carrying the American flag . This started under former head coach Robb Akey after he took a trip to Afghanistan . The Vandals still run out with the flag under current head coach Paul Petrino . Ring the Bell Idaho has another tradition inside the walls of its facilities and uses it as a rallying call with \u201c Ring the Bell . \u201d Every time the bell is rung in the weight room , it signifies a player has hit his personal best . The Serpentine Add another tradition for Idaho , one that the students love . On the night before the homecoming football game , students form a serpentine led by the marching band that snakes across campus and picks people up on the way to a bonfire and pep rally . Originally , freshmen were tasked with gathering materials for the fire . Now , it is constructed by the homecoming committee . The serpentine has been an annual event for more than 100 years . Montana State Gold Rush Game Montana State has one of the best home venues in FCS football . The Bobcats make it extra special during the first home game of the year with the Gold Rush Game . The fans all wear gold and the team wears its gold jerseys . If the first home game is also the season opener , it 's usually held on a Thursday night under the lights . Cat Prowl Another cool tradition for MSU is the Cat Prowl an hour before kickoff . Cheerleaders and the marching band lead the football team to the stadium through a tunnel of fans . Before entering the stadium , players touch a 9 - foot statute of Sonny Holland , known as the \u201c the greatest Bobcat of them all . \u201d The statue debuted in 2016 . Holland was a three - time All -American and also won 47 games in seven years as a head coach , winning the 1976 Division II national championship . And the big stat is going 10 - 1 against Montana . Colgate Cake Wednesday Former Raiders head coach Dick Biddle told his players , \u201c Do n't be cake eaters . \u201d In other words , \u201c do n't be soft . \u201d In 2012 , Biddle brought in an actual cake with frosting that said , \u201c Do n't be cake eaters . \u201d This took place on a Wednesday and the team won that Saturday . It 's now turned into a tradition with cake in the locker room after every Wednesday practice . Samford Charles Williams Memorial Jersey In 2003 , Samford defensive back Charles Williams was killed in a car accident . An extremely well - respected man by his teammates and coaches , it was decided that no player would wear his No. 5 during the 2003 and 2004 seasons . In 2005 , the first Charles Williams Memorial Jersey was awarded to a senior who had the same qualities as Williams : selflessness , perseverance , and determination . The jersey number has been given to a senior every season since . Jacksonville State \u201c I'll Fly Away \u201d This has been sung by the JSU Marching Southerners for decades . A few years ago , the football team began to join in on the tradition . After games , the Southerners gather , put their arms around each other and sing it with the fans and players . Chattanooga Singing the Alma Mater A lot of football teams sing the school 's alma mater after games with the band . But how Chattanooga began this tradition is a little more unique . In 2009 , UTC fans pointed out on the message boards that Wofford stopped in the middle of the field after the game to watch the band play the UTC alma mater while the Chattanooga players ran to the locker room . Bob Mulkey , an admin on the message boards , brought it up to then - head coach Russ Huesman as part of the \u201c question of the week . \u201d Huesman acknowledged it and since then the football team remains on the field during the alma mater and the words appear on the video boards . Northern Arizona , Northern Colorado , Western Carolina The Freshmen Run At the beginning of every season , the freshmen class runs across the football field from end zone to end zone . Known FCS schools to do this are Northern Arizona , Northern Colorado , and Western Carolina . ( James Madison also does this , but has another well - known tradition that will be on this list . ) WCU 's tradition had a special twist with beloved chancellor David Belcher leading the freshmen during his seven years at the school . Belcher , known as the biggest fan of every sport / athlete at WCU , passed away in 2018 after a year - long battle with cancer . Western Illinois Peach Blossoms \u201c ' Peach Blossoms ' is the informal name of WIU 's Veterans Club with the purpose to help student - veterans adjust to college life after their time in service . They are also a group of the most passionate Leatherneck fans out there . The Peach Blossoms , a moniker adopted in the 1960s , can be seen during home games , tailgating , and the annual parade wearing their red-dyed mop tops and purple T-shirts . Villanova Tap the Rock The \u201c Tap the Rock \u201d mantra dates back to the 2009 national championship Villanova team . Team Chaplin , Father Rob Hagen , shared the Stonecutter Parable which describes a person wanting to break down a stone using only small chipping tools . The cutter goes on for a long time tapping the stone , eventually getting the stone to crack and fall apart . The message from the story is not reaching the goal . It 's realizing that , while the final tap of the rock was the one that broke it , it was all the taps leading up to it that played a key role . The message stuck and was engraved on the national title rings . Now , the football team still uses the saying and taps a rock as a reminder that the final play did n't win the game , but it was everything that added up to that final play . South Dakota Dakota Days ( D- Days ) The first Dakota Day was held in 1914 . Also known as D-Days , it 's a prideful week where the alumni return and the current students get to know more about the past traditions of the university . The weeklong celebration culminates with a parade Saturday before the football game . Of course , the students also use it as an excuse to do what college students typically do on a Saturday night . That side of D-Days can be found here : South Dakota State Hobo Day Another Homecoming celebration for a South Dakota school . The first official Hobo Day at SDSU took place in 1912 . It originally began as a \u201c nightshirt parade \u201d in 1907 where students prepared torches after a bonfire and marched through Main Street dressed in nightshirts and bedsheets .

Princeton The Bonfire If the ceremonial bonfire takes place , that means it was a special season for the Princeton football team .

Sochor 's core rule was that a player 's helmet was to never hit the ground .

Cal Poly Mustang Memorial After a game in 1960 , a plane carrying the Cal Poly football team crashed due to weather conditions , an overweight aircraft , and partial loss of power in the left engine . Of the 48 people on board , 22 died , including 16 players , a student manager , a Cal Poly football booster , and the pilots . There is a memorial outside of Cal Poly 's stadium with 18 columns to honor the Cal Poly-affiliated individuals who died in the crash , each one the height of the person that died . The columns are in a circle that resembles a huddle and they have display plaques that tell the story of each person . Before the football team departs for away games , the team stops at the Mustang Memorial . And on official visits for recruits , the first place they start is at the memorial . For home games , after warm-ups and before the football team goes back to the locker room , the team meets at a rock next to the locker room because they cannot go outside the stadium to visit the memorial . The team says a quick prayer to remind them that they have the opportunity to play and coach the game they love and that they will play and coach for someone other than just themself . Throughout the week , former head coach Tim Walsh could be seen eating lunch by himself at the memorial . If anyone asked him what he was doing , he always responded with , \u201c I 'm eating lunch with some friends . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"every senior","span":[14909,14920],"token_span":[2908,2909],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The individual that manipulates a Sound_maker so that it makes Noise."},{"text":"the Victory Bell","span":[14731,14746],"token_span":[2874,2876],"role":"Sound_maker","label":"Sound_maker","role_definition":"The entity that produces the Noise, as a result of the action of the Agent."},{"text":"After football wins","span":[14887,14905],"token_span":[2904,2906],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the noise is produced."},{"text":"at the start of graduation ceremonies","span":[15106,15142],"token_span":[2949,2954],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the noise is produced."},{"text":"outside of the legendary Rose Hill Gym.","span":[14767,14805],"token_span":[2881,2887],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location at which the sound is produced."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-3125-175-frame-Cause_to_make_progress","frame":"Cause_to_make_progress","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Agent works on a Project so that it reaches a more advanced and desirable state.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Awards , recognition and rankings In September 2013 , Harrison High School was recognized by the United States Department of Education as an Exemplary Improving School , as part of the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program .

He played a crucial role in exploring the creative possibilities of new console technology by working on some of the most innovative titles of the 1990s . After contributing to early installments of Wizardry and Phantasy Star , Ohshima created the iconic character designs for Sonic the Hedgehog . The blue mascot 's success paved the way for Ohshima 's directing turn on Sonic CD , a game brimming over with fresh ideas that few had an opportunity to experience due to the Sega CD 's unpopularity . His next major project , Nights Into Dreams for the Sega Saturn , was an audacious and beautiful attempt to claim the high ground during the early days of 3D console gaming . He followed Nights with Burning Rangers , another game for the ill-fated Saturn that was radically different from its violence - oriented 3D contemporaries . As the 90s came to an end he weathered the shifting fortunes of Sega by forming Artoon , developers of Blinx : The Time Sweeper , Blue Dragon , and Yoshi 's Island DS , and now heads the sometimes brilliant , occasionally aggravating , always interesting Cavia -- recently responsible for Capcom 's Resident Evil : Darkside Chronicles , and currently working on Square Enix 's upcoming Nier . You recently became the CEO of Cavia , moving over from Artoon -- or is it more complex than that ? Naoto Ohshima : Well , the head of the company here quit because of ... family issues . ( laughs ) Since they then lacked a president , I sort of wound up taking over that role , since we 're all technically part of the same outfit . ( Ed. note : Artoon , Cavia , and Feelplus are all under AQ Interactive . ) I do like a lot of Cavia 's games . Though they often seem unpolished -- the games seem to get \" almost there , \" do you know what I mean ? Bullet Witch and Ghost In The Shell : Stand Alone Complex both have something to them , but these certainly do n't feel like Ohshima -style games . NO : Well , certainly , I do a lot of management - type work these days . I definitely want to make something again ! I really do . Your first major console game with Artoon was Blinx . You might say it was ahead of its time ... games like Prince of Persia used a time mechanic long afterward and saw great success with it . Where did that idea come from ? NO : It was purely a product of the hard drive included with every Xbox -- the original one , not the 360 . We wanted to build a console game from the ground up that used the drive effectively . That 's where the play mechanic came from ? NO : That 's right . There would n't be any other way to do it . The PS2 would n't have been able to do it . Do you think it would be possible to make another mascot-style platforming game in the current era ? NO : Ah , well , I 'm making a game like that right now . ( laughs ) I ca n't quite talk about that yet , though . In more general terms , the game needs to be something that anyone is able to play , and it needs to have one thing or element that is brand new , that has n't been done before . Nights Into Dreams Nights Into Dreams on the Saturn was the first really 3D game I played , long ago . As the Nights character you had a certain path you followed in 2D , but if you went back to human form , you could walk around anywhere you liked . I found a lot of things that way that I could n't see as Nights , and it was a sort of turning point for me ; it felt like a real - life world to me , making these discoveries . You do n't get that pure feeling of discovery much in games anymore . Was that something you were purposefully aiming for with Nights ? NO : Well , with people my age , we did n't really have video games as children . When we came up with concepts for games , we could n't say \" It 's some of this game and some of that other game . \" As a result , especially around that era , you had a lot of games that did not become truly evaluated by the public until long after their release . There just were n't a lot of 3D games back then . Of course , with Nights , if you keep going and going along the ground you eventually run into an invisible wall , so ... we had to think about ways to keep players from going that far off ; that 's where the Alarm Egg came from ( Ed. note : a wandering alarm clock that follows the human player and wakes them from the dreamland , thereby ending the level ) . BS : What made you want to put features like that into the non- Nights section of the game ? NO : Well , the original inspiration for the game was to create a Peter Pan-like character . Nights and Peter Pan share that character trait ; they 're both capable of things that regular people can only do in their dreams . So I wanted two games here , in a way ; one where you were human , and one where you combined with Nights to accomplish extraordinary things . Nobody had really played a full - on , free -running 3D game at that time , so we were concerned that people would have trouble comprehending the game if it gave you complete control freedom . As a result , as a human , you have freedom , but only in a small , confined space . Combine with Nights , and the game switches to a side - scrolling type , as gamers would 've been readily familiar with at that time . In a way , having a vulnerable human character able to do things Nights could n't is somewhat empowering to the player . NO : I agree . Christmas Nights was also ahead of its time -- the idea that you could unlock extra stuff depending on what the date is . Those sorts of games are still rare to see . NO : Indeed . That game is mostly the same as Nights , but it was very literally a Christmas present for our audience , a sort of thank - you from Sega to its fans . That was the concept . I was an enormous fan of Sega , around the Saturn and Mega Drive / Genesis eras , and that certainly calls to mind the Sega of old . What struck me about Christmas Nights was that there was a lot of stuff in there , altered graphics and such , that would only be playable for two days ' time . NO : We had the idea to have Spring Nights , Summer Nights , and so forth , reflecting all of the seasons . It really was n't a technological challenge , as the textures do n't really change much . It did n't take a lot of time , and I think its mission of drumming up interest and excitement among our fans was pretty well met . What did you think of the new Nights ? NO : The Wii one ? That project was led by [ Takashi ] Iizuka , who was the lead designer on the original Nights . He really loves that character , and I 'm sure that he was able to create the Nights that he wanted to create . It did n't feel the same to me . NO : It was , perhaps , more Americanized than before . The original Nights was chiefly made with the Japanese and European audiences in mind -- Sonic , meanwhile , was squarely aimed at the U.S. market . In what way did you position Sonic for the U.S. market ? NO : Well , he 's a character that I think is suited to America -- or , at least , the image I had of America at the time . Nights is a more delicate ... well , his gender is deliberately ambiguous , for one . It 's a cliched question , but was that why Sonic 's main colors are red , white and blue ? NO : ( laughs ) Well , he 's blue because that 's Sega 's more - or - less official company color . His shoes were inspired by the cover to Michael Jackson 's Bad , which contrasted heavily between white and red -- that Santa Claus - type color . I also thought that red went well for a character who can run really fast , when his legs are spinning . Sonic CD You were also the director of Sonic CD -- another game that had time travel as a play mechanic . Have you liked that mechanic for a while ? NO : Well , I wanted a Sonic where the levels changed on you -- where Sonic would go really fast , like in Back to the Future , and bang , wind up in a different place . Why do you think you 've been involved with a lot of games with time elements to them ? NO : I had n't realized that , actually . ( laughs ) There must be a part of me that likes that sort of thing , the time . Sonic CD really felt great in action . It does n't have the full - on speed of Sonic 2 , but the world feels really alive in the game , much in the same that it did for me in Nights -- that feeling that the game world would still be alive even if I were n't exploring it . Was that your intention ? NO : Sonic CD was made in Japan , while Sonic 2 was made by ( Yuji ) Naka 's team over in the U.S. We exchanged information , of course , talking about the sort of game design each of us was aiming for . But Sonic CD was n't Sonic 2 ; it was really meant to be more of a CD version of the original Sonic . I ca n't help but wonder , therefore , if we had more fun making CD than they did making Sonic 2 [ because we did n't have the pressure of making a \" numbered sequel \" ] . What I really wanted to do was just have this sonic boom , with a flash , and have the level change on you instantly . We just could n't manage it on the hardware , though , so instead there 's that sequence that plays while it 's loading . ( laughs ) I kept fighting and fighting with the programmers , but they said it just was n't possible . I bet they probably could have done it . NO : I know ! ( laughs ) If Naka was doing the programming , I think it could 've been done . Do you know why Naka left Sega ? NO : No , actually . The way he put it , he was too far up -- he was doing nothing but management and could n't do any design or programming work on games . He could n't even influence Sonic anymore . I thought that was admirable that he went on to try to do creative work again . NO : Indeed . In fact , it was really the same deal with me and Artoon . Now , though , the group as a whole has gotten really big -- it 's sort of a mini-Sega . So will you be making your type of game in the future , then , or are you going to be making more darker - styled games , as Artoon and Cavia have been moving toward ? NO : Well , the important thing is to make gamers happy -- the users playing your game . When you make something that 's truly new -- well , it 's not that you have to with every project , but when you do , you 're expanding the world of games . That 's what I want to do ; I want to keep on doing new things , and I think that 's possible with Artoon , Cavia , and Feelplus . The way I see it , if the director makes the sort of games he wants to make , then the end results are going to be more interesting . The gamers are important , of course , but if you make a game for yourself , that adds character to the result . NO : Well , for example none of my favorite movies were really hits . ( laughs ) Myself and the gaming audience , we 're different . I like new things , but if something is too new , then gamers wo n't be able to comprehend it . So you have to think about your audience at least a little bit , or else you 'll make something that runs the risk of being incomprehensible . That 's why I want to keep them in mind . Certainly that 's true , but sometimes you see indie films become hits , too . Taking that risk is important , I think . NO : Yeah , but the sort of indies that become hits are those that are easy to follow for anyone who watches them . So , in the end , you want to make it just a little new -- not completely so . Echochrome With games , though , you have download platforms that can support titles like Echocrome ( the PSP version of which Artoon worked on ) . Games like that , they do n't have to be massive hits . NO : Sure . Echochrome does n't have very fancy graphics at all , but play it , and it 's really fun . It really depends on the game . What made you decide to move into that darker territory with Vampire Rain and Artoon ? NO : Games are a part of the overall realm of entertainment , including movies and music and so on . I think that movies play a sort of big - brother role for the game industry . The Japanese film industry has been around for ages , but once films from other countries began to see wide distribution here , Hollywood films very quickly became the most popular . Within that environment , Japanese animation has managed to attract worldwide praise , which is great . But we 're seeing a sort of Hollywood - ization of the game industry right now , and Japan 's traditional strengths in cartoon - style games are going by the wayside . So in thinking about the future , I realized I wanted to do both \" real \" and \" cartoon \" games . Now , Vampire Rain got a negative reception from a lot of its players , and we regret a lot of things with that game , so in the future we definitely want to make games that excite people a great deal more . You could say that Silent Hill has succeeded at that in the past , showing an auteurism without being Hollywoodized -- opening up to the world on its own terms . Those cartoony games do not sell well in Japan any longer , either -- it seems like platformers like Sonic and Mario are the only ones that do . Why do you think that is ? NO : Because they 're all the same . The art and the storylines may be different , but the gameplay is the same . Lately I 've been thinking about how to modernize games like those . I think the first hour or so of Uncharted is close . You do n't have a gun or anything -- you 're just jumping around and searching for treasure in this gorgeous environment . I thought that was really fun , until it got to the shooting bits , but I 'm not sure if such a game would sell well . NO : I do have an interest in that sort of thing as well , but I think games that have more of an original idea to them come first in my mind .

What struck me about Christmas Nights was that there was a lot of stuff in there , altered graphics and such , that would only be playable for two days ' time . NO : We had the idea to have Spring Nights , Summer Nights , and so forth , reflecting all of the seasons . It really was n't a technological challenge , as the textures do n't really change much . It did n't take a lot of time , and I think its mission of drumming up interest and excitement among our fans was pretty well met . What did you think of the new Nights ? NO : The Wii one ? That project was led by [ Takashi ] Iizuka , who was the lead designer on the original Nights . He really loves that character , and I 'm sure that he was able to create the Nights that he wanted to create . It did n't feel the same to me . NO : It was , perhaps , more Americanized than before . The original Nights was chiefly made with the Japanese and European audiences in mind -- Sonic , meanwhile , was squarely aimed at the U.S. market . In what way did you position Sonic for the U.S. market ? NO : Well , he 's a character that I think is suited to America -- or , at least , the image I had of America at the time . Nights is a more delicate ... well , his gender is deliberately ambiguous , for one . It 's a cliched question , but was that why Sonic 's main colors are red , white and blue ? NO : ( laughs ) Well , he 's blue because that 's Sega 's more - or - less official company color . His shoes were inspired by the cover to Michael Jackson 's Bad , which contrasted heavily between white and red -- that Santa Claus - type color . I also thought that red went well for a character who can run really fast , when his legs are spinning . Sonic CD You were also the director of Sonic CD -- another game that had time travel as a play mechanic . Have you liked that mechanic for a while ? NO : Well , I wanted a Sonic where the levels changed on you -- where Sonic would go really fast , like in Back to the Future , and bang , wind up in a different place . Why do you think you 've been involved with a lot of games with time elements to them ? NO : I had n't realized that , actually . ( laughs ) There must be a part of me that likes that sort of thing , the time . Sonic CD really felt great in action . It does n't have the full - on speed of Sonic 2 , but the world feels really alive in the game , much in the same that it did for me in Nights -- that feeling that the game world would still be alive even if I were n't exploring it . Was that your intention ? NO : Sonic CD was made in Japan , while Sonic 2 was made by ( Yuji ) Naka 's team over in the U.S. We exchanged information , of course , talking about the sort of game design each of us was aiming for . But Sonic CD was n't Sonic 2 ; it was really meant to be more of a CD version of the original Sonic . I ca n't help but wonder , therefore , if we had more fun making CD than they did making Sonic 2 [ because we did n't have the pressure of making a \" numbered sequel \" ] . What I really wanted to do was just have this sonic boom , with a flash , and have the level change on you instantly . We just could n't manage it on the hardware , though , so instead there 's that sequence that plays while it 's loading . ( laughs ) I kept fighting and fighting with the programmers , but they said it just was n't possible . I bet they probably could have done it . NO : I know ! ( laughs ) If Naka was doing the programming , I think it could 've been done . Do you know why Naka left Sega ? NO : No , actually . The way he put it , he was too far up -- he was doing nothing but management and could n't do any design or programming work on games . He could n't even influence Sonic anymore . I thought that was admirable that he went on to try to do creative work again . NO : Indeed . In fact , it was really the same deal with me and Artoon . Now , though , the group as a whole has gotten really big -- it 's sort of a mini-Sega . So will you be making your type of game in the future , then , or are you going to be making more darker - styled games , as Artoon and Cavia have been moving toward ? NO : Well , the important thing is to make gamers happy -- the users playing your game . When you make something that 's truly new -- well , it 's not that you have to with every project , but when you do , you 're expanding the world of games . That 's what I want to do ; I want to keep on doing new things , and I think that 's possible with Artoon , Cavia , and Feelplus . The way I see it , if the director makes the sort of games he wants to make , then the end results are going to be more interesting . The gamers are important , of course , but if you make a game for yourself , that adds character to the result . NO : Well , for example none of my favorite movies were really hits . ( laughs ) Myself and the gaming audience , we 're different . I like new things , but if something is too new , then gamers wo n't be able to comprehend it . So you have to think about your audience at least a little bit , or else you 'll make something that runs the risk of being incomprehensible . That 's why I want to keep them in mind . Certainly that 's true , but sometimes you see indie films become hits , too . Taking that risk is important , I think . NO : Yeah , but the sort of indies that become hits are those that are easy to follow for anyone who watches them . So , in the end , you want to make it just a little new -- not completely so . Echochrome With games , though , you have download platforms that can support titles like Echocrome ( the PSP version of which Artoon worked on ) . Games like that , they do n't have to be massive hits . NO : Sure . Echochrome does n't have very fancy graphics at all , but play it , and it 's really fun . It really depends on the game . What made you decide to move into that darker territory with Vampire Rain and Artoon ? NO : Games are a part of the overall realm of entertainment , including movies and music and so on . I think that movies play a sort of big - brother role for the game industry . The Japanese film industry has been around for ages , but once films from other countries began to see wide distribution here , Hollywood films very quickly became the most popular . Within that environment , Japanese animation has managed to attract worldwide praise , which is great . But we 're seeing a sort of Hollywood - ization of the game industry right now , and Japan 's traditional strengths in cartoon - style games are going by the wayside . So in thinking about the future , I realized I wanted to do both \" real \" and \" cartoon \" games . Now , Vampire Rain got a negative reception from a lot of its players , and we regret a lot of things with that game , so in the future we definitely want to make games that excite people a great deal more . You could say that Silent Hill has succeeded at that in the past , showing an auteurism without being Hollywoodized -- opening up to the world on its own terms . Those cartoony games do not sell well in Japan any longer , either -- it seems like platformers like Sonic and Mario are the only ones that do . Why do you think that is ? NO : Because they 're all the same . The art and the storylines may be different , but the gameplay is the same . Lately I 've been thinking about how to modernize games like those . I think the first hour or so of Uncharted is close . You do n't have a gun or anything -- you 're just jumping around and searching for treasure in this gorgeous environment . I thought that was really fun , until it got to the shooting bits , but I 'm not sure if such a game would sell well . NO : I do have an interest in that sort of thing as well , but I think games that have more of an original idea to them come first in my mind .

A number of distinguished speakers will present their latest GPCR research at the GPCR Colloquium at the \u201c American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics \u201d meeting . In the phenomenon of biased agonism in GPCRs , a biased ligand activates one signaling pathway without activating another . \u201c Biased agonism represented a paradigm shift , \u201d says Robert Lefkowitz , M.D. , professor of chemistry at Duke University and winner of the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with his colleague and former post-doc Brian Kobilka of Stanford University for their seminal work on 7 - transmembrane domain GPCRs . \u201c Much to our total surprise , we realized that an agonist could stimulate one pathway \u2014 G proteins or the arrestins \u2014 without stimulating the other .

He will discuss how Trevena is using receptor bias for clinical development of pain therapeutics . They are focused on using biased ligands to separate \u201c on-target adverse effects , \u201d or adverse effects presumed inseparable from a drug 's pharmacology , from the drug 's intended therapeutic effects . For example , Trevena recently discovered an analgesic drug targeting the mu-opioid receptor whose signaling mechanism partly resembles that of morphine , yet differs in that it does not engage beta-arrestins \u2014 and therapeutically shows reduced adverse effects of respiratory suppression and opioid-induced constipation . \u201c We are engaging the very well precedented and very valuable analgesia of this target , but hopefully in a safer and more tolerable fashion , by more precisely tuning in the kinds of intracellular signals that we desire , \u201d says Dr. Violin . He notes the value of beginning with known targets and signaling mechanisms , and then working to understand the mechanisms of biased ligands of these targets . \u201c What we think is happening with biased ligands is that we are stabilizing a subset of conformations associated with the active pharmacological entity or entities , \u201d he says . In other words , a biased ligand activates only a subset of the different signaling pathways and in vivo pharmacological responses that they normally observe with the full agonist . \u201c To us , that 's part of the value in our approach , \u201d he says , \u201c that we can take targets for which we know a lot about their clinical benefits or clinical risks , and dissect those so that we do n't have to lay out completely new biological pathways . \u201d \u201c We 're interested in studying new , functionally selective molecules that will activate G protein pathways selectively , or activate the beta-arrestin pathways selectively , \u201d says Jeff Aub\u00e9 , Ph.D. , professor and chemist at the University of Kansas . His work is motivated by the need to grow the toolbox of biased ligands . \u201c We 've sought to expand the scope of available compounds for study in this field by using different approaches , including screening and de novo design , \u201d he says . \u201c We have identified preliminary examples of five new , entirely different chemical classes with a range of potencies , and qualitatively different pharmacologies . \u201d Dr. Aub\u00e9 hopes that expanding the toolkit of biased ligands will help other researchers in the field . \u201c There are a lot of people who are interested in indications like addiction , who would be interested in , say , a potent partial agonist , \u201d he says . \u201c But that 's not really available right now . \u201d GPCRs in Therapeutics \u201c It is increasingly obvious that taking advantage of ligand - biased signaling will provide for some GPCR targets a way to modulate therapeutically relevant pathways while potentially avoiding unwanted physiology , \u201d says Christian Felder , Ph.D. , a research fellow in psychiatric disorders at Eli Lilly . \u201c Allosteric regulation of GPCRs has taken the science to a new level of possibilities , although with inherently increased complexity in execution . \u201d He stresses the need for more effective pharmacological tools , which will entail further work on GPCR crystal structures , in silico molecular dynamic simulations , and translational bioassay development . \u201c Without good ligand tools , research challenges such as deorphanizing of new GPCR targets and deconvoluting disease etiology become even bigger . \u201d Dr. Felder also believes that GPCR drug discovery will continue to benefit from partnerships among academia , government , and industry . \u201c A deeper understanding of structure , function , and physiology can only happen when we bring together the various disciplines of chemical , physical , and biological sciences to embrace the obvious complexity of how GPCRs regulate complex pathways and circuits , \u201d says Dr. Felder . \u201c Recent advances in active - state GPCR crystallography and in silico molecular dynamics are informing ligand - receptor interactions in much more detail , \u201d resulting in more efficient drug design . Int vitro models , such as inducible pluripotent stem cells , can give relevant information in a disease context , which can in turn \u201c inform translational animal models that may more directly mimic human disease etiology , \u201d says Dr. Felder . Heptares Therapeutics takes another angle on therapeutics , developing drugs to GPCR targets to which previous attempts have been unsuccessful , yet for which there is strong evidence for disease involvement . \u201c There remain a large number of GPCRs with a high level of clinical validation in disease that have not been drugged by small molecules , \u201d says the firm 's CSO , Fiona Marshall , Ph.D. \u201c For example , GLP1 is an important target in diabetes . However , only injectable peptides have been discovered for this receptor so far . \u201d Heptares uses a structure - based drug design platform called StaR , which engineers GPCRs to increase their thermostability \u2014 the result being that they can be purified from cell membranes . This lets them take advantage of drug discovery methods commonly used for soluble proteins , but normally impossible with membrane proteins , such as x-ray crystallography . \u201c Sta Rs are locked in specific chosen conformational states , such as agonist or antagonist , \u201d says Dr. Marshall , \u201c and can be used to define the pharmacology of compounds by measuring the relative binding to different conformations \u2014 a process known as ' reverse pharmacology ' . \u201d Heptares uses x-ray structures to look at receptor binding sites and protein-ligand interactions . They utilize the atomic resolution of x-ray structures to find small but significant differences between ligand binding sites of GPCRs in activated and inactive states , and then use the protein structure for the form of their chosen target for drug discovery . In her presentation , Dr. Marshall will discuss Heptares ' identification of drug candidates , including \u201c the identification of highly selective muscarinic agonists for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease , and the identification of orexin antagonists for sleep disorders and addiction , \u201d she says . \u201c I will also be giving a first look at the first Family B GPCR structure that has been solved . \u201d GPCR Trafficking Looking at therapeutic opportunities of GPCRs from another angle is the lab of Mark von Zastrow , M.D. , Ph.D. , professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at UCSF . Traditionally , GPCR trafficking can determine in part whether a signaling response is sustained or downregulated , and it occurs over a longer period of hours or more . But Dr. von Zastrow is looking at GPCR trafficking events that occur seconds to minutes after ligand application \u2014 an acute trafficking response that occurs much faster than previously thought . \u201c Such effects are much less well understood , \u201d he says . \u201c GPCR trafficking mechanisms offer , in principle , a wide range of new biochemical targets for therapeutic manipulation . To my knowledge , the in vivo potential of such targets remains a little - explored area . \u201d Dr. von Zastrow will discuss results on mechanisms of GPCR localization , trafficking , and signaling from both biochemical and optimal imaging techniques , and will focus on recent progress toward developing new therapeutics . \u201c We are particularly interested in processes that affect neural and cardiovascular function , \u201d he says . \u201c An over - arching challenge is to link mechanistic understanding , elucidated largely in vitro or using reduced cell culture preparations , to in vivo effects as they occur in relevant tissues . \u201d The field is accumulating evidence for independent mechanisms of GPCR trafficking and GPCR signaling , according to Dr. von Zastrow . \u201c The idea that drugs can selectively influence one of these was considered highly controversial even five years ago , \u201d he says . \u201c However , little is known about the consequences of such selective ligand effects in vivo , or their potential therapeutic significance .

Continuing Education Activity Uterine atony is a principal cause of postpartum hemorrhage , an obstetric emergency . Globally , it is one of the top 5 causes of maternal mortality . Uterine atony refers to the inadequate contraction of the corpus uteri myometrial cells in response to endogenous oxytocin release . Postpartum hemorrhage can occur because spiral arteries are uniquely devoid of musculature and dependent on uterine contractions to mechanically squeeze them into hemostasis . After delivery , in the absence of uterine contraction , spiral arteries may continue to bleed , resulting in postpartum hemorrhage . This activity reviews the evaluation and management of uterine atony and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well - coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients . Objectives : - Explain how to detect uterine atony . - Explain the risks associated with uterine atony . - Describe how to manage uterine atony . - Explain the importance of improving care coordination , with particular emphasis on communication between interprofessional medical teams , to enhance to prevent hemorrhage in patients with uterine atony . Introduction Uterine atony refers to the corpus uteri myometrial cells inadequate contraction in response to endogenous oxytocin that is released in the course of delivery . It leads to postpartum hemorrhage as delivery of the placenta leaves disrupted spiral arteries which are uniquely void of musculature and dependent on contractions to mechanically squeeze them into a hemostatic state . Uterine atony is a principal cause of postpartum hemorrhage , an obstetric emergency . Globally , this is one of the top 5 causes of maternal mortality . [ 1 ] Etiology Risk factors for uterine atony include prolonged labor , precipitous labor , uterine distension ( multi-fetal gestation , polyhydramnios , fetal macrosomia ) , fibroid uterus , chorioamnionitis , indicated magnesium sulfate infusions , and prolonged use of oxytocin . Ineffective uterine contraction , either focally or diffusely , is additionally associated with a diverse range of etiologies including retained placental tissue , placental disorders ( such as morbidly adherent placenta , placenta previa , and abruption placentae ) , coagulopathy ( increased fibrin degradation products ) and uterine inversion . Body mass index ( BMI ) above 40 ( class III obesity ) is also a recognized risk factor for postpartum uterine atony . [ 2 ] Epidemiology The absence of effective contraction of the uterus after delivery complicates 1 in 40 births in the United States and is responsible for at least 75 % of cases of postpartum hemorrhage . [ 3 ] Pathophysiology Contraction of the myometrium that mechanically compresses the blood vessels supplying the placental bed provides the principal mechanism uterine hemostasis after delivery of the fetus , and the placenta is concluded . The process is complemented by local decidual hemostatic factors such as tissue factor type -1 plasminogen activator inhibitor as well as by systemic coagulation factors such as platelets , circulating clotting factors . History and Physical At prenatal history and examination , risk factor discernment is key to optimal risk management . Identification of risks allows for planning and availability of resources that might be needed including personnel , medication , equipment , adequate intravenous access , and blood products . The American College of Obstetricians recommends that women be identified prenatally as high risk for postpartum hemorrhage based on the presence of placenta accreta spectrum , pre-pregnancy BMI greater than 50 , clinically significant bleeding disorder , or other surgical - medical high - risk factors . Part of the planning should be to develop a plan that allows delivery at a facility with an appropriate level of care for these patients ' needs . The diagnosis is made during the physical exam immediately upon conclusion of an obstetric vaginal or cesarean delivery . Direct palpation at cesarean delivery ( typically after the closure of the uterine incision ) or indirect examination at bimanual examination after a vaginal delivery reveals a boggy , soft , and an unusually enlarged uterus , typically with co-existent bleeding from the cervical os ( harder to appreciate at cesarean deliveries ) . An expeditious exclusion of retained gestational products or obstetric lacerations quickly excludes additional co-concomitant etiologies . The possibility of coagulopathies is considered and pursued if clinically indicated . The physical examination suggested above may involve obstetric ultrasound imaging . Evaluation Diagnosis of diffuse uterine atony is prompted typically by finding of more than usual blood loss during examination demonstrating a flaccid and enlarged uterus , which may contain a significant amount of blood . With focal localized atony , the fundal region may be well contracted while the lower uterine segment is dilated and atonic , which may difficult to appreciate on abdominal examination , but may be detected on vaginal examination . A digital exploration of the uterine cavity ( if adequate anesthesia is available ) , or bedside obstetric ultrasound imaging to reveal an echogenic endometrial stripe is an essential examination , as is a timely examination with adequate lighting to exclude an obstetric laceration . Treatment / Management Prenatal Readiness If the woman is at a medium risk for intrapartum , blood should include be typed and screened . Women with a medium risk factor for uterine atony - related postpartum hemorrhage include prior uterine surgery , multiple gestation , grand multiparity , prior PPH , large fibroids , macrosomia , body mass index greater than 40 , anemia , chorioamnionitis , prolonged second stage , oxytocin longer than 24 hours , and magnesium sulfate administration . Those assessed to be high risk should be typed and cross - matched for those at high risk of PPH . High -risk criteria include placental previa or accreta , bleeding diathesis , 2 or more medium risk factors for uterine atony . Use of a cell saver ( blood salvage ) should be considered for women at increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage , but this is not cost-effective to be routine . Intrapartum Prevention This includes optimal management of the third stage of labor . Active management of the third stage includes uterine massage with concomitant sustained low-level traction on the umbilical cord . Simultaneous oxytocin infusion is helpful , although it is reasonable to defer it to after delivery of the placenta . Initial Medical Treatment If uterine atony occurs , healthcare providers should be ready for initial medical management which is directed to the use of medications to improve tone and induce uterine contractions . Massaging the uterus is also effective , as is ensuring an empty cavity . Maternal support with intravenous ( IV ) fluids is commenced through preferably an u8 - gauge , intravenous catheter . A team approach is initiated with the summoning of the needed personnel through a standardized built - in alert system . Medications used for postpartum hemorrhage secondary to Uterine atony include the following : - Oxytocin ( Pitocin ) can be given IV 10 to 40 units per 1000 ml or 10 units intramuscularly ( IM ) . The rapid undiluted infusion may cause hypotension . - Methylergonovine ( Methergine ) given IM 0.2 mg. Given every 2 to 4 hours . Should be avoided in patients with hypertension . - 15 - methyl-PGF2 -alpha ( Hemabate ) given IM 0.25 mg . Given every 15 to 90 minutes for a maximum of 8 doses . Should be avoided in asthmatics . May cause diarrhea , fevers , or tachycardia . It is expensive . - Misoprostol ( Cytotec ) : 800 to 1000 mg placed rectally . May cause a low-grade fever . It has a delayed action . - Dinoprostone ( Prostin E2 ) 20 mg vaginal or rectal suppository may be given every 2 hours . Surgical Treatment Should the medications fail with persisting excess bleeding , then surgical management is engaged . [ 4 ] Tamponade Techniques - Uterine packing with gauze ( with vaginal packing to ensure its retention , thus a uterovaginal packing ) with Foley catheter insertion to allow bladder drainage . The uterine packing should be tight and uniform , and it is a quickly and efficiently achieved with rolled gauze ribbons . - Bakri balloon ( with vaginal packing to ensure its retention ) with Foley catheter insertion to facilitate bladder drainage . Surgical Management Techniques - Uterine curettage for retained products - Uterine artery ligation ( O' Leary ) , with an option to for extending arterial ligation to tubo-ovarian vessels . - Compression sutures such as the B-Lynch are typically reserved for clinical scenarios where bimanual compression of the uterus leads to arrest in bleeding . - Hypogastric artery ligation ( performed by Gyn / Onc ) - Hysterectomy Differential Diagnosis The typical physical findings elude detection in the presence of uterine eversion when the endometrial surface everts into the vagina and allowed by uterine atony . This typically occurs after a vaginal delivery , and the usual findings of an enlarged boggy uterus are unavailable and replaced by findings of an intra-vaginal mass that is cherry colored ( endometrium ) and should be immediately replaced back into the uterine cavity , after which restoration of uterine tone prevents its recurrence . Prognosis Women with a prior PPH have as much as a 15 % risk of recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy . The risk of recurrence depends , in part , on the underlying cause and associations such as class 3 obesity may have a higher recurrence risk . Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care Postpartum anemia is common after an episode of uterine atony and postpartum hemorrhage . Severe anemia due to PPH may require red cell transfusions , depending on the severity of anemia and the degree of symptomatology attributable to anemia . A common practice is to offer a transfusion to symptomatic women with a hemoglobin value less than 7 g/dL . In most cases of uterine atony - related postpartum hemorrhage , the amount of iron lost is not fully replaced by the transfused blood . Oral iron should thus be also considered . Parenteral iron therapy is an option as it accelerated recovery . Most women with mild to moderate anemia , however , resolve the anemia sufficiently rapidly with oral iron alone and do not need parenteral iron . Pearls and Other Issues In recognition that the majority of the cases of postpartum hemorrhage are due to uterine atony , implementation of a systemic approach in birthing units is advocated by all leading professional bodies . Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The Joint Commission recommends that obstetrical staff undergo interprofessional team training to teach staff to work together and communicate more effectively when postpartum hemorrhage ( most due to uterine atony ) occurs . The Commission is in favor of clinical drills to help staff prepare for the clinical event , as well as conducting debriefings after such events to evaluate team performance and identify areas for improvement . Simulation team training can help to identify areas that need strengthening , and regular , unannounced , simulated , postpartum hemorrhage scenarios in real - life settings , such as the labor and delivery units or post-anesthesia care units , may also increase comfort with the protocols and teamwork required in such emergencies . Such a systemic approach creates a positive trajectory toward improved obstetric outcomes and is also endorsed by the Association of Women 's Health , Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses ( AWHONN ) . An interprofessional team approach will provide the best patient outcomes . [ Level V ] References - 1 . - American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists .

Continuing Education Activity Uterine atony is a principal cause of postpartum hemorrhage , an obstetric emergency . Globally , it is one of the top 5 causes of maternal mortality . Uterine atony refers to the inadequate contraction of the corpus uteri myometrial cells in response to endogenous oxytocin release . Postpartum hemorrhage can occur because spiral arteries are uniquely devoid of musculature and dependent on uterine contractions to mechanically squeeze them into hemostasis . After delivery , in the absence of uterine contraction , spiral arteries may continue to bleed , resulting in postpartum hemorrhage . This activity reviews the evaluation and management of uterine atony and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well - coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients . Objectives : - Explain how to detect uterine atony . - Explain the risks associated with uterine atony . - Describe how to manage uterine atony . - Explain the importance of improving care coordination , with particular emphasis on communication between interprofessional medical teams , to enhance to prevent hemorrhage in patients with uterine atony . Introduction Uterine atony refers to the corpus uteri myometrial cells inadequate contraction in response to endogenous oxytocin that is released in the course of delivery . It leads to postpartum hemorrhage as delivery of the placenta leaves disrupted spiral arteries which are uniquely void of musculature and dependent on contractions to mechanically squeeze them into a hemostatic state . Uterine atony is a principal cause of postpartum hemorrhage , an obstetric emergency . Globally , this is one of the top 5 causes of maternal mortality . [ 1 ] Etiology Risk factors for uterine atony include prolonged labor , precipitous labor , uterine distension ( multi-fetal gestation , polyhydramnios , fetal macrosomia ) , fibroid uterus , chorioamnionitis , indicated magnesium sulfate infusions , and prolonged use of oxytocin . Ineffective uterine contraction , either focally or diffusely , is additionally associated with a diverse range of etiologies including retained placental tissue , placental disorders ( such as morbidly adherent placenta , placenta previa , and abruption placentae ) , coagulopathy ( increased fibrin degradation products ) and uterine inversion . Body mass index ( BMI ) above 40 ( class III obesity ) is also a recognized risk factor for postpartum uterine atony . [ 2 ] Epidemiology The absence of effective contraction of the uterus after delivery complicates 1 in 40 births in the United States and is responsible for at least 75 % of cases of postpartum hemorrhage . [ 3 ] Pathophysiology Contraction of the myometrium that mechanically compresses the blood vessels supplying the placental bed provides the principal mechanism uterine hemostasis after delivery of the fetus , and the placenta is concluded . The process is complemented by local decidual hemostatic factors such as tissue factor type -1 plasminogen activator inhibitor as well as by systemic coagulation factors such as platelets , circulating clotting factors . History and Physical At prenatal history and examination , risk factor discernment is key to optimal risk management . Identification of risks allows for planning and availability of resources that might be needed including personnel , medication , equipment , adequate intravenous access , and blood products . The American College of Obstetricians recommends that women be identified prenatally as high risk for postpartum hemorrhage based on the presence of placenta accreta spectrum , pre-pregnancy BMI greater than 50 , clinically significant bleeding disorder , or other surgical - medical high - risk factors . Part of the planning should be to develop a plan that allows delivery at a facility with an appropriate level of care for these patients ' needs . The diagnosis is made during the physical exam immediately upon conclusion of an obstetric vaginal or cesarean delivery . Direct palpation at cesarean delivery ( typically after the closure of the uterine incision ) or indirect examination at bimanual examination after a vaginal delivery reveals a boggy , soft , and an unusually enlarged uterus , typically with co-existent bleeding from the cervical os ( harder to appreciate at cesarean deliveries ) . An expeditious exclusion of retained gestational products or obstetric lacerations quickly excludes additional co-concomitant etiologies . The possibility of coagulopathies is considered and pursued if clinically indicated . The physical examination suggested above may involve obstetric ultrasound imaging . Evaluation Diagnosis of diffuse uterine atony is prompted typically by finding of more than usual blood loss during examination demonstrating a flaccid and enlarged uterus , which may contain a significant amount of blood . With focal localized atony , the fundal region may be well contracted while the lower uterine segment is dilated and atonic , which may difficult to appreciate on abdominal examination , but may be detected on vaginal examination . A digital exploration of the uterine cavity ( if adequate anesthesia is available ) , or bedside obstetric ultrasound imaging to reveal an echogenic endometrial stripe is an essential examination , as is a timely examination with adequate lighting to exclude an obstetric laceration . Treatment / Management Prenatal Readiness If the woman is at a medium risk for intrapartum , blood should include be typed and screened . Women with a medium risk factor for uterine atony - related postpartum hemorrhage include prior uterine surgery , multiple gestation , grand multiparity , prior PPH , large fibroids , macrosomia , body mass index greater than 40 , anemia , chorioamnionitis , prolonged second stage , oxytocin longer than 24 hours , and magnesium sulfate administration . Those assessed to be high risk should be typed and cross - matched for those at high risk of PPH . High -risk criteria include placental previa or accreta , bleeding diathesis , 2 or more medium risk factors for uterine atony . Use of a cell saver ( blood salvage ) should be considered for women at increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage , but this is not cost-effective to be routine . Intrapartum Prevention This includes optimal management of the third stage of labor . Active management of the third stage includes uterine massage with concomitant sustained low-level traction on the umbilical cord . Simultaneous oxytocin infusion is helpful , although it is reasonable to defer it to after delivery of the placenta . Initial Medical Treatment If uterine atony occurs , healthcare providers should be ready for initial medical management which is directed to the use of medications to improve tone and induce uterine contractions . Massaging the uterus is also effective , as is ensuring an empty cavity . Maternal support with intravenous ( IV ) fluids is commenced through preferably an u8 - gauge , intravenous catheter . A team approach is initiated with the summoning of the needed personnel through a standardized built - in alert system . Medications used for postpartum hemorrhage secondary to Uterine atony include the following : - Oxytocin ( Pitocin ) can be given IV 10 to 40 units per 1000 ml or 10 units intramuscularly ( IM ) . The rapid undiluted infusion may cause hypotension . - Methylergonovine ( Methergine ) given IM 0.2 mg. Given every 2 to 4 hours . Should be avoided in patients with hypertension . - 15 - methyl-PGF2 -alpha ( Hemabate ) given IM 0.25 mg . Given every 15 to 90 minutes for a maximum of 8 doses . Should be avoided in asthmatics . May cause diarrhea , fevers , or tachycardia . It is expensive . - Misoprostol ( Cytotec ) : 800 to 1000 mg placed rectally . May cause a low-grade fever . It has a delayed action . - Dinoprostone ( Prostin E2 ) 20 mg vaginal or rectal suppository may be given every 2 hours . Surgical Treatment Should the medications fail with persisting excess bleeding , then surgical management is engaged .

John Holles owned substantial lands in Nottinghamshire and property in London . He purchased the barony of Haughton and the earldom of Clare in an unsuccessful attempt to ingratiate himself at the court of King James I. Both titles were inherited by Denzil 's older brother , John . Denzil Holles attended Christ 's College , Cambridge , and Gray 's Inn , then made an advantageous marriage to heiress Dorothy Ashley in 1626 . After Dorothy 's death in 1641 , Holles married Jane , the wealthy widow of Sir Walter Covert . His third marriage , in 1666 , was also to a wealthy widow , Esther Richer , widow of Jacques Richer , a French nobleman . Holles 's political career began in 1624 when he was elected MP for St Michael in Cornwall . He came to prominence as MP for Dorchester in the second session of King Charles I 's third Parliament . During the violent scenes that accompanied the dissolution of Parliament in March 1629 , Holles physically held the Speaker , Sir John Finch , in his chair and read out Parliament 's declaration of grievances against the King . Holles was arrested with Sir John Eliot and seven others for his part in the protest . He was briefly imprisoned in the Tower , then brought before the court of the King 's Bench in February 1630 on a charge of conspiracy . Although he refused to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the King 's Bench over offences committed in Parliament , Holles was fined one thousand marks . He eventually paid the fine , but was later compensated by the Long Parliament , which ruled that his prosecution was a breach of parliamentary privilege . During the early sessions of the Long Parliament , Holles consistently maintained the view that Charles I was a good king , misled by evil counsellors . However , he did not join the attack on the King 's most unpopular adviser Lord Strafford , who was married to his sister . Holles attempted to mediate for Strafford 's life in Parliament and spoke on behalf of his family . In all other matters , Holles was firmly in opposition to the King . He presented the impeachment of Archbishop Laud in the House of Lords , supported the Root and Branch Bill against Episcopacy , drafted the Grand Remonstrance with John Pym and aggressively supported Hesilrige 's Militia Bill . After refusing an attempt to buy him off with the offer of a position at court , Holles was named as one of the Five Members whom the King attempted to arrest in January 1642 . When the First Civil War broke out in 1642 , Holles raised a regiment of foot for Parliament and went with the Earl of Bedford to the unsuccessful siege of Sherborne Castle . He was present at the battle of Edgehill in October 1642 , where he courageously held his position and tried to rally the troops scattered by Prince Rupert 's charge . The following month , however , his regiment was wiped out when Rupert stormed Brentford during the King 's advance on London , One-third of Holles 's regiment were killed and most of the rest were taken prisoner . Although he was not present at Brentford , Holles 's confidence was badly shaken . He withdrew from the military and turned down the offer of a senior command in the Parliamentarian army . During the winter of 1642 - 3 , he emerged as a leading member of the \" Peace Party \" in Parliament , taking an active part in the negotiations that took place between Parliament and the King at Oxford in the spring of 1643 , at Uxbridge during the winter of 1644 - 5 and at Newcastle in the summer of 1646 . Holles 's support for a negotiated settlement between King and Parliament brought him to prominence as a leader of the Presbyterian faction against the Independents . He clashed violently with Oliver Cromwell , whom he hated , accusing him of cowardice and saying that all his successes were due to chance and good fortune . In association with Scottish representatives and the Earl of Essex , Holles attempted to impeach Cromwell in December 1644 as an \" incendiary between the two nations \" . With the ending of the First Civil War in 1646 , Holles took a leading role in the bitter dispute between the Presbyterian MPs and the New Model Army . Following the dissolution of the Committee for Both Kingdoms in January 1647 , Holles and his Presbyterian allies took over effective control of the government . They planned to pay the Scottish army to return home , after which the English army was to be disbanded and negotiations opened for a settlement with the King . Although the Scots were paid off , the New Model Army refused to disband before arrears of pay were settled and other grievances addressed . In March 1647 , Holles denounced the soldiers who petitioned Parliament as \" enemies of the state \" . This resulted in the politicisation of the Army during the spring and summer of 1647 and its alliance with the radical Leveller movement . In June 1647 , Holles was foremost among the Eleven Members whose suspension from Parliament and impeachment was demanded by Army leaders . In response , Holles called for the mobilisation of the London militia against the New Model Army , but when General Fairfax led the Army into London in August 1647 , Presbyterian opposition quickly melted away . Most of the Eleven Members fled to the Continent . Holles went to Normandy , where he remained for almost a year . In June 1648 , during the Second Civil War , Parliament voted to repeal the impeachment against the Eleven Members . Holles returned to London in August and immediately resumed his attempts to reach a negotiated treaty with King Charles . He was one of the parliamentary commissioners at the Treaty of Newport , where he threw himself at the King 's feet , imploring him to accept Parliament 's terms . Holles presented the report from the commissioners at Newport to the House of Commons on 1 December and recommended that negotiations should be continued , to which Parliament agreed . This infuriated Army leaders and the Independent faction in Parliament and was the catalyst for Pride 's Purge on 6 December 1648 . The Army demanded the arrest of Holles and the other impeached MPs who had retaken their seats , but once again he escaped to France . After the execution of Charles I in January 1649 , Holles wrote to Charles II urging him to form an alliance with the Scots to regain the throne but he refused an offer to become Charles ' secretary of state in 1651 . Cromwell attempted a reconciliation with Holles and other exiled Presbyterians in 1654 and he returned to England where he lived quietly until the eve of the Restoration . Holles was among the secluded MPs who were re-admitted to Parliament when General Monck reversed Pride 's Purge in February 1660 and he was one the commissioners appointed to go to the Hague to deliver Parliament 's invitation to Charles II to return to England . Holles preceded Charles to England to prepare for his reception and was appointed to the privy council on 5 June 1660 . He emerged as the most vindictive of the thirty - four commissioners appointed to try the regicides in September and October . On 20 April 1661 , he was created first Baron Holles of Ifield in Sussex . Holles was English ambassador to Paris from 1662 - 7 , but his obsession with protocol was severely criticised . He was one of the commissioners who negotiated the treaty that ended the Second Anglo - Dutch War in June 1667 . In December 1667 , Holles was one of four peers who protested at the banishment of the Earl of Clarendon , which almost cost him his place on the privy council . However , he remained active in Restoration politics until his death in 1680 . He was buried at Westminster Abbey and a monument to him was erected in St Peter 's in Dorchester . His only son Francis ( 1627 - 90 ) succeeded as the second Baron Holles . The peerage became extinct after the death of his grandson Denzil , third Baron Holles , in 1694 . C.H.

John Holles owned substantial lands in Nottinghamshire and property in London . He purchased the barony of Haughton and the earldom of Clare in an unsuccessful attempt to ingratiate himself at the court of King James I. Both titles were inherited by Denzil 's older brother , John . Denzil Holles attended Christ 's College , Cambridge , and Gray 's Inn , then made an advantageous marriage to heiress Dorothy Ashley in 1626 . After Dorothy 's death in 1641 , Holles married Jane , the wealthy widow of Sir Walter Covert . His third marriage , in 1666 , was also to a wealthy widow , Esther Richer , widow of Jacques Richer , a French nobleman . Holles 's political career began in 1624 when he was elected MP for St Michael in Cornwall . He came to prominence as MP for Dorchester in the second session of King Charles I 's third Parliament . During the violent scenes that accompanied the dissolution of Parliament in March 1629 , Holles physically held the Speaker , Sir John Finch , in his chair and read out Parliament 's declaration of grievances against the King . Holles was arrested with Sir John Eliot and seven others for his part in the protest . He was briefly imprisoned in the Tower , then brought before the court of the King 's Bench in February 1630 on a charge of conspiracy . Although he refused to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the King 's Bench over offences committed in Parliament , Holles was fined one thousand marks . He eventually paid the fine , but was later compensated by the Long Parliament , which ruled that his prosecution was a breach of parliamentary privilege . During the early sessions of the Long Parliament , Holles consistently maintained the view that Charles I was a good king , misled by evil counsellors . However , he did not join the attack on the King 's most unpopular adviser Lord Strafford , who was married to his sister . Holles attempted to mediate for Strafford 's life in Parliament and spoke on behalf of his family . In all other matters , Holles was firmly in opposition to the King . He presented the impeachment of Archbishop Laud in the House of Lords , supported the Root and Branch Bill against Episcopacy , drafted the Grand Remonstrance with John Pym and aggressively supported Hesilrige 's Militia Bill . After refusing an attempt to buy him off with the offer of a position at court , Holles was named as one of the Five Members whom the King attempted to arrest in January 1642 . When the First Civil War broke out in 1642 , Holles raised a regiment of foot for Parliament and went with the Earl of Bedford to the unsuccessful siege of Sherborne Castle . He was present at the battle of Edgehill in October 1642 , where he courageously held his position and tried to rally the troops scattered by Prince Rupert 's charge . The following month , however , his regiment was wiped out when Rupert stormed Brentford during the King 's advance on London , One-third of Holles 's regiment were killed and most of the rest were taken prisoner . Although he was not present at Brentford , Holles 's confidence was badly shaken . He withdrew from the military and turned down the offer of a senior command in the Parliamentarian army . During the winter of 1642 - 3 , he emerged as a leading member of the \" Peace Party \" in Parliament , taking an active part in the negotiations that took place between Parliament and the King at Oxford in the spring of 1643 , at Uxbridge during the winter of 1644 - 5 and at Newcastle in the summer of 1646 . Holles 's support for a negotiated settlement between King and Parliament brought him to prominence as a leader of the Presbyterian faction against the Independents . He clashed violently with Oliver Cromwell , whom he hated , accusing him of cowardice and saying that all his successes were due to chance and good fortune . In association with Scottish representatives and the Earl of Essex , Holles attempted to impeach Cromwell in December 1644 as an \" incendiary between the two nations \" . With the ending of the First Civil War in 1646 , Holles took a leading role in the bitter dispute between the Presbyterian MPs and the New Model Army . Following the dissolution of the Committee for Both Kingdoms in January 1647 , Holles and his Presbyterian allies took over effective control of the government . They planned to pay the Scottish army to return home , after which the English army was to be disbanded and negotiations opened for a settlement with the King . Although the Scots were paid off , the New Model Army refused to disband before arrears of pay were settled and other grievances addressed . In March 1647 , Holles denounced the soldiers who petitioned Parliament as \" enemies of the state \" . This resulted in the politicisation of the Army during the spring and summer of 1647 and its alliance with the radical Leveller movement . In June 1647 , Holles was foremost among the Eleven Members whose suspension from Parliament and impeachment was demanded by Army leaders . In response , Holles called for the mobilisation of the London militia against the New Model Army , but when General Fairfax led the Army into London in August 1647 , Presbyterian opposition quickly melted away . Most of the Eleven Members fled to the Continent . Holles went to Normandy , where he remained for almost a year . In June 1648 , during the Second Civil War , Parliament voted to repeal the impeachment against the Eleven Members . Holles returned to London in August and immediately resumed his attempts to reach a negotiated treaty with King Charles . He was one of the parliamentary commissioners at the Treaty of Newport , where he threw himself at the King 's feet , imploring him to accept Parliament 's terms . Holles presented the report from the commissioners at Newport to the House of Commons on 1 December and recommended that negotiations should be continued , to which Parliament agreed . This infuriated Army leaders and the Independent faction in Parliament and was the catalyst for Pride 's Purge on 6 December 1648 . The Army demanded the arrest of Holles and the other impeached MPs who had retaken their seats , but once again he escaped to France . After the execution of Charles I in January 1649 , Holles wrote to Charles II urging him to form an alliance with the Scots to regain the throne but he refused an offer to become Charles ' secretary of state in 1651 . Cromwell attempted a reconciliation with Holles and other exiled Presbyterians in 1654 and he returned to England where he lived quietly until the eve of the Restoration . Holles was among the secluded MPs who were re-admitted to Parliament when General Monck reversed Pride 's Purge in February 1660 and he was one the commissioners appointed to go to the Hague to deliver Parliament 's invitation to Charles II to return to England . Holles preceded Charles to England to prepare for his reception and was appointed to the privy council on 5 June 1660 . He emerged as the most vindictive of the thirty - four commissioners appointed to try the regicides in September and October . On 20 April 1661 , he was created first Baron Holles of Ifield in Sussex . Holles was English ambassador to Paris from 1662 - 7 , but his obsession with protocol was severely criticised . He was one of the commissioners who negotiated the treaty that ended the Second Anglo - Dutch War in June 1667 . In December 1667 , Holles was one of four peers who protested at the banishment of the Earl of Clarendon , which almost cost him his place on the privy council . However , he remained active in Restoration politics until his death in 1680 . He was buried at Westminster Abbey and a monument to him was erected in St Peter 's in Dorchester . His only son Francis ( 1627 - 90 ) succeeded as the second Baron Holles . The peerage became extinct after the death of his grandson Denzil , third Baron Holles , in 1694 . C.H.

Hear that ? On the radio ? That slick , dreamy crooner dude , singing about how he 's going out of his mind over that girl ? Well , she 's an animal \u2014 baby , it 's in her nature . He used to play around with hearts that hastened at his call . But when he met that little girl , he knew that he would fall . Wait a sec ... what song is this ? Which dreamy dude is this ? What year is this ? Perhaps it 's the first week of August , 1958 , when the top song in America was Ricky Nelson 's \" Poor Little Fool \" \u2014 the first No. 1 song ever on the Billboard Hot 100 . The week Billboard launched what would become the premier singles chart in America , the list was led by the smooth - as-milk Nelson , acting the part of a player who 'd met his match \u2014 bewitched by a woman who , it turns out , is even faster than he is . Fifty - five years later , to the week , we find the Hot 100 topped by \" Blurred Lines , \" a ditty from the smooth - as - milk Robin Thicke . It 's about a player who 's ... bewitched by a woman who 's faster than he is . So , yeah , gender politics in pop music have scarcely evolved in a half - century \u2014 plus \u00e7a change and all that . ( Trust : 28-year - old Ricky Nelson had swag . If he 'd known in 1958 what a music video was , he 'd have shot one with ladies in various states of undress , too . ) The better question is this : How is it that , half a century later , we still follow a chart called the Hot 100 to measure which songs are dominating our earbuds , our streets , our beaches , our dancefloors , our American lives ? We do n't listen to transistor radios anymore , or buy seven-inch 45 - RPM vinyl ( not in quantity , anyway ) . Why is this chart still around ? The Hot 100 was designed to adapt . It 's a voracious creature , built to absorb whatever medium is delivering music to the masses at any given time . It 's not perfect \u2014 any chart where Bob Dylan , Bruce Springsteen and Missy Elliott peak only at No. 2 ca n't be \u2014 but this chart , designed for the music business and followed by pop nerds like me worldwide , is still the best benchmark we have to measure the bigness of hits . Defining our terms : Before dissecting how the Hot 100 came to be the industry standard for pop hitography , let 's answer some basic questions . Is \" the Top 40 \" related to the Hot 100 ? As a term for a radio format that plays current , popular music , \" Top 40 \" dates back to the early ' 50s , before the Hot 100 even existed . But nowadays , when Americans refer to the Top 40 as \" a list of popular songs , \" generally they 're referring to the first 40 songs on the Hot 100 . ( The full list of 100 songs is published in Billboard 's weekly magazine and online . ) Virtually all music critics and chart historians referencing a \" Top 40 hit \" are talking about the Hot 100 's first 40 positions , and if a song is understood to have \" missed the Top 40 , \" it peaked on the Hot 100 at No. 41 or below . This might all seem obvious \u2014 but it should be noted that many radio or TV programs that count down the top 40 , top 20 or top 10 do n't use the Hot 100 . That 's usually because the wide range of genres on Billboard 's big chart are a little too wide for their tastes , falling outside of a station 's target demographics \u2014 an adult - pop station that does n't play rap , for example . For more than 20 years ( 1970\u201391 ) , the national syndicated program American Top 40 with Casey Kasem did actually count down the Top 40 of the Hot 100 ( for Boomers and Gen -X pop nerds , it was paradise ) . But after a 1991 host change , and in response to longtime station complaints about the edgier hits making the chart ( e.g. , \" Me So Horny \" ) , AT40 switched to other , more radio-centric charts for its data . The current edition of AT40 , hosted by Ryan Seacrest , uses an unpublished chart with no direct relationship to Billboard . Is the Hot 100 a \" pop \" chart ? While the term began as an abbreviation for \" popular , \" pop has also come to denote a sugary genre unto itself \u2014 catchy music , usually meant to appeal to young people , tailor - made for the radio and mass consumption . But when we refer to the Hot 100 as \" the big pop chart , \" pop really does mean popular : Billboard will allow onto the Hot 100 any current song , in any genre , that radio is playing or people are buying or streaming . R&B , rap , country , rock , dance and other genres all have their own separate charts , with rules limiting what kind of song is allowed there . But songs of all of these types can and do appear on the Hot 100 . At one time , Billboard got its radio data for the Hot 100 only from stations playing Top 40 music . That 's because , in its ' 60s - to - ' 80s heyday , Top 40 stations really would play a rock song next to a country song next to an R&B song . In our modern world of micro-audience , that 's no longer the case , and the Hot 100 reflects it : For roughly the last 15 years , all current - based radio stations ( i.e. , not classic rock or oldies ) feed into the chart . If your local hip - hop or alt - rock or adult - contemporary or hot- country station is playing current stuff , those plays are tracked on the Hot 100 . What does the date on the Hot 100 mean ? Each week 's Hot 100 chart has a Saturday publication date , and it is a \" week ending \" date \u2014 the chart is meant to cover the seven days up to and including that Saturday . So this year , a baby born on July 29 would by covered by the Hot 100 dated August 3 , 2013 . ( Welcome to the world , \" Blurred Lines \" baby ! ) However , it should be noted that , for both record -keeping and magazine - selling purposes , Billboard stamps its charts with a date in the future , even though the data is from the recent past . This skews timing considerably \u2014 there 's a huge gap between when data is collected for the chart and the week - ending date . You buying a song or hearing it on the radio on a Monday or Tuesday does n't get recorded until early the next week ; it is n't announced by Billboard until a couple of days after that ; it does n't hit newsstands until early the following week ; and its \" week ending \" date is the Saturday after that . So for example , any iTunes -buying or radio-listening you 're doing right now is going to get captured on a chart dated August 17 , 2013 . The pedants among you will want to keep this in mind when you look up \" your \" No. 1 song \u2014 the Billboard chart that lines up with your birthdate reflects data from when Mom was still carrying you . ( I wish this technicality would allow me to say my birth song is really Paul and Linda McCartney 's \" Uncle Albert / Admiral Halsey \" and not this forgettable Donny Osmond song , but alas , no matter how I cut it , I 'm stuck with Donny . ) What does \" Number One with a bullet \" mean ? This phrase has so infiltrated popular culture that few know it originated in Billboard ; and even those that know \" with a bullet \" is pop-chart - related have no idea why we 're talking about ammo . It 's actually pretty simple : Billboard puts a circle \u2014 a bullet \u2014 around the chart position of any record that is gaining in chart points and has upward momentum . The Hot 100 was the first major Billboard chart to receive bullets ( at first , in the late ' 50s , they were actually stars , denoting a \" Star Performer This Week \" ) , but now virtually all Billboard charts have bullets . Generally , a song retains its bullet while it 's rising and loses it when the song is slowing at radio or with consumers and , hence , nearing its peak . It 's possible for a song to rise a few positions without a bullet , or fall a couple of places with a bullet \u2014 but generally , you want a bullet , which means your record has an upward trajectory . The ever-popular \" No. 1 with a bullet \" means a record is not only on top of the chart , it 's got upward momentum and will likely stay there for a while since it ca n't go any higher . So that 's a glossary of Hot 100 concepts . But how does the chart actually work ? Radio and sales , the perfect blend : The main thing to keep in mind about the Hot 100 is that it does n't measure just one thing . That is its genius . Many music charts are fairly simple . The album chart , for example \u2014 the Billboard 200 \u2014 is essentially a straight - up ranking of pure sales as tallied by Nielsen Soundscan , with a few minor rules applied regarding which albums qualify . But the Hot 100 is more like Coca -Cola , or the Dow Jones Industrial Average \u2014 it has a formula . A bit of history : By 1955 , at the start of the Rock Era , The Billboard , as the magazine was then called , had been tracking the amusements business ( circuses , vaudeville , fairgrounds ) for decades ; and it had been tracking record sales for the better part of 20 years . At the time , the magazine ran separate charts that tracked best-selling records in stores , disc jockey playlists and jukebox plays ( self - reported by retailers , DJs and jukebox operators , respectively , back in those pre-computer days ) . But the magazine 's brain trust began experimenting with a chart that would mash up all of these pools of music data into one chart to rule them all . After three years of tinkering with a proto-chart ( the \" Top 100 , \" 1955 \u2013 58 ) , on August 4 , 1958 , they launched the Hot 100 with great fanfare as the \" first true blend \" of sales - plus - plays . This is still the premise of the Hot 100 . To this day , the two biggest data pools feeding into it are radio airplay and song sales . ( Jukeboxes , already on the wane in ' 58 as box sales slowed , were eliminated from the chart by ' 59 \u2014 just one of many ways the Hot 100 has changed since inception . ) The reason this airplay- plus - sales system works so well is that the songs doing well at radio and retail are broadly similar at any given time , but they are different enough from each other that averaging them together gives a fairly full picture of the current state of pop hit\u2013dom . Radio is a more passive , top-down medium . It is certainly responsive to listener requests , but it 's also driven by the demands of advertisers and the limits of formatting . However , radio is \u2014 still \u2014 how tens of millions of Americans are exposed to current music , which makes it valuable to track . Music retail , on the other hand , provides a better , more direct line into what songs consumers are obsessing over in any given week . But record retail over - samples the most obsessive fan ( the one guaranteed to buy an Elvis single or a Madonna single in its first week ) , and it can be driven by momentary fads or short - lived event recordings . Not unlike a bicameral legislature , the Hot 100 is a system of checks and balances . In any given week , the chart will be populated by songs consumers are buying that radio has barely begun to play ( or may never play ) ; songs radio is heavily rotating that consumers are losing interest in ; and \u2014 when everything works perfectly \u2014 songs whose sales and airplay are peaking simultaneously . But all these different types of songs are hits . In the most recent Top 10 , for example , Jay Z's new single \" Holy Grail \" featuring Justin Timberlake has a berth at No. 8 thanks largely to sales , not airplay \u2014 it 's the country 's fourth biggest - selling song , but at radio , the still - new track ranks only 40th . On the other hand , Timberlake 's \" Mirrors \" at No. 10 is mostly an airplay story ; it clings to the Top 10 because it 's got the fourth - highest radio audience , but it 's only the 17th best-seller with consumers . ( This has been true for \" Mirrors \" throughout its chart run \u2014 when it peaked at No. 2 on the Hot 100 in June , it was in the midst of a nearly two -month run as America 's most-played song at radio , but it never got higher in sales than third place . Average that out , and you get a No. 2 Hot 100 hit . ) It should be noted that , while radio and retail are still the two biggest components of the Hot 100 , they 're not the only ones \u2014 other digital media like YouTube and Spotify now play a role in what makes a hit , too . Never mind the fact that \" retail , \" nowadays , largely means i Tunes , not record stores . Let 's talk about how the big chart has evolved . Rules are made to be broken : The Hot 100 has been retooled frequently throughout its history . Arguably , this is what has prolonged the chart 's life \u2014 Billboard has added new data streams or even changed the chart 's ground rules when necessary . Most of the changes have had to do with the consumer side of the equation , reflecting changing norms in the ways fans buy songs , are permitted to acquire songs or have songs made available to them . Some rule changes have been technical and fairly invisible \u2014 the weighting of sales versus airplay , for example , or the addition or subtraction of stations to the radio panel . Some are relics of a bygone era : For roughly the first 40 years of the Hot 100 , when singles were physical and came with A-sides and B-sides , Billboard had difficulty deciding how to track the B-sides and , a couple times per decade , kept changing its mind over whether they should chart together with their A- sides or in their own , separate chart positions . ( In the digital era , that 's no longer an issue : a song is a song , and each one gets its own Hot 100 real estate . ) Other changes , however , have had huge effects on how the Hot 100 functions . In the last quarter - century , there have been four major formula changes that took a sledgehammer to the chart , all arguably necessary to keep it relevant . - November 1991 \u2014 the addition of more accurate data : 1991 is n't just \" the year punk broke \" ; for my fellow pop nerds , it 's the B.C. / A.D. moment for chart - following , as it was the year Billboard added data from SoundScan to its major charts . The direct cash - register sales data provided by the company ( now owned by Nielsen ) was so much more accurate than Billboard 's old system of collecting retailers ' fudgeable sales lists , it completely changed how we perceive music popularity . ( Some examples : we learned country and rap were bigger sellers nationwide than we thought ; and that most albums open like movies , with a big opening week , not a gradual rise . ) The album chart changed first , switching to SoundScan data in May of that year . In November , SoundScan came to the Hot 100 , along with radio data from Broadcast Data Systems \u2014 computerized counting of song plays , to match SoundScan 's computerized tallying of sales . The result was a radically different Hot 100 . Songs could now break faster \u2014 no more waiting weeks for retailers and programmers to acknowledge them \u2014 but they also lingered longer , both on the Hot 100 as a whole and at No. 1 . Numerous all - time records were broken : Elvis 's record for most weeks at No. 1 ( 11 , with 1956's \" Do n't Be Cruel \" / \" Hound Dog \" ) was beaten four times within the new chart 's first five years ( and finally set for all time in 1995\u201396 with Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men 's 16 - week blockbuster \" One Sweet Day \" ) . The Hot 100 's first - ever song to debut at No. 1 appeared in 1995 ( Michael Jackson 's \" You Are Not Alone \" ) , and another 20 songs since then have repeated the feat . - November 1998 \u2014 the inclusion of non-retail , radio -only songs : For its first 40 years , the Hot 100 was a singles chart . Billboard 's ironclad rule was that a song had to be available for sale as a 45 , a 12-inch maxi-single , a cassingle or a CD - single to make the big chart \u2014 no album cuts , no promotional - only tracks just for radio or DJs . This rule , designed to compel labels to release their hits as singles , was thwarted by the industry in the ' 90s , when the labels waged a decade - long campaign to kill the single as a retail medium and compel consumers to purchase full - length CDs . ( Remember the joy of ponying up $ 18 in 1999 to own Lou Bega 's \" Mambo No. 5 \" ? ) These label shenanigans made the Hot 100 look out of touch for much of the ' 90s \u2014 some of the biggest songs you heard on the radio ( Green Day 's \" When I Come Around \" ; No Doubt 's \" Do n't Speak \" ; the Fugees ' \" Killing Me Softly \" ; Natalie Imbruglia 's \" Torn \" ) did n't appear on the big chart at all , because they were n't for sale as retail singles . Billboard held out a long time in changing this rule , but in 1998 , bowing to label pressure , they relented , allowing radio-only songs with no retail single to appear on the Hot 100 for the first time . It restored the Hot 100 's pop relevance , but it also removed the labels ' last incentive to release singles and get Hot 100 bragging rights . From 1999 to 2004 , the Hot 100 was an airplay - skewed chart , with big-selling singles only occasionally having an impact . That is , until ... - February 2005 \u2014 the addition of digital sales : Singles fans have Apple founder Steve Jobs to thank for the return of the a la carte song purchase . The legal- digital - music era began in earnest in 2003 when Apple launched the iTunes Music Store , with a uniform price of 99 cents per song and a requirement ( insisted upon by Jobs in his negotiations with the labels ) that virtually all songs be available for individual purchase . Two years later , with digital music booming , Billboard responded in kind , adding digital song sales to the Hot 100 . In effect , the addition of iTunes and other digital song retailers proved a vital counterweight to the 1998 rule change allowing radio-only tracks on the chart . After a half - decade of sluggish Hot 100 action ( e.g. , only nine new songs hit No. 1 in all of 2002 ) , the digital infusion energized the chart considerably . Consumers ' tastes change faster than radio playlists , and consumers ' ability to satisfy song cravings instantly \u2014 faster , even , than in the heyday of the 45 - RPM single \u2014 allowed songs to make huge debuts and quantum leaps up the chart . Digital music even shifted the kinds of songs that would chart , in a more centrist - pop direction . No. 1 hits by the likes of Gwen Stefani , Plain White T's and Owl City would have been unthinkable without the viral effect spurred by i Tunes . Of course , when it came to viral hits , i Tunes was n't the last word . - March 2012 / February 2013 \u2014 the addition of streaming music : Over the last 18 months the Hot 100 has begun to reckon with the world of digital music that fans play on demand but never acquire . Billboard 's opening gambit came in the early spring of 2012 , when it added Spotify and other subscription streaming music services ( e.g. , Muve Music , Rdio , Rhapsody , Slacker ) to the chart . The effects were noticeable but not earth -shaking \u2014 a few more rock-oriented or EDM songs , such as fun . 's \" We Are Young \" or Avicii 's \" Levels , \" got a bit of a boost from on - demand streams , but not enough to shift the chart 's direction . The bigger change came just this past winter , when YouTube and other video streaming was finally added to the Hot 100 . This latest move by Billboard was exceedingly populist \u2014 not only are plays of official , label - sanctioned videos on Vevo now chart -legal , but YouTube fan videos incorporating at least half a minute of a current song count , as well . In a bit of clever P.R. , Billboard introduced the change at a moment it would n't be missed , when the \" Harlem Shake \" phenomenon was dominating YouTube . The result : Baauer , producer of the \" Harlem Shake \" recording , became an instant Hot 100 chart-topper , as streams of some 100 million views ( most of them of viral fan videos , not the full - length song itself ) leapfrogged \" Shake \" to the penthouse . Six months later , Baauer still has n't scored a followup hit , and worries by chart fans that the Hot 100 would become choked with viral dance fads have not yet come to pass . But we 'll see what happens when the next music mega-meme explodes . The result of all these changes is that the Hot 100 is now essentially a three - legged stool . Sales and airplay are the first two legs , as they have been historically ( albeit with digital sales now standing in for the 45 ) ; and streaming music \u2014 the combination of YouTube , Spotify and their ilk \u2014 is the third . According to Billboard , the formula continues to weigh sales and airplay more heavily than streaming . But in a week where streaming activity is high ( read : a \" Harlem Shake \" \u2013 like phenomenon , or the release of a buzzy video like Miley Cyrus ' \" We Ca n't Stop \" ) , the streaming component can make up as much as 30 % of the Hot 100 's data . In short , to hit the upper reaches of the Hot 100 in 2013 , a song must place well in all three categories : sales , airplay and streaming . That 's how Robin Thicke has dominated the chart all summer . At various times in the last two months , \" Blurred Lines \" has been most played and purchased , and near the top in streams . ( It 's also why the generally acclaimed Song of Summer , Daft Punk 's \" Get Lucky , \" has fallen short ; despite stronger streaming numbers than Thicke , \" Lucky 's \" sales and airplay have been lighter than \" Blurred 's , \" and consequently , as I predicted , on the big chart \" Lucky \" peaked at No. 2 . ) How much longer can the Hot 100 remain relevant ? In a world of music disaggregation and fan-driven hitmaking , wo n't the chart become a relic ? It 's certainly possible . But Billboard 's malleable formula is a remarkably versatile tool , helping this Lazarus - like chart survive numerous paradigm shifts in the last two decades . In a world of adapt or die , as long as there 's a music business to track , the Hot 100 can \u2014 and , I would argue , should \u2014 continue to exist , if only to maintain a benchmark with decades of history . Plus , let 's just say it : Pop charts are fun .

Hear that ? On the radio ? That slick , dreamy crooner dude , singing about how he 's going out of his mind over that girl ? Well , she 's an animal \u2014 baby , it 's in her nature . He used to play around with hearts that hastened at his call . But when he met that little girl , he knew that he would fall . Wait a sec ... what song is this ? Which dreamy dude is this ? What year is this ? Perhaps it 's the first week of August , 1958 , when the top song in America was Ricky Nelson 's \" Poor Little Fool \" \u2014 the first No. 1 song ever on the Billboard Hot 100 . The week Billboard launched what would become the premier singles chart in America , the list was led by the smooth - as-milk Nelson , acting the part of a player who 'd met his match \u2014 bewitched by a woman who , it turns out , is even faster than he is . Fifty - five years later , to the week , we find the Hot 100 topped by \" Blurred Lines , \" a ditty from the smooth - as - milk Robin Thicke . It 's about a player who 's ... bewitched by a woman who 's faster than he is . So , yeah , gender politics in pop music have scarcely evolved in a half - century \u2014 plus \u00e7a change and all that . ( Trust : 28-year - old Ricky Nelson had swag . If he 'd known in 1958 what a music video was , he 'd have shot one with ladies in various states of undress , too . ) The better question is this : How is it that , half a century later , we still follow a chart called the Hot 100 to measure which songs are dominating our earbuds , our streets , our beaches , our dancefloors , our American lives ? We do n't listen to transistor radios anymore , or buy seven-inch 45 - RPM vinyl ( not in quantity , anyway ) . Why is this chart still around ? The Hot 100 was designed to adapt . It 's a voracious creature , built to absorb whatever medium is delivering music to the masses at any given time . It 's not perfect \u2014 any chart where Bob Dylan , Bruce Springsteen and Missy Elliott peak only at No. 2 ca n't be \u2014 but this chart , designed for the music business and followed by pop nerds like me worldwide , is still the best benchmark we have to measure the bigness of hits . Defining our terms : Before dissecting how the Hot 100 came to be the industry standard for pop hitography , let 's answer some basic questions . Is \" the Top 40 \" related to the Hot 100 ? As a term for a radio format that plays current , popular music , \" Top 40 \" dates back to the early ' 50s , before the Hot 100 even existed . But nowadays , when Americans refer to the Top 40 as \" a list of popular songs , \" generally they 're referring to the first 40 songs on the Hot 100 . ( The full list of 100 songs is published in Billboard 's weekly magazine and online . ) Virtually all music critics and chart historians referencing a \" Top 40 hit \" are talking about the Hot 100 's first 40 positions , and if a song is understood to have \" missed the Top 40 , \" it peaked on the Hot 100 at No. 41 or below . This might all seem obvious \u2014 but it should be noted that many radio or TV programs that count down the top 40 , top 20 or top 10 do n't use the Hot 100 . That 's usually because the wide range of genres on Billboard 's big chart are a little too wide for their tastes , falling outside of a station 's target demographics \u2014 an adult - pop station that does n't play rap , for example . For more than 20 years ( 1970\u201391 ) , the national syndicated program American Top 40 with Casey Kasem did actually count down the Top 40 of the Hot 100 ( for Boomers and Gen -X pop nerds , it was paradise ) . But after a 1991 host change , and in response to longtime station complaints about the edgier hits making the chart ( e.g. , \" Me So Horny \" ) , AT40 switched to other , more radio-centric charts for its data . The current edition of AT40 , hosted by Ryan Seacrest , uses an unpublished chart with no direct relationship to Billboard . Is the Hot 100 a \" pop \" chart ? While the term began as an abbreviation for \" popular , \" pop has also come to denote a sugary genre unto itself \u2014 catchy music , usually meant to appeal to young people , tailor - made for the radio and mass consumption . But when we refer to the Hot 100 as \" the big pop chart , \" pop really does mean popular : Billboard will allow onto the Hot 100 any current song , in any genre , that radio is playing or people are buying or streaming . R&B , rap , country , rock , dance and other genres all have their own separate charts , with rules limiting what kind of song is allowed there . But songs of all of these types can and do appear on the Hot 100 . At one time , Billboard got its radio data for the Hot 100 only from stations playing Top 40 music . That 's because , in its ' 60s - to - ' 80s heyday , Top 40 stations really would play a rock song next to a country song next to an R&B song . In our modern world of micro-audience , that 's no longer the case , and the Hot 100 reflects it : For roughly the last 15 years , all current - based radio stations ( i.e. , not classic rock or oldies ) feed into the chart . If your local hip - hop or alt - rock or adult - contemporary or hot- country station is playing current stuff , those plays are tracked on the Hot 100 . What does the date on the Hot 100 mean ? Each week 's Hot 100 chart has a Saturday publication date , and it is a \" week ending \" date \u2014 the chart is meant to cover the seven days up to and including that Saturday . So this year , a baby born on July 29 would by covered by the Hot 100 dated August 3 , 2013 . ( Welcome to the world , \" Blurred Lines \" baby ! ) However , it should be noted that , for both record -keeping and magazine - selling purposes , Billboard stamps its charts with a date in the future , even though the data is from the recent past . This skews timing considerably \u2014 there 's a huge gap between when data is collected for the chart and the week - ending date . You buying a song or hearing it on the radio on a Monday or Tuesday does n't get recorded until early the next week ; it is n't announced by Billboard until a couple of days after that ; it does n't hit newsstands until early the following week ; and its \" week ending \" date is the Saturday after that . So for example , any iTunes -buying or radio-listening you 're doing right now is going to get captured on a chart dated August 17 , 2013 . The pedants among you will want to keep this in mind when you look up \" your \" No. 1 song \u2014 the Billboard chart that lines up with your birthdate reflects data from when Mom was still carrying you . ( I wish this technicality would allow me to say my birth song is really Paul and Linda McCartney 's \" Uncle Albert / Admiral Halsey \" and not this forgettable Donny Osmond song , but alas , no matter how I cut it , I 'm stuck with Donny . ) What does \" Number One with a bullet \" mean ? This phrase has so infiltrated popular culture that few know it originated in Billboard ; and even those that know \" with a bullet \" is pop-chart - related have no idea why we 're talking about ammo . It 's actually pretty simple : Billboard puts a circle \u2014 a bullet \u2014 around the chart position of any record that is gaining in chart points and has upward momentum . The Hot 100 was the first major Billboard chart to receive bullets ( at first , in the late ' 50s , they were actually stars , denoting a \" Star Performer This Week \" ) , but now virtually all Billboard charts have bullets . Generally , a song retains its bullet while it 's rising and loses it when the song is slowing at radio or with consumers and , hence , nearing its peak . It 's possible for a song to rise a few positions without a bullet , or fall a couple of places with a bullet \u2014 but generally , you want a bullet , which means your record has an upward trajectory . The ever-popular \" No. 1 with a bullet \" means a record is not only on top of the chart , it 's got upward momentum and will likely stay there for a while since it ca n't go any higher . So that 's a glossary of Hot 100 concepts . But how does the chart actually work ? Radio and sales , the perfect blend : The main thing to keep in mind about the Hot 100 is that it does n't measure just one thing . That is its genius . Many music charts are fairly simple . The album chart , for example \u2014 the Billboard 200 \u2014 is essentially a straight - up ranking of pure sales as tallied by Nielsen Soundscan , with a few minor rules applied regarding which albums qualify . But the Hot 100 is more like Coca -Cola , or the Dow Jones Industrial Average \u2014 it has a formula . A bit of history : By 1955 , at the start of the Rock Era , The Billboard , as the magazine was then called , had been tracking the amusements business ( circuses , vaudeville , fairgrounds ) for decades ; and it had been tracking record sales for the better part of 20 years . At the time , the magazine ran separate charts that tracked best-selling records in stores , disc jockey playlists and jukebox plays ( self - reported by retailers , DJs and jukebox operators , respectively , back in those pre-computer days ) . But the magazine 's brain trust began experimenting with a chart that would mash up all of these pools of music data into one chart to rule them all . After three years of tinkering with a proto-chart ( the \" Top 100 , \" 1955 \u2013 58 ) , on August 4 , 1958 , they launched the Hot 100 with great fanfare as the \" first true blend \" of sales - plus - plays . This is still the premise of the Hot 100 . To this day , the two biggest data pools feeding into it are radio airplay and song sales . ( Jukeboxes , already on the wane in ' 58 as box sales slowed , were eliminated from the chart by ' 59 \u2014 just one of many ways the Hot 100 has changed since inception . ) The reason this airplay- plus - sales system works so well is that the songs doing well at radio and retail are broadly similar at any given time , but they are different enough from each other that averaging them together gives a fairly full picture of the current state of pop hit\u2013dom . Radio is a more passive , top-down medium . It is certainly responsive to listener requests , but it 's also driven by the demands of advertisers and the limits of formatting . However , radio is \u2014 still \u2014 how tens of millions of Americans are exposed to current music , which makes it valuable to track . Music retail , on the other hand , provides a better , more direct line into what songs consumers are obsessing over in any given week . But record retail over - samples the most obsessive fan ( the one guaranteed to buy an Elvis single or a Madonna single in its first week ) , and it can be driven by momentary fads or short - lived event recordings . Not unlike a bicameral legislature , the Hot 100 is a system of checks and balances . In any given week , the chart will be populated by songs consumers are buying that radio has barely begun to play ( or may never play ) ; songs radio is heavily rotating that consumers are losing interest in ; and \u2014 when everything works perfectly \u2014 songs whose sales and airplay are peaking simultaneously . But all these different types of songs are hits . In the most recent Top 10 , for example , Jay Z's new single \" Holy Grail \" featuring Justin Timberlake has a berth at No. 8 thanks largely to sales , not airplay \u2014 it 's the country 's fourth biggest - selling song , but at radio , the still - new track ranks only 40th . On the other hand , Timberlake 's \" Mirrors \" at No. 10 is mostly an airplay story ; it clings to the Top 10 because it 's got the fourth - highest radio audience , but it 's only the 17th best-seller with consumers . ( This has been true for \" Mirrors \" throughout its chart run \u2014 when it peaked at No. 2 on the Hot 100 in June , it was in the midst of a nearly two -month run as America 's most-played song at radio , but it never got higher in sales than third place . Average that out , and you get a No. 2 Hot 100 hit . ) It should be noted that , while radio and retail are still the two biggest components of the Hot 100 , they 're not the only ones \u2014 other digital media like YouTube and Spotify now play a role in what makes a hit , too . Never mind the fact that \" retail , \" nowadays , largely means i Tunes , not record stores . Let 's talk about how the big chart has evolved . Rules are made to be broken : The Hot 100 has been retooled frequently throughout its history . Arguably , this is what has prolonged the chart 's life \u2014 Billboard has added new data streams or even changed the chart 's ground rules when necessary . Most of the changes have had to do with the consumer side of the equation , reflecting changing norms in the ways fans buy songs , are permitted to acquire songs or have songs made available to them . Some rule changes have been technical and fairly invisible \u2014 the weighting of sales versus airplay , for example , or the addition or subtraction of stations to the radio panel . Some are relics of a bygone era : For roughly the first 40 years of the Hot 100 , when singles were physical and came with A-sides and B-sides , Billboard had difficulty deciding how to track the B-sides and , a couple times per decade , kept changing its mind over whether they should chart together with their A- sides or in their own , separate chart positions . ( In the digital era , that 's no longer an issue : a song is a song , and each one gets its own Hot 100 real estate . ) Other changes , however , have had huge effects on how the Hot 100 functions . In the last quarter - century , there have been four major formula changes that took a sledgehammer to the chart , all arguably necessary to keep it relevant . - November 1991 \u2014 the addition of more accurate data : 1991 is n't just \" the year punk broke \" ; for my fellow pop nerds , it 's the B.C. / A.D. moment for chart - following , as it was the year Billboard added data from SoundScan to its major charts . The direct cash - register sales data provided by the company ( now owned by Nielsen ) was so much more accurate than Billboard 's old system of collecting retailers ' fudgeable sales lists , it completely changed how we perceive music popularity . ( Some examples : we learned country and rap were bigger sellers nationwide than we thought ; and that most albums open like movies , with a big opening week , not a gradual rise . ) The album chart changed first , switching to SoundScan data in May of that year . In November , SoundScan came to the Hot 100 , along with radio data from Broadcast Data Systems \u2014 computerized counting of song plays , to match SoundScan 's computerized tallying of sales . The result was a radically different Hot 100 . Songs could now break faster \u2014 no more waiting weeks for retailers and programmers to acknowledge them \u2014 but they also lingered longer , both on the Hot 100 as a whole and at No. 1 . Numerous all - time records were broken : Elvis 's record for most weeks at No. 1 ( 11 , with 1956's \" Do n't Be Cruel \" / \" Hound Dog \" ) was beaten four times within the new chart 's first five years ( and finally set for all time in 1995\u201396 with Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men 's 16 - week blockbuster \" One Sweet Day \" ) . The Hot 100 's first - ever song to debut at No. 1 appeared in 1995 ( Michael Jackson 's \" You Are Not Alone \" ) , and another 20 songs since then have repeated the feat . - November 1998 \u2014 the inclusion of non-retail , radio -only songs : For its first 40 years , the Hot 100 was a singles chart . Billboard 's ironclad rule was that a song had to be available for sale as a 45 , a 12-inch maxi-single , a cassingle or a CD - single to make the big chart \u2014 no album cuts , no promotional - only tracks just for radio or DJs . This rule , designed to compel labels to release their hits as singles , was thwarted by the industry in the ' 90s , when the labels waged a decade - long campaign to kill the single as a retail medium and compel consumers to purchase full - length CDs . ( Remember the joy of ponying up $ 18 in 1999 to own Lou Bega 's \" Mambo No. 5 \" ? ) These label shenanigans made the Hot 100 look out of touch for much of the ' 90s \u2014 some of the biggest songs you heard on the radio ( Green Day 's \" When I Come Around \" ; No Doubt 's \" Do n't Speak \" ; the Fugees ' \" Killing Me Softly \" ; Natalie Imbruglia 's \" Torn \" ) did n't appear on the big chart at all , because they were n't for sale as retail singles . Billboard held out a long time in changing this rule , but in 1998 , bowing to label pressure , they relented , allowing radio-only songs with no retail single to appear on the Hot 100 for the first time . It restored the Hot 100 's pop relevance , but it also removed the labels ' last incentive to release singles and get Hot 100 bragging rights . From 1999 to 2004 , the Hot 100 was an airplay - skewed chart , with big-selling singles only occasionally having an impact . That is , until ... - February 2005 \u2014 the addition of digital sales : Singles fans have Apple founder Steve Jobs to thank for the return of the a la carte song purchase . The legal- digital - music era began in earnest in 2003 when Apple launched the iTunes Music Store , with a uniform price of 99 cents per song and a requirement ( insisted upon by Jobs in his negotiations with the labels ) that virtually all songs be available for individual purchase . Two years later , with digital music booming , Billboard responded in kind , adding digital song sales to the Hot 100 . In effect , the addition of iTunes and other digital song retailers proved a vital counterweight to the 1998 rule change allowing radio-only tracks on the chart . After a half - decade of sluggish Hot 100 action ( e.g. , only nine new songs hit No. 1 in all of 2002 ) , the digital infusion energized the chart considerably . Consumers ' tastes change faster than radio playlists , and consumers ' ability to satisfy song cravings instantly \u2014 faster , even , than in the heyday of the 45 - RPM single \u2014 allowed songs to make huge debuts and quantum leaps up the chart . Digital music even shifted the kinds of songs that would chart , in a more centrist - pop direction . No. 1 hits by the likes of Gwen Stefani , Plain White T's and Owl City would have been unthinkable without the viral effect spurred by i Tunes . Of course , when it came to viral hits , i Tunes was n't the last word . - March 2012 / February 2013 \u2014 the addition of streaming music : Over the last 18 months the Hot 100 has begun to reckon with the world of digital music that fans play on demand but never acquire . Billboard 's opening gambit came in the early spring of 2012 , when it added Spotify and other subscription streaming music services ( e.g. , Muve Music , Rdio , Rhapsody , Slacker ) to the chart . The effects were noticeable but not earth -shaking \u2014 a few more rock-oriented or EDM songs , such as fun . 's \" We Are Young \" or Avicii 's \" Levels , \" got a bit of a boost from on - demand streams , but not enough to shift the chart 's direction . The bigger change came just this past winter , when YouTube and other video streaming was finally added to the Hot 100 . This latest move by Billboard was exceedingly populist \u2014 not only are plays of official , label - sanctioned videos on Vevo now chart -legal , but YouTube fan videos incorporating at least half a minute of a current song count , as well . In a bit of clever P.R. , Billboard introduced the change at a moment it would n't be missed , when the \" Harlem Shake \" phenomenon was dominating YouTube . The result : Baauer , producer of the \" Harlem Shake \" recording , became an instant Hot 100 chart-topper , as streams of some 100 million views ( most of them of viral fan videos , not the full - length song itself ) leapfrogged \" Shake \" to the penthouse . Six months later , Baauer still has n't scored a followup hit , and worries by chart fans that the Hot 100 would become choked with viral dance fads have not yet come to pass . But we 'll see what happens when the next music mega-meme explodes . The result of all these changes is that the Hot 100 is now essentially a three - legged stool . Sales and airplay are the first two legs , as they have been historically ( albeit with digital sales now standing in for the 45 ) ; and streaming music \u2014 the combination of YouTube , Spotify and their ilk \u2014 is the third . According to Billboard , the formula continues to weigh sales and airplay more heavily than streaming . But in a week where streaming activity is high ( read : a \" Harlem Shake \" \u2013 like phenomenon , or the release of a buzzy video like Miley Cyrus ' \" We Ca n't Stop \" ) , the streaming component can make up as much as 30 % of the Hot 100 's data . In short , to hit the upper reaches of the Hot 100 in 2013 , a song must place well in all three categories : sales , airplay and streaming . That 's how Robin Thicke has dominated the chart all summer . At various times in the last two months , \" Blurred Lines \" has been most played and purchased , and near the top in streams . ( It 's also why the generally acclaimed Song of Summer , Daft Punk 's \" Get Lucky , \" has fallen short ; despite stronger streaming numbers than Thicke , \" Lucky 's \" sales and airplay have been lighter than \" Blurred 's , \" and consequently , as I predicted , on the big chart \" Lucky \" peaked at No. 2 . ) How much longer can the Hot 100 remain relevant ? In a world of music disaggregation and fan-driven hitmaking , wo n't the chart become a relic ? It 's certainly possible . But Billboard 's malleable formula is a remarkably versatile tool , helping this Lazarus - like chart survive numerous paradigm shifts in the last two decades .

Sometimes the heart gets larger and becomes weak for unknown reasons . This condition is called idiopathic cardiomyopathy . Conditions associated with an enlarged heart include : - Heart condition present at birth ( congenital heart defect ) . Problems with the structure and function of the heart can cause the heart muscle to get larger and weak . - Damage from a heart attack . Scarring and other structural heart damage can make it harder for the heart to pump enough blood to the body . The strain can lead to heart swelling and eventual heart failure . - Diseases of the heart muscle ( cardiomyopathy ) . Cardiomyopathy often makes the heart rigid or thick . It can make it harder for the heart to pump blood . - Fluid buildup in the sac around the heart ( pericardial effusion ) . A collection of fluid in the sac that contains the heart can cause heart enlargement that can be seen on a chest X -ray . - Heart valve disease . Four valves in the heart keep blood flowing in the right direction . Disease or damage to any of the valves may interrupt blood flow and cause the heart chambers to get larger . - High blood pressure ( hypertension ) . If you have high blood pressure , the heart may have to pump harder to deliver blood to the rest of the body . The strain can cause the heart muscle to grow larger and become weak . - High blood pressure in the arteries in the lungs ( pulmonary hypertension ) . The heart has to work harder to move blood between the lungs and the heart . The strain may lead to thickening or enlargement of the right side of the heart . - Low red blood cell count ( anemia ) . In anemia , there 's a lack of healthy red blood cells to carry proper levels of oxygen to the body 's tissues . The heart must pump more blood to make up for the lack of oxygen in the blood . - Thyroid disorders . Both an underactive thyroid gland ( hypothyroidism ) and an overactive thyroid gland ( hyperthyroidism ) can lead to heart problems , including an enlarged heart . - Too much iron in the body ( hemochromatosis ) . Iron can build up in various organs , including the heart . This can cause the lower left heart chamber to swell . - Unusual protein deposits in the heart ( cardiac amyloidosis ) . This rare disease causes a protein called amyloid to collect in the blood and get stuck in body organs , including the heart . Amyloid protein deposits in the heart cause an irreversible thickening of the heart wall . The heart has to work harder to fill with blood . - Aerobic exercise . In some athletes , the heart becomes enlarged as a response to frequent and prolonged exercise . Usually , this type of enlarged heart is n't considered a disease and does n't need treatment . - Fat around the heart . Some people have extra fat around the heart that can appear on a chest X -ray . Unless there are other heart conditions associated , no treatment is necessary . Risk factors Things that can increase the risk of an enlarged heart ( cardiomegaly ) include : - A family history of heart muscle disease ( cardiomyopathy ) . Some types of cardiomyopathy run in families . Tell your health care provider if a parent or sibling has a history of a thick , rigid or enlarged heart . - High blood pressure . This means having a blood pressure measurement higher than 140/90 millimeters of mercury . - Heart diseases . Any problem affecting the heart , including congenital heart defects or heart valve disease , may lead to heart enlargement . It 's important to follow a healthy lifestyle and have regular health checkups to manage heart disease . Complications The risk of complications from an enlarged heart depends on the part of the heart affected and the cause . Complications of an enlarged heart can include : - Heart failure . Heart failure may occur if the left lower heart chamber ( left ventricle ) becomes enlarged . In heart failure , the heart ca n't pump the proper amount of blood throughout the body . - Blood clots . Blood clots may form in the lining of the heart . A blood clot that forms on the right side of the heart can travel to the lungs ( pulmonary embolism ) . If a clot blocks blood flow , you could have a heart attack or stroke . - Leaky heart valve ( regurgitation ) . Heart enlargement may prevent the mitral and tricuspid heart valves from closing , causing blood to leak backward . The interrupted blood flow creates a sound called a heart murmur . Although not necessarily harmful , heart murmurs should be monitored by a health care provider . - Cardiac arrest and sudden death . An enlarged heart may cause the heart to beat too fast or too slow . The irregular heartbeat ( arrhythmia ) may lead to fainting , cardiac arrest or sudden death . Prevention Tell your health care provider if anyone in your family has or had cardiomyopathy or other health conditions that caused an enlarged heart . When diagnosed early , proper treatment of the underlying condition may prevent the enlarged heart from getting worse . Following a heart- healthy lifestyle can help prevent or manage some conditions that can lead to an enlarged heart . Take these steps to help prevent an enlarged heart : - Monitor and manage high blood pressure , high cholesterol and diabetes . - Take any prescribed medications as directed . - Eat a nutritious , balanced diet . - Get regular exercise . - Avoid or limit alcohol . - Do n't smoke . - Do n't use illegal drugs .","annotations":[{"text":"Others","span":[962,967],"token_span":[184,184],"role":"Protagonist","label":"Protagonist","role_definition":"The individual whose posture changes."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"For many people , cardiomegaly is asymptomatic .

The Forum takes place at 7.30 pm for an 8 pm start . Panellists confirmed so far are Fans ' Director Brian Attmore and new Commercial Director Justyn Medd . The football staff will be represented by Andy Duncan . Early arrival is recommended as capacity at the venue is limited . The full story ... Six days after they were formally relegated from the Football League , Cambridge United Football Club Limited filed in the Chancery Court on Friday morning to enter administration . According to the club 's official website , the decision to file for administration was taken this week \" after a thorough review of the club 's financial situation and detailed discussions with insolvency experts , Grant Thornton . \" | \" It 's been a dreadful season in all ways ... this gives the people of Cambridge and the supporters of Cambridge the chance to start afresh . \" | | Roger Hunt , Cambridge United Chairman | Finance Director Nick Pomery explained : \" The club has liabilities of around \u00a3 900,000 and assets which are in no way sufficient to meet these debts . Our relegation to the Conference , confirmed on Saturday , means that it is not feasible that these liabilities can be paid off by trading profitably over the forthcoming season . We therefore have no choice but to file for administration . \" After such a tumultuous season , this statement wo n't be a surprise to many of the fans . By deciding to file for administration now it means that as the season continues for the U's , they will automatically have ten points deducted ... This of course , makes no difference now they 've been relegated . By doing it now rather than later it means they 'll be on equal terms when they start next season in the Conference . BBC Radio Cambridgeshire 's Sports Editor Jonathan Park explains : \" The administrator 's main aim is to keep the business running . They 'll have a thorough look at what 's going on and where the club are spending money . They 'll have to make some tough decisions and it 's probable that staff will be made redundant and players will be sold . The bottom line is how can the club keep going by spending the least amount of money ... \" It also means people who are owed money by the club may not be paid , although Finance Director Pomery has said that \" suppliers have assurance that any future supplies ordered by administrators will be paid for in full . \" | Roger Hunt | The administrators will also be looking at the rental payments for the ground which they need to meet , currently \u00a3 200,000 a year . This is part of the contract with Bideawhile 445 Ltd who bought the stadium in November 2004 . Minutes after the announcement was made , Sports Editor Jonathan Park spoke to United Chairman Roger Hunt who believes this is a fresh start for the club . He said : \" It 's been a dreadful season in all ways ... this gives the people of Cambridge and the supporters of Cambridge the chance to start afresh . \" Asked whether it 's possible to keep the squad together he said : \" It 's always going to be difficult because we 've only got four players in contract for next season . Like every club , you try and negotiate new contracts - it 's obviously going to be a bit harder going into the Conference , but there are other players that think it 's a good opportunity . \" Regarding the situation with rental payments for the ground , Hunt said : \" It was already paid quarterly in advance which I think expires on the 23rd of June . John Howard has already agreed with the administrator that he will waive the rent completely for the next three months to get us through this period and to help the club come out of administration . So that is a very good gesture , in fairness . \" Responding to a question about the timing of going into administration Hunt said : \" To be really , really honest [ the decision ] should have been taken perhaps when we did n't get the ITV Digital money . We 've struggled on and struggled on and all it 's done is make the spiral even worse and we 've ended up where we have . We should have really taken the decision a lot sooner than we have . \" This large debt was hanging over us , no chance of meeting it , really there was no other alternative . \" Talking about the local companies and suppliers who wo n't be paid Hunt said : \" That has been the main reason for not going into administration before now . Because we are very mindful of these local businesses , most of which do support us very strongly on and off the pitch anyway , and they are true Cambridge United fans . That actually is the hardest pill to swallow and I really ca n't give a satisfactory answer that would suit me , let alone anybody else . \" After a question from a Radio Cambridgeshire listener about where the debt has come from , Hunt said : \" After the ground was sold we did clear all our debts . At that particular time there was a significant shortfall on our gate income and the biggest debt was from Customs and Excise - having sold the ground there was VAT on that sale and that was a big bill . To get through this close season now , with relegation we 've obviously lost a lot of Football League income ... it is impossible , and that is the major creditor . \" Asked what will happen to manager Steve Thompson , Hunt said : \" It 's the administrators decision really . We are working very closely with the administrator , but to be honest it 's a bit too early to call that one and I 'll sit down and talk to Steve first . \" The U's Chairman does n't see this as the end of the club : \" It simply draws the line under a very , very sad season . \" Crisis Timeline : 29th November 2004 : At an emergency meeting , Cambridge United shareholders approved the sale and lease back of the Abbey Stadium for \u00a3 1,923,000 to Bideawhile 445 Ltd. 12th December 2004 : Manager Herve Renard is sacked . 28th December 2004 : Steve Thompson appointed as manager . 17th January 2005 : Cambridge Fans United announce plans to ' Buy back the Abbey ' at their AGM . 29th January 2005 : Cambridge lose a crucial match against Kidderminster , leaving them trailing at the bottom of the League Two table . 31st January 2005 : At the club 's AGM it was revealed that Cambridge United has just 28 days to save itself .

The bottom line is how can the club keep going by spending the least amount of money ... \" It also means people who are owed money by the club may not be paid , although Finance Director Pomery has said that \" suppliers have assurance that any future supplies ordered by administrators will be paid for in full . \" | Roger Hunt | The administrators will also be looking at the rental payments for the ground which they need to meet , currently \u00a3 200,000 a year . This is part of the contract with Bideawhile 445 Ltd who bought the stadium in November 2004 . Minutes after the announcement was made , Sports Editor Jonathan Park spoke to United Chairman Roger Hunt who believes this is a fresh start for the club . He said : \" It 's been a dreadful season in all ways ... this gives the people of Cambridge and the supporters of Cambridge the chance to start afresh . \" Asked whether it 's possible to keep the squad together he said : \" It 's always going to be difficult because we 've only got four players in contract for next season . Like every club , you try and negotiate new contracts - it 's obviously going to be a bit harder going into the Conference , but there are other players that think it 's a good opportunity . \" Regarding the situation with rental payments for the ground , Hunt said : \" It was already paid quarterly in advance which I think expires on the 23rd of June . John Howard has already agreed with the administrator that he will waive the rent completely for the next three months to get us through this period and to help the club come out of administration . So that is a very good gesture , in fairness . \" Responding to a question about the timing of going into administration Hunt said : \" To be really , really honest [ the decision ] should have been taken perhaps when we did n't get the ITV Digital money . We 've struggled on and struggled on and all it 's done is make the spiral even worse and we 've ended up where we have . We should have really taken the decision a lot sooner than we have . \" This large debt was hanging over us , no chance of meeting it , really there was no other alternative . \" Talking about the local companies and suppliers who wo n't be paid Hunt said : \" That has been the main reason for not going into administration before now . Because we are very mindful of these local businesses , most of which do support us very strongly on and off the pitch anyway , and they are true Cambridge United fans . That actually is the hardest pill to swallow and I really ca n't give a satisfactory answer that would suit me , let alone anybody else . \" After a question from a Radio Cambridgeshire listener about where the debt has come from , Hunt said : \" After the ground was sold we did clear all our debts . At that particular time there was a significant shortfall on our gate income and the biggest debt was from Customs and Excise - having sold the ground there was VAT on that sale and that was a big bill . To get through this close season now , with relegation we 've obviously lost a lot of Football League income ... it is impossible , and that is the major creditor . \" Asked what will happen to manager Steve Thompson , Hunt said : \" It 's the administrators decision really . We are working very closely with the administrator , but to be honest it 's a bit too early to call that one and I 'll sit down and talk to Steve first . \" The U's Chairman does n't see this as the end of the club : \" It simply draws the line under a very , very sad season . \" Crisis Timeline : 29th November 2004 : At an emergency meeting , Cambridge United shareholders approved the sale and lease back of the Abbey Stadium for \u00a3 1,923,000 to Bideawhile 445 Ltd. 12th December 2004 : Manager Herve Renard is sacked . 28th December 2004 : Steve Thompson appointed as manager . 17th January 2005 : Cambridge Fans United announce plans to ' Buy back the Abbey ' at their AGM . 29th January 2005 : Cambridge lose a crucial match against Kidderminster , leaving them trailing at the bottom of the League Two table . 31st January 2005 : At the club 's AGM it was revealed that Cambridge United has just 28 days to save itself .

Everything else presented is pure bunk \u2013 in more ways than one . As the trailers and commercial spots for Primeval have done an excellent job telling us , Gustave is the world 's most prolific serial killer with over 300 kills to his name . The same trailers and commercial spots have gone out of their way to avoid letting us know that Gustave is , in fact , an enormous man-eating crocodile . One has to wonder whether or not the choice to try and keep Gustave 's true nature a secret was a brilliant stroke of marketing or evidence that the studio had little or no faith in getting audiences into theaters to watch a movie about a killer crocodile , even one that 's \u201c inspired by true events , \u201d or that they just knew the film was lousy and decided to unload it into the cinematic dumping ground that is January . The way Hollywood Pictures pulled up stakes and abruptly ( and unceremoniously ) changed Primeval 's release date from April 13th to January 12th with less than two weeks ' notice kind of gave me the vibe that the latter was probably more accurate . Now that I 've seen the film for myself , I 'm positive it had to have been the latter . But first things first . Just who is Gustave ? Having done my own research into the subject matter , I can tell you that Gustave is indeed a killer crocodile that has been terrorizing the riverbanks around Lake Tanganyika in Burundi , Africa . Gustave , who got his name from a French resident of Burundi , is one of the largest crocodiles ever reported at twenty feet in length and weighing around one ton . It 's believed that the three times larger than the average croc Gustave became too big to sustain itself on a typical crocodile diet and thus began eating people . An unconfirmed number claims that Gustave has consumed in excess of 300 fishermen and bathers . Some have tried to capture or kill Gustave only to lose their lives in the process or come away missing a few limbs . And since many of the commercials have gone on the record telling us that Gustave is \u201c still at large , \u201d they 've already done the audience a disservice by more or less telling us how the movie wo n't end . Now that part of the marketing was unquestionably asinine . Well , guess what , everyone ; turns out that the movie 's marketers got us with a double whammy . This movie about a killer crocodile that 's been deceptively marketed as a serial killer flick turns out to not even really be a movie about a killer crocodile . Primeval is really more of a liberal guilt trip thriller about African genocide and how the rest of the world , especially we affluent American honkies , just do n't give a damn about poor black people killing other poor black people . Gustave is more or less the catalyst to get the characters to Africa and only cameos briefly throughout the film . Right when the kill or be killed by Gustave part of the movie should be kicking in , the croc suddenly takes a backseat to the protagonists ' thoroughly lame life or death struggle with the ruthless henchmen of an African warlord . Imagine a really poor man 's Blood Diamond that just happens to also feature an enormous man-eating crocodile ; that 's what Primeval really is . We 'll even be browbeaten at one point with an insipid monologue about how we 're all responsible for the creation of Gustave by not doing anything about the civil wars in Africa . Give me a break ! Dominic Purcell of \u201c Prison Break \u201d fame plays a Network News Channel ( I guess calling it the Network News Network would have just been too hokey for the filmmakers ) producer in hot water after a scandalous story he broke regarding a powerful Senator 's corruption turns out to have been erroneous . The NNC honcho decides to get him out of the country for a while by assigning him to a story about a killer crocodile in Burundi , Africa that just killed a humanitarian aide worker ( as seen in the film 's effective opening sequence ) . His boss does n't just want him to fly to Africa and produce the story ; he wants the croc captured alive in time for sweeps . Purcell is unhappy and thinks this fluff piece is beneath him . Right off the bat we got a major miscasting problem as Dominic Purcell 's physical scruffiness and often surly demeanor make him look and sound more appropriate for the role of a guy competing in the UFC Octagon than a character that is supposed to be a Peabody Award winning television news producer . Anchoring the segment will be the network 's go - to reporter for animal related news items played by The Replacement 's Brooke Langton . Her sole contribution to the film is to provide an easy on the eyes female . I 'm sure it will come as no shock to you to hear that Primeval is yet another one of those movies where the two actors in the group with the least amount of personality get to be the two main characters almost entirely due to their being the most photogenic . Say what I may about the other characters I 'm about to describe , none are as one-dimensionally shallow as those played by Purcell and Langton . Of course , where would we be without the wisecracking black cameraman played by Orlando Jones ? Ugh . Damn near every line of dialogue that comes out of his mouth is meant to be funny , and I 'd reckon that the ratio of stuff he says that actually is humorous is about 20 - to - 1 against . He gets off about three or four that actually elicit a chuckle and one that is legitimately laugh out loud funny , but mostly he 's just obnoxious as the stereotypical wisecracking black sidekick who rarely takes anything seriously , even when face - to - snout with a giant crocodile . When Jones goes off on a comedic tirade about how much he hates Africa , he even tosses out a few lines about how in retrospect slavery was n't a bad thing after all because it got his people out of Africa . It 's embarrassing . As a matter of fact , one especially insulting scene has Jones trying to teach some African bushmen how to do a hip - hop beat with their native drums with no success , prompting his character to utter the line , \u201c This is embarrassing . \u201d Ten bucks says that was an ad lib . Jones ' cameraman also gets to befriend a young African youth in a Nike shirt who speaks English and longs to travel to America . This young man will play a key role in their impending confrontation with armed thugs to the point of factoring into the plot almost more than the giant crocodile does . The NNC trio joins up with the other two more members of their croc hunt upon arriving in Africa . One is an Aussie crocodile hunter clearly based on the late Steve Irwin . The other is Jurgen Prochnow playing one of those roles he can sleepwalk his way through . In this case he 's a local hunter who 'll serve as their tour guide and translator . But mostly he get into arguments with the crocodile hunter because the croc hunter wants to capture Gustave alive in this giant cage they brought , arguing that he wants to protect it from people like Prochnow , and , naturally , Prochnow insists that capture is impossible and the bulletproof ( literally ! ) crocodile must be killed . Guess which one will prove to be correct ? They 've all got bigger problems though . Burundi is in the midst of a civil war , although their NNC boss assured them they 'll be okay because there 's currently a cease - fire . They 'd never know it since their boat is immediately shot at and they are given dire warning that where they are headed is in the vicinity of the local warlord known as \u201c Little Gustave . \u201d He 's such a heartless butcher that he nicknamed himself after the killer croc . He 's also the real villain of the movie \u2013 well , mostly his henchmen are . Orlando Jones will go for a solo walk through the African brush to get some footage of the local scenery and stumble upon some of Little Gustave 's henchmen executing a family . Of course , he gets it on film and , of course , Little Gustave 's men will want that footage back and are willing to kill for it . The group will debate whether or not this footage is the real story they need to cover , not the crocodile , leading to a big discussion about world apathy towards African genocide . I hate to sound apathetic in my own right toward African genocide , but was n't this supposed to be a \u201c nature gone amok \u201d horror flick about a killer crocodile ? Forget the giant , cunning , man-eating crocodile ; Primeval suddenly decides it wants to be a socially conscientious thriller with sporadic appearances by a giant , cunning , man-eating crocodile . The script will devolve to the point that Gustave is just popping up in time to chomp one of the bad guys at just the right moment . Heck , Little Gustave 's thugs even generate more carnage than \u201c the world 's most prolific serial killer \u201d does . But even the few and far between \u201c nature gone amok \u201d moments when Gustave does show up are almost guaranteed to disappoint , not just because the computer generated crocodile often appears obviously so , but because director Michael Katleman and editor Gabriel Wrye have co-conspired to make nearly all the croc attack scenes virtually incomprehensible to watch thanks to the one - two punch of jittery camera work and rapid-fire editing . It 's kind of hard to generate suspense or thrills when you hardly have any idea what is actually happening on the screen . The only moment in the entire movie where you get a really good look at Gustave in action that is n't in any way obscured by either darkness , bad camerawork , or split second editing is near the end when it engages in a foot race in pursuit of Orlando Jones ( despite real - life reports of Gustave being rather slow - moving due to its enormity ) . This was the most suspenseful moment of the movie for me as I was on the edge of my seat hoping that croc would catch Orlando Jones and chomp the hell out of him . Other than that , there 's only one genuine jump scare in the whole film . Now I generally frown on people talking back at the screen in movie theaters , that sort of behavior being a pet peeve of mine that I myself have rarely ever given into . However , I could n't help myself with Primeval . When the little doggie that Brooke Langton had rescued from being used as croc bait early in the film , the same little doggie that we had n't see hide nor hair of for the last 40 minutes , came from completely out of nowhere at the end of the movie to jump into her loving arms , I openly began booing the movie . I do n't think any of the five other people in the screening would object to my having done so since I overheard all of them on the way out afterwards commenting on what a terrible movie Primeval was . This film marks the first of two killer crocodile movies hitting theaters this year , assuming Dimension Films does n't just sit on the currently unscheduled for a release date Rogue . How Rogue will turn out remains to be seen , but I can safely say right now that if you only see one killer crocodile movie in theaters this year , make sure it 's not Primeval . 1 out of 5 Discuss Primeval in our forums !

February was same month in which his father , Edgar Rice Burroughs , decided to make a full - time career of writing . In fact , ERB dedicated the first novel he wrote , A Princess of Mars , to young John . \" John \" was obviously a favourite name of ERB 's -- as well as giving the name to his youngest son , he also christened his two best-known heroes with the name , and even used it once as a pseudonym : John Tyler McCulloch . The ancestor of whom Ed was most proud was Virginia settler , John Coleman . Coleman was also Ed 's brother 's name . JCB ( Jack ) and his older sister and brother Joan ( pronounced Jo- Anne ) and Hulbert ( Hully ) were all brought up on Tarzan stories and were encouraged to develop a great appreciation for the outdoors and nature . By all accounts ERB was an excellent father and his most prolific and artistic writing period coincided with the period of time when his three children were probably most demanding . He had said , \" Were I literary and afflicted with temperament I should have a devil of a time writing stories ... \" ERB was a complex man who had few real friends , but two of his closest friends and confidantes throughout the rest of his life would be his sons , John and Hulbert . In discussions with them he shared his dislike for any form of organized religion , and often called himself an atheist , but he obviously had a great respect for intelligent reason , humanism and nature . He imparted in his sons a code of love and understanding of wildlife that was over a half century ahead of the current ecological movements . The family went on many outdoor excursions together , the first being a cross - country trip from Chicago to California in 1913 -- Jack was a six-month -old infant at the time . A more rigorous automobile camping tour was undertaken in 1916 . The San Fernando Valley ranch , to which they moved in 1919 , was full of abundant wildlife and the family spent countless hours exploring its rugged untouched terrain , both on foot and horseback -- roaming from Pacific beaches , through arroyos and up mountainsides . The famous ERB Doodad was created during one of their outdoor adventures in the high Sierras in 1924 when Ed sketched it out in the sand on a riverbank . This symbol was to become the famous colophon which appears on most of the ERB books . Each family member , however , had his own special variant of the doodad : Ed 's circle was to the right of the \" spear , \" Hulbert 's circle was below , and Jack 's was to the left . The family embarked on numerous other auto expeditions : the Grand Canyon area in August , 1926 and Death Valley in April 1933 . The famous ERB Doodad was created during one of their outdoor adventures in the high Sierras in 1924 when Ed sketched it out in the sand on a riverbank . This symbol was to become the famous colophon which appears on most of the ERB books . Each family member , however , had his own special variant of the doodad : Ed 's circle was to the right of the \" spear , \" Hulbert 's circle was below , and Jack 's was to the left . The family embarked on numerous other auto expeditions : the Grand Canyon area in August , 1926 and Death Valley in April 1933 . The Burroughs family moved to California when Jack was six , and settled on the 550 - acre Harrison Gray Otis , Mil Flores estate , which they re-christened Tarzana . The Burroughs children were constantly exposed to activity and excitement : meeting celebrities , visiting movie sets , horseback riding and motoring with their famous father . Young Jack , perhaps the most sensitive of the three Burroughs children , showed an early aptitude for art and was given his first lessons by his father who himself was quite a good cartoonist . Papa , as Jack called his father , would encourage him by telling him wild tales , showing him the fundamentals of drawing and encouraging his creative interests at every opportunity . Both boys soon were enrolled in LA 's Page Military Academy but when eight - year - old Jack , a sensitive and timid child , could n't adjust to the strict regimen he was pulled out in mid-year and tutored at home for the rest of the year . The boy had nearly died of diphtheria soon after their move to Tarzana and later , in 1921 , both Jack and Hulbert contracted mild cases of polio . As a result , Ed and Emma were worried about them being exposed to diseases in public schools . Around the time that he was being tutored at home , Jack was enrolled , temporarily , in the Hollywood School for Girls . Both boys eventually were enrolled at the Los Angeles Coaching School . Later , Jack attended Urban Military Academy and later , John Burroughs and Van Nuys High Schools , graduating in 1930 . During this schooling period , Jack achieved an early success in creative writing . His father helped him in writing poetry and developing metre . Undoubtedly influenced by his father 's stories , he composed fantastic science fiction serials , devising plots about monsters coming out of the ocean or collisions between planets . He provided his own illustrations for these stories . His interest in drawing had been noticeable several years before , when he began copying or tracing the colourful illustrations made by J. Allen St. John . Other students would wait eagerly to read Jack 's stories and hear each new installment of the serials which he read in class . He was emulating his father 's style of cliffhanger endings . Expanding upon his writing skills , Jack took on the role of sports editor at Van Nuys High School . A curious choice for one who did not like sports at the time . He dreaded writing up the football or basketball games and usually turned in his assignments at the last moment . Born : 6 March 1916 , Oklahoma City One of his best friends at school was Rochelle Hudson , a movie starlet at 13 . Since she lived near Ventura Boulevard , she was often given a ride to school by Jack and Hulbert . Snubbed by most of her schoolmates because of her fame as a movie star , she became a good friend of the Burroughs family and even took vacation trips with them . On one occasion , sixteen - year - old Jack drove Rochelle and her mother on a trip to Oklahoma City . Living so close to Hollywood , coupled with their father 's association with the film industry , offered many advantages to the Burroughs kids . In 1920 a film company gave them lion cubs and monkeys for Christmas . The monkeys turned out to be quite vicious , however , and the lions had voracious appetites -- a more suitable home was soon found for the animals . Ed treated the family and even members of the Hollywood community to regular showings of feature films in the ballroom of a building he had built near the main house . The second story of the building contained a darkroom and ERB 's study which was used as a schoolroom where the children were tutored . Another source of excitement for Jack was the number of films which were shot on location in the canyon on the back of the ranch . ERB 's novel , The Girl from Hollywood , actually presents a thinly veiled description of Burroughs family life on Tarzana Ranch in the twenties . Pursuing his interest in art , John Coleman enrolled in Pomona College in 1930 . Before he left for college , his father had confided that he was not in agreement with much of what colleges stood for and also that he feared that Jack would meet literary people who would deride the Burroughs stories . Ed urged his son not to take these criticisms seriously and repeated statements he often made about his work . He had no pretensions about being a skilled or profound writer ; his sole purpose was to create entertainment for the reader . Jack shared his father 's appreciation of classical art and he worked hard to learn the basic techniques of the old masters . In one of the courses he studied anatomy by dissecting a human cadaver . He recalls working in the \" Biology Department basement at night with children 's big eyes watching me through the high basement window as I worked on my half of the specimen assigned to me . \" Jack was very successful in his four years at Pomona College and he graduated with honours in 1934 ( Phi Beta Kappa , magna cum lauda ) . For his graduate project he acquired some real sabre - tooth tiger bones from the Los Angeles County Museum , which had recovered them from the La Brea tar pits . He then used these bones for inspiration in the creation of a model of a saber - tooth tiger , which was considered an outstanding piece of work and was placed on exhibition at the Los Angeles Art Museum . Influenced by his father 's interest in flying , Jack took weekend flying lessons in 1934 , but it was around this time that his father and mother separated , an event which had a tremendously disruptive effect on the entire family . Ed had often confided in both of his sons as to the difficulties presented to his marriage by their mother 's drinking problem , but the actual separation proved to be a great shock . Hully and Jack moved with mother , Emma , to a house in Bel -Air , a stylish suburb west of Beverly Hills and from then until her death on November 5 , 1944 , they took on much of the responsibility of caring for her . Jack had explained the situation by saying , \" My father was sensitive and idealistic about women . He wanted them to be like his heroines , fine and virtuous . The idea of his wife as a victim of alcohol was difficult for him to accept . His generation thought that drinkiing by women was immoral . \" Although Jack and the rest of the family obviously did not fully approve of Ed 's developing relationship with family friend and one - time movie starlet , Florence Dearholt , he and Florence 's brother , Eddie Gilbert did become good friends . Jack married Pomona classmate , Jane Ralston , on 12 December , 1936 -- they were both 23 years old . Jack and Jane 's first child -- John Ralston -- was born on 22 June , 1942 ( less than two months after Ed 's May 4th divorce from Florence ) . Their second son , Danton , was born on 2 June , 1944 and they later had a daughter , Dian . Today , all three of the children carry on the Burroughs legacy by being actively involved in the arts , entertainment and the running of ERB , Inc . All of Edgar Rice Burroughs ' children were fans of their father 's writing , but only JCB has actually added significantly to ERB 's works with new creative material , although Hulbert was very involved in ERB , Inc.business matters . Since John grew up in an atmosphere saturated by his father 's famous creations , it is not surprising that one of his major influences was J. Allen St. John , who illustrated most of the early ERB works . Nor is it surprising that his first excursions into the professional art world would be influenced by ERB themes . After graduating from Pomona , John did preliminary work , with friend and former Otis Art Institute classmate , Bob Clampett , on an animated version of John Carter of Mars . Clampett , who had developed the Porky Pig and Merrie Melodies cartoons at Warner Brothers , convinced ERB of the potential of developing his fantastic stories into animated features . Since Clampett was still holding down a full - time job at Warners , the work on their short test film had to be done at night and on weekends . Clampett did the animation , while Jack and wife Jane painted the cells and designed the characters . ERB took the finished product to MGM but , although they were interested , they believed that such a project should involve the wildly popular Tarzan which already had a proven name . So , in 1936 , Burroughs travelled to Chicago and New York to lay the ground work for launching a Tarzan cartoon feature under the company name Tarzantoons , Inc . He even convinced J. Allen St. John to help out with the project but when Leon Schlesinger offered Clampett a chance to head up his own production unit at Warners , the Tarzan project fizzled . If they had sold A Princess of Mars , it would have been the first full - length serious cartoon ever done -- preceding Disney 's Snow White by quite few years . The Tarzan cartoon was to be a short , featuring a serious Tarzan , with the animals providing comedy relief . At age 23 , he was given the chance to illustrate his father 's book , The Oakdale Affair and the Rider , a combination of two 1918 magazine stories which the author finally got around to publishing on February 15 , 1937 . A few months earlier , Ed had written to St. John : \" ... it has always been the ambition of my son , Jack , and myself that one day he would illustrate one of my books . He is doing very excellent work , and I am having him illustrate the Spring book for us . \" Jack commented at the time that he was well aware he had not yet attained the ability of a St. John , but was deeply grateful to his father for the unprecedented opportunity afforded him . JCB was very dedicated to his art and threw himself completely into his work , striving hard to justify his father 's faith in him . He used his wife , Jane Ralston , and his brother - in - law , James Pierce as models for the dust jacket , which he painted on a 30 \" x 50 \" canvas . The cover and the two interior illustrations were a success and he matured rapidly as an artist . He went on to illustrate all future ERB books published during the author 's lifetime - a total of over 125 illustrations . Perhaps one of the most curious and unique projects that JCB and his father collaborated on came about in 1937 . Popular Hollywood actress , Colleen Moore , invited ERB to contribute a tiny Tarzan book for her miniature Fairy Castle Collection at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago . What she received was an original fable featuring a princess and Tarzan , Jr. written by ERB and illustrated by John Coleman Burroughs . The unusual thing about this story is that it was printed , by hand , in a one - of - a- kind , one inch by one inch , miniature book . In the fantasy and science fiction field , John Coleman and Hulbert collaborated on two novelettes , The Man Without A World and The Lightning Men , which appeared in the June 1939 and February 1940 issues of Thrilling Wonder Stories . They then wrote a novel , The Bottom of the World , which appeared in the September 1941 issue of Startling Stories complete with seven illustrations by JCB . Hybrid of Horror , written in collaboration with Jane Ralston Burroughs , appeared as the feature novelette in the July 1940 issue of Thrilling Mystery . JCB 's first venture into comics was for Dell 's The Funnies , in which he took over a John Carter of Mars strip . His work was featured in issues # 34 ( August 1939 ) through # 56 ( June 1941 ) with a total of 152 pages . Twelve pages introducing the Chessmen of Mars , never reached publication . Dell reprinted much of the John Carter art from The Funnies ( nos. 30 through 39 ) in a 1940 Fast Action Book for which JCB did the cover . JCB 's art has appeared on the covers of several Whitman Publishing Company Better Little Books , including four of the Tarzan titles : Tarzan the Untamed , Tarzan the Terrible , Tarzan and the Golden Lion and Tarzan and the Ant Men . The Untamed and Terrible BLBs included JCB flip animation in the upper right hand corners . Other Whitman assignments included covers and animations for The Shadow and the Ghost Makers and Inspector Charlie Chan . Whitman also published a John Carter story in a Big Little Book in 1940 which was a new original publication with story , cover and illustrations by JCB . An expanded re-working of this story would eventually appear in the January 1941 and April 1961 issues of Amazing Stories as John Carter and the Giant of Mars . It then appeared in the book , John Carter of Mars , published by Canaveral Press and Ballantine Books Another 1940s comics adaptation was David Innes of Pellucidar for which he drew 32 pages . The first 12 pages appeared in Hi-Spot Comics . All 32 pages , plus related sketches were eventually published in 1968 by Greystoke Press in a 56 - page booklet . In 1941 , he wrote and illustrated 69 weeks of a syndicated colour Sunday newspaper strip , John Carter of Mars which debuted in The Chicago Sun , December 7 , 1941 . This debute coincided with the Pearl Harbor attack , resulting in the series being picked up by very few papers . The strip began with a Princess of Mars adaptation but departed from the original with episode 5 . JCB explained that this was done at the request of United Features Syndicate in order to provide more action in the weekly episodes . Continuing with the Burroughs tradition of family involvement , John 's wife , Jane Ralston Burroughs , helped with the backgrounds , inking and lettering of the strip and even served as model for Dejah Thoris . As with all of his art projects , he entered into the work with full abandon -- going so far as to create a model Barsoomian thoat with many moving parts . However , fierce competition among the newspaper strips , brought about by wartime paper shortages and the general upheaval in the publishing industry , resulted in the folding of the John Carter series in March 1943 . JCB then went to work for the Douglas Aircraft Industrial Training Department where he wrote and illustrated a number of WWII training manuals . Then , after some time with Warner Brothers and Universal Studios art departments , JCB decided to devote more of his time to his own art , specializing in unusual action , scenic pictures of the West and old Mexico and exotic portraits . His best work involves portrait studies of native Americans and Mexicans done in boldly brushed colours . When speaking of illustrating his father 's books , John Coleman said , \" I believe J. Allen St. John , who illustrated Dad 's stories , caught the spirit of them better than anyone has since . I hope someday to be able to do this job as well as he - which is a high mark to shoot for , anyway . \" Many years ago when JCB was very young and like thousands of his father 's fans was actually living the part of Tarzan in playful pretense , he was following his father 's footsteps , nose to the ground and on all fours . \" What in the world are you doing , Jack ? \" his father asked . \" I am following your spoor , \" his young son replied . And although JCB is famous and successful in his own chosen field , it was by following the trail blazed by his father that it was possible for him to give pleasure to the mind and eyes of Burroughs fans by creating new adventures , in text and pictures , for ERB 's characters . Edgar Rice Burroughs died on 19 March 1950 and was cremated at the Chapel of the Pines in Los Angeles . Following his father 's wishes , Jack picked up the ashes on March 27 and they were buried beside Ed 's mother 's remains under the Black Walnut tree that shaded the ERB , Inc. offices in Tarzana . After the death of his father , he shifted his talents from illustration and back to fine art . JCB worked constantly on technique . According to his second wife , Mary Burroughs , they first met when he was enrolled under an assumed name in a summer night course at Pierce Community College in the ' 50s ( a college where he later was hired to teach art classes ) . He had joined the class because it offered him an opportunity to work with live models and to mix with other serious artists . Mary claims that one of his major influences was the Russian / American artist , Nicolai Fechin ( 1881 - 1955 ) with whom he studied after he left Pomona . The Fechin influences are especially evident in his bold brushed colours and his portrait styles . John and Jane Ralston divorced in 1961 and Mary and he married soon after , on December 16 , 1961 . It was around this time that he contracted what was later perceived to be meningitis or encephalitis on a trip to Tijuana . He was close to death for some time but survived . Mary believes that it was actually this disease which brought on the condition that was diagnosed as Parkinson 's -- the crippling effects of which he battled until his death 18 years later . Jack sought the best medical treatment available . For awhile he was under the care of the now- famous neurologist , Oliver Sachs ( he was played by Robin Williams in the movie Awakenings ) . Thanks to Hulberts assistance , he was able to obtain permission to become one of the first Americans to use the then - experimental drug , LDopamine with many positive results . He refused to accept that he had contracted the disease which had disabled his father in his last years , and spent many of his final years battling depression and debilitation which robbed him of his ability to paint . John and Mary divorced after 11 years of marriage . The years that Mary and her children shared with John were bittersweet he was in poor health for much of the time but his charisma and aura obviously left them with unforgettable memories of his love , warmth and courage . JCB 's last novel , Treasure of the Black Falcon , was published by Ballantine Books , Inc. , March 1967 . It had been written twenty years earlier but was shelved and forgotten after numerous rejections . During the Burroughs boom of the ' 60s , however , Hulbert came across the manuscript and submitted it to Ballantine where it was eagerly accepted . John Coleman 's dedication in the book reads : \" To my brother Hulbert who found the Treasure . \" Ballantine 's cover blurb reads : \" A new name in fantastic adventure -- a name that perpetuates the best traditions of the creator of the Tarzan and Mars books . Bursting with action , packed with new ideas , TREASURE OF THE BLACK FALCON is thrilling adventure in the grand tradition . Ballantine Books is proud to be the publisher of JOHN COLEMAN BURROUGHS . \" John Coleman Burroughs died on February 22 , 1979 The works of art created by John Coleman Burroughs have been exhibited in galleries and one- man shows throughout the United States and his portraits and western paintings adorn the homes of many celebrities . John Coleman 's second wife , Mary , remembers the day , while driving down Ventura Boulevard , they saw one of his paintings for sale in the window of an art gallery . John recognized it as one that used to hang in the Harpo Marx house which had been sold after his death . John and Mary bought back the painting . She also recognized one of John 's paintings hanging in Barry Goldwater 's house in the newspaper pictures which were published after his death . Probably the largest collection of John 's paintings is owned by son Danton and ERB , Inc . The best printed compilation of his work is exhibited in The Edgar Rice Burroughs Library of Illustration by Russ Cochran . Volume 2 of this three volume set is dedicated to JCB and features most of his ERB art and comic strip work . It is a gorgeous rare limited edition with copies owned and treasured by most members of the Burroughs family and many of the late artist 's friends .

February was same month in which his father , Edgar Rice Burroughs , decided to make a full - time career of writing . In fact , ERB dedicated the first novel he wrote , A Princess of Mars , to young John . \" John \" was obviously a favourite name of ERB 's -- as well as giving the name to his youngest son , he also christened his two best-known heroes with the name , and even used it once as a pseudonym : John Tyler McCulloch . The ancestor of whom Ed was most proud was Virginia settler , John Coleman . Coleman was also Ed 's brother 's name . JCB ( Jack ) and his older sister and brother Joan ( pronounced Jo- Anne ) and Hulbert ( Hully ) were all brought up on Tarzan stories and were encouraged to develop a great appreciation for the outdoors and nature . By all accounts ERB was an excellent father and his most prolific and artistic writing period coincided with the period of time when his three children were probably most demanding . He had said , \" Were I literary and afflicted with temperament I should have a devil of a time writing stories ... \" ERB was a complex man who had few real friends , but two of his closest friends and confidantes throughout the rest of his life would be his sons , John and Hulbert . In discussions with them he shared his dislike for any form of organized religion , and often called himself an atheist , but he obviously had a great respect for intelligent reason , humanism and nature . He imparted in his sons a code of love and understanding of wildlife that was over a half century ahead of the current ecological movements . The family went on many outdoor excursions together , the first being a cross - country trip from Chicago to California in 1913 -- Jack was a six-month -old infant at the time . A more rigorous automobile camping tour was undertaken in 1916 . The San Fernando Valley ranch , to which they moved in 1919 , was full of abundant wildlife and the family spent countless hours exploring its rugged untouched terrain , both on foot and horseback -- roaming from Pacific beaches , through arroyos and up mountainsides . The famous ERB Doodad was created during one of their outdoor adventures in the high Sierras in 1924 when Ed sketched it out in the sand on a riverbank . This symbol was to become the famous colophon which appears on most of the ERB books . Each family member , however , had his own special variant of the doodad : Ed 's circle was to the right of the \" spear , \" Hulbert 's circle was below , and Jack 's was to the left . The family embarked on numerous other auto expeditions : the Grand Canyon area in August , 1926 and Death Valley in April 1933 . The famous ERB Doodad was created during one of their outdoor adventures in the high Sierras in 1924 when Ed sketched it out in the sand on a riverbank . This symbol was to become the famous colophon which appears on most of the ERB books . Each family member , however , had his own special variant of the doodad : Ed 's circle was to the right of the \" spear , \" Hulbert 's circle was below , and Jack 's was to the left . The family embarked on numerous other auto expeditions : the Grand Canyon area in August , 1926 and Death Valley in April 1933 . The Burroughs family moved to California when Jack was six , and settled on the 550 - acre Harrison Gray Otis , Mil Flores estate , which they re-christened Tarzana . The Burroughs children were constantly exposed to activity and excitement : meeting celebrities , visiting movie sets , horseback riding and motoring with their famous father . Young Jack , perhaps the most sensitive of the three Burroughs children , showed an early aptitude for art and was given his first lessons by his father who himself was quite a good cartoonist . Papa , as Jack called his father , would encourage him by telling him wild tales , showing him the fundamentals of drawing and encouraging his creative interests at every opportunity . Both boys soon were enrolled in LA 's Page Military Academy but when eight - year - old Jack , a sensitive and timid child , could n't adjust to the strict regimen he was pulled out in mid-year and tutored at home for the rest of the year . The boy had nearly died of diphtheria soon after their move to Tarzana and later , in 1921 , both Jack and Hulbert contracted mild cases of polio . As a result , Ed and Emma were worried about them being exposed to diseases in public schools . Around the time that he was being tutored at home , Jack was enrolled , temporarily , in the Hollywood School for Girls . Both boys eventually were enrolled at the Los Angeles Coaching School . Later , Jack attended Urban Military Academy and later , John Burroughs and Van Nuys High Schools , graduating in 1930 . During this schooling period , Jack achieved an early success in creative writing . His father helped him in writing poetry and developing metre . Undoubtedly influenced by his father 's stories , he composed fantastic science fiction serials , devising plots about monsters coming out of the ocean or collisions between planets . He provided his own illustrations for these stories . His interest in drawing had been noticeable several years before , when he began copying or tracing the colourful illustrations made by J. Allen St. John . Other students would wait eagerly to read Jack 's stories and hear each new installment of the serials which he read in class . He was emulating his father 's style of cliffhanger endings . Expanding upon his writing skills , Jack took on the role of sports editor at Van Nuys High School . A curious choice for one who did not like sports at the time . He dreaded writing up the football or basketball games and usually turned in his assignments at the last moment . Born : 6 March 1916 , Oklahoma City One of his best friends at school was Rochelle Hudson , a movie starlet at 13 . Since she lived near Ventura Boulevard , she was often given a ride to school by Jack and Hulbert . Snubbed by most of her schoolmates because of her fame as a movie star , she became a good friend of the Burroughs family and even took vacation trips with them . On one occasion , sixteen - year - old Jack drove Rochelle and her mother on a trip to Oklahoma City . Living so close to Hollywood , coupled with their father 's association with the film industry , offered many advantages to the Burroughs kids . In 1920 a film company gave them lion cubs and monkeys for Christmas . The monkeys turned out to be quite vicious , however , and the lions had voracious appetites -- a more suitable home was soon found for the animals . Ed treated the family and even members of the Hollywood community to regular showings of feature films in the ballroom of a building he had built near the main house . The second story of the building contained a darkroom and ERB 's study which was used as a schoolroom where the children were tutored . Another source of excitement for Jack was the number of films which were shot on location in the canyon on the back of the ranch . ERB 's novel , The Girl from Hollywood , actually presents a thinly veiled description of Burroughs family life on Tarzana Ranch in the twenties . Pursuing his interest in art , John Coleman enrolled in Pomona College in 1930 . Before he left for college , his father had confided that he was not in agreement with much of what colleges stood for and also that he feared that Jack would meet literary people who would deride the Burroughs stories . Ed urged his son not to take these criticisms seriously and repeated statements he often made about his work . He had no pretensions about being a skilled or profound writer ; his sole purpose was to create entertainment for the reader . Jack shared his father 's appreciation of classical art and he worked hard to learn the basic techniques of the old masters . In one of the courses he studied anatomy by dissecting a human cadaver . He recalls working in the \" Biology Department basement at night with children 's big eyes watching me through the high basement window as I worked on my half of the specimen assigned to me . \" Jack was very successful in his four years at Pomona College and he graduated with honours in 1934 ( Phi Beta Kappa , magna cum lauda ) . For his graduate project he acquired some real sabre - tooth tiger bones from the Los Angeles County Museum , which had recovered them from the La Brea tar pits . He then used these bones for inspiration in the creation of a model of a saber - tooth tiger , which was considered an outstanding piece of work and was placed on exhibition at the Los Angeles Art Museum . Influenced by his father 's interest in flying , Jack took weekend flying lessons in 1934 , but it was around this time that his father and mother separated , an event which had a tremendously disruptive effect on the entire family . Ed had often confided in both of his sons as to the difficulties presented to his marriage by their mother 's drinking problem , but the actual separation proved to be a great shock . Hully and Jack moved with mother , Emma , to a house in Bel -Air , a stylish suburb west of Beverly Hills and from then until her death on November 5 , 1944 , they took on much of the responsibility of caring for her . Jack had explained the situation by saying , \" My father was sensitive and idealistic about women . He wanted them to be like his heroines , fine and virtuous . The idea of his wife as a victim of alcohol was difficult for him to accept . His generation thought that drinkiing by women was immoral . \" Although Jack and the rest of the family obviously did not fully approve of Ed 's developing relationship with family friend and one - time movie starlet , Florence Dearholt , he and Florence 's brother , Eddie Gilbert did become good friends . Jack married Pomona classmate , Jane Ralston , on 12 December , 1936 -- they were both 23 years old . Jack and Jane 's first child -- John Ralston -- was born on 22 June , 1942 ( less than two months after Ed 's May 4th divorce from Florence ) . Their second son , Danton , was born on 2 June , 1944 and they later had a daughter , Dian . Today , all three of the children carry on the Burroughs legacy by being actively involved in the arts , entertainment and the running of ERB , Inc . All of Edgar Rice Burroughs ' children were fans of their father 's writing , but only JCB has actually added significantly to ERB 's works with new creative material , although Hulbert was very involved in ERB , Inc.business matters . Since John grew up in an atmosphere saturated by his father 's famous creations , it is not surprising that one of his major influences was J. Allen St. John , who illustrated most of the early ERB works . Nor is it surprising that his first excursions into the professional art world would be influenced by ERB themes . After graduating from Pomona , John did preliminary work , with friend and former Otis Art Institute classmate , Bob Clampett , on an animated version of John Carter of Mars . Clampett , who had developed the Porky Pig and Merrie Melodies cartoons at Warner Brothers , convinced ERB of the potential of developing his fantastic stories into animated features . Since Clampett was still holding down a full - time job at Warners , the work on their short test film had to be done at night and on weekends . Clampett did the animation , while Jack and wife Jane painted the cells and designed the characters . ERB took the finished product to MGM but , although they were interested , they believed that such a project should involve the wildly popular Tarzan which already had a proven name . So , in 1936 , Burroughs travelled to Chicago and New York to lay the ground work for launching a Tarzan cartoon feature under the company name Tarzantoons , Inc . He even convinced J. Allen St. John to help out with the project but when Leon Schlesinger offered Clampett a chance to head up his own production unit at Warners , the Tarzan project fizzled . If they had sold A Princess of Mars , it would have been the first full - length serious cartoon ever done -- preceding Disney 's Snow White by quite few years . The Tarzan cartoon was to be a short , featuring a serious Tarzan , with the animals providing comedy relief . At age 23 , he was given the chance to illustrate his father 's book , The Oakdale Affair and the Rider , a combination of two 1918 magazine stories which the author finally got around to publishing on February 15 , 1937 . A few months earlier , Ed had written to St. John : \" ... it has always been the ambition of my son , Jack , and myself that one day he would illustrate one of my books . He is doing very excellent work , and I am having him illustrate the Spring book for us . \" Jack commented at the time that he was well aware he had not yet attained the ability of a St. John , but was deeply grateful to his father for the unprecedented opportunity afforded him . JCB was very dedicated to his art and threw himself completely into his work , striving hard to justify his father 's faith in him . He used his wife , Jane Ralston , and his brother - in - law , James Pierce as models for the dust jacket , which he painted on a 30 \" x 50 \" canvas . The cover and the two interior illustrations were a success and he matured rapidly as an artist . He went on to illustrate all future ERB books published during the author 's lifetime - a total of over 125 illustrations . Perhaps one of the most curious and unique projects that JCB and his father collaborated on came about in 1937 . Popular Hollywood actress , Colleen Moore , invited ERB to contribute a tiny Tarzan book for her miniature Fairy Castle Collection at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago . What she received was an original fable featuring a princess and Tarzan , Jr. written by ERB and illustrated by John Coleman Burroughs . The unusual thing about this story is that it was printed , by hand , in a one - of - a- kind , one inch by one inch , miniature book . In the fantasy and science fiction field , John Coleman and Hulbert collaborated on two novelettes , The Man Without A World and The Lightning Men , which appeared in the June 1939 and February 1940 issues of Thrilling Wonder Stories . They then wrote a novel , The Bottom of the World , which appeared in the September 1941 issue of Startling Stories complete with seven illustrations by JCB . Hybrid of Horror , written in collaboration with Jane Ralston Burroughs , appeared as the feature novelette in the July 1940 issue of Thrilling Mystery . JCB 's first venture into comics was for Dell 's The Funnies , in which he took over a John Carter of Mars strip . His work was featured in issues # 34 ( August 1939 ) through # 56 ( June 1941 ) with a total of 152 pages . Twelve pages introducing the Chessmen of Mars , never reached publication . Dell reprinted much of the John Carter art from The Funnies ( nos. 30 through 39 ) in a 1940 Fast Action Book for which JCB did the cover . JCB 's art has appeared on the covers of several Whitman Publishing Company Better Little Books , including four of the Tarzan titles : Tarzan the Untamed , Tarzan the Terrible , Tarzan and the Golden Lion and Tarzan and the Ant Men . The Untamed and Terrible BLBs included JCB flip animation in the upper right hand corners . Other Whitman assignments included covers and animations for The Shadow and the Ghost Makers and Inspector Charlie Chan . Whitman also published a John Carter story in a Big Little Book in 1940 which was a new original publication with story , cover and illustrations by JCB . An expanded re-working of this story would eventually appear in the January 1941 and April 1961 issues of Amazing Stories as John Carter and the Giant of Mars . It then appeared in the book , John Carter of Mars , published by Canaveral Press and Ballantine Books Another 1940s comics adaptation was David Innes of Pellucidar for which he drew 32 pages . The first 12 pages appeared in Hi-Spot Comics . All 32 pages , plus related sketches were eventually published in 1968 by Greystoke Press in a 56 - page booklet . In 1941 , he wrote and illustrated 69 weeks of a syndicated colour Sunday newspaper strip , John Carter of Mars which debuted in The Chicago Sun , December 7 , 1941 . This debute coincided with the Pearl Harbor attack , resulting in the series being picked up by very few papers . The strip began with a Princess of Mars adaptation but departed from the original with episode 5 . JCB explained that this was done at the request of United Features Syndicate in order to provide more action in the weekly episodes . Continuing with the Burroughs tradition of family involvement , John 's wife , Jane Ralston Burroughs , helped with the backgrounds , inking and lettering of the strip and even served as model for Dejah Thoris . As with all of his art projects , he entered into the work with full abandon -- going so far as to create a model Barsoomian thoat with many moving parts . However , fierce competition among the newspaper strips , brought about by wartime paper shortages and the general upheaval in the publishing industry , resulted in the folding of the John Carter series in March 1943 . JCB then went to work for the Douglas Aircraft Industrial Training Department where he wrote and illustrated a number of WWII training manuals . Then , after some time with Warner Brothers and Universal Studios art departments , JCB decided to devote more of his time to his own art , specializing in unusual action , scenic pictures of the West and old Mexico and exotic portraits . His best work involves portrait studies of native Americans and Mexicans done in boldly brushed colours . When speaking of illustrating his father 's books , John Coleman said , \" I believe J. Allen St. John , who illustrated Dad 's stories , caught the spirit of them better than anyone has since . I hope someday to be able to do this job as well as he - which is a high mark to shoot for , anyway . \" Many years ago when JCB was very young and like thousands of his father 's fans was actually living the part of Tarzan in playful pretense , he was following his father 's footsteps , nose to the ground and on all fours . \" What in the world are you doing , Jack ? \" his father asked . \" I am following your spoor , \" his young son replied . And although JCB is famous and successful in his own chosen field , it was by following the trail blazed by his father that it was possible for him to give pleasure to the mind and eyes of Burroughs fans by creating new adventures , in text and pictures , for ERB 's characters . Edgar Rice Burroughs died on 19 March 1950 and was cremated at the Chapel of the Pines in Los Angeles . Following his father 's wishes , Jack picked up the ashes on March 27 and they were buried beside Ed 's mother 's remains under the Black Walnut tree that shaded the ERB , Inc. offices in Tarzana . After the death of his father , he shifted his talents from illustration and back to fine art . JCB worked constantly on technique . According to his second wife , Mary Burroughs , they first met when he was enrolled under an assumed name in a summer night course at Pierce Community College in the ' 50s ( a college where he later was hired to teach art classes ) . He had joined the class because it offered him an opportunity to work with live models and to mix with other serious artists . Mary claims that one of his major influences was the Russian / American artist , Nicolai Fechin ( 1881 - 1955 ) with whom he studied after he left Pomona . The Fechin influences are especially evident in his bold brushed colours and his portrait styles . John and Jane Ralston divorced in 1961 and Mary and he married soon after , on December 16 , 1961 . It was around this time that he contracted what was later perceived to be meningitis or encephalitis on a trip to Tijuana . He was close to death for some time but survived . Mary believes that it was actually this disease which brought on the condition that was diagnosed as Parkinson 's -- the crippling effects of which he battled until his death 18 years later . Jack sought the best medical treatment available . For awhile he was under the care of the now- famous neurologist , Oliver Sachs ( he was played by Robin Williams in the movie Awakenings ) . Thanks to Hulberts assistance , he was able to obtain permission to become one of the first Americans to use the then - experimental drug , LDopamine with many positive results . He refused to accept that he had contracted the disease which had disabled his father in his last years , and spent many of his final years battling depression and debilitation which robbed him of his ability to paint . John and Mary divorced after 11 years of marriage . The years that Mary and her children shared with John were bittersweet he was in poor health for much of the time but his charisma and aura obviously left them with unforgettable memories of his love , warmth and courage . JCB 's last novel , Treasure of the Black Falcon , was published by Ballantine Books , Inc. , March 1967 . It had been written twenty years earlier but was shelved and forgotten after numerous rejections . During the Burroughs boom of the ' 60s , however , Hulbert came across the manuscript and submitted it to Ballantine where it was eagerly accepted . John Coleman 's dedication in the book reads : \" To my brother Hulbert who found the Treasure . \" Ballantine 's cover blurb reads : \" A new name in fantastic adventure -- a name that perpetuates the best traditions of the creator of the Tarzan and Mars books . Bursting with action , packed with new ideas , TREASURE OF THE BLACK FALCON is thrilling adventure in the grand tradition . Ballantine Books is proud to be the publisher of JOHN COLEMAN BURROUGHS . \" John Coleman Burroughs died on February 22 , 1979 The works of art created by John Coleman Burroughs have been exhibited in galleries and one- man shows throughout the United States and his portraits and western paintings adorn the homes of many celebrities . John Coleman 's second wife , Mary , remembers the day , while driving down Ventura Boulevard , they saw one of his paintings for sale in the window of an art gallery . John recognized it as one that used to hang in the Harpo Marx house which had been sold after his death . John and Mary bought back the painting . She also recognized one of John 's paintings hanging in Barry Goldwater 's house in the newspaper pictures which were published after his death . Probably the largest collection of John 's paintings is owned by son Danton and ERB , Inc . The best printed compilation of his work is exhibited in The Edgar Rice Burroughs Library of Illustration by Russ Cochran . Volume 2 of this three volume set is dedicated to JCB and features most of his ERB art and comic strip work . It is a gorgeous rare limited edition with copies owned and treasured by most members of the Burroughs family and many of the late artist 's friends .

Sunday marked his second year attending 4/20 , an informal marijuana - focused festival of thousands on Hippie Hill in Golden Gate Park , and Nathan - \" just Nathan \" - had traveled from Salinas to be part of the communal partaking of cannabis . \" Everyone is so nice , \" he said , taking another drag , adding that it was fortuitously Easter , albeit an untraditional acknowledgment of it . \" Everyone is coming together to celebrate something . \" While the vibe in the park was for the most part mellow , city and park officials were keeping a wary eye on the event . They did n't care about the cannabis . They cared about the clogged streets , illegally parked cars and mounds of trash . There were several arrests by late afternoon , according to reports . Last year , the crowds left 10,000 pounds of garbage in their wake and created at - a-standstill traffic jams as the revelers flooded the Haight - Ashbury neighborhood . Supervisor London Breed said she did n't want to be a \" buzzkill . \" But Breed , whose district includes the Haight and the park area , did n't want a repeat of last year 's chaos and two -day cleanup . She noted that smoking anything in any city park is illegal , but San Francisco has a tradition of turning a blind eye to infractions for official or unofficial events . City officials said they would be cracking down on several violations , including structures or canopies , amplified sound , alcoholic beverages , tree climbing , fires , and peddling or vending without a permit . Lenient attitude Yet Hippie Hill and Sharon Meadow below it were covered in canopies , with speakers blaring music , bottles and cans of beer everywhere , an occasional tree climber , several barbecues , and dozens if not hundreds of people selling a range of regular and \" medicinal \" items . \" Lollipops ( laced with cannabis ) , two for $ 5 , \" one entrepreneurial woman yelled . \" Joints for $ 2 . \" \" Chili cheese Cheetos , Doritos , Fritos , \" yelled a man selling the straight snacks . \" I got it right here . Fritos . Cheetos . Boom ! \" So many people were selling pot cookies , pot brownies , pot cupcakes and other bacchanalian treats that sales were pretty slow , many of the impromptu vendors said . \" I 'm pretty baked , so it 's slow going , \" one sucker - selling woman said . Yet there was no visible police presence in the meadow or on the hill . \" Ultimately , we want people to enjoy the park peacefully , \" said Connie Chan , spokeswoman for the Recreation and Park Department . Elias Pizano , 29 , drove from Modesto and arrived at the meadow at 6:30 a.m. , a car - size beach ball in tow . \" It 's like a celebration , \" he said . \" Everybody is happy . \" No place to go That was arguably an overstatement . Among those not happy : people who needed a potty break in the midst of the pot smoking . Because it was a non-sanctioned event , there were n't any portable bathrooms on hand , just a few stalls in permanent park bathrooms and a plethora of trees and bushes to accommodate the 10,000 or so revelers . Similar events were taking place in other cities across the state and country , each hitting its peak at 4:20 p.m. with a shared communal high . Yet the celebration comes as San Francisco and the state continue to grapple with the issue of relaxed laws on marijuana . In San Francisco earlier this month , the City Planning Commission approved restrictions to limit the growth of cannabis dispensaries in the Ocean Avenue neighborhood . California voted to legalize medical marijuana in 1996 . But Gov. Jerry Brown said recently he is watching closely to see how Colorado and Washington handle new laws that regulate the growth and sale of taxed recreational marijuana at state- licensed stores . In San Francisco , officials were more focused Sunday on keeping the temporary cardboard trash cans from overflowing and traffic moving around neighboring streets . Barriers prevented cars from entering the park and from accessing Haight Street . Trash collectors And a handful of park workers on overtime pay mingled with the crowd , picking up trash . As 4:20 p.m. approached , however , trash started to dot the hillside and meadow , despite the numerous recycling and landfill boxes spaced about 30 feet apart . Along the pathway at the bottom of Hippie Hill , where revelers were shoulder to shoulder , vendors Alicia , 30 , and Patrick , 34 - no last names given - held up sizable $ 5 peanut - butter chocolate - chip cookies , each containing an estimated half - gram of marijuana .

Sunday marked his second year attending 4/20 , an informal marijuana - focused festival of thousands on Hippie Hill in Golden Gate Park , and Nathan - \" just Nathan \" - had traveled from Salinas to be part of the communal partaking of cannabis . \" Everyone is so nice , \" he said , taking another drag , adding that it was fortuitously Easter , albeit an untraditional acknowledgment of it . \" Everyone is coming together to celebrate something . \" While the vibe in the park was for the most part mellow , city and park officials were keeping a wary eye on the event . They did n't care about the cannabis . They cared about the clogged streets , illegally parked cars and mounds of trash . There were several arrests by late afternoon , according to reports . Last year , the crowds left 10,000 pounds of garbage in their wake and created at - a-standstill traffic jams as the revelers flooded the Haight - Ashbury neighborhood . Supervisor London Breed said she did n't want to be a \" buzzkill . \" But Breed , whose district includes the Haight and the park area , did n't want a repeat of last year 's chaos and two -day cleanup . She noted that smoking anything in any city park is illegal , but San Francisco has a tradition of turning a blind eye to infractions for official or unofficial events . City officials said they would be cracking down on several violations , including structures or canopies , amplified sound , alcoholic beverages , tree climbing , fires , and peddling or vending without a permit . Lenient attitude Yet Hippie Hill and Sharon Meadow below it were covered in canopies , with speakers blaring music , bottles and cans of beer everywhere , an occasional tree climber , several barbecues , and dozens if not hundreds of people selling a range of regular and \" medicinal \" items . \" Lollipops ( laced with cannabis ) , two for $ 5 , \" one entrepreneurial woman yelled . \" Joints for $ 2 . \" \" Chili cheese Cheetos , Doritos , Fritos , \" yelled a man selling the straight snacks . \" I got it right here . Fritos . Cheetos . Boom ! \" So many people were selling pot cookies , pot brownies , pot cupcakes and other bacchanalian treats that sales were pretty slow , many of the impromptu vendors said . \" I 'm pretty baked , so it 's slow going , \" one sucker - selling woman said . Yet there was no visible police presence in the meadow or on the hill . \" Ultimately , we want people to enjoy the park peacefully , \" said Connie Chan , spokeswoman for the Recreation and Park Department . Elias Pizano , 29 , drove from Modesto and arrived at the meadow at 6:30 a.m. , a car - size beach ball in tow . \" It 's like a celebration , \" he said . \" Everybody is happy . \" No place to go That was arguably an overstatement . Among those not happy : people who needed a potty break in the midst of the pot smoking . Because it was a non-sanctioned event , there were n't any portable bathrooms on hand , just a few stalls in permanent park bathrooms and a plethora of trees and bushes to accommodate the 10,000 or so revelers . Similar events were taking place in other cities across the state and country , each hitting its peak at 4:20 p.m. with a shared communal high . Yet the celebration comes as San Francisco and the state continue to grapple with the issue of relaxed laws on marijuana . In San Francisco earlier this month , the City Planning Commission approved restrictions to limit the growth of cannabis dispensaries in the Ocean Avenue neighborhood . California voted to legalize medical marijuana in 1996 . But Gov. Jerry Brown said recently he is watching closely to see how Colorado and Washington handle new laws that regulate the growth and sale of taxed recreational marijuana at state- licensed stores . In San Francisco , officials were more focused Sunday on keeping the temporary cardboard trash cans from overflowing and traffic moving around neighboring streets . Barriers prevented cars from entering the park and from accessing Haight Street . Trash collectors And a handful of park workers on overtime pay mingled with the crowd , picking up trash . As 4:20 p.m. approached , however , trash started to dot the hillside and meadow , despite the numerous recycling and landfill boxes spaced about 30 feet apart . Along the pathway at the bottom of Hippie Hill , where revelers were shoulder to shoulder , vendors Alicia , 30 , and Patrick , 34 - no last names given - held up sizable $ 5 peanut - butter chocolate - chip cookies , each containing an estimated half - gram of marijuana . They had few takers . \" We 're not coming back next year , \" said Patrick , adding they had come from Stockton . \" Too much of a hassle . \" Behind them was a cooler filled with most of the 150 individually vacuum - packed cookies they had made . \" We 're gonna end up eating and passing out whatever 's left , \" Patrick said with a shrug .

Learn about our Medical Expert Board Print The endometrium is one of the stars of the female reproductive system , playing key roles during the menstrual cycle as well as during pregnancy . Also called the endometrial lining , the tissue it 's made up of serves as the \" wallpaper \" of the uterus , or womb \u2014 the pear-shaped organ that houses a developing baby . Abnormalities of the endometrium can result in concerns such as endometriosis , hyperplasia , and cancer . Garry DeLong / Getty Images Anatomy The endometrium is made up mostly of mucosal tissue . It has two layers . The first layer , the stratum basalis , attaches to the layer of smooth muscle tissue of the uterus called the myometrium . This layer serves as an anchor for the endometrium within the uterus and stays relatively unchanged . The second layer is dynamic , however . It changes in response to the monthly flux of hormones that guide the menstrual cycle . For this reason , it 's called the stratum functionalis , or functional layer . It 's the part of the endometrium where a fertilized egg ( or blastocyst ) will implant if conception takes place . Menstruation and Pregnancy Just before ovulation ( the release of an egg from a fallopian tube ) , the functional layer of the endometrium goes through specific changes . Structures called uterine glands become longer and tiny blood vessels proliferate \u2014 a process called vascularization . As a result , the endometrial lining becomes thicker and enriched with blood so that it 's ready to receive a fertilized egg and also support a placenta \u2014 the organ that develops during pregnancy to supply a fetus with oxygen , blood , and nutrients . If conception does n't take place after ovulation , the build - up of blood vessels and tissues becomes unnecessary and is shed . This is your period . Menstrual flow is made up of the cells that slough away from the functional layer of the endometrial lining , mixed with blood from the little blood vessels that surrounded the uterine glands . Keep in mind that those too young to have gotten their periods yet and adults who 've gone through menopause will not experience these changes . Their endometrial linings will stay relatively thin and stable . Hormonal birth control methods can have a similar effect . People who use progesterone - only contraception such as the Mirena intrauterine device or the contraceptive implant Nexplanon , both of which ultimately suppress the build - up of the functional layer of the endometrium , tend to have lighter periods . Endometrial Conditions Most of the time , the ebb and flow of the endometrial lining follow a fairly predictable rhythm \u2014 as you well know if you 're a person who menstruates . However , this can be altered by abnormalities of the endometrial lining . Here are the most common ones women may experience . Endometriosis Sometimes as it thickens , the endometrial lining wanders outside of the borders of the uterus and builds upon the ovaries , fallopian tubes , or tissue that lines the pelvis . Even though it 's outside of the uterus , this tissue will continue to grow and then break down as you menstruate . The problem is because it is displaced , the blood and tissue have nowhere to exit the body and become trapped . Eventually , endometriosis can lead to cysts on the ovaries called endometriomas , as well as scar tissue and adhesions that cause structures in the pelvis to stick together . The main symptom is severe pain \u2014 not only during menstruation but also during intercourse , bowel movements , or urination . Periods may be heavy , and you may feel extra tired , bloated , or nauseous . Endometriosis can be treated with medication , hormone therapy , or surgery , but may still affect fertility . About 40 % of people who have endometriosis will have some degree of infertility resulting from any number of complications , such as scar tissue and adhesions in and around the fallopian tubes to low levels of progesterone that can affect the build - up of the uterine lining \u2014 a condition called luteal phase defect . Endometrial Hyperplasia In this condition , the endometrial lining becomes too thick . This most often happens due to a specific hormonal imbalance . An excess of estrogen , which causes the thickening of the endometrium , in combination with an absence of progesterone that can result if ovulation does n't take place . Under these conditions , the endometrial lining is n't shed and cells within it continue to proliferate . Endometrial hyperplasia can occur during perimenopause when ovulation becomes irregular , or after menopause , when the menstrual cycle stops altogether . It also can happen in people who take medications that act like estrogen ( without progestin or progesterone ) or who take high doses of estrogen after menopause for a long period of time . Other risk factors include irregular menstrual periods , particularly in people who have polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) , are infertile , or are obese : Excess fat cells produce excess estrogen as well . This can lead to an extra buildup of the endometrium and , ultimately , heavier periods . The symptoms of endometrial hyperplasia include menstrual bleeding that 's heavier or lasts longer than usual ; shorter than normal periods ; or any bleeding after menopause . If you experience any of these symptoms , see your gynecologist . Endometrial hyperplasia can put you at risk of endometrial cancer , as the excess cells can become abnormal . The condition is usually treated with progestin . Cancer Endometrial cancer is caused by the growth of abnormal cells . About 90 % of people who are diagnosed with this condition have abnormal vaginal bleeding . Other possible symptoms of endometrial cancer include non-bloody vaginal discharge , pelvic pain , feeling a mass in your pelvic area , or unexplained weight loss . According to the American Cancer Society , when diagnosed early ( at stage 0 ) , the five - year survival rate for treated endometrial cancer is 96 % . If your periods change dramatically ( they become heavier or last longer , for example ) or you have bleeding between periods or after you go through menopause , see your healthcare provider . There are less serious causes for these symptoms , but it 's better to err on the side of caution . Was this page helpful ? Thanks for your feedback !

In 1987 , when he and fellow investors Donald Kline and Donald Jasper acquired Talking Rain , a tiny , unprofitable beverage company , they did n't realize how long -- and pocked -- a road it would be to prosperity . Their recent success is a shock given the long stretch of false starts and outright failures . Ah , sweet vindication . Over the last three years the company 's zero-calorie fizzy water , Sparkling ICE , has kept it from folding -- and blasted revenue from $ 25 million in 2010 to $ 148 million in 2012 . Talking Rain , based in Preston , Wash . , pulled in $ 50 million in the first quarter , and claims it 's profitable . Now available in all 50 states , Sparkling ICE accounts for 95 % of sales . \" We pinch ourselves every day , \" says Talking Rain CEO Kevin Klock , 44 . He should : It 's taken the company longer to reach this point than Odysseus needed to battle the Trojans and make his way home . \" For a long time nobody believed the numbers , which is fine -- it just allowed us to continue to take market share . \" Hebner , now 72 , had no business getting involved in the first place . A onetime broker for Dean Witter in Seattle , he 'd known Kline , 75 , and Jasper , 74 - - both home builders and real estate investors -- since 1970 . He 'd gotten them into various stocks , then into commercial properties . When they stumbled across Talking Rain , it was a six-month-old company that produced carbonated water , rode on the back of a The trio took a majority stake for $ 300,000 . Three months later , having burned through the first $ 110,000 payout , Stevens and Hiskin came back for more . The investors decided to take over , buying out Hiskin but keeping Stevens to head up marketing and product development .

Expansion of Sales Systems in Japan and Development of Markets in Other Countries Item 4 . Exports of Completely - built Vehicles Exports to Scandinavia began with a sample shipment of two Tiaras to Finland in June 1962 , marking the start of Toyota 's advance into Europe , but nothing went beyond the sample shipment . The trigger of a full - scale entry by Toyota vehicles into European markets was the ninth Tokyo Motor Show held in October of that year . President W. Krohn of Erla Auto Import A/S , a Danish dealer of imported vehicles , was in Japan and noticed the Crown ( RS40 ) that was on display at the show . He had a feeling that the subdued styling of the Crown would suit European tastes and decided to obtain exclusive sales rights for the Crown in Denmark . President Krohn exhibited the Crown in three major cities in Denmark in December of that year and generated a tremendous reaction . A distributor agreement was concluded with Erla Auto Import in May 1963 , and full - scale exports to the European market began with the loading on a ship of 190 Crowns . The start of exports to Denmark led to a distributor agreement being signed with Louwman & Parqui B.V. of the Netherlands in May 1964 , marking the start of Toyota 's entrance into mainland Europe . Initially , Erla Auto Import was also responsible for sales in Sweden and Norway , but local distributors were later established in these countries . In 1966 , Toyota used non-automobile producing countries such as Belgium and Switzerland as footholds to establish sales bases in automobile - producing countries including the United Kingdom , France , and West Germany . Complete-knockdown production of Toyota vehicles in Europe was commenced by Portugal - based Salvador Caetano I.M.V.T. , S.A. in 1968 . With the strengthening of its foundations for sales in Europe in the late 1960s , Toyota 's sales grew rapidly . At the time , Japanese vehicles were at a price disadvantage because of the freight charges for the long transport distances and customs duties , but they offered the advantages of including a lot of equipment as standard and incurring few breakdowns , which meant that maintenance costs were low , and as a result , the competitiveness of Japanese vehicles steadily increased . As exports to Europe gained momentum , a representative office was established in Brussels , Belgium in August 1970 to gather information on automotive - related laws and regulations in each country and to conduct development of products suited for European markets . As for Canada , export to the country did not make much headway due to the specifications required for the harsh , cold climate , as well as the imposition of high import duties . Finally in 1965 , exports of the Crown , Publica , and Land Cruiser began , with Canadian Motor Industries as the distributor .

Expansion of Sales Systems in Japan and Development of Markets in Other Countries Item 4 . Exports of Completely - built Vehicles Exports to Scandinavia began with a sample shipment of two Tiaras to Finland in June 1962 , marking the start of Toyota 's advance into Europe , but nothing went beyond the sample shipment . The trigger of a full - scale entry by Toyota vehicles into European markets was the ninth Tokyo Motor Show held in October of that year . President W. Krohn of Erla Auto Import A/S , a Danish dealer of imported vehicles , was in Japan and noticed the Crown ( RS40 ) that was on display at the show . He had a feeling that the subdued styling of the Crown would suit European tastes and decided to obtain exclusive sales rights for the Crown in Denmark . President Krohn exhibited the Crown in three major cities in Denmark in December of that year and generated a tremendous reaction . A distributor agreement was concluded with Erla Auto Import in May 1963 , and full - scale exports to the European market began with the loading on a ship of 190 Crowns . The start of exports to Denmark led to a distributor agreement being signed with Louwman & Parqui B.V. of the Netherlands in May 1964 , marking the start of Toyota 's entrance into mainland Europe . Initially , Erla Auto Import was also responsible for sales in Sweden and Norway , but local distributors were later established in these countries . In 1966 , Toyota used non-automobile producing countries such as Belgium and Switzerland as footholds to establish sales bases in automobile - producing countries including the United Kingdom , France , and West Germany . Complete-knockdown production of Toyota vehicles in Europe was commenced by Portugal - based Salvador Caetano I.M.V.T. , S.A. in 1968 . With the strengthening of its foundations for sales in Europe in the late 1960s , Toyota 's sales grew rapidly . At the time , Japanese vehicles were at a price disadvantage because of the freight charges for the long transport distances and customs duties , but they offered the advantages of including a lot of equipment as standard and incurring few breakdowns , which meant that maintenance costs were low , and as a result , the competitiveness of Japanese vehicles steadily increased . As exports to Europe gained momentum , a representative office was established in Brussels , Belgium in August 1970 to gather information on automotive - related laws and regulations in each country and to conduct development of products suited for European markets . As for Canada , export to the country did not make much headway due to the specifications required for the harsh , cold climate , as well as the imposition of high import duties . Finally in 1965 , exports of the Crown , Publica , and Land Cruiser began , with Canadian Motor Industries as the distributor . Specifications for the extreme cold , however , were not adopted , and sales were extremely poor .

The exact nature of the event was not known . Sudhalter writes in \" Lost Chords \" that there is some documentation that has been carefully hidden from the public that \" records an event deemed serious enough , at least in the context of the early ' 20s , to have kindled Bismarck Beiderbecke 's indignation . \" \" The facts remain closely guarded and cannot be discussed here without betrayal of confidences . \" I have expounded on the need to separate Bix 's private from his public life and have strongly argued that his rights to privacy must not be desecrated .

First , I note an error in Ward 's account : Bix was eighteen , not nineteen in 1921 , when the alleged incident took place . Second , and most importantly , the event does not provide any support whatsoever for allegations of Bix 's homosexuality . This is important because some individuals had cited this event - without having any knowledge of its nature - as evidence for a proposed link between Bix 's alcohol addiction and Berton 's undocumented claim of a homosexual encounter . Albert Haim I am caught between strong contradictory forces . On the one hand , my ethical principles compel me to scrupulously guard Bix 's - and anybody 's - private affairs from public scrutiny and speculation . On the other hand , my rigorous training as a research scientist drives me to vigorously investigate and search for the \" truth \" . After a lot of soul searching and in the interest of fairness , accuracy , completeness , and final closure , I decided to post here transcriptions of the only two available documents - the Davenport police blotter for April 22 , 1921 and the grand jury deposition of Preston R. Ivens , the father of the girl in the incident . In addition , and with his permission , I also provide the essence of a conversation I had with Geoffrey C. Ward , the author of \" Jazz : A History of America 's Music \" , the companion book to Ken Burns ' Jazz TV series for PBS . I have seen photographs of the two documents mentioned above . The Davenport police blotter for 1921 still exists and has been archived . I have been informed that the Scott County proceedings prior to 1940 have been purged .

[ Exact transcription from photograph of original document . ] Preston R. Ivens being first duly sworn on oath says : I live at 3030 Grand Ave. Davenport- Scott County , Iowa . I am a student at the Palmer School . On April 22 , 1921 my little girl came home , told me that a man took her in the garage , said some awful things to her . I ran up to the garage , then called up the police but could get no clue . Next day I saw 2 boys whom I had seen when I went to the garage . I asked if they saw a man take a little girl into the garage the day before . They said yes & told me it was the Dft [ defendant ] . My little girl told her story to me & later to the chief of police & the County Attorney . She said he asked her to show herself . The little girl is 5 years old . In consideration of the childs [ sic ] age & the harm that would result to her in going over with this case I would request that no action be taken by the Grand Jury . I consulted with Dr. Eliot & Dr. B. J. Palmer & Dr. Craven & they all besides Mr. C. H. Murphy thought it best to drop the case for the betterment of the child . Signed : Preston R. Ivens . [ Note : Palmer School of Chiropractic is still in existence ; Mr. Ivens did not complete the program . The Ivens 's residence was about 15 blocks away from the Beiderbecke 's residence . ] I had a telephone conversation with Geoffrey C. Ward , the author of \" Jazz : A History of America 's Music \" on December 18 , 2000 . Mr. Ward informed me that the data about Bix 's arrest for \" lewd and lascivious act with a child \" was from a photograph of the Davenport police blotter for April 22 , 1921 . No information about the age and sex of the child was provided in the blotter . The identification of the child as \" apparently just a fellow teenager , a girl from down the street \" was provided to Mr. Ward by the late Mr. Philip Evans during a telephone conversation several years ago . \" This is all I know about the episode of April 1921 . As far as I am aware , there are no other serious events in Bix 's life that have not been disclosed . I believe that this is the sum total of material that has not been in the public domain . I will not analyze the documents nor will I speculate about their meaning or some of the puzzling aspects . However , some clarifications are in order . For the benefit of readers from overseas , I give a brief and general explanation of the Grand Jury system in the U.S.A . The rules vary from state to state , but some features are common . Basically , when an individual is arrested , depending on the nature of the charges , he / she may be bound over to a Grand Jury . The Grand Jury is a group of about twenty citizens called to determine whether evidence exists to warrant the trial ( by a Petit Jury , 12 men / women who decide on the guilt or innocence of the defendant ) of a person accused of a crime . Unlike the trial by a Petit Jury , Grand Jury proceedings are secret . The only person present during depositions by witnesses and by the defendant is the District Attorney . Witnesses and accused testify one at a time behind closed doors . There is no judge present . After the jurors are sworn in , the indictments proposed by the District Attorney are laid before them and witnesses are called . The defendant may be called , provided he / she waives his privilege against self- incrimination . On the conclusion of the hearing , the Grand Jury deliberates in private and decides whether the evidence provides reasonable cause to believe that the defendant committed the crime of which he is accused . Of course , the Grand Jury can decide that insufficient evidence has been presented and the case is dismissed . When the proceedings are concluded in favor of the defendant , the records are sealed . This means that they are not available to anyone without a Supreme Court order on good cause shown . Clearly , Bix was arrested , released on bail , and his case was sent over to the Grand Jury . The case was dismissed . Those are the facts . What are the claims ? According to Mr. Ivens , his daughter told him that an unidentified man said \" something awful \" to her and asked her \" to show herself . \" What is the basis for the allegation by Mr. Ivens that the man was Bix ? Apparently , only the word of two unidentified boys seen by Mr. Ivens near \" the garage . \" Clearly , all the evidence brought in by Mr. Ivens was nothing but hearsay . The charges were dismissed and , according to the U.S. legal system , an individual is innocent until proven guilty : Bix is innocent . Let there be closure on this subject . As far as I am concerned , the information related to the arrest neither adds to or subtracts from my understanding or appreciation of Bix 's music . However , it provides a possible explanation , as stated by Richard M. Sudhalter in \" Lost Chords \" ( p. 803 : \" prompted the family to ship the boy off to Lake Forest \" ) and by Geoffrey C. Ward in \" Jazz : A History of America 's Music \" ( p. 83 : \" they packed him off to Lake Forest \" ) for the decision of Mr. and Mrs. Bismark Beiderbecke to send Bix to Lake Forest Academy . Bix 's academic work was unsatisfactory , he was drinking , and he was hanging out with jazz musicians . The arrest - although without a conviction - could have been an additional factor in the parents ' decision to enroll Bix in Lake Forest Academy . This event turned out to be a defining moment in Bix 's life . As pointed out by Geoffrey Ward during a telephone conversation we had on 12/21/00 , Bix 's enrollment in the Academy had profound consequences in Bix 's life as a musician : Chicago and jazz were a short train ride away and jazz history was changed as a consequence . It is with profound regret that I am posting the copies of the documents in question . I trust that no further speculation will be forthcoming in the forum about this unfortunate aspect of Bix 's life . Our enjoyment and study of Bix 's luminous music and our searches for heretofore undiscovered recordings and films are sufficient to keep us occupied for a long time . Albert Haim I am grateful to Mike Heckman for his expert technical advice : his explanations of complicated and subtle legal matters were very helpful . I also acknowledge the help of three Bixophiles who provided information about the existing documentation , judicious advice , and strong moral support . Finally , I thank Geoffrey Ward for several illuminating discussions .","annotations":[{"text":"Leon Beiderbecke","span":[5947,5962],"token_span":[1129,1130],"role":"Perpetrator","label":"Perpetrator","role_definition":"The individual that commits a Crime."},{"text":"Lewd & lascivious act with child","span":[6005,6036],"token_span":[1141,1146],"role":"Crime","label":"Crime","role_definition":"An act, generally intentional, that has been formally forbidden by law."},{"text":"On April 22 , 1921","span":[6558,6575],"token_span":[1259,1263],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the Crime was committed."},{"text":"in the garage","span":[6632,6644],"token_span":[1277,1279],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the Crime occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"On April 22 , 1921 , a month after he turned 18 , Beiderbecke was arrested by two Davenport police officers on an accusation that he had taken a five - year - old girl named Sarah Ivens into a neighbor 's garage and committed a lewd and lascivious act with her \u2014 a statutory felony in Iowa .","annotations":[{"text":"Beiderbecke","span":[50,60],"token_span":[13,13],"role":"Perpetrator","label":"Perpetrator","role_definition":"The individual that commits a Crime."},{"text":"a lewd and lascivious act","span":[226,250],"token_span":[45,49],"role":"Crime","label":"Crime","role_definition":"An act, generally intentional, that has been formally forbidden by law."},{"text":"a neighbor 's garage","span":[191,210],"token_span":[39,42],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the Crime occurs."},{"text":"Iowa","span":[285,288],"token_span":[57,57],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the Crime occurs."}],"trigger":{"text":"committed","start_char":216,"end_char":224,"start_token":44,"end_token":44,"frame":"Committing_crime"}},"source":{"text":"Several Bixophiles have written asking me to discontinue the discussion of Bix 's sexuality in the Forum .

The charges were dismissed and , according to the U.S. legal system , an individual is innocent until proven guilty : Bix is innocent . Let there be closure on this subject . As far as I am concerned , the information related to the arrest neither adds to or subtracts from my understanding or appreciation of Bix 's music . However , it provides a possible explanation , as stated by Richard M. Sudhalter in \" Lost Chords \" ( p. 803 : \" prompted the family to ship the boy off to Lake Forest \" ) and by Geoffrey C. Ward in \" Jazz : A History of America 's Music \" ( p. 83 : \" they packed him off to Lake Forest \" ) for the decision of Mr. and Mrs. Bismark Beiderbecke to send Bix to Lake Forest Academy . Bix 's academic work was unsatisfactory , he was drinking , and he was hanging out with jazz musicians . The arrest - although without a conviction - could have been an additional factor in the parents ' decision to enroll Bix in Lake Forest Academy . This event turned out to be a defining moment in Bix 's life . As pointed out by Geoffrey Ward during a telephone conversation we had on 12/21/00 , Bix 's enrollment in the Academy had profound consequences in Bix 's life as a musician : Chicago and jazz were a short train ride away and jazz history was changed as a consequence . It is with profound regret that I am posting the copies of the documents in question . I trust that no further speculation will be forthcoming in the forum about this unfortunate aspect of Bix 's life . Our enjoyment and study of Bix 's luminous music and our searches for heretofore undiscovered recordings and films are sufficient to keep us occupied for a long time . Albert Haim I am grateful to Mike Heckman for his expert technical advice : his explanations of complicated and subtle legal matters were very helpful . I also acknowledge the help of three Bixophiles who provided information about the existing documentation , judicious advice , and strong moral support . Finally , I thank Geoffrey Ward for several illuminating discussions .","annotations":[{"text":"Leon Beiderbecke","span":[5947,5962],"token_span":[1129,1130],"role":"Perpetrator","label":"Perpetrator","role_definition":"The individual that commits a Crime."},{"text":"Lewd & lascivious act with child","span":[6005,6036],"token_span":[1141,1146],"role":"Crime","label":"Crime","role_definition":"An act, generally intentional, that has been formally forbidden by law."},{"text":"April 22 , 1921","span":[6561,6575],"token_span":[1260,1263],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the Crime was committed."},{"text":"the garage","span":[6635,6644],"token_span":[1278,1279],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the Crime occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-0262-469-frame-Communication","frame":"Communication","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Communicator conveys a Message to an Addressee; the Topic and Medium of the communication also may be expressed.","frame_ancestors":["Cause_to_perceive","Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":["Communication_manner","Communication_noise","Communication_response","Gesture","Reassuring","Summarizing"],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"The first use of the phrase is identified as a quote in the Christian Science Monitor ( April 11 , 1980 ) in reference to the Iran hostage crisis : \" US options grow more difficults as the chance of a Soviet response increases .

Macha was the woman 's name , as scholars say . She sat herself down on a chair near the hearth , and stirred the fire . She passed the whole day there , without exchanging a word with any one . She fetched a kneading - trough and a sieve and began to prepare food . As the day drew to an end she took a vessel and milked the cow , still without speaking . When she returned to the house , she turned right about , went into his kitchen and gave directions to his servants ; then she took a seat next to Crunnchu . Each one went to his couch ; she remained to the last and put out the fire , turned right about again and laid herself down beside him , laying her hand on his side . For a long time they dwelt together . Through his union with her , he increased yet more in wealth . His handsome appearance was delightful to her .

The Ulstermen gathered to the festival , Crunnchu also going pith the rest . It was a brilliant festival , not alone in regard to the people , but as to horses and costumes also . There took place races and combats , tournaments , games , and processions . At the ninth hour the royal chariot was brought upon the ground , and the king 's horses carried the day in the contests . Then bards appeared to praise the king and the queen , the poets and the druids , his household , the people and the whole assembly . The people cried : \u201c Never before have two such horses been seen at the festival as these two horses of the king : in all Ireland there is not a swifter pair ! \u201d \u201c My wife runs quicker than these two horses , \u201d said Crunnchu . \u201c Seize the man , \u201d said the king , \u201c and hold him until his wife can be brought to the race - contest ! \u201d He was made fast , and messengers were despatched from the king to the woman . She bade the messengers welcome , and asked them what had brought them there . \u201c We have come for you that you may release your husband , kept prisoner by the king 's command , because he boasted that you were swifter of foot than the king 's horses . \u201d \u201c My husband has spoken unwisely , \u201d said she ; \u201c it was not fitting that he should say so . As for me , I am ill , and about to be delivered of a child . \u201d \u201c Alas for that , \u201d said the messengers , \u201c for thy husband will be put to death if thou dost not come . \u201d \u201c Then I must needs go , \u201d she said . Forthwith she went to the assembly . Every one crowded round to see her . \u201c it is not becoming , \u201d said she , \u201c that I should be gazed at in this condition . Wherefore am I brought hither ? \u201d \u201c To run in contest with the two horses of the king , \u201d shouted the multitude . \u201c Alas ! \u201d she cried , \u201c for I am close upon my hour . \u201d \u201c Unsheath your swords and hew yonder man to death , \u201d said the king . \u201c Help me , \u201d she cried to the bystanders , \u201c for a mother hath borne each one of you . Give me , O King , but a short delay , until I am delivered . \u201d \u201c It shall not be so , \u201d replied the king . \u201c Then shame upon you who have shown so little respect for me , \u201d she cried . \u201c Because you take no pity upon me , a heaviei . infamy will fall upon you . \u201d \u201c What is thy name ? \u201d asked the king . \u201c My name , \u201d said she , \u201c and the name of that which I shall bear , will for ever cleave to the place of this assembly . I am Macha , daughter of Sainreth mac Imbaith ( Strange son of Ocean ) . Bring up the horses beside me ! \u201d It was done , and she outran the horses and arrived first at the end of the course . Then she gave vent to a cry in her pain , but God helped her , and she bore twins , a son and a daughter , before the horses reached the goal . Therefore is the place called Emain Macha , the \" Twins of Macha . \" All who heard that cry were suddenly seized with weakness , so that they had no more strength than the woman in her pain . And she said , \u201c From this hour the ignominy that you have inflicted upon me will redound to the shame of each one of you . When a time of oppression falls upon you , each one of you who dwells in this province will be overcome with weakness , as the weakness of a woman in childbirth , and this will remain upon you for five days and four nights ; to the ninth generation it shall be so . \u201d Thus it was . It continued from the days of Crunnchu to the days of Fergus mac Donnell , or till the time of Forc , son of Dallan , son of Mainech , son of Lugaid . Three classes there were upon whom the debility had no power , namely , the children and the women of Ulster , and Cu Chulainn , because he was not descended from Ulster ; none , also , of those who were outside the province were afflicted by it .

Then bards appeared to praise the king and the queen , the poets and the druids , his household , the people and the whole assembly . The people cried : \u201c Never before have two such horses been seen at the festival as these two horses of the king : in all Ireland there is not a swifter pair ! \u201d \u201c My wife runs quicker than these two horses , \u201d said Crunnchu . \u201c Seize the man , \u201d said the king , \u201c and hold him until his wife can be brought to the race - contest ! \u201d He was made fast , and messengers were despatched from the king to the woman . She bade the messengers welcome , and asked them what had brought them there . \u201c We have come for you that you may release your husband , kept prisoner by the king 's command , because he boasted that you were swifter of foot than the king 's horses . \u201d \u201c My husband has spoken unwisely , \u201d said she ; \u201c it was not fitting that he should say so . As for me , I am ill , and about to be delivered of a child . \u201d \u201c Alas for that , \u201d said the messengers , \u201c for thy husband will be put to death if thou dost not come . \u201d \u201c Then I must needs go , \u201d she said . Forthwith she went to the assembly . Every one crowded round to see her . \u201c it is not becoming , \u201d said she , \u201c that I should be gazed at in this condition . Wherefore am I brought hither ? \u201d \u201c To run in contest with the two horses of the king , \u201d shouted the multitude . \u201c Alas ! \u201d she cried , \u201c for I am close upon my hour . \u201d \u201c Unsheath your swords and hew yonder man to death , \u201d said the king . \u201c Help me , \u201d she cried to the bystanders , \u201c for a mother hath borne each one of you . Give me , O King , but a short delay , until I am delivered . \u201d \u201c It shall not be so , \u201d replied the king . \u201c Then shame upon you who have shown so little respect for me , \u201d she cried . \u201c Because you take no pity upon me , a heaviei . infamy will fall upon you . \u201d \u201c What is thy name ? \u201d asked the king . \u201c My name , \u201d said she , \u201c and the name of that which I shall bear , will for ever cleave to the place of this assembly . I am Macha , daughter of Sainreth mac Imbaith ( Strange son of Ocean ) . Bring up the horses beside me ! \u201d It was done , and she outran the horses and arrived first at the end of the course . Then she gave vent to a cry in her pain , but God helped her , and she bore twins , a son and a daughter , before the horses reached the goal . Therefore is the place called Emain Macha , the \" Twins of Macha . \" All who heard that cry were suddenly seized with weakness , so that they had no more strength than the woman in her pain . And she said , \u201c From this hour the ignominy that you have inflicted upon me will redound to the shame of each one of you . When a time of oppression falls upon you , each one of you who dwells in this province will be overcome with weakness , as the weakness of a woman in childbirth , and this will remain upon you for five days and four nights ; to the ninth generation it shall be so . \u201d Thus it was . It continued from the days of Crunnchu to the days of Fergus mac Donnell , or till the time of Forc , son of Dallan , son of Mainech , son of Lugaid . Three classes there were upon whom the debility had no power , namely , the children and the women of Ulster , and Cu Chulainn , because he was not descended from Ulster ; none , also , of those who were outside the province were afflicted by it . This is the cause of the Noinden Ulad , or the Debility of the Ulstermen .","annotations":[{"text":"Macha","span":[4154,4158],"token_span":[923,923],"role":"Speaker","label":"Speaker","role_definition":"Speaker is the sentient entity that delivers the Message."},{"text":"a cry in her pain","span":[4363,4379],"token_span":[969,973],"role":"Voice","label":"Voice","role_definition":"The Voice describes the Speaker's utterance or other message-encoded production."},{"text":"before the horses reached the goal","span":[4448,4481],"token_span":[991,996],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time where the Communication noise event occurs."},{"text":"at the end of the course","span":[4314,4337],"token_span":[957,962],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where an event occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-1104-392-frame-Communication_response","frame":"Communication_response","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"This frame deals with a Speaker communicating a reply or response, a Message, to some prior communication or action, the Trigger.

Noeline 's grandfather William , a publican by trade , was one of the 50 strong volunteers that came to Lough Mask from Monaghan / Cavan in 1880 in order to help with the harvesting of the crops . He died in 1904 at the age of 63 years . Gerry and Noeline had in their possession the historic silver commemorative medal , which was presented to William Moore in early 1881 by the Orange Order to the men who took part in the Lough Mask House Relief Expedition . It is believed to be the only remaining inscribed medal from this expedition left in Ireland , the National Museum in Dublin has one without inscription . The medal bore the following inscription : - Obverse side : the Imperial Crown and the words \" In honour of the Loyal and Brave Ulstermen \" ; - Reverse : \" The Boycott Expedition . Lough Mask 1880 . \" Space was left on this side for the name of each recipient . In this case the medal was inscribed with William Moore 's name . The Neale Heritage and Development Association are extremely grateful to Gerry and Noeline for their visit and a verbal commitment to donate the historic medal to the proposed community resource centre at the Neale has been given . This will be a wonderful asset to the new centre . The ribbon is orange with two green stripes which indicates that the medal is connected with agriculture . It was designed by a professional medalist named John Woodhouse Jnr and struck by West & Co of Belfast . Seventy one medals were struck and awarded to the officers of the expedition ( 3 ) the County Monaghan party ( 32 ) the county Cavan party ( 25 ) individuals from Dublin ( 7 ) Special awards ( 3 ) which went to the Earl of Enniskilling The Royal Irish Academy and The Belfast Newsletter . One was awarded to the British Museum for historical purposes . Charles Boycott was not awarded a medal . Boycott medals have not been common on the open market . The Story of the Expedition Charles Boycott found himself in real difficulties when the first ' boycott ' begun . It was as hard , then , to run a farm without labour as it would be difficult today to run one without tractors . Nonetheless the demands of the farm waited for no one . Charles had started harvesting . He had 300 sheep and perhaps fifty steers ( attending to sheep in those days was no sinecure ; foot - rot was common ) . What had been a well ordered private house and farm had been turned into a muddy , and disordered , public establishment . Everyone still living in Lough Mask House was required , suddenly , to adopt a new , and most unexpected , lifestyle . By the end of the first week in November a ' Boycott Relief Expedition ' from Ulster had been , more or less decided upon . Charles , it is believed , did his best to stop this from happening , he needed no more than about twelve men to finish his harvest ) . Tension began , slowly to mount ; plans to transfer additional soldiers to Ballinrobe were made ; troops began to patrol the roads leading to Charles house ; the telegraph between Ballinrobe and Dublin was kept , permanently , open , additional magistrates were drafted into the Ballinrobe area . On 9th November further military reinforcements , from Dublin and The Curragh proceeded west to Ballinrobe ; and , by the following day , about 900 soldiers ( from different arms of the services ) and a small ' army ' of war and newspaper correspondents had arrived , Ballinrobe was seething with excitement ! Could it , conceivably be true that an armed body of Ulstermen was on its way to help Charles ' get in his turnips ' ? On 10th November the ' Boycott Expedition ' was reported as being ready to leave Ulster . Whilst Charles had succeeded in ' saving ' a large part of his grain crop he still needed to complete his harvest . The rumour that he was about to play host to a number of Ulstermen filled him with justified - trepidation ; even the R.I.C , billeted on his land , were prevented from buying food in Ballinrobe . But , and despite his mounting difficulties , Charles remained defiant . On the same day , in Ulster , the fifty volunteers from counties Monaghan and Cavan showed themselves to be ' stout and respectable ' - and cheerful young men ( whatever anyone else might call them ! ) . they had been told that they were going to County Mayo to save the crops of a brave and courageous English gentleman . On 11th November the two separate county parties merged under the command of Mr Manning , Mr Goddard ( a solicitor ) and Captain Somerset Maxwell who was then aged seventy -seven . Whilst waiting on Athlone station the volunteers were issued with revolvers but told to conceal them The Dublin Daily Express donated food and supplies . The party travelled on to Claremorris by a scheduled train . At Claremorris station the volunteers found themselves facing a substantial reception party . This consisted of one Field Officer and twenty other ranks from the 1st Dragoons , 150 officers and men of the 76th Regiment , two troops of the l9th Hussars , Colone I Bruce and a number of Royal Irish Constables , several Resident Magistrates , an ambulance wagon under the command of Surgeon Major Reynolds and a large group of war and newspaper reporters . Not surprisingly the Freemen 's Journal remarked that they had never seen 'a sorrier or more wretched crew than the volunteers ' whilst the ' loyalist press ' described a group of ' fine young men ' making 'a brave show of indifference . ' From Claremorris to Ballinrobe At about 4.30 pm - it was November and darkness was fast coming on - the marching party set off on their fourteen - mile march to Ballinrobe . Heavy rain is said to have fallen ' continuously . ' For a reason now obscure the escort of 150 men of the 76th Regiment were relieved , at Hollymount , by a similar number from the 84th Regiment . Several delays occurred , it was not until nearly five hours had elapsed that the by now wet and weary volunteers reached Ballinrobe . On the following day ( 12th November ) the weather had improved . The military column smaller than on the previous day - reformed itself and marched on , for a further three miles , to Lough Mask House where it was received by Charles and Assheton Weekes , both of whom were armed . Not many people watched ; most of those who did were women . That evening Charles gave a dinner party for those army officers , volunteer officers and magistrates who intended to spend the night at or near , Lough Mask House . The volunteers make themselves as comfortable as circumstances allowed , everyone found a tent . The expeditions first night in Lough Mask House is believed to have been very wet . The process of turning Charles 's tidy paths and well - kept lawns into an appaling - quagmire had begun . On 12th November there were about 900 soldiers in and around Lough Mask House and Ballinrobe and about 7,000 in the west of Ireland . Charles continued , resolutely , to defy the Land League . The eyes of the world were , by now , focused upon events in Lough Mask House . On Saturday 13th November the task of ' saving Charles 's crops ' began - this meant the lifting of eight acres of turnips , seven acres of mangolds , two acres of potatoes and the threshing of twenty acres of already cut corn . The Royal Engineers ' scooped out ' a cooking trench upon which the volunteer cooks placed gigantic pots of potatoes . Three or four members of the party started on the threshing , using Charles 's ' modern ' - but still very small - hand - thresher ; the remainder , accompanied by their officers and escorted by police and a patrol of the l9th Hussars , marched out to Charles 's fields . That night the Monaghan men returned soaking wet and refused to sleep in their tents , but seemed happier when moved into a hayloft . A rumour reached the camp that it was to be attacked that evening ; sentries were doubled , a password given out and extra soldiers from the 84th moved up but nothing untoward happened . The Ulstermen had only a limited objective . When they had secured Charles 's crops , and threshed his corn , the only thing remaining to them was to return home . In the meanwhile the eyes and ears of the western world including American eyes and ears - remained glued upon Lough Mask and his exciting affairs . On the next day Father John O'Malley of The Neale began to react to the apparent success of the Ulstermen . He proposed that a delegation of Lough Mask House and farm employees , led by himself , should go north to meet Lord Erne . On 20th November Michael Davitt returned to Ireland from the U.S.A. - too late to take any part in the ' Boycott affair ' but not too late to emphasise to his many friends in Ireland the depth of American support for Ireland . By about the same date it seemed unlikely that any surprising incident would upset the steady flow of events round Lough Mask House . The Ulstermen were working well . Such of Charles 's crops as could be sold were fetching good prices . Somerset Maxwell had abandoned the boathouse and was staying with Lord and Lady Ardilaun near Cong . A professional photographer named Wynne had taken some excellent photographs of the ' camp ' and its occupants . Auld Lang Syne By Friday 26th November the Ulster Volunteers had finished their work . That night everyone was kept awake by another tremendous storm which , finally , completed the ruin of Charles 's well - trampled park and his lawns and paths . On the following day ( 27th November ) conditions were better and everyone set about striking camp with a will . At about 2 pm the volunteers accompanied by their officers some soldiers , the press and several newspaper artists assembled outside Charles 's front door . Somerset Maxwell read out a courteous letter from Charles in which he thanked everyone for their help and expressed the sadness he felt at being obliged ' to quit , with my wife , a happy home where we had hoped to have spent the remainder of our days . ' A great cheer went up when Charles walked down his front door steps and shook hands with everyone . A Regimentals cook borrowed a scabbard and beat the time whilst the assembled company sang ' Auld Lang Syne ' and ' For They are Jolly Good Fellows ' . Not many local people watched the departure to Ballinrobe of ' the queerest menagerie that ever came to Connaught ' , but Father O'Malley was one . He found himself entangled with an old lady . ' Did I not warn you ' he said , ' to let the British Army alone ? How dare you come to intimidate those two thousand heroes after their glorious campaign ? I 'll make an example of you . Be off ! ' It was still dark when the volunteers and soldiers marched away from Ballinrobe to catch their trains . Charles and Annie accompanied by a dog , a parrot and a few suitcases - left Lough Mask House early on the same day in an ambulance wagon ( drawn , it is believed by four grey mules ) and escorted by a troop of the 19th Hussars . As Charles caught up , and passed through , the Ulster Volunteers he took off his hat to them ; they had done their duty . Atter Charles left Lough Mask House at the end of November 1880 ' boycotting ' became both widespread , and notorious , in Ireland . ' Boycotting ' To ' boycott ' was legal in as much as it could not be proceeded against under the law because no offence , known to the law , had been committed . This was its strength . It soon became a most unpleasant , much feared and widely used social weapon in Ireland ; and , before long , in the world . It was , almost always , used against individuals or against small family groups . Parnell and the Land League won ' their war ' against Charles without much real difficulty and in a , more or less , gentlemanly way . But , after Christmas 1880 , gentility came to an abrupt end ' boycotting ' became a terrifying , and often long lasting , punishment for an offence which no judge or jury had even considered let alone ruled upon . Before Charles ' invented ' boycotting the verb ' to ostracise ' ( first used in 1588 ) meant one of two things , it could mean 'a temporary banishment by which a too popular , or too powerful , citizen was sent into exile ' or it might mean , banishment by general consent - exclusion from society favour or common privileges ' . ' To send to Coventry ' meant ' to exclude a person from the society of which he is a member on account of objectionable conduct ; to refuse to associate , or have intercourse , with him ' . Neither of these well tried sanctions fitted the new requirement - neither ' ostracism ' nor ' sending to Coventry ' exacted sufficient penalty . In May 1882 Gladstone defined , ' boycotting ' . ' What is meant by boycotting ? In the first place , it is combined intimidation . In the second place it is combined intimidation made use of for the purpose of destroying the private liberties of choice by fear of ruin and starvation . In the third place that being what \" boycotting \" is in itself , we must look to this ; that the creed of \" boycotting \" , like every other creed , requires a sanction and that the sanction of boycotting - that which stands in the rear of \" boycotting \" and by which alone \" boycotting ' can in the long run be made thoroughly effective - is the murder which is not to be denounced . ' As the years passed , and acts of ' boycotting ' multiplied all over the world , it was realised that even Gladstone had not succeeded in hitting the ' boycott ' nail precisely , on the head .

Noeline 's grandfather William , a publican by trade , was one of the 50 strong volunteers that came to Lough Mask from Monaghan / Cavan in 1880 in order to help with the harvesting of the crops . He died in 1904 at the age of 63 years . Gerry and Noeline had in their possession the historic silver commemorative medal , which was presented to William Moore in early 1881 by the Orange Order to the men who took part in the Lough Mask House Relief Expedition . It is believed to be the only remaining inscribed medal from this expedition left in Ireland , the National Museum in Dublin has one without inscription . The medal bore the following inscription : - Obverse side : the Imperial Crown and the words \" In honour of the Loyal and Brave Ulstermen \" ; - Reverse : \" The Boycott Expedition . Lough Mask 1880 . \" Space was left on this side for the name of each recipient . In this case the medal was inscribed with William Moore 's name . The Neale Heritage and Development Association are extremely grateful to Gerry and Noeline for their visit and a verbal commitment to donate the historic medal to the proposed community resource centre at the Neale has been given . This will be a wonderful asset to the new centre . The ribbon is orange with two green stripes which indicates that the medal is connected with agriculture . It was designed by a professional medalist named John Woodhouse Jnr and struck by West & Co of Belfast . Seventy one medals were struck and awarded to the officers of the expedition ( 3 ) the County Monaghan party ( 32 ) the county Cavan party ( 25 ) individuals from Dublin ( 7 ) Special awards ( 3 ) which went to the Earl of Enniskilling The Royal Irish Academy and The Belfast Newsletter . One was awarded to the British Museum for historical purposes . Charles Boycott was not awarded a medal . Boycott medals have not been common on the open market . The Story of the Expedition Charles Boycott found himself in real difficulties when the first ' boycott ' begun . It was as hard , then , to run a farm without labour as it would be difficult today to run one without tractors . Nonetheless the demands of the farm waited for no one . Charles had started harvesting . He had 300 sheep and perhaps fifty steers ( attending to sheep in those days was no sinecure ; foot - rot was common ) . What had been a well ordered private house and farm had been turned into a muddy , and disordered , public establishment . Everyone still living in Lough Mask House was required , suddenly , to adopt a new , and most unexpected , lifestyle . By the end of the first week in November a ' Boycott Relief Expedition ' from Ulster had been , more or less decided upon . Charles , it is believed , did his best to stop this from happening , he needed no more than about twelve men to finish his harvest ) . Tension began , slowly to mount ; plans to transfer additional soldiers to Ballinrobe were made ; troops began to patrol the roads leading to Charles house ; the telegraph between Ballinrobe and Dublin was kept , permanently , open , additional magistrates were drafted into the Ballinrobe area . On 9th November further military reinforcements , from Dublin and The Curragh proceeded west to Ballinrobe ; and , by the following day , about 900 soldiers ( from different arms of the services ) and a small ' army ' of war and newspaper correspondents had arrived , Ballinrobe was seething with excitement ! Could it , conceivably be true that an armed body of Ulstermen was on its way to help Charles ' get in his turnips ' ? On 10th November the ' Boycott Expedition ' was reported as being ready to leave Ulster . Whilst Charles had succeeded in ' saving ' a large part of his grain crop he still needed to complete his harvest . The rumour that he was about to play host to a number of Ulstermen filled him with justified - trepidation ; even the R.I.C , billeted on his land , were prevented from buying food in Ballinrobe . But , and despite his mounting difficulties , Charles remained defiant . On the same day , in Ulster , the fifty volunteers from counties Monaghan and Cavan showed themselves to be ' stout and respectable ' - and cheerful young men ( whatever anyone else might call them ! ) . they had been told that they were going to County Mayo to save the crops of a brave and courageous English gentleman . On 11th November the two separate county parties merged under the command of Mr Manning , Mr Goddard ( a solicitor ) and Captain Somerset Maxwell who was then aged seventy -seven . Whilst waiting on Athlone station the volunteers were issued with revolvers but told to conceal them The Dublin Daily Express donated food and supplies . The party travelled on to Claremorris by a scheduled train . At Claremorris station the volunteers found themselves facing a substantial reception party . This consisted of one Field Officer and twenty other ranks from the 1st Dragoons , 150 officers and men of the 76th Regiment , two troops of the l9th Hussars , Colone I Bruce and a number of Royal Irish Constables , several Resident Magistrates , an ambulance wagon under the command of Surgeon Major Reynolds and a large group of war and newspaper reporters . Not surprisingly the Freemen 's Journal remarked that they had never seen 'a sorrier or more wretched crew than the volunteers ' whilst the ' loyalist press ' described a group of ' fine young men ' making 'a brave show of indifference . ' From Claremorris to Ballinrobe At about 4.30 pm - it was November and darkness was fast coming on - the marching party set off on their fourteen - mile march to Ballinrobe . Heavy rain is said to have fallen ' continuously . ' For a reason now obscure the escort of 150 men of the 76th Regiment were relieved , at Hollymount , by a similar number from the 84th Regiment . Several delays occurred , it was not until nearly five hours had elapsed that the by now wet and weary volunteers reached Ballinrobe . On the following day ( 12th November ) the weather had improved . The military column smaller than on the previous day - reformed itself and marched on , for a further three miles , to Lough Mask House where it was received by Charles and Assheton Weekes , both of whom were armed . Not many people watched ; most of those who did were women . That evening Charles gave a dinner party for those army officers , volunteer officers and magistrates who intended to spend the night at or near , Lough Mask House . The volunteers make themselves as comfortable as circumstances allowed , everyone found a tent . The expeditions first night in Lough Mask House is believed to have been very wet . The process of turning Charles 's tidy paths and well - kept lawns into an appaling - quagmire had begun . On 12th November there were about 900 soldiers in and around Lough Mask House and Ballinrobe and about 7,000 in the west of Ireland . Charles continued , resolutely , to defy the Land League . The eyes of the world were , by now , focused upon events in Lough Mask House . On Saturday 13th November the task of ' saving Charles 's crops ' began - this meant the lifting of eight acres of turnips , seven acres of mangolds , two acres of potatoes and the threshing of twenty acres of already cut corn . The Royal Engineers ' scooped out ' a cooking trench upon which the volunteer cooks placed gigantic pots of potatoes . Three or four members of the party started on the threshing , using Charles 's ' modern ' - but still very small - hand - thresher ; the remainder , accompanied by their officers and escorted by police and a patrol of the l9th Hussars , marched out to Charles 's fields . That night the Monaghan men returned soaking wet and refused to sleep in their tents , but seemed happier when moved into a hayloft . A rumour reached the camp that it was to be attacked that evening ; sentries were doubled , a password given out and extra soldiers from the 84th moved up but nothing untoward happened . The Ulstermen had only a limited objective . When they had secured Charles 's crops , and threshed his corn , the only thing remaining to them was to return home . In the meanwhile the eyes and ears of the western world including American eyes and ears - remained glued upon Lough Mask and his exciting affairs . On the next day Father John O'Malley of The Neale began to react to the apparent success of the Ulstermen . He proposed that a delegation of Lough Mask House and farm employees , led by himself , should go north to meet Lord Erne . On 20th November Michael Davitt returned to Ireland from the U.S.A. - too late to take any part in the ' Boycott affair ' but not too late to emphasise to his many friends in Ireland the depth of American support for Ireland . By about the same date it seemed unlikely that any surprising incident would upset the steady flow of events round Lough Mask House . The Ulstermen were working well . Such of Charles 's crops as could be sold were fetching good prices . Somerset Maxwell had abandoned the boathouse and was staying with Lord and Lady Ardilaun near Cong . A professional photographer named Wynne had taken some excellent photographs of the ' camp ' and its occupants . Auld Lang Syne By Friday 26th November the Ulster Volunteers had finished their work . That night everyone was kept awake by another tremendous storm which , finally , completed the ruin of Charles 's well - trampled park and his lawns and paths . On the following day ( 27th November ) conditions were better and everyone set about striking camp with a will . At about 2 pm the volunteers accompanied by their officers some soldiers , the press and several newspaper artists assembled outside Charles 's front door . Somerset Maxwell read out a courteous letter from Charles in which he thanked everyone for their help and expressed the sadness he felt at being obliged ' to quit , with my wife , a happy home where we had hoped to have spent the remainder of our days . ' A great cheer went up when Charles walked down his front door steps and shook hands with everyone . A Regimentals cook borrowed a scabbard and beat the time whilst the assembled company sang ' Auld Lang Syne ' and ' For They are Jolly Good Fellows ' . Not many local people watched the departure to Ballinrobe of ' the queerest menagerie that ever came to Connaught ' , but Father O'Malley was one . He found himself entangled with an old lady . ' Did I not warn you ' he said , ' to let the British Army alone ? How dare you come to intimidate those two thousand heroes after their glorious campaign ? I 'll make an example of you . Be off ! ' It was still dark when the volunteers and soldiers marched away from Ballinrobe to catch their trains . Charles and Annie accompanied by a dog , a parrot and a few suitcases - left Lough Mask House early on the same day in an ambulance wagon ( drawn , it is believed by four grey mules ) and escorted by a troop of the 19th Hussars . As Charles caught up , and passed through , the Ulster Volunteers he took off his hat to them ; they had done their duty . Atter Charles left Lough Mask House at the end of November 1880 ' boycotting ' became both widespread , and notorious , in Ireland . ' Boycotting ' To ' boycott ' was legal in as much as it could not be proceeded against under the law because no offence , known to the law , had been committed . This was its strength . It soon became a most unpleasant , much feared and widely used social weapon in Ireland ; and , before long , in the world . It was , almost always , used against individuals or against small family groups . Parnell and the Land League won ' their war ' against Charles without much real difficulty and in a , more or less , gentlemanly way . But , after Christmas 1880 , gentility came to an abrupt end ' boycotting ' became a terrifying , and often long lasting , punishment for an offence which no judge or jury had even considered let alone ruled upon . Before Charles ' invented ' boycotting the verb ' to ostracise ' ( first used in 1588 ) meant one of two things , it could mean 'a temporary banishment by which a too popular , or too powerful , citizen was sent into exile ' or it might mean , banishment by general consent - exclusion from society favour or common privileges ' . ' To send to Coventry ' meant ' to exclude a person from the society of which he is a member on account of objectionable conduct ; to refuse to associate , or have intercourse , with him ' . Neither of these well tried sanctions fitted the new requirement - neither ' ostracism ' nor ' sending to Coventry ' exacted sufficient penalty . In May 1882 Gladstone defined , ' boycotting ' . ' What is meant by boycotting ? In the first place , it is combined intimidation . In the second place it is combined intimidation made use of for the purpose of destroying the private liberties of choice by fear of ruin and starvation . In the third place that being what \" boycotting \" is in itself , we must look to this ; that the creed of \" boycotting \" , like every other creed , requires a sanction and that the sanction of boycotting - that which stands in the rear of \" boycotting \" and by which alone \" boycotting ' can in the long run be made thoroughly effective - is the murder which is not to be denounced . ' As the years passed , and acts of ' boycotting ' multiplied all over the world , it was realised that even Gladstone had not succeeded in hitting the ' boycott ' nail precisely , on the head . The Oxford English Dictionary now defines the word as follows : ' To continue in refusing to hold relations of any kind with ( a neighbour ) on account of political or other differences , so as either to punish him or coerce him into abandoning his position . The word was first used to describe the action instituted by the Irish Land League towards those who incurred its hostility .

There 's a can of worms we opened this year : the unfortunate situation with support for DWG files in free CAD software via LibreDWG . We feel , by now it ought to be closed . We have the final answer from FSF . In January this year LGW picked a lead about perspectives of LibreDWG and support for DWG in software like LibreCAD , FreeCAD , Open Asset Import Library , and Blender . The key question was : why does n't any of the end -user applications use the existing code in LibreDWG to gain support for DWG files ? As it turned out , it was about incompatibility between LibreDWG , which is GPLv3 + , and some of the 3rd party projects which had strictly GPLv2 licensed code or linked to one . We contacted all involved parties \u2014 developers of LibreDWG , maintainers of all aforementioned 3rd party end -user software , and a license compatibility engineer at FSF . Eventually , as nothing was moving forward , in April one of LibreDWG developers contacted Richard Stallman personally ( and CCed several people including me ) . It took quite a bit of persuasion ( 3 months ) to get him to provide a clear and concise statement , and that statement is : We are not going to change the license . So , what does it mean ? Is it the end of DWG support in free software ? Is LibreDWG actually alive ? And what took it LGW so long to publish an update to the story ? Let 's start from the very beginning . The core of the issue Essentially , it 's about incompatibility between GPLv2 - only and GPLv3 + code . LibreDWG is licensed under GPLv3 + , and all copyright belongs to Free Software Foundation . The actual developers do n't have a say in all legal matters . The FAQ on GPL clearly states : Is GPLv3 compatible with GPLv2 ? No . Some of the requirements in GPLv3 , such as the requirement to provide Installation Information , do not exist in GPLv2 . As a result , the licenses are not compatible : if you tried to combine code released under both these licenses , you would violate section 6 of GPLv2 . However , if code is released under GPL \u201c version 2 or later , \u201d that is compatible with GPLv3 because GPLv3 is one of the options it permits . For FreeCAD the problem was both the Coin3D library and the Open CASCADE library . The first used to be GPLv2 - only and was relicensed to GPL - compatible BSD 3 - clause in December 2011 . The Open CASCADE project , however , currently uses its own Open CASCADE Technology Public License that is n't GPL - compatible . They were contacted about that by Debian team in 2009 . In late 2011 they publicly stated that they were considering dual - licensing OCCT ( the library ) , however in February 2012 they announced they were postponing that move . According to Andrey Betenev , as of December 2012 the decision is still up to the head company that controls Open CASCADE assets . For LibreCAD the legal issue is about the GPLv2 - only code inherited from Ribbonsoft who created the original QCad Community Edition product . The company declined the requests to relicense the code and even requested immediate removal of additional content such as documentation and fonts from LibreCAD . So before FSF issued a final statement ( not a public one , too ) on the matter , we were dealing with a situation where LibreDWG could become usable for end -user software only at the risk of potential legal issues . Having had seen that developers of free CAD software could n't make use of LibreDWG , the library developers eventually lost the motivation to work on the project and ceased their involvement . Which did n't make the situation any better . What 's going on now In terms of DWG support in free software nothing is really going on . GRASS is still the only project knowingly using the LibreDWG library . FreeCAD team is about to release v 0.13 , LibreCAD team is working on upcoming v2.0 , Open Asset Import Library and Blender are compatible , but have no volunteers to work on the support for DWG files . Meanwhile earlier this year Open Design Alliance released v 5.2 of their DWG specification that finally makes a stab at decrypting binary ACIS data \u2014 the most important part of DWG for FreeCAD . The development of LibreDWG is effectively on hold . Latest changes to master branch were committed in January 2011 , and latest changes to r2007 branch were committed in February 2012 . What 's next How can we solve this ? Let 's be realistic : we probably ca n't . You ca n't force Open CASCADE managers to okay the switch of the license to LGPL : they will do it only when they feel comfortable about it and have the green lights from lawyers . And knowing the track record of Ribbonsoft , chances that you can get them to relicense their code from the QCad Community Edition are rather zero-ish . If it 's not relicensing , then surely there could be a technical workaround ? Like a plug - in ? Well , not quite . For instance , according to LibreCAD team , right now there are just two ways for LibreDWG to be legally used in LibreCAD via the plug - in interface : - Rewriting all LibreCAD classes that are currently GPLv2 -only . - Creating tons of proxy objects to work around license incompatibility . Given the current development status of LibreCAD , none of the two ways seem realistic , and in terms of longterm strategy planning the second approach is , frankly , unthinkable . Edit : accrording to one of LibreDWG developers the second scenario is n't legal anyway . Finally , once you break through the legal matters , you have to deal with the fact that LibreDWG is currently unmaintained and even has n't had a single tarball release ever . There does n't seem to be any development going on , the code for R2007 file format is still in a branch , and no work on R2010 file format has even ( knowingly ) started . But wait , is n't LibreDWG one of the high priority projects by Free Software Foundation ? Unfortunately , so far hopes for FSF to take the lead have proven to be false . Richard Stallman was n't even aware of the problems one of their \u201c high priority \u201d projects had been facing for a long time . And it does n't look like he did anything about it since he learned about it : no awareness campaign , no direct contacting of involved parties that we know about . Since I was drawn into a private discussion with Richard about LibreDWG anyway , I specifically asked him , whether FSF was planning to take any actions to ensure that the work on LibreDWG was n't left unused by free end -user software . That was in June 2012 . After 6 months ( I can be very patient , when I have to ) and several reminders Richard still has n't provided any reply whatsoever . Apparently , the question does n't deserve an answer . You are at liberty to draw your conclusions from that . I have my own reservations . As you can see , solving this issue for both FreeCAD and LibreCAD is going to need a well orchestrated campaign . It 's going to involve a smart strategy . And it 's going to take years to get to the stage where you have production - quality input and output of DWG files . So we are talking about a bottomless supply of patience coupled with passion and some serious management skills . I 'm confident : there is a CAD version of Barney Stinson walking around who can claim that the challenge is accepted .

Given the current development status of LibreCAD , none of the two ways seem realistic , and in terms of longterm strategy planning the second approach is , frankly , unthinkable . Edit : accrording to one of LibreDWG developers the second scenario is n't legal anyway . Finally , once you break through the legal matters , you have to deal with the fact that LibreDWG is currently unmaintained and even has n't had a single tarball release ever . There does n't seem to be any development going on , the code for R2007 file format is still in a branch , and no work on R2010 file format has even ( knowingly ) started . But wait , is n't LibreDWG one of the high priority projects by Free Software Foundation ? Unfortunately , so far hopes for FSF to take the lead have proven to be false . Richard Stallman was n't even aware of the problems one of their \u201c high priority \u201d projects had been facing for a long time . And it does n't look like he did anything about it since he learned about it : no awareness campaign , no direct contacting of involved parties that we know about . Since I was drawn into a private discussion with Richard about LibreDWG anyway , I specifically asked him , whether FSF was planning to take any actions to ensure that the work on LibreDWG was n't left unused by free end -user software . That was in June 2012 . After 6 months ( I can be very patient , when I have to ) and several reminders Richard still has n't provided any reply whatsoever . Apparently , the question does n't deserve an answer . You are at liberty to draw your conclusions from that . I have my own reservations . As you can see , solving this issue for both FreeCAD and LibreCAD is going to need a well orchestrated campaign . It 's going to involve a smart strategy . And it 's going to take years to get to the stage where you have production - quality input and output of DWG files . So we are talking about a bottomless supply of patience coupled with passion and some serious management skills . I 'm confident : there is a CAD version of Barney Stinson walking around who can claim that the challenge is accepted .

Ties between India and China have long been hostage to mutual suspicion and great - power rivalry , but the joint training is the result of a new approach to Afghanistan that was agreed upon by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their informal summit in Wuhan , China in April 2018 . The change in Indian - Chinese bilateral relations on Afghanistan from a zero-sum dynamic to outcome-driven cooperation is likely to go a long way in helping to secure peace in the country by making it impossible for Pakistan to oppose Indo - Chinese projects to build up the capacity of the Afghan state . If India and China continue to successfully implement joint projects , they should be able to convince other stakeholders , such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and NATO , to help stabilize Afghanistan as well . Security is a natural focus for the two countries , as the situation in Afghanistan continues to deteriorate . According to the latest report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction to the U.S. Congress , the Afghan government controls just over half of the country \u2013 \u2013 55.5 percent of districts \u2013\u2013down from 72.5 percent three years earlier . In the face of a sustained Taliban insurgency , both New Delhi and Beijing are giving indications of pragmatic thinking on how to navigate their respective interests by working in coordination . There is a realization in both countries that growing instability in Afghanistan can have a potentially negative spillover effect for the region . Moreover , there is significant overlap in Chinese and Indian interests as well . Instability in Afghanistan has provided an enabling environment for terrorist networks such as al - Qaeda , ISIS - Khorasan , East Turkestan Islamic Movement ( ETIM ) , Lashkar -e- Taiba , the Haqqani Network , and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan ( IMU ) to launch attacks across the region . The chaos has allowed human , drug , and weapons smuggling to thrive too . China has additional security concerns related to Islamic militancy among the Uighur population in its far-western province of Xinjiang . Uighur militants have found shelter beyond China 's borders in the past , and in recent years , aided by ISIS , Uighur militancy has re-emerged in Afghanistan , where the Islamic State of Khorasan Province ( ISKP ) has called for jihad against China , vowing to \u201c shed blood like rivers . \u201d This has led China to tighten its ties with Kabul and provide counterterrorism assistance , including training and equipment , to the Afghan government . There is speculation that Beijing is in talks with Kabul over the construction of a military base in the mountainous Wakhan Corridor ( which links Xinjiang and Afghanistan ) , where joint patrols of Chinese and Afghan troops have been reported . As it looks to increase its footprint in Afghanistan , China has also turned to its long - standing military ally and trading partner , Pakistan . The \u201c all - weather \u201d friendship between China and Pakistan and the deep linkages between Pakistan 's security establishment and the Afghan Taliban have obliged Beijing to accommodate the Taliban . Beijing hopes that this will convince the group to cut its ties with ETIM and the IMU , which will help China contain their presence in Afghanistan . In the past year , China has also directly engaged with the Afghan Taliban as part of its back - channel diplomacy , during which Pakistan is said to have acted as a broker for the Taliban . This willingness to talk directly to the Taliban rather than just mediate in Afghan - led negotiations shows China 's seriousness in getting involved in Afghan politics . China 's Belt and Road initiative ( BRI ) is also unlikely to achieve its goals if there is constant conflict in Afghanistan , with blowback effects in Pakistan . In fact , Maulana Samiul Haq , the \u201c Father of the Taliban \u201d who was recently assassinated in his Rawalpindi home , had asked China to act as an arbitrator in Afghan peace negotiations . It would not be entirely incorrect to argue that the road to peace in Afghanistan runs through Rawalpindi in terms of its ability to put pressure on the Afghan Taliban to join the peace process , and no country other than China has real leverage over Pakistan 's security establishment . It was pressure from Beijing that forced the Pakistani military to launch a decisive operation in June 2014 in North Waziristan against the Taliban Movement of Pakistan , who were said to be hosting ETIM . At the same time , China is keen to involve India\u2013\u2013a country that has a broadly positive image among Afghans\u2013\u2013in its drive to secure its interests and influence in Afghanistan . For its part , by strengthening Afghanistan , India seeks to advance its own national security objectives \u2013 \u2013eliminating a critical safe haven for terrorists who have attacked India , and gaining access to Central Asian trade and energy resources . Islamabad 's exaggerated fears that New Delhi wants to trap Pakistan militarily through the Kabul government have led it to oppose Indian involvement in Afghanistan . Pakistan 's military establishment frequently levels allegations that an Indo - Afghan nexus is stoking separatist movements in Pakistan , and there have been many instances of kidnappings and attacks on Indians in Afghanistan aimed at frightening the Indian government into leaving the country . Despite Pakistan 's objections , Indo - Afghan ties remain robust , as reflected by the activation of the air corridor and the trilateral agreement with Iran over the Chabahar Port . Supporting a more proactive regional role for New Delhi\u2013\u2013which would contribute to Afghanistan 's security , stability , and economic development \u2013\u2013 should be in Beijing 's long - term interest . Joint capacity building and development - oriented projects with China in Afghanistan would be beneficial for India both economically and strategically . Besides protecting Indian nationals working in Afghanistan , such projects might also provide security from terrorist attacks backed by Pakistan 's security establishment . While Chinese - Indian cooperation on measures like joint diplomatic training is welcome , there remains a fundamental difference on how to resolve the Afghan problem . India would like China to play a more positive role in facilitating direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban\u2013 \u2013 the only path to peace and stability in the region . However , while Beijing has leverage with Pakistan 's security establishment , its close relationship with Islamabad has also been a real impediment to forcing it to deliver tangible results in a negotiated political settlement in Afghanistan . For now , the belief that China 's increasing involvement in Afghanistan might eventually motivate Beijing to put pressure on Pakistan to cut its ties with terrorist groups has yet to be translated into reality . Ultimately , if Chinese - Indian cooperation in Afghanistan is to prove successful , the two countries will need to find common ground on the issue of terrorism .

It would not be entirely incorrect to argue that the road to peace in Afghanistan runs through Rawalpindi in terms of its ability to put pressure on the Afghan Taliban to join the peace process , and no country other than China has real leverage over Pakistan 's security establishment . It was pressure from Beijing that forced the Pakistani military to launch a decisive operation in June 2014 in North Waziristan against the Taliban Movement of Pakistan , who were said to be hosting ETIM . At the same time , China is keen to involve India\u2013\u2013a country that has a broadly positive image among Afghans\u2013\u2013in its drive to secure its interests and influence in Afghanistan . For its part , by strengthening Afghanistan , India seeks to advance its own national security objectives \u2013 \u2013eliminating a critical safe haven for terrorists who have attacked India , and gaining access to Central Asian trade and energy resources . Islamabad 's exaggerated fears that New Delhi wants to trap Pakistan militarily through the Kabul government have led it to oppose Indian involvement in Afghanistan . Pakistan 's military establishment frequently levels allegations that an Indo - Afghan nexus is stoking separatist movements in Pakistan , and there have been many instances of kidnappings and attacks on Indians in Afghanistan aimed at frightening the Indian government into leaving the country . Despite Pakistan 's objections , Indo - Afghan ties remain robust , as reflected by the activation of the air corridor and the trilateral agreement with Iran over the Chabahar Port . Supporting a more proactive regional role for New Delhi\u2013\u2013which would contribute to Afghanistan 's security , stability , and economic development \u2013\u2013 should be in Beijing 's long - term interest . Joint capacity building and development - oriented projects with China in Afghanistan would be beneficial for India both economically and strategically . Besides protecting Indian nationals working in Afghanistan , such projects might also provide security from terrorist attacks backed by Pakistan 's security establishment . While Chinese - Indian cooperation on measures like joint diplomatic training is welcome , there remains a fundamental difference on how to resolve the Afghan problem . India would like China to play a more positive role in facilitating direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban\u2013 \u2013 the only path to peace and stability in the region . However , while Beijing has leverage with Pakistan 's security establishment , its close relationship with Islamabad has also been a real impediment to forcing it to deliver tangible results in a negotiated political settlement in Afghanistan . For now , the belief that China 's increasing involvement in Afghanistan might eventually motivate Beijing to put pressure on Pakistan to cut its ties with terrorist groups has yet to be translated into reality . Ultimately , if Chinese - Indian cooperation in Afghanistan is to prove successful , the two countries will need to find common ground on the issue of terrorism .

John Bercow ( Buckingham ) ( Con ) : I am proud to rise to champion the cause of the Nuffield speech and language unit , which is based in Ealing . It is a centre of excellence that now faces the threat of closure . It is right that the House and those interested in the subject should understand the background . The Nuffield speech and language unit is a part of the Royal National Throat , Nose and Ear hospital , which in turn is part of the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust . Since 1971 , the unit has provided specialist intensive therapy and teaching to children aged between four and seven with the most severe speech and language disorders . No provision of comparable quality for such children does or can exist in mainstream education . It is important to understand that children typically attend the unit for an average of two years . The severity of their impairments means that they are not able to participate in , or be integrated into , mainstream education . Quite apart from its teaching and therapy work , the unit has established itself intellectually and professionally as the repository of excellence in research and good practice , and the Nuffield dyspraxia programme is used in countries all over the world . The unit is small , catering for between 12 and 14 children . I have described the teaching and therapy that it provides , and the significance of its globally imitated dyspraxia programme . In addition , the unit is inextricably bound up with the Nuffield hearing and speech centre , which receives some 40 requests each week \u201a \u00c4\u00eefrom parents and professionals , by telephone , e-mail and post \u201a \u00c4\u00eeseeking advice on speech therapy . That is the background to the unit 's significance . It is exemplary and deservedly celebrated , but is now facing the threat of closure . For the best part of five successive years , the unit has been either full or over-subscribed . As a result , it had become a net financial contributor to its parent trust . This year , however , it is suffering a lack of referrals for 2006 - 07 and so is falling into deficit for the first time . Two factors explain the lack of referrals . First , the local education authority is resistant to the issuing of statements , and to agreeing to and providing finance for out - of - area placements . Secondly , there is a widespread and \u201a \u00c4\u00eedare I say it ? \u201a \u00c4\u00eealmost pervasive ignorance of the unit 's existence . I attribute that ignorance to the fact that the Royal Free Hampstead trust has devoted a degree of energy to marketing the trust that is somewhere between minimal and nil . I emphasise to the Minister that , on the strength of that one - year deficit , the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust is proposing to close this distinguished and celebrated unit . Mr. Philip Hollobone ( Kettering ) ( Con ) : I congratulate my hon . Friend on securing this debate . I received a telephone call today from a constituent , Dr. Deirdre Lucas , a distinguished audiology consultant who has nothing but praise for the unit 's special and unique work . She expressed in the strongest terms her fear that that centre of excellence and expertise could be lost for ever . It is without equal and , if we are not careful , we are going to lose a very precious resource . John Bercow : I am grateful to my hon . Friend , who makes his point eloquently and pithily . In preparing for the debate , I became aware of Dr. Deirdre Lucas , but it is a pretty safe bet that she will not be aware of me . I know of her authority and expertise in the field . She is one of a number of people who are determined to fight the good fight to preserve the unit because she has professional knowledge of its indispensability . My hon . Friend wisely used the word \u201c unique \u201d , which leads me to the arguments against closure of the unit . The facility is unique . That word may be hackneyed ; it is overused and frequently used inappropriately but it could scarcely be more appositely deployed than in respect of the unit . There is no other facility of its kind either in London or anywhere else in the country , so it is unique and it is also irreplaceable . However , the Minister does not need to take that from me . He can take it from the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust 's consultation document , which puts the point clearly , stating helpfully that Significantly , it adds that if the unit ceases to exist , the future potential of the children whom it serves will be severely damaged . I could not put it more effectively than that . We are describing a vital national resource , which on my reckoning at least 16 local education authorities have used over the years . We cannot afford lightly , if at all , to dispense with existing centres of excellence . We should be proud of them . We should be defending them and building on them , championing and supporting them , and if they are under threat it is the responsibility of all political parties , including pre-eminently the governing party , to get involved : to take a stance , to lend a hand and not to back off \u201a \u00c4\u00eea point to which I will , in due course , return . Mr. Peter Bone ( Wellingborough ) ( Con ) : I congratulate my hon . Friend on securing this important debate . Does he agree that one of the problems is that to a certain extent the unit is seen as a Cinderella part of the national health and the education services ? I have personal experience of the problem . My five -year - old son had a minor speech problem that was difficult to have attended to in the state system , so to hear that a unit with such national excellence is to close is extremely worrying . John Bercow : I entirely agree . My hon . Friend reinforces the argument and the impression , which I am glad to say is correct and growing , that there is strong support for the unit . We are entitled to look at the long - term outcomes of the Nuffield unit 's work \u201a \u00c4\u00eefor example , over the period between 1998 and 2003 . I re-emphasise that we are talking about help for severely disadvantaged children . After two years at the unit , 41 per cent . of children are able to go on to mainstream education ; 7 per cent . go on to local language units attached to mainstream schools ; 38 per cent . go to the Meath school , a specialist school that caters specifically for children with severe speech and language disorders ; and 13 per cent . go to other specialist schools . Early intervention is of the essence . I underline that point . We have to ensure that children in special and intense need are assisted at an early stage . If we do that , help , treatment , therapy and teaching can be highly effective . What is more , that can result in cost savings in the medium to long term . On the other hand , if we intervene very late , there are grave risks , such as emotional and psychological damage , lower educational attainment , a persistent communication handicap and poorer employment prospects . For all those reasons , it is vital that children get a chance without the procrastination , delay and politicking that prevent them from getting the help that they need . We cannot simply intervene later and rescue the situation . Serious , grave and potentially irrevocable damage can be done to the opportunities and life chances of children who are so delayed or neglected . I want to say something about the support that exists for the unit . My hon . Friends the Members for Kettering ( Mr. Hollobone ) and for Wellingborough ( Mr. Bone ) have already referred to that , but let it be underlined . A plethora of testimonials is now emerging in support of the unit . I call in aid first of all Pamela Williams , who is the chief speech therapist at the Nuffield speech and language unit and also chair of the Dyspraxia Foundation . Her words should carry weight and be listened to with respect by all hon . Members . She has said : Hers is not the only voice . Let us listen to the verdict of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists , which has publicly stated and communicated to me its belief that the demise of the unit would cause an \u201c erosion of expertise \u201d and a \u201c loss of capacity \u201d , with the result that patients would be left \u201c unsupported \u201d . Let us hear , too , the verdict of Janet Farrugia , a distinguished speech and language therapist of 25 years ' experience . She says : Significantly and ominously , she goes on to add that children who go elsewhere for their treatment or education make \u201c significantly slower \u201d progress . From the range of parents , I would like to cite in particular Dr. Tony Canas , who has founded the Friends of the Nuffield Speech and Language Unit . He is a truly remarkable man who is fighting as David against Goliath in the battle . He has set up a website and devoted an enormous amount of time and his considerable intellectual prowess to try to make arguments in support of the unit . He and his wife Angela have a son , Vincente , at the unit . They had to go through an enormous , debilitating , protracted , expensive and potentially soul-destroying battle to get their son into the unit , which they did , and he has now been there for the best part of an academic year . Tony Canas says : That is the considered judgment of a range of people who know of the unit , who can see its benefit , who are alarmed at the threat to its existence and who are determined to protect it . Dr. Julian Lewis ( New Forest , East ) ( Con ) : My hon . Friend is making such an overwhelming case that I will ask him briefly to do something slightly unusual in a debate of this sort . Will he put himself in the shoes of the people who are trying to close the unit and say what possible basis they could adduce for its closure in the face of such an overwhelming endorsement of it ? It is hard to envisage any such basis from the testimonials that he has eloquently read to the House . John Bercow : I am very grateful to my hon . Friend , who will have been a friend of mine for 23 years this October . We have often said that we have only one brain and we have thought it prudent over the years , in the course of our political careers , to share it between us . We each have an uncanny tendency to anticipate the thoughts and prospective pronouncements of the other , but I have to say , in all candour , that if he thinks that I am able to penetrate the inner recesses of the sort of extraordinarily contorted minds that could seriously contemplate a decision of this kind , I am afraid that he is elevating me to a level of intellectual pedigree to which I cannot realistically hope ever to aspire . I can only hazard a guess . The answer is almost certainly money , money and money again . I will return to that point . So far , I have raised one argument against the closure of the unit ; it is a centre of excellence that we ought to foster and support . There are other reasons why it is wrong to propose its closure . It is wrong to do so when the shortage of referrals could prove to be only short term . Yes , there is a downturn , but , last year , someone had to be turned away because the unit was over-subscribed . The trust consultation document helpfully observes that the Indeed it may . Is it not an extraordinary suggestion that one should close a unit with a proven track record and dramatic future potential simply on the basis of one year , which the trust calmly acknowledges in its document might be the result of statistical fluctuations ? The misjudgment is truly breathtaking . I said that the downturn might be temporary . I put it more strongly than that ; it is wrong to close a unit when there is every prospect that there will be an increase in demand for its services in the future and an increase in the number of referrals . Why do I say that ? I say it because there is no evidence whatever to suppose that , at any time soon , there will be a reduction in the number of children with severe speech and language disorders . Indeed , I suggest that the evidence probably points in the opposite direction . As a result of the increased survival rates of children who are born prematurely and who suffer significant complications as a result of that , there is every possibility that the number of children with such severe impairments will increase . There is therefore a very real chance of a greater demand for such services and for referrals to the unit in the future . It is wrong to propose the closure of the unit when there has been virtually no marketing of it by its parent trust , which ought to have some responsibility for proudly proclaiming the unit 's record , disseminating the evidence and seeking subscription to it . It is wrong to propose the closure of the unit when there is currently a Select Committee inquiry into statementing and other relevant aspects of special educational needs policy that are directly linked to the current plight of the unit . The hon. Member for Huddersfield ( Mr. Sheerman ) is the Chairman of the Education and Skills Committee . The Committee has taken evidence and will shortly publish its report . In accordance with the conventions of the House , with which the Minister will be familiar , the Government have a responsibility to issue a reply to the report within three months , and can be expected to do so . To propose the closure of the unit when the report has a direct link to the issues at that unit and before this House has had an opportunity to make a judgment seems to me to come fairly close to a contempt of Parliament . It is wrong to propose the closure of the unit when either cross- subsidy from another part of the activities of the trust or relocation of the unit from Ealing to the central London premises of the Royal National Throat , Nose and Ear hospital would offer a lifeline to this valued facility . Neither of those options has been other than flimsily considered in the consultation document that the trust has issued . It is wrong to propose the closure of the unit when , as in the words of one distinguished therapist , there is the likelihood of an irretrievable \u201a \u00c4\u00ee I use her words advisedly \u201a \u00c4\u00eeloss of knowledge , expertise and good practice , which it has taken many years to accumulate . Finally , it is wrong for the trust to propose the closure of a unit , the running cost of which amounts to 0.2 per cent . of the total turnover last year of the Royal Free Hampstead NHS trust . The Minister , for whom I have the highest regard \u201a \u00c4\u00ee I feel sure that he has a glittering ministerial career ahead of him \u201a \u00c4\u00eehas been listening with his customary courtesy . It is possible that he is thinking to himself , \u201c Well , there 's a certain amount in all this , but why is it a matter for me ? \u201d I do not wish to be unkind , because I like the Minister , but his private secretary telephoned my office last Thursday to report \u201a \u00c4\u00ee I happened not to be there , but she gave the information to my secretary \u201a \u00c4\u00eethat the Minister thought that I ought to be aware that a public consultation process was taking place in respect of the Nuffield speech and language unit , so he did not feel that he could say much and therefore that there was not much point in me proceeding with the debate . My response , through my secretary , was to say , \u201c Well , the Parliamentary Under - Secretary of State for Health \u201a \u00c4\u00eewho is , of course , but a Minister \u201a \u00c4\u00eemight not have anything to say , but I certainly do \u201d , as I hope that I have demonstrated so far this evening . I want very simply to put two points to the Minister on why this is a proper matter for him . First , it is not local . If the Minister has in the scripted speech \u201a \u00c4\u00eevery carefully prepared for him by others to whom I cannot refer in the Chamber \u201a \u00c4\u00eepassages that suggest that the local configuration of services should be determined by local people on the strength of a local knowledge of local needs , he should delete those passages . If he is planning to say , \u201c Well , it would be very presumptuous of me to say what should be decided by the trust \u201d , I urge him to abandon that argument . The cap does not fit , and one of the reasons why there is such widespread , indeed almost pervasive , cynicism in the country about politics and politicians \u201a \u00c4\u00eewe all have a duty to counter that cynicism \u201a \u00c4\u00eeis that a lot of people think that , irrespective of party , we are all too ready to proclaim our successes , to boast and to invite praise , glory and congratulation , but when a problem arises , it is always someone else 's fault ; leave the responsibility to A. N. Other . That will not do . This is not a local matter , local to the Royal Free Hampstead NHS trust or local to Ealing . I have already explained that the unit 's services have been extensively used by a range of authorities , predominantly but not exclusively in London , and it is a unique national resource . So there is a relevance for the Government , and they should take a view . Secondly , the form of the consultation has been profoundly objectionable , and it is a matter with which the Minister should concern himself . You will doubtless be aware , as the fount of all wisdom , Mr. Deputy Speaker , that under section 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 , there is a requirement in such circumstances for public consultation exercises to take place . There is an obligation for NHS bodies to ensure that either the recipients of services or their representatives are involved in and consulted on the planning and development of services . I think that it is section 11 ( 2 ) , but if I am mistaken , no doubt the Minister will advise me . Moreover , the provision goes on to explain that , where decisions to change those services are proposed or contemplated , there is a requirement to consult and involve those who will be affected . I am sorry to tell the Minister that , as far I am concerned , the Royal Free Hampstead NHS trust has chronically failed to adhere to the letter or spirit of its legal responsibility . The trust 's chief executive , Mr. Andrew Way , did not want a consultation process to take place , but he eventually agreed , under pressure , that it could . He then went to the Ealing scrutiny panel , for which legislative provision is also made , without telling the parents of children at the unit , to ask for permission to have a much shorter consultation than the 90 days that he would otherwise be obliged to accept . He was , I am pleased to say , turned down and a 90 - day consultation , running to the end of June , is now in process . Mr. Way and his colleagues on the trust board have rejected the suggestions of consultees and other supporters of the unit and refuse to issue , even now , a list of the people whom they are consulting . They have decided to stage public consultation meetings on a week day between 3 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon and from 6 o'clock until 8 o'clock in the evening . I suggest to the House , knowing that hon . Members are not ordinarily cynical , that those times are manifestly inconvenient to working parents and parents of young children . The thought arises in one 's mind that Mr. Way and his colleagues might not be disappointed if attendance at those meetings turned out to be small . At the first meeting , the only parent who attended was Dr. Tony Canas who stood up passionately and rigorously for the cause of the unit . I believe that that is an absolute disgrace . It is also a disgrace that the trust board has so far refused to consult the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists ; a body that one might presume had some responsibility for potential recipients of the services under discussion . The board has also failed and refused to consult both the Association of Speech and Language Therapists in Independent Practice and the Association for All Speech Impaired Children . So far , one could be forgiven for thinking that the consultation is a sham , a farce and a disgrace and that Mr. Andrew Way and his cohorts should be ashamed of the truly despicable way in which they have gone about the matter . Dr. Lewis rose \u201a \u00c4\u00ee John Bercow : I realise that I am expressing myself in my characteristically modest and understated terms , for which I make no apology before giving way to my hon . Friend . Dr. Lewis : I am sorry to intervene again on my hon . Friend , but there seems to be a parallel here with some of the sharp practices carried out in the New Forest and Romsey area in an attempt to close much - loved community hospitals . My hon . Friend might bear in mind the fact that when statutory consultations are abused in this way , the process of judicial review is always possible . If the person undertaking the review happens to be someone eligible for legal aid , the trust may find itself facing much larger and more irrecoverable legal bills than any possible short - term saving that resulted from the initial closure of a unit . I just mention that by the by . John Bercow : I am extremely grateful to my hon . Friend for his advice , which might well come in handy in the weeks and months ahead . As far as I am concerned , this is but the start of the campaign to preserve this unit . The Royal Free Hampstead NHS trust issued an annual report last year , which \u201a \u00c4\u00eesickeningly , from my point of view \u201a \u00c4\u00eecarried on its front cover the slogan , \u201c Specialising in Excellence \u201d . That should not be a slogan , a pious hope or a rhetorical statement of good intent for a honeyed future ; it should , first and foremost , reflect the reality on the ground , current practice and existing achievement . In that context , it should reflect the medical and educational priorities of a proud parent trust . But it does not . On the strength of a one - year deficit , in the face of a continuing parliamentary inquiry into relevant matters , and with scarcely a finger lifted to promote the unit , Mr. Andrew Way and his trust board colleagues are seriously , in all conscience I am advised , proposing the closure of a unit which has done so much to help some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children in our society , and which could do so much more in the future . If Mr. Way and his colleagues believe that the only way in which they can achieve overall financial balance \u201a \u00c4\u00eenot within the unit but within the trust as a whole \u201a \u00c4\u00eeis by picking on the most vulnerable children in the community , I honestly suggest that they should be told to clear their desks and pursue employment opportunities elsewhere . I appeal to the Minister , who I think is a compassionate , decent and humanitarian figure , to agree with me that there should at the least be a stay of execution in this case . I ask the Minister from the bottom of my heart to instruct \u201a \u00c4\u00eeyes , I use that word \u201a \u00c4\u00ee the trust to do two things . First , it should write to all LEAs , to relevant GPs , to speech and language therapists , to educational psychologists , to paediatricians and possibly to others , on whom we can agree if he accepts the principle , to inform them of the services of the unit , its success rate and the advisability in many cases of a referral to it . Secondly , I urge the Minister to instruct the trust board to look seriously , not with a pathetic , dismissive one - paragraph consideration , at the possibility of moving the unit from Ealing to central London in Gray 's Inn road , thereby not only making internal cost savings through location within the hospital but opening up the potential of a much wider area from which applications and referrals can come , not least the eastern part of London . That is a sensible proposition and it ought , among others , to be examined . The Minister will have noted that I have not launched some excoriating attack on the Government 's inclusion policy . Inclusion can work for a significant , a large number of children . It is , with appropriate help and support , the right course . If I accept that , which seems to me simply to reflect the reality of the evidence , I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that , for a significant and vulnerable minority of children , inclusion does not and cannot work . Those children need additional help . There is nowhere that better provides it for children with severe speech and language impairments than the Nuffield speech and language unit . It must survive ; I will fight to preserve it . I hope that I will be joined by the Minister and others . 6.38 pm","annotations":[{"text":"in Ealing","span":[420,428],"token_span":[79,80],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"Where the event takes place."},{"text":"The Nuffield speech and language unit","span":[598,634],"token_span":[113,118],"role":"Healer","label":"Healer","role_definition":"The Healer, anyone who treats or cures the Patient, occurs as the External Argument of verbs:"},{"text":"specialist intensive","span":[798,817],"token_span":[153,154],"role":"Treatment","label":"Treatment","role_definition":"The role Treatment is used for treatments and means, distinguished by separate FEs in FN-1."},{"text":"to children aged between four and seven","span":[840,878],"token_span":[158,164],"role":"Patient","label":"Patient","role_definition":"This is the sufferer of the injury, disease or pain and can occur as an NP Object in this frame.

John Bercow ( Buckingham ) ( Con ) : I am proud to rise to champion the cause of the Nuffield speech and language unit , which is based in Ealing . It is a centre of excellence that now faces the threat of closure . It is right that the House and those interested in the subject should understand the background . The Nuffield speech and language unit is a part of the Royal National Throat , Nose and Ear hospital , which in turn is part of the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust . Since 1971 , the unit has provided specialist intensive therapy and teaching to children aged between four and seven with the most severe speech and language disorders . No provision of comparable quality for such children does or can exist in mainstream education . It is important to understand that children typically attend the unit for an average of two years . The severity of their impairments means that they are not able to participate in , or be integrated into , mainstream education . Quite apart from its teaching and therapy work , the unit has established itself intellectually and professionally as the repository of excellence in research and good practice , and the Nuffield dyspraxia programme is used in countries all over the world . The unit is small , catering for between 12 and 14 children . I have described the teaching and therapy that it provides , and the significance of its globally imitated dyspraxia programme . In addition , the unit is inextricably bound up with the Nuffield hearing and speech centre , which receives some 40 requests each week \u201a \u00c4\u00eefrom parents and professionals , by telephone , e-mail and post \u201a \u00c4\u00eeseeking advice on speech therapy . That is the background to the unit 's significance . It is exemplary and deservedly celebrated , but is now facing the threat of closure . For the best part of five successive years , the unit has been either full or over-subscribed . As a result , it had become a net financial contributor to its parent trust . This year , however , it is suffering a lack of referrals for 2006 - 07 and so is falling into deficit for the first time . Two factors explain the lack of referrals . First , the local education authority is resistant to the issuing of statements , and to agreeing to and providing finance for out - of - area placements . Secondly , there is a widespread and \u201a \u00c4\u00eedare I say it ? \u201a \u00c4\u00eealmost pervasive ignorance of the unit 's existence . I attribute that ignorance to the fact that the Royal Free Hampstead trust has devoted a degree of energy to marketing the trust that is somewhere between minimal and nil . I emphasise to the Minister that , on the strength of that one - year deficit , the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust is proposing to close this distinguished and celebrated unit . Mr. Philip Hollobone ( Kettering ) ( Con ) : I congratulate my hon . Friend on securing this debate . I received a telephone call today from a constituent , Dr. Deirdre Lucas , a distinguished audiology consultant who has nothing but praise for the unit 's special and unique work . She expressed in the strongest terms her fear that that centre of excellence and expertise could be lost for ever . It is without equal and , if we are not careful , we are going to lose a very precious resource . John Bercow : I am grateful to my hon . Friend , who makes his point eloquently and pithily . In preparing for the debate , I became aware of Dr. Deirdre Lucas , but it is a pretty safe bet that she will not be aware of me . I know of her authority and expertise in the field . She is one of a number of people who are determined to fight the good fight to preserve the unit because she has professional knowledge of its indispensability . My hon . Friend wisely used the word \u201c unique \u201d , which leads me to the arguments against closure of the unit . The facility is unique . That word may be hackneyed ; it is overused and frequently used inappropriately but it could scarcely be more appositely deployed than in respect of the unit . There is no other facility of its kind either in London or anywhere else in the country , so it is unique and it is also irreplaceable . However , the Minister does not need to take that from me . He can take it from the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust 's consultation document , which puts the point clearly , stating helpfully that Significantly , it adds that if the unit ceases to exist , the future potential of the children whom it serves will be severely damaged . I could not put it more effectively than that . We are describing a vital national resource , which on my reckoning at least 16 local education authorities have used over the years . We cannot afford lightly , if at all , to dispense with existing centres of excellence . We should be proud of them . We should be defending them and building on them , championing and supporting them , and if they are under threat it is the responsibility of all political parties , including pre-eminently the governing party , to get involved : to take a stance , to lend a hand and not to back off \u201a \u00c4\u00eea point to which I will , in due course , return . Mr. Peter Bone ( Wellingborough ) ( Con ) : I congratulate my hon . Friend on securing this important debate . Does he agree that one of the problems is that to a certain extent the unit is seen as a Cinderella part of the national health and the education services ? I have personal experience of the problem . My five -year - old son had a minor speech problem that was difficult to have attended to in the state system , so to hear that a unit with such national excellence is to close is extremely worrying . John Bercow : I entirely agree . My hon . Friend reinforces the argument and the impression , which I am glad to say is correct and growing , that there is strong support for the unit . We are entitled to look at the long - term outcomes of the Nuffield unit 's work \u201a \u00c4\u00eefor example , over the period between 1998 and 2003 . I re-emphasise that we are talking about help for severely disadvantaged children . After two years at the unit , 41 per cent . of children are able to go on to mainstream education ; 7 per cent . go on to local language units attached to mainstream schools ; 38 per cent . go to the Meath school , a specialist school that caters specifically for children with severe speech and language disorders ; and 13 per cent . go to other specialist schools . Early intervention is of the essence . I underline that point . We have to ensure that children in special and intense need are assisted at an early stage . If we do that , help , treatment , therapy and teaching can be highly effective . What is more , that can result in cost savings in the medium to long term . On the other hand , if we intervene very late , there are grave risks , such as emotional and psychological damage , lower educational attainment , a persistent communication handicap and poorer employment prospects . For all those reasons , it is vital that children get a chance without the procrastination , delay and politicking that prevent them from getting the help that they need . We cannot simply intervene later and rescue the situation . Serious , grave and potentially irrevocable damage can be done to the opportunities and life chances of children who are so delayed or neglected . I want to say something about the support that exists for the unit . My hon . Friends the Members for Kettering ( Mr. Hollobone ) and for Wellingborough ( Mr. Bone ) have already referred to that , but let it be underlined . A plethora of testimonials is now emerging in support of the unit . I call in aid first of all Pamela Williams , who is the chief speech therapist at the Nuffield speech and language unit and also chair of the Dyspraxia Foundation . Her words should carry weight and be listened to with respect by all hon . Members . She has said : Hers is not the only voice . Let us listen to the verdict of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists , which has publicly stated and communicated to me its belief that the demise of the unit would cause an \u201c erosion of expertise \u201d and a \u201c loss of capacity \u201d , with the result that patients would be left \u201c unsupported \u201d . Let us hear , too , the verdict of Janet Farrugia , a distinguished speech and language therapist of 25 years ' experience . She says : Significantly and ominously , she goes on to add that children who go elsewhere for their treatment or education make \u201c significantly slower \u201d progress . From the range of parents , I would like to cite in particular Dr. Tony Canas , who has founded the Friends of the Nuffield Speech and Language Unit . He is a truly remarkable man who is fighting as David against Goliath in the battle . He has set up a website and devoted an enormous amount of time and his considerable intellectual prowess to try to make arguments in support of the unit . He and his wife Angela have a son , Vincente , at the unit . They had to go through an enormous , debilitating , protracted , expensive and potentially soul-destroying battle to get their son into the unit , which they did , and he has now been there for the best part of an academic year . Tony Canas says : That is the considered judgment of a range of people who know of the unit , who can see its benefit , who are alarmed at the threat to its existence and who are determined to protect it . Dr. Julian Lewis ( New Forest , East ) ( Con ) : My hon . Friend is making such an overwhelming case that I will ask him briefly to do something slightly unusual in a debate of this sort . Will he put himself in the shoes of the people who are trying to close the unit and say what possible basis they could adduce for its closure in the face of such an overwhelming endorsement of it ? It is hard to envisage any such basis from the testimonials that he has eloquently read to the House . John Bercow : I am very grateful to my hon . Friend , who will have been a friend of mine for 23 years this October . We have often said that we have only one brain and we have thought it prudent over the years , in the course of our political careers , to share it between us . We each have an uncanny tendency to anticipate the thoughts and prospective pronouncements of the other , but I have to say , in all candour , that if he thinks that I am able to penetrate the inner recesses of the sort of extraordinarily contorted minds that could seriously contemplate a decision of this kind , I am afraid that he is elevating me to a level of intellectual pedigree to which I cannot realistically hope ever to aspire . I can only hazard a guess . The answer is almost certainly money , money and money again . I will return to that point . So far , I have raised one argument against the closure of the unit ; it is a centre of excellence that we ought to foster and support . There are other reasons why it is wrong to propose its closure . It is wrong to do so when the shortage of referrals could prove to be only short term . Yes , there is a downturn , but , last year , someone had to be turned away because the unit was over-subscribed . The trust consultation document helpfully observes that the Indeed it may . Is it not an extraordinary suggestion that one should close a unit with a proven track record and dramatic future potential simply on the basis of one year , which the trust calmly acknowledges in its document might be the result of statistical fluctuations ? The misjudgment is truly breathtaking . I said that the downturn might be temporary . I put it more strongly than that ; it is wrong to close a unit when there is every prospect that there will be an increase in demand for its services in the future and an increase in the number of referrals . Why do I say that ? I say it because there is no evidence whatever to suppose that , at any time soon , there will be a reduction in the number of children with severe speech and language disorders . Indeed , I suggest that the evidence probably points in the opposite direction . As a result of the increased survival rates of children who are born prematurely and who suffer significant complications as a result of that , there is every possibility that the number of children with such severe impairments will increase . There is therefore a very real chance of a greater demand for such services and for referrals to the unit in the future . It is wrong to propose the closure of the unit when there has been virtually no marketing of it by its parent trust , which ought to have some responsibility for proudly proclaiming the unit 's record , disseminating the evidence and seeking subscription to it . It is wrong to propose the closure of the unit when there is currently a Select Committee inquiry into statementing and other relevant aspects of special educational needs policy that are directly linked to the current plight of the unit . The hon. Member for Huddersfield ( Mr. Sheerman ) is the Chairman of the Education and Skills Committee . The Committee has taken evidence and will shortly publish its report . In accordance with the conventions of the House , with which the Minister will be familiar , the Government have a responsibility to issue a reply to the report within three months , and can be expected to do so . To propose the closure of the unit when the report has a direct link to the issues at that unit and before this House has had an opportunity to make a judgment seems to me to come fairly close to a contempt of Parliament . It is wrong to propose the closure of the unit when either cross- subsidy from another part of the activities of the trust or relocation of the unit from Ealing to the central London premises of the Royal National Throat , Nose and Ear hospital would offer a lifeline to this valued facility . Neither of those options has been other than flimsily considered in the consultation document that the trust has issued . It is wrong to propose the closure of the unit when , as in the words of one distinguished therapist , there is the likelihood of an irretrievable \u201a \u00c4\u00ee I use her words advisedly \u201a \u00c4\u00eeloss of knowledge , expertise and good practice , which it has taken many years to accumulate . Finally , it is wrong for the trust to propose the closure of a unit , the running cost of which amounts to 0.2 per cent . of the total turnover last year of the Royal Free Hampstead NHS trust . The Minister , for whom I have the highest regard \u201a \u00c4\u00ee I feel sure that he has a glittering ministerial career ahead of him \u201a \u00c4\u00eehas been listening with his customary courtesy . It is possible that he is thinking to himself , \u201c Well , there 's a certain amount in all this , but why is it a matter for me ? \u201d I do not wish to be unkind , because I like the Minister , but his private secretary telephoned my office last Thursday to report \u201a \u00c4\u00ee I happened not to be there , but she gave the information to my secretary \u201a \u00c4\u00eethat the Minister thought that I ought to be aware that a public consultation process was taking place in respect of the Nuffield speech and language unit , so he did not feel that he could say much and therefore that there was not much point in me proceeding with the debate . My response , through my secretary , was to say , \u201c Well , the Parliamentary Under - Secretary of State for Health \u201a \u00c4\u00eewho is , of course , but a Minister \u201a \u00c4\u00eemight not have anything to say , but I certainly do \u201d , as I hope that I have demonstrated so far this evening . I want very simply to put two points to the Minister on why this is a proper matter for him . First , it is not local . If the Minister has in the scripted speech \u201a \u00c4\u00eevery carefully prepared for him by others to whom I cannot refer in the Chamber \u201a \u00c4\u00eepassages that suggest that the local configuration of services should be determined by local people on the strength of a local knowledge of local needs , he should delete those passages . If he is planning to say , \u201c Well , it would be very presumptuous of me to say what should be decided by the trust \u201d , I urge him to abandon that argument . The cap does not fit , and one of the reasons why there is such widespread , indeed almost pervasive , cynicism in the country about politics and politicians \u201a \u00c4\u00eewe all have a duty to counter that cynicism \u201a \u00c4\u00eeis that a lot of people think that , irrespective of party , we are all too ready to proclaim our successes , to boast and to invite praise , glory and congratulation , but when a problem arises , it is always someone else 's fault ; leave the responsibility to A. N. Other . That will not do . This is not a local matter , local to the Royal Free Hampstead NHS trust or local to Ealing . I have already explained that the unit 's services have been extensively used by a range of authorities , predominantly but not exclusively in London , and it is a unique national resource . So there is a relevance for the Government , and they should take a view . Secondly , the form of the consultation has been profoundly objectionable , and it is a matter with which the Minister should concern himself . You will doubtless be aware , as the fount of all wisdom , Mr. Deputy Speaker , that under section 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 , there is a requirement in such circumstances for public consultation exercises to take place . There is an obligation for NHS bodies to ensure that either the recipients of services or their representatives are involved in and consulted on the planning and development of services . I think that it is section 11 ( 2 ) , but if I am mistaken , no doubt the Minister will advise me . Moreover , the provision goes on to explain that , where decisions to change those services are proposed or contemplated , there is a requirement to consult and involve those who will be affected . I am sorry to tell the Minister that , as far I am concerned , the Royal Free Hampstead NHS trust has chronically failed to adhere to the letter or spirit of its legal responsibility . The trust 's chief executive , Mr. Andrew Way , did not want a consultation process to take place , but he eventually agreed , under pressure , that it could . He then went to the Ealing scrutiny panel , for which legislative provision is also made , without telling the parents of children at the unit , to ask for permission to have a much shorter consultation than the 90 days that he would otherwise be obliged to accept . He was , I am pleased to say , turned down and a 90 - day consultation , running to the end of June , is now in process . Mr. Way and his colleagues on the trust board have rejected the suggestions of consultees and other supporters of the unit and refuse to issue , even now , a list of the people whom they are consulting . They have decided to stage public consultation meetings on a week day between 3 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon and from 6 o'clock until 8 o'clock in the evening . I suggest to the House , knowing that hon . Members are not ordinarily cynical , that those times are manifestly inconvenient to working parents and parents of young children . The thought arises in one 's mind that Mr. Way and his colleagues might not be disappointed if attendance at those meetings turned out to be small . At the first meeting , the only parent who attended was Dr. Tony Canas who stood up passionately and rigorously for the cause of the unit . I believe that that is an absolute disgrace . It is also a disgrace that the trust board has so far refused to consult the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists ; a body that one might presume had some responsibility for potential recipients of the services under discussion . The board has also failed and refused to consult both the Association of Speech and Language Therapists in Independent Practice and the Association for All Speech Impaired Children . So far , one could be forgiven for thinking that the consultation is a sham , a farce and a disgrace and that Mr. Andrew Way and his cohorts should be ashamed of the truly despicable way in which they have gone about the matter . Dr. Lewis rose \u201a \u00c4\u00ee John Bercow : I realise that I am expressing myself in my characteristically modest and understated terms , for which I make no apology before giving way to my hon . Friend . Dr. Lewis : I am sorry to intervene again on my hon . Friend , but there seems to be a parallel here with some of the sharp practices carried out in the New Forest and Romsey area in an attempt to close much - loved community hospitals . My hon . Friend might bear in mind the fact that when statutory consultations are abused in this way , the process of judicial review is always possible . If the person undertaking the review happens to be someone eligible for legal aid , the trust may find itself facing much larger and more irrecoverable legal bills than any possible short - term saving that resulted from the initial closure of a unit . I just mention that by the by . John Bercow : I am extremely grateful to my hon . Friend for his advice , which might well come in handy in the weeks and months ahead . As far as I am concerned , this is but the start of the campaign to preserve this unit . The Royal Free Hampstead NHS trust issued an annual report last year , which \u201a \u00c4\u00eesickeningly , from my point of view \u201a \u00c4\u00eecarried on its front cover the slogan , \u201c Specialising in Excellence \u201d . That should not be a slogan , a pious hope or a rhetorical statement of good intent for a honeyed future ; it should , first and foremost , reflect the reality on the ground , current practice and existing achievement . In that context , it should reflect the medical and educational priorities of a proud parent trust . But it does not . On the strength of a one - year deficit , in the face of a continuing parliamentary inquiry into relevant matters , and with scarcely a finger lifted to promote the unit , Mr. Andrew Way and his trust board colleagues are seriously , in all conscience I am advised , proposing the closure of a unit which has done so much to help some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children in our society , and which could do so much more in the future . If Mr. Way and his colleagues believe that the only way in which they can achieve overall financial balance \u201a \u00c4\u00eenot within the unit but within the trust as a whole \u201a \u00c4\u00eeis by picking on the most vulnerable children in the community , I honestly suggest that they should be told to clear their desks and pursue employment opportunities elsewhere . I appeal to the Minister , who I think is a compassionate , decent and humanitarian figure , to agree with me that there should at the least be a stay of execution in this case . I ask the Minister from the bottom of my heart to instruct \u201a \u00c4\u00eeyes , I use that word \u201a \u00c4\u00ee the trust to do two things . First , it should write to all LEAs , to relevant GPs , to speech and language therapists , to educational psychologists , to paediatricians and possibly to others , on whom we can agree if he accepts the principle , to inform them of the services of the unit , its success rate and the advisability in many cases of a referral to it . Secondly , I urge the Minister to instruct the trust board to look seriously , not with a pathetic , dismissive one - paragraph consideration , at the possibility of moving the unit from Ealing to central London in Gray 's Inn road , thereby not only making internal cost savings through location within the hospital but opening up the potential of a much wider area from which applications and referrals can come , not least the eastern part of London . That is a sensible proposition and it ought , among others , to be examined . The Minister will have noted that I have not launched some excoriating attack on the Government 's inclusion policy . Inclusion can work for a significant , a large number of children . It is , with appropriate help and support , the right course .

Those children need additional help . There is nowhere that better provides it for children with severe speech and language impairments than the Nuffield speech and language unit .

The crime was committed by a state government and groups of individuals eager to profit from reclaiming a \u201c dismal wasteland \u201d and converting it into farm fields that would yield a bountiful harvest . The earliest efforts at draining the almost one- million - acre wetland were made in the mid-1850s , when landowners hand - dug channels to direct water into the Kankakee River . Most of the early ditching efforts were made at the eastern end of the marsh , which stretched along both sides of the river from South Bend , Ind. , to Momence .

In the 1870s and 1880s , drainage efforts were ramped up with the introduction of steam-driven dredges . The large machines were far faster and more productive than the hand - digging and oxen - drawn - plow methods used previously . They produced wider , deeper ditches , piling up the excavated material to form levees or road bases along the sides . One of the earliest waterways dug by a steam dredge was the Singleton Ditch , begun in 1873 . In Lake County , Ind. , it runs parallel to and about one mile to the north of the river , crosses the state line , and empties into the Kankakee just east of Momence .

He owned more than 25,000 acres , where he raised large herds of cattle brought to Indiana from Texas . A related drainage project was Beaver Lake , located on the southwestern edge of the marsh , north of the town of Morocco . The earliest effort to drain the 16,000 - acre lake was made by the Indiana state government in 1853 . A ditch several miles in length was dug to connect the lake with the Kankakee River , but the results were disappointing : the lake 's shoreline receded by only about 100 yards . During the next 20 years , further ditching efforts drained away most of the lake , leaving only a narrow body of water about two miles long and 800 feet wide .

It 's now time for some painful medicine . ( FORTUNE Magazine ) \u2013 Whatever happens next , the Great Asian Slump is already one for the record books . Never in the course of economic events -- not even in the early years of the Depression -- has so large a part of the world economy experienced so devastating a fall from grace . Latin America , once the world champion when it came to economic instability , has lost the title . Compared with Asia 's debacle , the tequila crisis of 1995 now looks like a minor wobble ; and the once terrifying debt crisis of the 1980s , a positively placid affair . Moreover , Asia is nowhere near having hit bottom : While the region 's currencies seem to have stopped plunging for the moment , its real economies are getting weaker , not stronger . Hong Kong just announced that its economy shrank 2.8 % in the first quarter of 1998 , its worst recession since World War II . Economists predict that Indonesia 's GDP will fall an astonishing 15.1 % this year . Compare that with America 's worst postwar recession year - - 1982 -- when the economy shrank 2.1 % . And it turns out that Japan 's bad bank debt is not $ 550 billion , as previously reported , but a whopping $ 1 trillion ( see following story ) . The repercussions from all this bad news are just now being felt , not the least of which is a case of the jitters for the U.S. stock markets . There have already been many recriminations over whom to blame for this catastrophe . Was it punishment for Asian sins or the nefarious work of evil speculators ? Did the IMF make the best of a bad situation or did it simply pour fuel on the fire ? There is some point to these arguments : Figuring out who lost Asia may help the world keep this crisis , or the next one , from spreading . But the really important question is , Now what ? Do we -- meaning the IMF , the U.S. Treasury , and the afflicted countries -- stick with Plan A , the strategy we 've been following so far ? Or is it time to try Plan B ? And what is Plan B , anyway ? The short answer is that it is time to think seriously about Plan B. And Plan B is fairly obvious -- except that nobody , not even Plan A 's harshest critics , has been willing to talk about it openly . But before we get to that , let 's remind ourselves of how we got here . ASIA : WHAT WENT WRONG By now the outline of how Asia fell apart is pretty familiar . At least in part , the region 's downfall was a punishment for its sins . We all know now what we should have known even during the boom years : that there was a dark underside to \" Asian values , \" that the success of too many Asian businessmen depended less on what they knew than on whom they knew . Crony capitalism meant , in particular , that dubious investments -- unneeded office blocks outside Bangkok , ego-driven diversification by South Korean chaebol -- were cheerfully funded by local banks , as long as the borrower had the right government connections . Sooner or later there had to be a reckoning . Even before the crisis , at a time when foreign banks were still lending and Indonesia 's debt was rated Baa , the facade was beginning to crumble : Big Korean companies were going belly - up ; Thai finance companies were folding . But financial excess , abetted by undue political influence , and a morning - after hangover are not particular to Asia -- remember those Texas thrifts ? The unique aspect of Asia 's comeuppance is not the awfulness of the crime but the severity of the punishment . What turned a bad financial situation into a catastrophe was the way a loss of confidence turned into self - reinforcing panic . In 1996 capital was flowing into emerging Asia at the rate of about $ 100 billion a year ; by the second half of 1997 it was flowing out at about the same rate . Inevitably , with that kind of reversal Asia 's asset markets plunged , its economies went into recession , and it only got worse from there . The upshot -- well , let 's quote from the June report of the Bank for International Settlements , an organization based in Basel , Switzerland , that is not usually given to purple prose : \" The effects of economic slowdowns , asset price collapses , and banking crises tend to be mutually reinforcing as the curtailment of bank credit depresses asset prices and further deepens recessions . This in turn creates additional problems for banks that are forced to retrench still further . ' Vicious circle ' has been an overworked term , but it describes Asia 's crisis all too well . \" SO WHAT DO YOU DO ? In the early days of the Asian crisis , Stanley Fischer -- the economist 's economist who is also the second - highest - ranking official at the IMF -- warned a Hong Kong audience of \" the possibility that [ speculative ] attacks become self - fulfilling prophecies . \" He worried , for instance , that any attack that forces a devaluation and higher interest rates would also weaken the banking system . In other words , you ca n't accuse the IMF of being naive : Officials there understood right from the beginning that the vicious circle the BIS so eloquently describes was a possibility , and they tried their best to prevent it . Working closely with the U.S. Treasury ( whose own No. 2 is , of course , Lawrence Summers , another major economics heavyweight ) , the IMF came up with a strategy that went like this : 1 . Lend the afflicted countries money to help tide them over the crisis . 2 . As a condition for the loan , demand that they reform their economies , eliminating the worst excesses of crony capitalism . 3 . Require them to maintain high interest rates to entice capital into staying in the country . 4 . Wait for confidence to return and for the vicious circle to turn into a virtuous circle . Even in retrospect , this was by no means a stupid strategy . Imagine for a moment that the U.S. had no deposit insurance , and that doubts about a major bank 's management had caused a run by the bank 's depositors . What would the Federal Reserve do ? Well , it would probably lend the bank some cash to meet its immediate needs ; as a condition for the loan , demand that the bank president fire his nephew ; and tell the bank to try to hold on to its depositors by offering them high interest rates . Then everyone would cross his fingers and hope for the best . What 's more , this strategy worked the last time around . In 1995 , Mexico experienced a crisis that , in its early months , seemed worse than the Asian debacle . Robert Rubin and company rode to Mexico 's rescue with a large line of credit ; the Mexicans moved to shore up their shaky banks ; interest rates in Mexico were pushed sky-high ; and then all held their breath . It was a terrible year for the Mexican economy , but in the end everything worked out : Money started flowing in again , interest rates fell , and after slumping 6.2 % the first year , Mexico staged an impressively rapid recovery . In other words , Plan A was the natural thing to try . You might even say that it was inevitable : Given not just the economic but the political logic of the situation , and given the success of a similar strategy in Mexico just two years before , how could the IMF and the Treasury not try to repeat their earlier triumph ? THE CRITICS While the IMF 's response to the Asian crisis may have been a foregone conclusion , that did n't mean that it went unchallenged . From early on there has been a chorus of disapproval , which has left the IMF 's public image badly battered . And some of the critics may have been at least partly right -- but only some of them , because the critics disagree more with one another than they do with the IMF . Roughly speaking , half of them are hard - money types : people who think that the IMF brought on the crisis by encouraging countries to devalue when they should have kept their exchange rates fixed . The other half are soft - money types , who think that the IMF placed too much emphasis on currency stability . They ca n't both be right . Actually , some of them are wrong for sure . The hard - money attack on Plan A -- an attack mainly carried out on the opinion pages of Forbes and the Wall Street Journal , and by other supply - side conservatives -- amounts to saying that Asian countries should have defended their exchange rates at all costs . To have done this in the face of massive capital flight , however , would have meant drastically reducing the quantity of money in circulation -- producing extremely high interest rates , far higher than what the countries have had to impose . And a central bank that ca n't print money because it is required to keep the exchange rate fixed ca n't act as a lender of last resort , providing cash to local banks threatened with runs . ( Argentina , whose \" currency board \" and one - peso / one - dollar policy are much lauded by conservatives , could only watch helplessly as its banking sector started to implode in 1995 ; luckily the World Bank came to the rescue . ) If you ask the hard - money types why they think their plans would have worked , why they would n't have produced a worse catastrophe , the only answer you get is that if only Thailand had n't devalued , or if Indonesia had established a currency board , confidence would have returned , and everything would have been all right . Well , maybe -- but it 's a completely circular argument . After all , any economic plan for Asia would have worked if it had instantly restored confidence . Why not skip the currency board and simply tell people to smile more often ? And for those who think that this crisis would n't have happened if only we had been on the gold standard , remember that the last time most major currencies were tied to gold was in 1929 ... The soft - money critics of the IMF , like Harvard 's Jeffrey Sachs -- who think less emphasis should have been placed on currency stability -- had a better case . They argued -- correctly -- that the high interest rates the IMF was demanding of countries would cause severe recessions and financial distress , and that as a result even healthy banks and companies would eventually collapse . So instead of insisting that countries raise interest rates to defend their currencies , they thought the IMF should have told countries to keep interest rates low and try to keep their real economies growing . That advice sounds pretty good , so it 's important to understand why smart people like Fischer and Summers did n't take it . For starters , the way the advice was given -- wrapped in vitriolic accusations that the IMF was both secretive and incompetent -- did n't help . More important , however , the soft - money critics never explained what was supposed to happen to exchange rates . In late 1997 the Korean won lost half its value in a matter of weeks . Would n't it have plunged even further , perhaps even gone into free fall , if Korea had n't raised interest rates ? And would n't that have risked spurring a hyperinflation -- not to mention instantly bankrupting all those banks and companies that had large dollar debts ? These questions never got a clear answer . Jeff Sachs has at times seemed to suggest that lowering interest rates would have strengthened rather than weakened Asian currencies -- that even though investors would have received lower rewards for holding won or bahts , the prospective improvement in the state of the real economy would have -- you guessed it -- restored confidence . At other times he has simply seemed to argue that while the currencies would fall , they would n't fall all that much , and little harm would be done . Well , maybe -- but as of last autumn that did n't seem as good a bet as Plan A. And so Plan A it was . But things have not gone too well . WHY PLAN A HASN'T WORKED Last autumn nobody imagined that Year One of the Asian crisis could be worse than 1995 in Mexico . But it was : Indonesia is a wreck , and there are few rays of sunshine even in the IMF 's obedient client states . What went wrong ? Here 's a partial list : IMF mistakes . The IMF clearly got some of the details wrong -- and some of those details were pretty big . It insisted that countries cut spending and raise taxes , a gratuitous deflationary policy that worsened the recession and the situation . Too much leverage . Mexico was able to go through a year of interest rates that ran as high as 75 % and survive . Asia 's economies , it turned out , were more vulnerable because their corporations were much more highly leveraged . When your debt is four or five times your equity -- an unheard - of ratio in the West but standard practice in South Korea -- it does n't take very long for recession plus high interest rates to wipe you out . Japan . The world 's second - largest economy --a country with a stable government , no foreign debt , and no inflation -- should have been a locomotive for its neighbors , the way the U.S. was for Mexico . Instead , Japan has been very much part of the problem . For all these factors , and maybe for other reasons we still do n't understand , the past year has been almost unimaginably bad . It is true that the wild currency swings of last year have subsided and that currencies have stabilized enough for some Asian governments to try to cut interest rates a bit , but those rates remain far too high to jump-start their devastated economies . At the same time , the double squeeze of high interest rates and depressed economies is steadily driving even the best-managed companies into bankruptcy . So what 's left of Plan A? Well , Korea and Thailand are proceeding with bank cleanups along the lines of America 's savings - and - loan rescue . That is definitely a good thing -- but it is not at all clear why it should help promote short - term recovery . ( Unless -- you guessed it again -- it restores confidence . ) Anyway , given the deeply depressed state of their economies , bank reform is chasing a moving target : Good loans are turning into bad as you read this . Otherwise , the plan seems to have degenerated into one of waiting for Godot : buying time in the hope that something good will eventually happen . And it might . Maybe Japan 's new Prime Minister will astonish the world by devising a massive stimulus plan that pulls not only Japan but also the whole region out of its slump . Maybe there will be a spontaneous shift in investor sentiment , and money will move from Internet stocks to Asian bonds . Maybe -- well , maybe the time has come to think seriously about Plan B. WHAT IS PLAN B ? The hard - money types have been surprisingly quiet about Asia 's predicament : They make occasional declarations that none of this would have happened if their advice had been taken , but they do n't seem to be making any suggestions about what to do now . The soft-money types are more forthcoming : As always , they insist that Asian countries must cut interest rates in order to have a chance at recovery . And they 're probably right . The problem is that the original objection to interest - rate reductions still stands . As Stan Fischer recently put it , \" I ca n't believe that serious people believe that without temporarily increasing interest rates , we could have contained the problems \" of plunging currencies . In late June , Bob Rubin toured Asia urging countries to stick to their tight - money policies , presumably fearing that if they did n't , the region 's currencies would again go into free fall . In short , Asia is stuck : Its economies are dead in the water , but trying to do anything major to get them moving risks provoking another wave of capital flight and a worse crisis . In effect , the region 's economic policy has become hostage to skittish investors . Is there any way out ? Yes , there is , but it is a solution so unfashionable , so stigmatized , that hardly anyone has dared suggest it . The unsayable words are \" exchange controls . \" Exchange controls used to be the standard response of countries with balance - of - payments crises . The details varied , but usually they worked something like this : Exporters were required to sell their foreign - currency earnings to the government at a fixed exchange rate ; that currency would in turn be sold at the same rate for approved payments to foreigners , basically for imports and debt service . While some countries tried to make other foreign - exchange transactions illegal , other countries allowed a parallel market . Either way , once the system was in place , a country did n't have to worry that cutting interest rates would cause the currency to plunge . Maybe the parallel exchange rate would sink , but that would n't affect the prices of imports or the balance sheets of companies and banks . If this sounds too easy to you , you 're right . Exchange controls present lots of problems in practice . Aside from the burden of paperwork and bureaucracy involved , they are -- surprise ! -- subject to abuse : Exporters have an incentive to hide their foreign - exchange receipts ; importers , an incentive to pad their invoices . Every country that has tried to maintain exchange controls for an extended period eventually finds the accumulating distortions intolerable , and there is a virtual consensus among economists that exchange controls work badly . But when you face the kind of disaster now occurring in Asia , the question has to be : badly compared with what ? After Mexico imposed exchange controls during the 1982 debt crisis , it went through five years of stagnation --a dismal result , but when your GDP has contracted by 5 % , 10 % , or 20 % , stagnation looks like a big improvement . And think about China right now : a country whose crony capitalism makes Thailand look like Switzerland and whose bankers make Suharto 's son look like J.P. Morgan . Why has n't China been nearly as badly hit as its neighbors ? Because it has been able to cut , not raise , interest rates in this crisis , despite maintaining a fixed exchange rate ; and the reason it is able to do that is that it has an inconvertible currency , a.k.a. exchange controls . Those controls are often evaded , and they are the source of lots of corruption , but they still give China a degree of policy leeway that the rest of Asia desperately wishes it had . In short , Plan B involves giving up for a time the business of trying to regain the confidence of international investors and forcibly breaking the link between domestic interest rates and the exchange rate . The policy freedom that Asia needs to rebuild its economies would clearly come at a price , but as the slump gets ever deeper , that price is starting to look more and more worth paying . You do n't have to agree that the time has come to adopt Plan B -- or even that it will ever come -- to admit that something like this is the obvious alternative to the current wait - and - hope strategy . And yet it is very hard to find anyone , even among the IMF 's critics , talking about it . How come ? THE NONCONSPIRACY OF SILENCE It 's no surprise that the IMF and the U.S. Treasury have n't said anything about alternatives to the current Asian strategy . The key players are neither stupid nor doctrinaire , but as a political matter they must of course always express complete confidence in whatever harsh medicine they prescribe . Moreover , even to hint at the possibility of exchange controls might itself cause capital flight and force Asian countries to raise interest rates rather than lower them . In other words , Plan B is like a devaluation : Officials always deny firmly that they would even consider the possibility of such a thing until the moment they do it . This gag rule applies not only to officials but to anyone who is associated with the strategy : bankers , major institutional investors , and so on . There is even some self - imposed moral pressure on those who have no policy role but are nonetheless broadly sympathetic with the policymakers and their dilemmas . Consider , for example , the situation of an economics professor and sometime journalist who has known Fischer and Summers all his professional life , wishes them well , and understands why they initially tried Plan A . As you might imagine , he would be very reluctant to go public with his doubts -- say , to suggest in a major business magazine that the time has come for Plan B--unless he was pretty definitely convinced that Plan A had reached a dead end . What is surprising is that neither the Western critics of the IMF nor the Asians themselves have talked much about how to cut interest rates without sending currencies into a free fall . Again , some of these people are very smart , and the thought that it might be necessary to resort to temporary exchange controls must have crossed their minds . Why not say so ? One suspects that considerations of salesmanship may be playing a role . Cutting interest rates sounds very appealing ; imposing exchange controls , with their deservedly unsavory reputation , does not ; so maybe the thing is to emphasize the positive and worry about the unpleasant corollaries later . And for the Asians themselves , the whole reversal of fortune may simply have been too much to take onboard at once . Barely a year ago these were the economies of the future ; to admit that they may need to turn back the policy clock , to implement the kinds of emergency measures that the Latin Americans adopted during the 1980s , may be more humiliation than they can stand just yet . Can you really blame them ? If Asian nations did adopt currency controls , they 'd have to brace themselves for an even rougher ride . Any chance of attracting new foreign investment would disappear . The financial markets would probably go into another swoon . But the damage , though painful , would be only temporary . As interest rates fell , local economies would eventually recover , confidence would return ( for real ! ) , and those nasty currency controls could be dropped -- one hopes forever . But if Asia does not act quickly , we could be looking at a true Depression scenario -- the kind of slump that 60 years ago devastated societies , destabilized governments , and eventually led to war . Extreme situations demand extreme measures ; it 's time to talk about Plan B. PAUL KRUGMAN is an economics professor at MIT .

It 's now time for some painful medicine . ( FORTUNE Magazine ) \u2013 Whatever happens next , the Great Asian Slump is already one for the record books . Never in the course of economic events -- not even in the early years of the Depression -- has so large a part of the world economy experienced so devastating a fall from grace . Latin America , once the world champion when it came to economic instability , has lost the title . Compared with Asia 's debacle , the tequila crisis of 1995 now looks like a minor wobble ; and the once terrifying debt crisis of the 1980s , a positively placid affair . Moreover , Asia is nowhere near having hit bottom : While the region 's currencies seem to have stopped plunging for the moment , its real economies are getting weaker , not stronger . Hong Kong just announced that its economy shrank 2.8 % in the first quarter of 1998 , its worst recession since World War II . Economists predict that Indonesia 's GDP will fall an astonishing 15.1 % this year . Compare that with America 's worst postwar recession year - - 1982 -- when the economy shrank 2.1 % . And it turns out that Japan 's bad bank debt is not $ 550 billion , as previously reported , but a whopping $ 1 trillion ( see following story ) . The repercussions from all this bad news are just now being felt , not the least of which is a case of the jitters for the U.S. stock markets . There have already been many recriminations over whom to blame for this catastrophe . Was it punishment for Asian sins or the nefarious work of evil speculators ? Did the IMF make the best of a bad situation or did it simply pour fuel on the fire ? There is some point to these arguments : Figuring out who lost Asia may help the world keep this crisis , or the next one , from spreading . But the really important question is , Now what ? Do we -- meaning the IMF , the U.S. Treasury , and the afflicted countries -- stick with Plan A , the strategy we 've been following so far ? Or is it time to try Plan B ? And what is Plan B , anyway ? The short answer is that it is time to think seriously about Plan B. And Plan B is fairly obvious -- except that nobody , not even Plan A 's harshest critics , has been willing to talk about it openly . But before we get to that , let 's remind ourselves of how we got here . ASIA : WHAT WENT WRONG By now the outline of how Asia fell apart is pretty familiar . At least in part , the region 's downfall was a punishment for its sins . We all know now what we should have known even during the boom years : that there was a dark underside to \" Asian values , \" that the success of too many Asian businessmen depended less on what they knew than on whom they knew . Crony capitalism meant , in particular , that dubious investments -- unneeded office blocks outside Bangkok , ego-driven diversification by South Korean chaebol -- were cheerfully funded by local banks , as long as the borrower had the right government connections . Sooner or later there had to be a reckoning . Even before the crisis , at a time when foreign banks were still lending and Indonesia 's debt was rated Baa , the facade was beginning to crumble : Big Korean companies were going belly - up ; Thai finance companies were folding . But financial excess , abetted by undue political influence , and a morning - after hangover are not particular to Asia -- remember those Texas thrifts ? The unique aspect of Asia 's comeuppance is not the awfulness of the crime but the severity of the punishment . What turned a bad financial situation into a catastrophe was the way a loss of confidence turned into self - reinforcing panic . In 1996 capital was flowing into emerging Asia at the rate of about $ 100 billion a year ; by the second half of 1997 it was flowing out at about the same rate . Inevitably , with that kind of reversal Asia 's asset markets plunged , its economies went into recession , and it only got worse from there . The upshot -- well , let 's quote from the June report of the Bank for International Settlements , an organization based in Basel , Switzerland , that is not usually given to purple prose : \" The effects of economic slowdowns , asset price collapses , and banking crises tend to be mutually reinforcing as the curtailment of bank credit depresses asset prices and further deepens recessions .

Every country that has tried to maintain exchange controls for an extended period eventually finds the accumulating distortions intolerable , and there is a virtual consensus among economists that exchange controls work badly . But when you face the kind of disaster now occurring in Asia , the question has to be : badly compared with what ? After Mexico imposed exchange controls during the 1982 debt crisis , it went through five years of stagnation --a dismal result , but when your GDP has contracted by 5 % , 10 % , or 20 % , stagnation looks like a big improvement . And think about China right now : a country whose crony capitalism makes Thailand look like Switzerland and whose bankers make Suharto 's son look like J.P. Morgan . Why has n't China been nearly as badly hit as its neighbors ? Because it has been able to cut , not raise , interest rates in this crisis , despite maintaining a fixed exchange rate ; and the reason it is able to do that is that it has an inconvertible currency , a.k.a. exchange controls . Those controls are often evaded , and they are the source of lots of corruption , but they still give China a degree of policy leeway that the rest of Asia desperately wishes it had . In short , Plan B involves giving up for a time the business of trying to regain the confidence of international investors and forcibly breaking the link between domestic interest rates and the exchange rate . The policy freedom that Asia needs to rebuild its economies would clearly come at a price , but as the slump gets ever deeper , that price is starting to look more and more worth paying . You do n't have to agree that the time has come to adopt Plan B -- or even that it will ever come -- to admit that something like this is the obvious alternative to the current wait - and - hope strategy . And yet it is very hard to find anyone , even among the IMF 's critics , talking about it . How come ? THE NONCONSPIRACY OF SILENCE It 's no surprise that the IMF and the U.S. Treasury have n't said anything about alternatives to the current Asian strategy . The key players are neither stupid nor doctrinaire , but as a political matter they must of course always express complete confidence in whatever harsh medicine they prescribe . Moreover , even to hint at the possibility of exchange controls might itself cause capital flight and force Asian countries to raise interest rates rather than lower them . In other words , Plan B is like a devaluation : Officials always deny firmly that they would even consider the possibility of such a thing until the moment they do it . This gag rule applies not only to officials but to anyone who is associated with the strategy : bankers , major institutional investors , and so on . There is even some self - imposed moral pressure on those who have no policy role but are nonetheless broadly sympathetic with the policymakers and their dilemmas . Consider , for example , the situation of an economics professor and sometime journalist who has known Fischer and Summers all his professional life , wishes them well , and understands why they initially tried Plan A . As you might imagine , he would be very reluctant to go public with his doubts -- say , to suggest in a major business magazine that the time has come for Plan B--unless he was pretty definitely convinced that Plan A had reached a dead end . What is surprising is that neither the Western critics of the IMF nor the Asians themselves have talked much about how to cut interest rates without sending currencies into a free fall . Again , some of these people are very smart , and the thought that it might be necessary to resort to temporary exchange controls must have crossed their minds . Why not say so ? One suspects that considerations of salesmanship may be playing a role . Cutting interest rates sounds very appealing ; imposing exchange controls , with their deservedly unsavory reputation , does not ; so maybe the thing is to emphasize the positive and worry about the unpleasant corollaries later . And for the Asians themselves , the whole reversal of fortune may simply have been too much to take onboard at once . Barely a year ago these were the economies of the future ; to admit that they may need to turn back the policy clock , to implement the kinds of emergency measures that the Latin Americans adopted during the 1980s , may be more humiliation than they can stand just yet . Can you really blame them ? If Asian nations did adopt currency controls , they 'd have to brace themselves for an even rougher ride . Any chance of attracting new foreign investment would disappear . The financial markets would probably go into another swoon . But the damage , though painful , would be only temporary . As interest rates fell , local economies would eventually recover , confidence would return ( for real ! ) , and those nasty currency controls could be dropped -- one hopes forever . But if Asia does not act quickly , we could be looking at a true Depression scenario -- the kind of slump that 60 years ago devastated societies , destabilized governments , and eventually led to war . Extreme situations demand extreme measures ; it 's time to talk about Plan B. PAUL KRUGMAN is an economics professor at MIT .

The state 's three prisons for women are at 129 percent of capacity , meaning inmates must sleep in temporary bunk beds in day rooms . Shelves with thousands of inmate files jam what once was a basketball court at the Kate Barnard Correctional Center . It 's the backup for a three - decade - old software program used for recordkeeping . With overcrowded and deteriorating prisons and shortages of corrections officers , Oklahoma 's prison system might appear to be primed for a federal takeover . As if to make the point , the state Department of Corrections last month proposed a budget increase of $ 1 billion in appropriations for fiscal 2019 , similar to last year 's request . \u201c We are not a listing ship , \u201d Corrections Director Joe Allbaugh said recently in his Oklahoma City office . \u201c We are a sinking ship . \u201d But after years of warnings that the federal government could take the helm of corrections and right the ship , it has yet to happen . People are also reading \u2026 Year after year , the inmate population continues to rise , facilities decline , the department turns to private prisons , costs go up , and efforts to lower incarceration rates advance in fits and starts . Allbaugh and other leaders also warned that a riot could erupt , evoking the notorious three - day riot in 1973 that burned much of the penitentiary in McAlester and left three inmates dead . There are some signs that legal action could eventually lead to dramatic changes . But instances of federal courts or agencies taking control of states ' entire prison systems are unusual and scattered . Still , across the country a number of state prisons or county jails answer to federal overseers . And in Oklahoma , it would be a case of repeating history . How the feds intervene The federal government does n't decide on its own to assume control of a state corrections system or send in its own hand - picked people to operate a system or prison . Federal intervention often begins with a lawsuit filed by one or more inmates who allege a pattern of problems or injustices in a facility or a system . The lawsuit may result in a consent decree , with the state agreeing to cede authority over all or part of its prisons and submit to oversight and supervision by the U.S. Justice Department or a judge . The Justice Department also has the authority to investigate jails and prisons and file lawsuits on its own , or join existing lawsuits , in order to force changes . A number of prison or jail systems have faced federal action , including in 2009 when Oklahoma County entered into an agreement with the feds to improve its jail in areas such as mental health services and housing . In Oklahoma , the question is whether life and treatment of inmates in prisons have reached a point where constitutional rights are being violated , which could lead to federal oversight . President Donald Trump 's administration , however , might be less inclined than former President Barack Obama 's administration to intervene . Allbaugh says that absent any changes in the agency 's overall direction , the state could find itself under a federal consent decree . \u201c That is where the Justice Department comes in and tells you how you 're going to run your prison system , and it 's very costly , \u201d he said . Lawsuits simmer It 's common for inmates to sue corrections departments in state or federal court , representing themselves or relying on an attorney . Earlier this week , a federal appeals court revived inmate Joseph Womble 's lawsuit against the Corrections Department alleging that conditions in the state 's prisons violated his constitutional rights . He said temperatures in his cell at the Mack Alford Correctional Center in Stringtown climbed above 90 degrees for half of June 2016 and he became dehydrated . Another lawsuit brought in August by inmates and an advocacy group allege that state officials and private- prison companies are perpetuating high rates of incarceration through the state 's guarantee that it will keep private prisons at least 98 percent full . The inmates have asked the Justice Department to intervene . One inmate , Stephen Craig Burnett , has sued the Corrections Department several times , most recently in 2014 when he was in the James Crabtree Correctional Center in Helena . Serving a life sentence for murdering his wife , Burnett alleges that prisons are overcrowded and understaffed and pose a danger to inmates and officers . The case was dismissed but remains on appeal . Historic case Tulsa attorney Louis Bullock spent much of his career on a landmark Oklahoma case , Battle v. Anderson , involving federal intervention in the state 's prisons . Bullock became the lead counsel for plaintiffs in 1976 , working on the case until 2000 . The Battle case started with about six inmates in the penitentiary and centered on medical care , due process and use of force in 1972 and before . In 1977 , when lawyers had a better understanding of the evidence , the case had grown to include confinement conditions and overcrowding , Bullock said . The litigation also expanded to cover all the state 's prisons and inmates . The lawsuit was filed one year before the 1973 riot , which put the system under further scrutiny . Even so , the \u201c minimally adequate system \u201d that resulted from the lawsuit was \u201c unfortunately a high - water mark \u201d for Oklahoma before conditions worsened , Bullock said . Bullock said there is \u201c little question \u201d that the state is following a path that will lead to a lawsuit and federal oversight of the prison system . \u201c They do not have the capacity to hold the number of people they 're locking up , \u201d he said , adding , \u201c Even from my distance , I can see the deterioration that is taking place , and they have a very real risk that the federal courts will have to take over the prison system again . \u201d Bullock added that money wo n't fix everything : Changes to the criminal justice system also are needed . He 's concerned that the Corrections Department is seeking money to build new prisons rather than focusing on reducing incarceration . \u201c The one lesson that Oklahoma should know by now is that they have never been successful \u2014 in fact , no one 's ever been successful \u2014 in building out of this crisis , \u201d Bullock said . He invoked a line from the movie \u201c Field of Dreams \u201d : \u201c Prisons are like the proverbial ball fields in Iowa . If you build it , they will come . \u201d As to whether federal oversight will happen , corrections director Allbaugh said , \u201c We 'll see . I hate the thought of that because I believe the Department of Corrections is one of the major core functions of government . ... There 's always going to be bad people . \u201d But \u201c if the state does n't demonstrate that they can handle their prison population in a safe and humane way , what are inmates supposed to do ?

The state 's three prisons for women are at 129 percent of capacity , meaning inmates must sleep in temporary bunk beds in day rooms . Shelves with thousands of inmate files jam what once was a basketball court at the Kate Barnard Correctional Center . It 's the backup for a three - decade - old software program used for recordkeeping . With overcrowded and deteriorating prisons and shortages of corrections officers , Oklahoma 's prison system might appear to be primed for a federal takeover . As if to make the point , the state Department of Corrections last month proposed a budget increase of $ 1 billion in appropriations for fiscal 2019 , similar to last year 's request . \u201c We are not a listing ship , \u201d Corrections Director Joe Allbaugh said recently in his Oklahoma City office . \u201c We are a sinking ship . \u201d But after years of warnings that the federal government could take the helm of corrections and right the ship , it has yet to happen . People are also reading \u2026 Year after year , the inmate population continues to rise , facilities decline , the department turns to private prisons , costs go up , and efforts to lower incarceration rates advance in fits and starts . Allbaugh and other leaders also warned that a riot could erupt , evoking the notorious three - day riot in 1973 that burned much of the penitentiary in McAlester and left three inmates dead . There are some signs that legal action could eventually lead to dramatic changes . But instances of federal courts or agencies taking control of states ' entire prison systems are unusual and scattered . Still , across the country a number of state prisons or county jails answer to federal overseers . And in Oklahoma , it would be a case of repeating history . How the feds intervene The federal government does n't decide on its own to assume control of a state corrections system or send in its own hand - picked people to operate a system or prison . Federal intervention often begins with a lawsuit filed by one or more inmates who allege a pattern of problems or injustices in a facility or a system . The lawsuit may result in a consent decree , with the state agreeing to cede authority over all or part of its prisons and submit to oversight and supervision by the U.S. Justice Department or a judge . The Justice Department also has the authority to investigate jails and prisons and file lawsuits on its own , or join existing lawsuits , in order to force changes . A number of prison or jail systems have faced federal action , including in 2009 when Oklahoma County entered into an agreement with the feds to improve its jail in areas such as mental health services and housing . In Oklahoma , the question is whether life and treatment of inmates in prisons have reached a point where constitutional rights are being violated , which could lead to federal oversight . President Donald Trump 's administration , however , might be less inclined than former President Barack Obama 's administration to intervene . Allbaugh says that absent any changes in the agency 's overall direction , the state could find itself under a federal consent decree . \u201c That is where the Justice Department comes in and tells you how you 're going to run your prison system , and it 's very costly , \u201d he said .

A farmer who lives alone wakes in the middle of the night after hearing what he thinks is a massive blast . It 's too loud for a gunshot . It must have been a transformer exploding , but the power is still on . He puts it down to a tremor from an earthquake . Nothing appears to be damaged so he goes back to bed . It 's a problem for the morning . Fifteen kilometres away , a huge explosion has rocked the town of Derrinallum . CFA volunteers are quickly alerted as their pagers signal an emergency . They are needed on the ground just a few kilometres to the west . Donning their trademark yellow uniforms and helmets , they rush to the scene in their trucks . They are told to wait . A few hours pass and they are stood down . There is nothing they can do . In the early hours of Saturday morning the drizzle sets in . The town wakes to the unmistakable drone of police and television helicopters and dozens of police cars . Neighbours are talking , friends ring each other . News broadcasts will soon fill in the missing gaps . Not since 1944 , when bushfires razed the town , has Derrinallum been in the national spotlight . HIS name was Glenn Sanders . He was a kind soul who had developed a troubled mind . His piercing eyes and long , willowy beard were unmistakable around the district . He was known for his generous spirit and his polite and friendly nature . His mechanical prowess was second to none . If you needed something fixed , there was no argument : he was the \u201c go - to \u201d man . Some people referred to him as the \u201c Colonel ' ' because of his beard and the similarities to Colonel Sanders of KFC fame . He reminded others of MacGyver , the television hero who could easily solve complex problems armed only with a roll of duct tape and a Swiss army knife . Eighteen months ago that all changed . He had become volatile , worrying locals with his paranoia , unpredictable behaviour and threats . They saw him out walking the streets with a vest rigged with explosives concealed under his jacket . They could hear blasts coming from his property on the western edge of town and from the cemetery , to the east , at all hours of the night . Advertisement Horrified residents in the close - knit town reported him to police , but officers found no sign of explosives and they did n't have enough evidence to do a full search of his property . They did manage to take his explosives licence away . About a month ago , Glenn Sanders rode the 12 kilometres into Lismore on his Harley - Davidson with his sheepdog on the back . He was n't wearing a helmet . A local takeaway operator suggested he should be worried about getting caught by police or falling off and injuring himself . His response was : \u201c No . When I go , I go big . \u201d That something \u201c big \u201d happened . Just what occurred is under wraps , but it involved a \u201c violent incident \u201d last Thursday week . Someone was troubled enough to make an official report to police , who put Sanders under surveillance with the task of arresting him . Their operation had begun . We now know that police were concerned about items Sanders had strapped to his body . Specialists were called in and began negotiations as soon as he returned to his property about 7 pm on Friday . Advertisement He had not entered his house when they attempted to get him to undress and remove the items . A seven-hour stand - off had begun . Just before 1.30 am his house exploded and , shortly after , the items he was wearing also exploded . The injuries were fatal . Two police officers were also injured and were taken to hospital . Remains , believed to be those of Sanders , were removed from the property on Tuesday afternoon . The highway was closed as soon as the siege began . More than a week later the roadblocks remain in place . The town is still isolated and trade is down . \u201c The Glenn we knew was n't the same Glenn who did this . It was just a different person altogether . He was always such a nice guy . \u201d - Derrinallum Post Office owner Margaret Howard Advertisement Oddly enough , the people of Derrinallum are now willing to forgive all that . And they also seem willing to forgive the man responsible for putting the media spotlight on the town for all the wrong reasons . A simple observation by a woman attempting to bring normality back by enjoying a picnic lunch in the elm avenue with her grandson best reflects that view : \u201c I think we 'll all remember him for what he was \u2014 a great talented man \u2014 rather than what he had become . \u201d Margaret Howard , who runs the post office agrees : \u201c The Glenn we knew was n't the same Glenn who did this . It was just a different person altogether . He was always such a nice guy . \u201d Glenn Albert Sanders was born on November 25 , 1965 at a time when Australia was in the grip of conservatism . Henry Bolte was premier , Sir Robert Menzies was still prime minister after 16 years and Australia had just entered the war with Vietnam . His parents Keith and Margaret Sanders ran the farm at 1370 Hamilton Highway which is now a crime scene . Locals described them as \u201c very placid people \u201d . His brother Andrew was born a few years later . Sanders was a born and bred country boy . He never ventured far from home , attending kindergarten and school at Derrinallum and then gaining an apprenticeship as a motor mechanic just up the road in Mortlake . Advertisement He was a quick learner and was qualified by the time he was just 18 or 19 . Returning home to help on the farm , Sanders dabbled in mechanical work and this eventually became his full - time trade . Rob Jamieson , a fourth - generation farmer at the historic Stony Point property in Darlington , offered Sanders a permanent part-time job in the late 1980s and early 1990s . \" He was n't a mad idiot who had a fetish for blowing things up . He used explosives like it was one of the tools in his toolbox . He was very skilled at it . \" - Clive Jamieson Every week he would spend one day in the farm workshop repairing and servicing machinery and another day restoring old cars and motorbikes for Rob , who was a passionate motor racing enthusiast . Sanders also had a love of racing and restored his own vehicles , competing in speedway and drags . Advertisement Rob 's son Clive Jamieson said the pair had a father - son- type relationship because of their shared interests . \u201c Even though they came from completely different walks of life , dad and Glenn had a very special rapport because of their passion for cars . \u201d Clive , who has known Sanders since the pair were at primary school in the late 1970s , described his welding and engineering skills as \u201c brilliant \u201d . \u201c He was always happy to do whatever task we charged him with even though some of it was probably below him . \u201d \u201c He was n't a mad idiot who had a fetish for blowing things up . He used explosives like it was one of the tools in his toolbox . He was very skilled at it . \u201d As part of his work on farms , Sanders would use an air compressor to remove the muck accumulated in windmill casings and then throw a part-stick of gelignite down the hole to create a cavity for water to accumulate . Advertisement Clive 's family wants to remember Sanders as the \u201c very kind , polite and friendly person \u201d they knew at Stony Point . \u201c We do n't want Glenn 's life to be defined by his final actions . \u201d Sanders also supported another local motoring enthusiast , Gary Poole , in his hobby . Mr Poole , a Derrinallum plumber , is well known for his trip overseas early last year to recreate the historic Monte Carlo rally in his FX Holden with V8 Supercar drivers Craig Lowndes and Richard Davison . Sanders took an avid interest in the project . Mr Poole says the pair had a lifelong friendship and Sanders helped with his other FX Holden race car over many years . \u201c The Sanders boys had a farm ute , an FJ Holden , which he gave to me 25 years ago for parts . \u201d Sanders left the Jamiesons ' employ in the mid-1990s when his business had grown enough with its own clientele . Advertisement \" We do n't want Glenn 's life to be defined by his final actions . \" - Clive Jamieson By that time he was married to first wife Sue , seven years his elder . She would do the accounts but \u201c kept pretty much to herself \u201d . The couple were later divorced and she now lives in a nearby town . His second wife , Shirley Savage from Cobden , had been married twice before and had an adult daughter from her first marriage . Shirley was well known around the district for the distinctive \u201c Cobden \u201d registration plates on her Prado four- wheel - drive . She also owned a motorhome and an old Austin A50 Cambridge car which Sanders had restored . Photographs from the bomb site show the three vehicles intact at the edge of the pile of rubble and twisted metal that was once Sanders ' substantial home and several sheds . Advertisement His mother 's house also remains standing . Some people say he knew exactly what he wanted to destroy and what he wanted to leave using carefully placed explosives .

Warrnambool Standard Advertisement He is destined to be known as the Derrinallum bomb man , but for most of his 49 years Glenn Sanders was a talented mechanic and polite , if offbeat , character , writes MARY ALEXANDER NOISES are amplified on still and chilly nights . A farmer who lives alone wakes in the middle of the night after hearing what he thinks is a massive blast . It 's too loud for a gunshot . It must have been a transformer exploding , but the power is still on . He puts it down to a tremor from an earthquake . Nothing appears to be damaged so he goes back to bed . It 's a problem for the morning . Fifteen kilometres away , a huge explosion has rocked the town of Derrinallum . CFA volunteers are quickly alerted as their pagers signal an emergency . They are needed on the ground just a few kilometres to the west . Donning their trademark yellow uniforms and helmets , they rush to the scene in their trucks . They are told to wait . A few hours pass and they are stood down . There is nothing they can do . In the early hours of Saturday morning the drizzle sets in . The town wakes to the unmistakable drone of police and television helicopters and dozens of police cars . Neighbours are talking , friends ring each other . News broadcasts will soon fill in the missing gaps . Not since 1944 , when bushfires razed the town , has Derrinallum been in the national spotlight . HIS name was Glenn Sanders . He was a kind soul who had developed a troubled mind . His piercing eyes and long , willowy beard were unmistakable around the district . He was known for his generous spirit and his polite and friendly nature . His mechanical prowess was second to none . If you needed something fixed , there was no argument : he was the \u201c go - to \u201d man . Some people referred to him as the \u201c Colonel ' ' because of his beard and the similarities to Colonel Sanders of KFC fame . He reminded others of MacGyver , the television hero who could easily solve complex problems armed only with a roll of duct tape and a Swiss army knife . Eighteen months ago that all changed . He had become volatile , worrying locals with his paranoia , unpredictable behaviour and threats . They saw him out walking the streets with a vest rigged with explosives concealed under his jacket . They could hear blasts coming from his property on the western edge of town and from the cemetery , to the east , at all hours of the night . Advertisement Horrified residents in the close - knit town reported him to police , but officers found no sign of explosives and they did n't have enough evidence to do a full search of his property . They did manage to take his explosives licence away . About a month ago , Glenn Sanders rode the 12 kilometres into Lismore on his Harley - Davidson with his sheepdog on the back . He was n't wearing a helmet . A local takeaway operator suggested he should be worried about getting caught by police or falling off and injuring himself . His response was : \u201c No . When I go , I go big . \u201d That something \u201c big \u201d happened . Just what occurred is under wraps , but it involved a \u201c violent incident \u201d last Thursday week . Someone was troubled enough to make an official report to police , who put Sanders under surveillance with the task of arresting him . Their operation had begun . We now know that police were concerned about items Sanders had strapped to his body . Specialists were called in and began negotiations as soon as he returned to his property about 7 pm on Friday . Advertisement He had not entered his house when they attempted to get him to undress and remove the items . A seven-hour stand - off had begun . Just before 1.30 am his house exploded and , shortly after , the items he was wearing also exploded . The injuries were fatal . Two police officers were also injured and were taken to hospital . Remains , believed to be those of Sanders , were removed from the property on Tuesday afternoon . The highway was closed as soon as the siege began . More than a week later the roadblocks remain in place . The town is still isolated and trade is down . \u201c The Glenn we knew was n't the same Glenn who did this . It was just a different person altogether . He was always such a nice guy . \u201d - Derrinallum Post Office owner Margaret Howard Advertisement Oddly enough , the people of Derrinallum are now willing to forgive all that . And they also seem willing to forgive the man responsible for putting the media spotlight on the town for all the wrong reasons . A simple observation by a woman attempting to bring normality back by enjoying a picnic lunch in the elm avenue with her grandson best reflects that view : \u201c I think we 'll all remember him for what he was \u2014 a great talented man \u2014 rather than what he had become . \u201d Margaret Howard , who runs the post office agrees : \u201c The Glenn we knew was n't the same Glenn who did this . It was just a different person altogether . He was always such a nice guy . \u201d Glenn Albert Sanders was born on November 25 , 1965 at a time when Australia was in the grip of conservatism . Henry Bolte was premier , Sir Robert Menzies was still prime minister after 16 years and Australia had just entered the war with Vietnam . His parents Keith and Margaret Sanders ran the farm at 1370 Hamilton Highway which is now a crime scene . Locals described them as \u201c very placid people \u201d . His brother Andrew was born a few years later . Sanders was a born and bred country boy . He never ventured far from home , attending kindergarten and school at Derrinallum and then gaining an apprenticeship as a motor mechanic just up the road in Mortlake . Advertisement He was a quick learner and was qualified by the time he was just 18 or 19 . Returning home to help on the farm , Sanders dabbled in mechanical work and this eventually became his full - time trade . Rob Jamieson , a fourth - generation farmer at the historic Stony Point property in Darlington , offered Sanders a permanent part-time job in the late 1980s and early 1990s . \" He was n't a mad idiot who had a fetish for blowing things up . He used explosives like it was one of the tools in his toolbox . He was very skilled at it . \" - Clive Jamieson Every week he would spend one day in the farm workshop repairing and servicing machinery and another day restoring old cars and motorbikes for Rob , who was a passionate motor racing enthusiast . Sanders also had a love of racing and restored his own vehicles , competing in speedway and drags . Advertisement Rob 's son Clive Jamieson said the pair had a father - son- type relationship because of their shared interests . \u201c Even though they came from completely different walks of life , dad and Glenn had a very special rapport because of their passion for cars . \u201d Clive , who has known Sanders since the pair were at primary school in the late 1970s , described his welding and engineering skills as \u201c brilliant \u201d . \u201c He was always happy to do whatever task we charged him with even though some of it was probably below him . \u201d \u201c He was n't a mad idiot who had a fetish for blowing things up . He used explosives like it was one of the tools in his toolbox . He was very skilled at it . \u201d As part of his work on farms , Sanders would use an air compressor to remove the muck accumulated in windmill casings and then throw a part-stick of gelignite down the hole to create a cavity for water to accumulate . Advertisement Clive 's family wants to remember Sanders as the \u201c very kind , polite and friendly person \u201d they knew at Stony Point . \u201c We do n't want Glenn 's life to be defined by his final actions . \u201d Sanders also supported another local motoring enthusiast , Gary Poole , in his hobby . Mr Poole , a Derrinallum plumber , is well known for his trip overseas early last year to recreate the historic Monte Carlo rally in his FX Holden with V8 Supercar drivers Craig Lowndes and Richard Davison . Sanders took an avid interest in the project . Mr Poole says the pair had a lifelong friendship and Sanders helped with his other FX Holden race car over many years . \u201c The Sanders boys had a farm ute , an FJ Holden , which he gave to me 25 years ago for parts . \u201d Sanders left the Jamiesons ' employ in the mid-1990s when his business had grown enough with its own clientele . Advertisement \" We do n't want Glenn 's life to be defined by his final actions . \" - Clive Jamieson By that time he was married to first wife Sue , seven years his elder . She would do the accounts but \u201c kept pretty much to herself \u201d . The couple were later divorced and she now lives in a nearby town . His second wife , Shirley Savage from Cobden , had been married twice before and had an adult daughter from her first marriage . Shirley was well known around the district for the distinctive \u201c Cobden \u201d registration plates on her Prado four- wheel - drive . She also owned a motorhome and an old Austin A50 Cambridge car which Sanders had restored . Photographs from the bomb site show the three vehicles intact at the edge of the pile of rubble and twisted metal that was once Sanders ' substantial home and several sheds . Advertisement His mother 's house also remains standing . Some people say he knew exactly what he wanted to destroy and what he wanted to leave using carefully placed explosives . The pair would often visit the picturesque farm that Shirley still owned on Boundary Road in Cobden , staying overnight in a rustic old cottage . Neighbours would report the sound of night - time explosions coming from the deep valley at the bottom of the property . \u201c He seemed to be a bit of a larrikin , \u201d said one Cobden resident who met him . Another friend remembers gatherings around bonfires : \u201c He loved being the centre of attention . \u201d He recalls nights when Sanders would set explosives in dead cows , blowing their heads off and sending blood and guts in the air as a \u201c party trick \u201d .

We might argue about the meaning of this or that event , but all sides usually accepted that the event in question had at least happened . No longer . A new and unsettling dimension has entered our collective , and global , conversation . In the US James Comey , the former FBI director sacked by Donald Trump , released his memoirs and did a round of TV interviews . The FBI has not always enjoyed or deserved public trust \u2013 under its founder , the bigoted and brutal J Edgar Hoover , minorities and trade unionists had good reason to fear it \u2013 but in recent decades it came to be seen as one of the trusted arbiters of American life , a non-partisan referee whose word would be accepted . That would be truer still of the figure at the helm , the nation 's top law enforcement officer . Now , of course it 's natural that Comey 's book would not be hailed as a definitive , objective account of recent , highly contested events . It was not sworn testimony , but an autobiography with all the self - flattery and exculpation associated with that genre . But what was striking was the casual dismissal even of the facts in the book . Trump and the Republican party instantly trashed the ex-director \u2013 himself a Republican \u2013 launching a website : lyincomey.com . You can argue about Comey 's judgment and his self - righteousness \u2013 which make parts of the book read like reflections of The Simpsons ' Ned Flanders \u2013 but his opponents go further , waving aside even that which is verifiably true . The more egregious example is also the more serious . At a concert in Barcelona , the former Pink Floyd star Roger Waters accused the Syria Civil Defence , or White Helmets \u2013 the volunteers who pull survivors from the rubble of bomb attacks , and are widely credited with saving thousands of civilian lives \u2013 of being \u201c a fake organisation that exists only to create propaganda for the jihadists and terrorists \u201d . That claim , which has been repeatedly debunked , was instantly applauded and spread by the same crowd of pro-Russia voices on the far left and far right who have served so dutifully as Assad 's online cheerleaders . To them , Waters was a hero for daring to speak an unpopular truth . For everyone else , a once admired musician had joined the ranks of conspiracist cranks and apologists for a murderous dictator . The remark by Waters fitted a story the Assad denialists have been telling for a while : that the chemical attack in Douma was fake , staged by the White Helmets and their western friends . Russian state TV even aired footage that , it claimed , showed a film set where such atrocities are cooked up . ( The pictures were , in fact , taken from the set of a Syrian feature film . ) Remember , these voices are not simply saying western air strikes were the wrong response to the killings in Douma . They are saying there were no killings in Douma . Or there were , but they did n't involve chemical weapons . Or they did , but rebel groups were responsible . Or the whole thing was staged by Britain . The line changes with dizzying frequency . The point is , whether it 's Comey or Syria , we are now in an era when the argument is no longer over our response to events , but the very existence of those events . It was the same story after the mass school shooting at Parkland , Florida , in February . A loud chorus of rightists was not content merely to denounce proposed gun control measures : they claimed the massacre had not happened at all , and that all those grieving parents and teenagers were \u201c crisis actors \u201d . These are symptoms of a post-truth disease that 's come to be known as \u201c tribal epistemology \u201d , in which the truth or falsity of a statement depends on whether the person making it is deemed one of us or one of them . According to the writer David Roberts , \u201c information is evaluated based not on conformity to common standards of evidence or correspondence to a common understanding of the world , but on whether it supports the tribe 's values and goals and is vouchsafed by tribal leaders . ' Good for our side ' and ' true ' begin to blur into one . \u201d Of course , we all suffer from confirmation bias , and all of us listen more to our friends than to our foes \u2013 but this goes further . Recall the Trump spokesperson Scottie Nell Hughes , who declared : \u201c There 's no such thing , unfortunately , any more as facts . \u201d For many Americans , Hughes explained , Trump 's tweets , regardless of the evidence , \u201c are truth \u201d simply because they come from him . It fits that social media is the weapon of choice . Its algorithms are proven to favour virality over veracity , spreading false stories faster and wider than true ones . A mysterious pro-Assad tweeter , with no other traceable existence online , has nearly as many followers as the BBC 's Middle East editor . Meanwhile , the top story on Google News the morning after the US presidential election hailed Trump as the winner of the popular vote \u2013 even though he had lost it by nearly 3 m votes . The tribe tells itself what it wants to hear . The desire to stand with your fellow Republicans or Assad apologists is so great you 're ready to throw out not only your opponents ' arguments but their evidence too . And because trust in all the previously respected referees \u2013 from the media to human rights organisations to the FBI \u2013 has collapsed , you refuse to believe anything and anyone that contradicts you . The danger this poses is clear . Comey 's moment will pass , but eventually his predecessor at the FBI , special counsel Robert Mueller , will deliver his report into the Trump campaign 's alleged collusion with Russia . Already Trump 's Fox News outriders are trashing Mueller \u2013 another Republican - appointed straight arrow whose honesty has never been credibly questioned \u2013 branding him biased , corrupt , even \u201c the head of a crime family \u201d . That will make it easier to ignore his findings , however damning . If Richard Nixon were in office now , even Watergate would not be Watergate : his own tribe would simply dismiss the hard , factual evidence against him . As for Syria , Waters and the rest may seem like fringe voices , but such thinking eventually leaks into the mainstream . On yesterday 's Question Time , Emily Thornberry echoed the Russian claim that chemical weapons inspectors were being kept out of Douma by UN red tape and health and safety rules \u2013 when in fact it is Assad and Russia keeping them out : long enough , presumably , to ensure that by the time they 're granted access the crucial evidence will have been cleared away .

We might argue about the meaning of this or that event , but all sides usually accepted that the event in question had at least happened . No longer . A new and unsettling dimension has entered our collective , and global , conversation . In the US James Comey , the former FBI director sacked by Donald Trump , released his memoirs and did a round of TV interviews . The FBI has not always enjoyed or deserved public trust \u2013 under its founder , the bigoted and brutal J Edgar Hoover , minorities and trade unionists had good reason to fear it \u2013 but in recent decades it came to be seen as one of the trusted arbiters of American life , a non-partisan referee whose word would be accepted . That would be truer still of the figure at the helm , the nation 's top law enforcement officer . Now , of course it 's natural that Comey 's book would not be hailed as a definitive , objective account of recent , highly contested events . It was not sworn testimony , but an autobiography with all the self - flattery and exculpation associated with that genre . But what was striking was the casual dismissal even of the facts in the book . Trump and the Republican party instantly trashed the ex-director \u2013 himself a Republican \u2013 launching a website : lyincomey.com . You can argue about Comey 's judgment and his self - righteousness \u2013 which make parts of the book read like reflections of The Simpsons ' Ned Flanders \u2013 but his opponents go further , waving aside even that which is verifiably true . The more egregious example is also the more serious . At a concert in Barcelona , the former Pink Floyd star Roger Waters accused the Syria Civil Defence , or White Helmets \u2013 the volunteers who pull survivors from the rubble of bomb attacks , and are widely credited with saving thousands of civilian lives \u2013 of being \u201c a fake organisation that exists only to create propaganda for the jihadists and terrorists \u201d . That claim , which has been repeatedly debunked , was instantly applauded and spread by the same crowd of pro-Russia voices on the far left and far right who have served so dutifully as Assad 's online cheerleaders . To them , Waters was a hero for daring to speak an unpopular truth . For everyone else , a once admired musician had joined the ranks of conspiracist cranks and apologists for a murderous dictator . The remark by Waters fitted a story the Assad denialists have been telling for a while : that the chemical attack in Douma was fake , staged by the White Helmets and their western friends . Russian state TV even aired footage that , it claimed , showed a film set where such atrocities are cooked up . ( The pictures were , in fact , taken from the set of a Syrian feature film . ) Remember , these voices are not simply saying western air strikes were the wrong response to the killings in Douma . They are saying there were no killings in Douma . Or there were , but they did n't involve chemical weapons . Or they did , but rebel groups were responsible . Or the whole thing was staged by Britain . The line changes with dizzying frequency . The point is , whether it 's Comey or Syria , we are now in an era when the argument is no longer over our response to events , but the very existence of those events . It was the same story after the mass school shooting at Parkland , Florida , in February . A loud chorus of rightists was not content merely to denounce proposed gun control measures : they claimed the massacre had not happened at all , and that all those grieving parents and teenagers were \u201c crisis actors \u201d . These are symptoms of a post-truth disease that 's come to be known as \u201c tribal epistemology \u201d , in which the truth or falsity of a statement depends on whether the person making it is deemed one of us or one of them . According to the writer David Roberts , \u201c information is evaluated based not on conformity to common standards of evidence or correspondence to a common understanding of the world , but on whether it supports the tribe 's values and goals and is vouchsafed by tribal leaders . ' Good for our side ' and ' true ' begin to blur into one . \u201d Of course , we all suffer from confirmation bias , and all of us listen more to our friends than to our foes \u2013 but this goes further . Recall the Trump spokesperson Scottie Nell Hughes , who declared : \u201c There 's no such thing , unfortunately , any more as facts . \u201d For many Americans , Hughes explained , Trump 's tweets , regardless of the evidence , \u201c are truth \u201d simply because they come from him . It fits that social media is the weapon of choice . Its algorithms are proven to favour virality over veracity , spreading false stories faster and wider than true ones . A mysterious pro-Assad tweeter , with no other traceable existence online , has nearly as many followers as the BBC 's Middle East editor . Meanwhile , the top story on Google News the morning after the US presidential election hailed Trump as the winner of the popular vote \u2013 even though he had lost it by nearly 3 m votes . The tribe tells itself what it wants to hear . The desire to stand with your fellow Republicans or Assad apologists is so great you 're ready to throw out not only your opponents ' arguments but their evidence too . And because trust in all the previously respected referees \u2013 from the media to human rights organisations to the FBI \u2013 has collapsed , you refuse to believe anything and anyone that contradicts you . The danger this poses is clear . Comey 's moment will pass , but eventually his predecessor at the FBI , special counsel Robert Mueller , will deliver his report into the Trump campaign 's alleged collusion with Russia . Already Trump 's Fox News outriders are trashing Mueller \u2013 another Republican - appointed straight arrow whose honesty has never been credibly questioned \u2013 branding him biased , corrupt , even \u201c the head of a crime family \u201d . That will make it easier to ignore his findings , however damning . If Richard Nixon were in office now , even Watergate would not be Watergate : his own tribe would simply dismiss the hard , factual evidence against him . As for Syria , Waters and the rest may seem like fringe voices , but such thinking eventually leaks into the mainstream . On yesterday 's Question Time , Emily Thornberry echoed the Russian claim that chemical weapons inspectors were being kept out of Douma by UN red tape and health and safety rules \u2013 when in fact it is Assad and Russia keeping them out : long enough , presumably , to ensure that by the time they 're granted access the crucial evidence will have been cleared away . It makes for a chilling landscape , a world where atrocities are committed twice over \u2013 once when they are done , and again when they are denied . Not decades later , but even as the dead are still being buried . The great division of our time may not , after all , be between left and right or open and closed , but something more fundamental still : between what is true and what is false .","annotations":[{"text":"by the same crowd of pro-Russia voices on the far left and far right who have served so dutifully as Assad 's online cheerleaders","span":[2111,2239],"token_span":[397,420],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent disperses or scatters the Individuals."},{"text":"That claim","span":[2026,2035],"token_span":[383,384],"role":"Individuals","label":"Individuals","role_definition":"The Individuals are scattered by the Agent."},{"text":"an era when the argument is no longer over our response to events , but the very existence of those events","span":[3247,3352],"token_span":[620,640],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time when the Individuals are dispersed."},{"text":"online","span":[2221,2226],"token_span":[419,419],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place where the dispersing event happens."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-2933-937-frame-Dodging","frame":"Dodging","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Dodger acts to avoid an oncoming moving Bad_entity.","frame_ancestors":["Avoiding","Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Both occupants escaped with only minor injuries and the aircraft was written off after sustaining major damage .

Both aircraft sustained substantial damage . Aviation Short Investigations Bulletin - Issue 41 Read report What happened On 11 April 2015 , the student pilot of a Piper PA - 28 aircraft , registered VH-TXH ( TXH ) , prepared to conduct a solo , local flight , from Moorabbin Airport , Victoria . The flight was to be the pilot 's second solo to the training area , where he was to practice simulated forced landings . The pilot inspected the aircraft , including checking the oil quantity and colour . He noted that the dipstick indicated 5.5 L of oil and the oil appeared to be of a golden colour . After completing the pre-flight checks , the pilot of TXH taxied the aircraft to the run - up bay and performed engine run-ups . He noted that all indications were normal and within the required performance limits . At 11:29:06 Eastern Standard Time ( EST ) , the pilot made a radio call to the Moorabbin surface movement controller ( SMC ) on the Ground frequency , advising that he was conducting a solo flight to the training area and requested a departure from runway 35 Right ( 35R ) . The SMC cleared TXH to taxi via taxiway A for a departure from runway 35R. TXH then taxied to the holding point for runway 35 R , and , at 11:36:37 , the pilot of TXH contacted the aerodrome controller \u2013 east ( ADC1 ) on the Tower East frequency . He reported ready for take - off , and ADC1 cleared TXH for take - off . At 11:37:08 , the pilot of a Cessna 172 aircraft , registered VH- EUU ( EUU ) , contacted the SMC and requested a clearance to taxi for a local private flight , with three passengers on board . The SMC cleared EUU to taxi to runway 35R via taxiway A , and the pilot commenced taxiing . The pilot of TXH reported that the take - off run was normal , with the engine indications in the normal range . After rotation , when about 150 ft above ground level ( AGL ) , the engine began to run roughly . The pilot lowered the aircraft nose slightly and within 2 - 3 seconds , the engine regained full power and the aircraft continued to climb . When approaching 500 ft AGL , the engine again ran roughly and partially lost power . The pilot suspected a fuel issue to be the cause of the rough running , and , as the fuel pump was still on , changed the selected fuel tank . The engine returned to producing full power and the pilot initiated a right climbing turn , leaving the fuel pump switched on . As the aircraft climbed , the engine lost power again . At 11:37:58 , the pilot advised ADC1 that he had a ' spluttering engine ' and requested a return to land . ADC1 had observed TXH in the initial climb and noted that it did not appear to be climbing out normally and was then quite low , at an estimated 300 ft AGL . ADC1 initially responded that TXH was number one for runway 35 R and then offered runways 22 or 31 if required . The pilot responded that he would use runway 22 ( Figure 1 ) . ADC1 gave TXH priority to land over all other aircraft , advised the SMC of an aircraft with engine trouble , requested runway 22 , and coordinated with the SMC for release of runway 22 ( see section : Air traffic control ) . The SMC checked the crossing taxiways , helicopter traffic and for any works in progress that may have conflicted with the use of runway 22 , then handed ADC1 the green runway strip for runway 22 . ADC1 then placed the strip in the runway bay on the console . ADC1 also coordinated with the aerodrome controller \u2013 west ( ADC2 ) , who instructed a couple of aircraft in the circuit for runway 35 Left ( 35L ) to go-around to ensure they remained clear of the crossing runway . ADC1 instructed the pilots of two aircraft that were in the circuit for runway 35R to go-around and another to conduct a full stop landing . The SMC reported then focusing on checking the runways and taxiways crossing runway 22 . Taxiway A did not cross runway 22 , and as the SMC remained seated , was unable to see EUU on taxiway A as it was obstructed by the tower console . Source : Google earth annotated by the ATSB At 11:39:06 , ADC1 cleared TXH to land on runway 22 . The pilot of TXH conducted a tight right turn towards runway 22 and as he was concerned about clearing the buildings on the approach to runway 22 , he did not select any flap . After passing over the buildings , the pilot reduced the power to idle . He reported that the aircraft touched down about one third of the way along runway 22 . ADC1 observed that TXH appeared to land about half way along the runway and did not decelerate normally after touching down . The SMC observed that TXH appeared very low on final approach to runway 22 and crossed the threshold travelling very fast . The ADC1 stated to the SMC and ADC2 controllers ' he 's landed long ' and ' gee he 's quick ' . The pilot of TXH assessed that he was not going to be able to stop the aircraft prior to the end of the sealed runway , but that there was a suitable grassed overshoot area beyond it , and maintained the aircraft on the runway centreline . ADC2 was standing up , and sighted EUU on taxiway A. ADC2 alerted the SMC to the Cessna ( EUU ) on taxiway A. ADC1 observed that EUU was then still north of the extended centreline of runway 22 on taxiway A . As TXH approached the end of runway 22 , the pilot of TXH sighted EUU taxiing on taxiway A to his right , and was unsure whether it was going to stop or not . He veered TXH to the right in an attempt to pass behind EUU and avoid a collision . At 11:39:25 , the SMC directed EUU to ' hold position , STOP , STOP ' . The pilot of EUU braked immediately and as his body moved forward in response to the aircraft braking , he sighted TXH in his left peripheral vision . The pilot of TXH saw EUU brake suddenly . The pilot of EUU assessed that if he stopped there , TXH would collide squarely with EUU , so he released the brakes and progressed forwards . The left wing of TXH then struck the tail of EUU and spun EEU around through about 180\u00b0 . TXH continued veering to the right for about 20 m further before coming to rest on a grassed area ( Figure 2 ) . Source : Airport Operator The pilot of TXH observed fuel spilling from the ruptured fuel tank and immediately exited the aircraft and reported that he was not injured . The pilot of EUU reported that he momentarily lost consciousness at the time of the collision , but came to within seconds . He then observed fuel leaking , and although feeling disoriented , he conducted a normal aircraft shut down , including switching off the aircraft electrics and fuel . He and the passengers disembarked and were treated for minor injuries . Both aircraft sustained substantial damage ( Figures 3 and 4 ) . Source : Airport operator Source : Airport Operator Pilot comments The pilot of TXH provided the following comments : - He did not declare an emergency as he assessed that he would be able to land the aircraft safely . He remained calm and focused on his approach to , and landing on , runway 22 . - He wanted to ensure that if the engine failed completely he would have sufficient height to clear the buildings in the approach path of runway 22 . - He did not have sufficient altitude to continue a circuit and land on 35R . - He was unable to stop the aircraft before the end of runway 22 , but if there had not been an aircraft on the taxiway , he would have been able to stop safely in the overshoot area . The pilot of EUU commented that as he was on Ground frequency and the pilot of TXH was on Tower frequency , he was not aware of TXH until he sighted it immediately prior to the collision . He reported that if he had been directed to stop earlier , it may have averted the collision . Controller comments The ADC1 controller provided the following comments : - The ADC1 offered the pilot of TXH the choice of runways to land on , but did not know what was achievable for the pilot or aircraft . - The ADC1 and ADC2 controllers both stood up when the pilot of TXH reported engine trouble . - The incident was a good example of how quickly things happen ; about 90 seconds after an aircraft took off it was back on the ground and at least two aircraft had to be sent around in the interim . The SMC reported checking the works strip under the runway designators in the console . The SMC scanned the eastern helicopter area , checked the taxiways that crossed runway 22 \u2013 ' F ' , ' B ' and ' C ' for any aircraft waiting to taxi , and did not see anything that may pose a risk to an aircraft landing on runway 22 . Taxiway A was not a crossing taxiway for runway 22 . The SMC reported that these scans were performed multiple times after the pilot of TXH advised of engine trouble . The SMC further commented that if TXH had maintained the runway centreline , the aircraft would not have collided . Moorabbin Airport and weather conditions Runway 22 at Moorabbin was 571 m in length , runway 35R was 1335 m . The wind was from 030\u00b0 at about 7 kt , resulting in a tailwind on runway 22 . Air traffic control ( ATC ) There were three ATC positions active at the time ; a combined surface movement controller / coordinator position ( SMC ) , an aerodrome controller \u2013 east ( ADC1 ) , and an aerodrome controller \u2013 west ( ADC2 ) . The three controllers were seated in the tower in that order from north to south facing towards the east , and were the only people in the control tower at the time . Runways 35L and 35R were the runways in use prior to the pilot of TXH reporting engine trouble . A runway in use is a runway under the control of an aerodrome controller . All runways are considered ' active ' and a clearance is required to cross or enter any runway . The runways other than those in use , were held by the SMC . The ADC1 therefore required the release of runway 22 from the SMC prior to clearing TXH to land . The controller places the runway strips of the runways for which they hold responsibility , in the runway bay of the console . Engineering inspection A post-accident inspection of the engine of TXH found a small quantity of oil on the cylinders and some fouling of the spark plugs which may have led to the rough running . Safety message The ATSB publication Avoidable Accidents No. 3 \u2013 Managing partial power loss after takeoff in single - engine aircraft , found causes of partial power loss after take - off include fuel starvation , spark plug fouling , carburettor icing and pre-ignition conditions . A pre-flight safety brief that considers actions to take following a partial power loss after take - off , gives pilots a much better chance of maintaining control of the aircraft and of responding immediately . Such actions include landing immediately within the aerodrome , landing beyond the aerodrome , and conducting a turn back towards the aerodrome .

Aviation Short Investigations Bulletin - Issue 41 Read report What happened On 11 April 2015 , the student pilot of a Piper PA - 28 aircraft , registered VH-TXH ( TXH ) , prepared to conduct a solo , local flight , from Moorabbin Airport , Victoria . The flight was to be the pilot 's second solo to the training area , where he was to practice simulated forced landings . The pilot inspected the aircraft , including checking the oil quantity and colour . He noted that the dipstick indicated 5.5 L of oil and the oil appeared to be of a golden colour . After completing the pre-flight checks , the pilot of TXH taxied the aircraft to the run - up bay and performed engine run-ups . He noted that all indications were normal and within the required performance limits . At 11:29:06 Eastern Standard Time ( EST ) , the pilot made a radio call to the Moorabbin surface movement controller ( SMC ) on the Ground frequency , advising that he was conducting a solo flight to the training area and requested a departure from runway 35 Right ( 35R ) . The SMC cleared TXH to taxi via taxiway A for a departure from runway 35R. TXH then taxied to the holding point for runway 35 R , and , at 11:36:37 , the pilot of TXH contacted the aerodrome controller \u2013 east ( ADC1 ) on the Tower East frequency . He reported ready for take - off , and ADC1 cleared TXH for take - off . At 11:37:08 , the pilot of a Cessna 172 aircraft , registered VH- EUU ( EUU ) , contacted the SMC and requested a clearance to taxi for a local private flight , with three passengers on board . The SMC cleared EUU to taxi to runway 35R via taxiway A , and the pilot commenced taxiing . The pilot of TXH reported that the take - off run was normal , with the engine indications in the normal range . After rotation , when about 150 ft above ground level ( AGL ) , the engine began to run roughly . The pilot lowered the aircraft nose slightly and within 2 - 3 seconds , the engine regained full power and the aircraft continued to climb . When approaching 500 ft AGL , the engine again ran roughly and partially lost power . The pilot suspected a fuel issue to be the cause of the rough running , and , as the fuel pump was still on , changed the selected fuel tank . The engine returned to producing full power and the pilot initiated a right climbing turn , leaving the fuel pump switched on . As the aircraft climbed , the engine lost power again . At 11:37:58 , the pilot advised ADC1 that he had a ' spluttering engine ' and requested a return to land . ADC1 had observed TXH in the initial climb and noted that it did not appear to be climbing out normally and was then quite low , at an estimated 300 ft AGL . ADC1 initially responded that TXH was number one for runway 35 R and then offered runways 22 or 31 if required . The pilot responded that he would use runway 22 ( Figure 1 ) . ADC1 gave TXH priority to land over all other aircraft , advised the SMC of an aircraft with engine trouble , requested runway 22 , and coordinated with the SMC for release of runway 22 ( see section : Air traffic control ) . The SMC checked the crossing taxiways , helicopter traffic and for any works in progress that may have conflicted with the use of runway 22 , then handed ADC1 the green runway strip for runway 22 . ADC1 then placed the strip in the runway bay on the console . ADC1 also coordinated with the aerodrome controller \u2013 west ( ADC2 ) , who instructed a couple of aircraft in the circuit for runway 35 Left ( 35L ) to go-around to ensure they remained clear of the crossing runway . ADC1 instructed the pilots of two aircraft that were in the circuit for runway 35R to go-around and another to conduct a full stop landing . The SMC reported then focusing on checking the runways and taxiways crossing runway 22 . Taxiway A did not cross runway 22 , and as the SMC remained seated , was unable to see EUU on taxiway A as it was obstructed by the tower console . Source : Google earth annotated by the ATSB At 11:39:06 , ADC1 cleared TXH to land on runway 22 . The pilot of TXH conducted a tight right turn towards runway 22 and as he was concerned about clearing the buildings on the approach to runway 22 , he did not select any flap . After passing over the buildings , the pilot reduced the power to idle . He reported that the aircraft touched down about one third of the way along runway 22 . ADC1 observed that TXH appeared to land about half way along the runway and did not decelerate normally after touching down . The SMC observed that TXH appeared very low on final approach to runway 22 and crossed the threshold travelling very fast . The ADC1 stated to the SMC and ADC2 controllers ' he 's landed long ' and ' gee he 's quick ' . The pilot of TXH assessed that he was not going to be able to stop the aircraft prior to the end of the sealed runway , but that there was a suitable grassed overshoot area beyond it , and maintained the aircraft on the runway centreline . ADC2 was standing up , and sighted EUU on taxiway A. ADC2 alerted the SMC to the Cessna ( EUU ) on taxiway A. ADC1 observed that EUU was then still north of the extended centreline of runway 22 on taxiway A . As TXH approached the end of runway 22 , the pilot of TXH sighted EUU taxiing on taxiway A to his right , and was unsure whether it was going to stop or not . He veered TXH to the right in an attempt to pass behind EUU and avoid a collision . At 11:39:25 , the SMC directed EUU to ' hold position , STOP , STOP ' . The pilot of EUU braked immediately and as his body moved forward in response to the aircraft braking , he sighted TXH in his left peripheral vision . The pilot of TXH saw EUU brake suddenly . The pilot of EUU assessed that if he stopped there , TXH would collide squarely with EUU , so he released the brakes and progressed forwards . The left wing of TXH then struck the tail of EUU and spun EEU around through about 180\u00b0 . TXH continued veering to the right for about 20 m further before coming to rest on a grassed area ( Figure 2 ) . Source : Airport Operator The pilot of TXH observed fuel spilling from the ruptured fuel tank and immediately exited the aircraft and reported that he was not injured . The pilot of EUU reported that he momentarily lost consciousness at the time of the collision , but came to within seconds . He then observed fuel leaking , and although feeling disoriented , he conducted a normal aircraft shut down , including switching off the aircraft electrics and fuel . He and the passengers disembarked and were treated for minor injuries . Both aircraft sustained substantial damage ( Figures 3 and 4 ) . Source : Airport operator Source : Airport Operator Pilot comments The pilot of TXH provided the following comments : - He did not declare an emergency as he assessed that he would be able to land the aircraft safely . He remained calm and focused on his approach to , and landing on , runway 22 . - He wanted to ensure that if the engine failed completely he would have sufficient height to clear the buildings in the approach path of runway 22 . - He did not have sufficient altitude to continue a circuit and land on 35R . - He was unable to stop the aircraft before the end of runway 22 , but if there had not been an aircraft on the taxiway , he would have been able to stop safely in the overshoot area . The pilot of EUU commented that as he was on Ground frequency and the pilot of TXH was on Tower frequency , he was not aware of TXH until he sighted it immediately prior to the collision . He reported that if he had been directed to stop earlier , it may have averted the collision . Controller comments The ADC1 controller provided the following comments : - The ADC1 offered the pilot of TXH the choice of runways to land on , but did not know what was achievable for the pilot or aircraft . - The ADC1 and ADC2 controllers both stood up when the pilot of TXH reported engine trouble . - The incident was a good example of how quickly things happen ; about 90 seconds after an aircraft took off it was back on the ground and at least two aircraft had to be sent around in the interim . The SMC reported checking the works strip under the runway designators in the console . The SMC scanned the eastern helicopter area , checked the taxiways that crossed runway 22 \u2013 ' F ' , ' B ' and ' C ' for any aircraft waiting to taxi , and did not see anything that may pose a risk to an aircraft landing on runway 22 . Taxiway A was not a crossing taxiway for runway 22 . The SMC reported that these scans were performed multiple times after the pilot of TXH advised of engine trouble . The SMC further commented that if TXH had maintained the runway centreline , the aircraft would not have collided . Moorabbin Airport and weather conditions Runway 22 at Moorabbin was 571 m in length , runway 35R was 1335 m . The wind was from 030\u00b0 at about 7 kt , resulting in a tailwind on runway 22 . Air traffic control ( ATC ) There were three ATC positions active at the time ; a combined surface movement controller / coordinator position ( SMC ) , an aerodrome controller \u2013 east ( ADC1 ) , and an aerodrome controller \u2013 west ( ADC2 ) . The three controllers were seated in the tower in that order from north to south facing towards the east , and were the only people in the control tower at the time . Runways 35L and 35R were the runways in use prior to the pilot of TXH reporting engine trouble . A runway in use is a runway under the control of an aerodrome controller . All runways are considered ' active ' and a clearance is required to cross or enter any runway . The runways other than those in use , were held by the SMC . The ADC1 therefore required the release of runway 22 from the SMC prior to clearing TXH to land . The controller places the runway strips of the runways for which they hold responsibility , in the runway bay of the console . Engineering inspection A post-accident inspection of the engine of TXH found a small quantity of oil on the cylinders and some fouling of the spark plugs which may have led to the rough running . Safety message The ATSB publication Avoidable Accidents No. 3 \u2013 Managing partial power loss after takeoff in single - engine aircraft , found causes of partial power loss after take - off include fuel starvation , spark plug fouling , carburettor icing and pre-ignition conditions . A pre-flight safety brief that considers actions to take following a partial power loss after take - off , gives pilots a much better chance of maintaining control of the aircraft and of responding immediately . Such actions include landing immediately within the aerodrome , landing beyond the aerodrome , and conducting a turn back towards the aerodrome .

For some these centuries continue to be a ' Dark Age ' , a name that is often criticised but which still finds its way into fairly recent book titles . For others it is the ' Heroic Age ' , as in the title of a current academic journal concerned with this period , whilst others go for more sober but still very telling names such as the ' early Anglo - Saxon ' period , the ' sub- Roman ' period , ' Late Antiquity ' or even the ' Brittonic ' \u2014 ' British ' \u2014 era . Each of these names does , of course , suggest a variety of conflicting conclusions as to the nature of these centuries and what actually took place in them . Given this , the question I want to ask here is , quite simply , how appropriate are any of these names for use when describing Lincolnshire in the fifth and sixth centuries ? | The Lincoln region in the late Roman period and after , showing the landscape of the region , the location of Lincoln , and the likely boundaries of one of the four late Roman provinces of Britannia controlled by this city ( drawn by C. R. Green ) . Dark blue represents the sea , green permanently dry land , and light blue the wetlands and salt - marshes ; the siltland around the Wash is striped to reflect its low-lying nature and origin as marine deposits in this period . For further details of this map , see here . | A variety of evidence might be cited in support of such a model , the most important of which are the great cremation cemeteries of the region . The scale of these sites does need to be emphasised \u2014 whereas in most of eastern Britain , ' Anglo - Saxon ' cemeteries of the fifth and sixth centuries rarely contain more than a couple of hundred of burials and more often contain only a few tens , the largest of these sites contain thousands . Indeed , Lincolnshire boasts two of the three largest fifth - and sixth- century cemeteries known from England , with over 1,800 graves excavated from the Loveden Hill cemetery ( out of a potential original total of c. 3,000 ) and over 1,500 excavated at Cleatham . Indeed , it seems likely that these cemeteries acted as social and sacred ' central places ' for sizeable surrounding territories and their inhabitants , many of whom were buried in the main cemetery , whilst others were buried in surrounding subordinate small cemeteries . All told , given that such cremation - cemeteries have cultural links to the Anglo - Saxon ' homelands ' on the continent , there seems little reason to doubt the reality of ' Anglo - Saxon ' immigration into this region ; indeed , Lincolnshire looks to have been one of the primary foci of this immigration on present evidence . | The major early Anglo - Saxon cremation cemeteries of the Lincoln region , set against the late / post - Roman landscape ( image drawn by C. R. Green , based on Green , Britons and Anglo - Saxons , fig. 11 ) . | | The site of Loveden Hill Anglo - Saxon cremation cemetery in the southern Lincolnshire district of Kesteven ( image : C. R. Green ) . | However , we do need to be careful here . Even if we add in the smaller , later fifth - to seventh - century Anglo - Saxon inhumation cemeteries known from the Lincoln region , which have a much wider distribution than do the large cremation cemeteries , it has to be admitted that there are still significant issues with the notion that Lincolnshire in the fifth and sixth centuries was wholly ' Anglo - Saxon ' . First , there are still large gaps in the distribution of both the cremation and inhumation cemeteries by the end of the early Anglo - Saxon period , with none at all known from the Fenland territory of the supposedly Anglo - Saxon Spalde , nor from extensive areas to the north of the River Witham and to the east of the River Trent . Second , even in those areas that had at least some culturally Anglo - Saxon cemeteries by the seventh century , there are still notable differences in the quantity and date of the material found . For example , in the ' peripheral ' Loveden and Kirton - in - Lindsey areas we have thousands of burials dating probably from the fifth century onwards in the great Anglian cremation cemeteries , with sometimes many hundreds in the nearby inhumation cemeteries of this area too ( for example , the inhumation cemetery at Sleaford probably contained around 600 burials ) . However , closer to Lincoln itself , most of the known cemeteries apparently present by the seventh century only contain 5 , 10 or 15 graves , and a phasing of these indicates that small Anglo - Saxon inhumation cemeteries only really encroached into the area around Lincoln after the early sixth century . Given this significant variance in the density and date of early Anglo - Saxon burials across Lincolnshire , we do have to wonder whether it is really appropriate to speak of the fifth - and sixth-centuries in Lincolnshire as being wholly and entirely ' early Anglo - Saxon ' , especially early on in this date - bracket , when the immigrant culture appears to have been even more limited in its spread than it was by the end of the period . | An enamelled Class 1 brooch from East Ravendale , Lincolnshire ( image : Green , Britons and Anglo - Saxons , fig. 14 ; also available on the PAS ) | | An apparent hybrid British Type G/ Class 1 enamelled brooch from Norton Disney , Lincolnshire ( image : Green , Britons and Anglo - Saxons , fig. 17 ; also available on the PAS ) | If Lincolnshire cannot be considered wholly or entirely ' early Anglo - Saxon ' even by the start of the seventh century , and appears to have been even less so in the fifth and earlier sixth centuries , what then was it ? In this light , it is worth considering further the fact that significant areas appear to have been empty of , or only sparsely populated by , culturally Anglo - Saxon graves in this era . If they were not entirely devoid of population and abandoned , a hypothesis now generally considered to be extremely unlikely , then were they were culturally and / or politically dominated by the former Romano -British inhabitants of this region ? In other words , was Lincolnshire , or at least parts of Lincolnshire , in some way ' sub - Roman ' or even ' Late Antique ' in these centuries , perhaps with the local Romano -British culture and institutions only gradually declining through the fifth century and the label ' Anglo - Saxon ' potentially becoming more generally appropriate towards the end of the sixth-century ? Once again , there is considerable merit in this position , with a strong case to be made for the former Romano -Britons of Lincoln having continued to control a large area around the city into at least the early sixth century . The avoidance of the former provincial capital by the major cremation cemeteries of this region is in itself important evidence for such a post - Roman British territory , offering a very marked contrast to the situation at and around other major Roman centres in eastern and northern Britain such as York , Leicester , and Caistor - by - Norwich , where significant Anglo - Saxon cremation cemeteries are found close by . This avoidance of Lincoln can be very clearly seen on the second map above , with the nearest large cremation cemetery to Lincoln being that at Loveden Hill , over 27 km to the south of the city . Furthermore , as was noted above , the small inhumation cemeteries similarly only really start to encroach on Lincoln after the early sixth century , something which is again suggestive . However , the cemetery evidence does not stand alone . Only a selection of the evidence can be cited here , but of particular note is the fact that the name of a post - Roman British territory focussed on Lincoln \u2014 * Lind\u0113s \u2014 was actually preserved in both British and Anglo - Saxon sources and names , most importantly in the seventh - century Anglo - Saxon kingdom - name Lindissi and the modern district - name Lindsey , both of which derive from the Late British territory - name * Lind\u0113s rather than any Old English name . Moreover , the Anglo - Saxons of Lincolnshire 's own name for themselves \u2014 the Lindisfaran , ' the people who migrated , faran , to the territory of * Lind\u0113s ' \u2014 makes explicit reference to the fact that they arrived as migrants into this British territory of * Lind\u0113s . Similarly , there is now a remarkable quantity of British fifth - and sixth-century high- status metalwork known from the Lincoln region , which suggests a significant degree of post - Roman British activity here and the presence of British elites throughout the region . Perhaps most notable of all , however , is the fact that a recent reconsideration of the radiocarbon and other data from the excavated apsidal church at St Paul in the Bail , Lincoln , indicates that this was almost certainly a British church of the fifth\u2013sixth centuries that was located in the centre of the Roman forum and able to hold up to 100 worshippers , not a later Anglo - Saxon construction as has sometimes been suggested . | Reconstruction of the apsidal church at St Paul in the Bail , Lincoln , within the Roman forum ( image : extract of Green , Britons and Anglo - Saxons , fig. 13 , by David Vale / SLHA ) | | The distribution of early Anglian cremation - predominant cemeteries , represented by filled squares , plotted against Saxon artefacts of the second half of the fifth century , represented by stars , and the Late Roman provincial boundaries ( image : C. R. Green , published as Green , Britons and Anglo - Saxons , fig , 21a ) . | As such , a label ' sub - Roman ' , or even ' Late Antique ' , would seem to have some applicability to the Lincoln region , especially for the fifth and earlier sixth centuries . Indeed , there are even hints that a vestige of Roman provincial control from Lincoln survived at least some way into the fifth century . Although we do need to be cautious here , it has been suggested that a real distinction appears to be observable between a mainly Anglian cultural zone and a mainly Saxon one in the archaeology of the fifth century , and that the dividing line between the two accords surprisingly well with the most recent reconstruction of the Late Roman provincial boundaries , with early Anglian cremation - predominant cemeteries being nearly all located within the province controlled by Lincoln . Equally , a tentative case can be made for the major cremation cemeteries of Lincolnshire having been sited in a ring around Lincoln as part of a deliberate defensive scheme for the protection of the former provincial capital \u2014 not only are the cemeteries at or close to potential strategic sites , but their distribution is very similar in pattern to that of the apparent last stage in the deployment of the late Roman army in the Lincoln region ( based on recent artefactual studies ) , leading to the suggestion that the people who used these large cemeteries may have been tasked with a similar defensive role with regard to Lincoln . Needless to say , both suggestions would add weight to the case for the region being effectively ' sub - Roman ' in the earlier part of the period , rather than there being a complete collapse of Romano -British culture and political institutions here . It is also interesting to note that such a scenario as the above accords interestingly well with the textual , ' Gildasian ' account of the Anglo - Saxon arrival in Britain as federate mercenaries , employed by the post - Roman Britons in the fifth century for defence after the withdrawal of the Roman army . Of course , it has to be admitted that the evidence for cultural continuity that we have from Lincoln and its surrounding territory does not approach that found on the continent , nor do we have any epigraphic evidence for continued Latin literacy or evidence for the import of Late Antique material culture and goods from the Mediterranean such as is found in western parts of Britain . Nonetheless , the indications that we have of the existence of a post - Roman British territory based around the former provincial capital are , when taken together , persuasive , and the evidence for both a degree of potential provincial continuity and a continuing Christian community located in Lincoln , using a church built in the centre of the old forum , is most intriguing . However , whilst a ' sub - Roman ' or similar label might hold good whilst the Britons retained control of Lincoln through the fifth century , what of the period after the early - mid sixth century , when the ' Anglo - Saxons ' were clearly the ascendant power , with Lincoln being the probable centre of an Anglo - Saxon polity named Lindissi \u2014 ' Lindsey ' \u2014 in the early seventh century ? Can we envisage a simple division of our period between an earlier , ' sub - Roman ' , stage , which then ended and was replaced by a new ' Anglo - Saxon ' one , or was the reality rather more complicated than this would imply ? For a number of reasons , such a model seems potentially unsatisfactory . Not only have we already seen that the ' Anglo - Saxon ' archaeology of the area immediately around Lincoln remains meagre right into the seventh century when compared to that in the ' peripheral area ' , but it can be argued that the Anglo - Saxon kingdom of Lindissi was to a large extent simply the British territory of * Lind\u0113s under new rule , both in terms of its name and also of what we can know and reconstruct of its internal organisation . Furthermore , there is no reason to think that the post - Roman Britons simply disappeared or immediately abandoned their ' Britishness ' when they lost control of * Lind\u0113s . Indeed , there is a good case to be made both for non- Anglo - Saxonised Britons having comprised the majority of the population of Lincolnshire into the seventh century and for them having continued to be distinguishable within it for some time . | The suggested minimum boundaries of the seventh - century Anglo - Saxon kingdom of Lindissi , against the likely landscape of the period and showing the Prehistoric - Medieval causeways across the Witham valley ( image : C. R. Green , derived from Green , Britons and Anglo - Saxons , fig. 25 ) | For instance , if we look at some of the available linguistic evidence , it is clear that there is rather more place - name evidence for Anglo - Saxon and British interaction than is sometimes allowed , and some of this is particularly intriguing . Thus some names from the Lincoln region seem to suggest the continued existence of communities of British -speakers in parts of Lincolnshire as late as the later eighth century ( on the basis of our usual understanding of place - name chronologies ) , whilst others appear to represent ' early Anglo - Saxon ' - ingas population - groups named after individuals who seem to possess a Brittonic ( British ) name , rather than an Anglo - Saxon one . An especially nice illustration of this comes from the area around Threekingham in south Lincolnshire . Here we have a distinct group of high - status , post - Roman British metalwork , suggestive of the presence of members of the fifth - and sixth- century British elite , which happens to come from an area that also has both an - ingas group apparently formed around a man with a British name and other place - name evidence for the existence of British -speakers into the eighth century ! Such a combination of evidence is , of course , most intriguing and the Threekingham area might consequently be seen as one in which post - Roman British elites and their dependants ' became ' Anglo - Saxon and forming an ingas- group within the new Anglo - Saxon kingdom of Lindissi after the end of British * Lind\u0113s , whilst also perhaps retaining some elements of their ' Britishness ' for a period . So , to return to the question we started with , what then should we actually call Lincolnshire in the fifth and sixth centuries ? On the whole , none of the names proposed for this era , either nationally or locally , seem fully appropriate for the entire period . Certainly , the notion that this is was truly a ' Dark Age ' does n't really work : our evidence may be thin , but if one is willing to use all of the available evidence \u2014 the archaeological , linguistic , literary and historical \u2014 then at least the general outlines seem potentially recoverable . However , even if we restrict ourselves to the less romantic labels , we are left with problems . Although the fifth century might well be described as ' sub - Roman ' and / or ' Late Antique ' , with the former Romano -Britons controlling the region from the Late Roman provincial capital , using items of high- status British metalwork which had their roots in the Late Roman period , and maintaining a church in the centre of the old forum , this label does n't really work for the sixth - century as a whole , with Lincolnshire being one of the primary areas of Anglo - Saxon immigration and the Anglo - Saxons having almost certainly taken over British * Lind\u0113s to form the kingdom of Lindissi at some point in this century . For similar reasons , the label ' early Anglo - Saxon ' does n't really work either : not only does it appear inappropriate for the earlier parts of period , but the kingdom of Lindissi had clear British roots and there arguably remained a strong British element in both the Lincolnshire population and culture through the latter part of the sixth century and into the seventh . In this context , I 'm tempted to suggest that if we decide that we must apply a label , or labels , to the fifth and sixth centuries that reflects our understanding of the period , then we might do worse than consider a variant of Chris Snyder 's suggestion that the period of British rule after the departure of the Roman legions ought to be termed ' Brittonic ' , rather than the perhaps slightly - pejorative ' sub - Roman ' , reflecting the natives own term for themselves at this time ( the Britons ) and the name of the language that they used ( Brittonic , Late British ) . A term ' Anglo -Brittonic ' for the fifth and sixth centuries in Lincolnshire would reflect many of the issues discussed above , emphasising both the undeniable new Anglian element present in the region from the fifth century onwards , whilst also acknowledging that historians no longer imagine that all of the pre-existing inhabitants were exterminated or driven out in that century by the Anglian immigrants , nor that the Britons had no impact on the political and cultural life of the region in this period . However , I fear that introducing yet another term for these centuries is unlikely to prove a popular move , and in the absence of any groundswell of support for such a movement I would suggest that the dry , factual ' post - Roman ' is probably the best alternative label that we currently possess , given that it avoids assigning any cultural designation to the period beyond acknowledging that the Roman Empire had surrendered de facto political control in the early fifth century . The above post was , in the main , written several years ago as a conference paper on the topic of whether ' sub - Roman ' or ' Anglo - Saxon ' was a better descriptor of fifth - to sixth- century Lincolnshire , and is offered here simply for interest ; fully detailed , referenced , revised , and final versions of the arguments and evidence briefly mentioned above are now available in my Britons and Anglo - Saxons , along with a significant amount of additional material .

For some these centuries continue to be a ' Dark Age ' , a name that is often criticised but which still finds its way into fairly recent book titles . For others it is the ' Heroic Age ' , as in the title of a current academic journal concerned with this period , whilst others go for more sober but still very telling names such as the ' early Anglo - Saxon ' period , the ' sub- Roman ' period , ' Late Antiquity ' or even the ' Brittonic ' \u2014 ' British ' \u2014 era . Each of these names does , of course , suggest a variety of conflicting conclusions as to the nature of these centuries and what actually took place in them . Given this , the question I want to ask here is , quite simply , how appropriate are any of these names for use when describing Lincolnshire in the fifth and sixth centuries ? | The Lincoln region in the late Roman period and after , showing the landscape of the region , the location of Lincoln , and the likely boundaries of one of the four late Roman provinces of Britannia controlled by this city ( drawn by C. R. Green ) . Dark blue represents the sea , green permanently dry land , and light blue the wetlands and salt - marshes ; the siltland around the Wash is striped to reflect its low-lying nature and origin as marine deposits in this period . For further details of this map , see here . | A variety of evidence might be cited in support of such a model , the most important of which are the great cremation cemeteries of the region . The scale of these sites does need to be emphasised \u2014 whereas in most of eastern Britain , ' Anglo - Saxon ' cemeteries of the fifth and sixth centuries rarely contain more than a couple of hundred of burials and more often contain only a few tens , the largest of these sites contain thousands . Indeed , Lincolnshire boasts two of the three largest fifth - and sixth- century cemeteries known from England , with over 1,800 graves excavated from the Loveden Hill cemetery ( out of a potential original total of c. 3,000 ) and over 1,500 excavated at Cleatham . Indeed , it seems likely that these cemeteries acted as social and sacred ' central places ' for sizeable surrounding territories and their inhabitants , many of whom were buried in the main cemetery , whilst others were buried in surrounding subordinate small cemeteries . All told , given that such cremation - cemeteries have cultural links to the Anglo - Saxon ' homelands ' on the continent , there seems little reason to doubt the reality of ' Anglo - Saxon ' immigration into this region ; indeed , Lincolnshire looks to have been one of the primary foci of this immigration on present evidence . | The major early Anglo - Saxon cremation cemeteries of the Lincoln region , set against the late / post - Roman landscape ( image drawn by C. R. Green , based on Green , Britons and Anglo - Saxons , fig. 11 ) . | | The site of Loveden Hill Anglo - Saxon cremation cemetery in the southern Lincolnshire district of Kesteven ( image : C. R. Green ) . | However , we do need to be careful here . Even if we add in the smaller , later fifth - to seventh - century Anglo - Saxon inhumation cemeteries known from the Lincoln region , which have a much wider distribution than do the large cremation cemeteries , it has to be admitted that there are still significant issues with the notion that Lincolnshire in the fifth and sixth centuries was wholly ' Anglo - Saxon ' . First , there are still large gaps in the distribution of both the cremation and inhumation cemeteries by the end of the early Anglo - Saxon period , with none at all known from the Fenland territory of the supposedly Anglo - Saxon Spalde , nor from extensive areas to the north of the River Witham and to the east of the River Trent . Second , even in those areas that had at least some culturally Anglo - Saxon cemeteries by the seventh century , there are still notable differences in the quantity and date of the material found . For example , in the ' peripheral ' Loveden and Kirton - in - Lindsey areas we have thousands of burials dating probably from the fifth century onwards in the great Anglian cremation cemeteries , with sometimes many hundreds in the nearby inhumation cemeteries of this area too ( for example , the inhumation cemetery at Sleaford probably contained around 600 burials ) . However , closer to Lincoln itself , most of the known cemeteries apparently present by the seventh century only contain 5 , 10 or 15 graves , and a phasing of these indicates that small Anglo - Saxon inhumation cemeteries only really encroached into the area around Lincoln after the early sixth century . Given this significant variance in the density and date of early Anglo - Saxon burials across Lincolnshire , we do have to wonder whether it is really appropriate to speak of the fifth - and sixth-centuries in Lincolnshire as being wholly and entirely ' early Anglo - Saxon ' , especially early on in this date - bracket , when the immigrant culture appears to have been even more limited in its spread than it was by the end of the period . | An enamelled Class 1 brooch from East Ravendale , Lincolnshire ( image : Green , Britons and Anglo - Saxons , fig. 14 ; also available on the PAS ) | | An apparent hybrid British Type G/ Class 1 enamelled brooch from Norton Disney , Lincolnshire ( image : Green , Britons and Anglo - Saxons , fig. 17 ; also available on the PAS ) | If Lincolnshire cannot be considered wholly or entirely ' early Anglo - Saxon ' even by the start of the seventh century , and appears to have been even less so in the fifth and earlier sixth centuries , what then was it ? In this light , it is worth considering further the fact that significant areas appear to have been empty of , or only sparsely populated by , culturally Anglo - Saxon graves in this era . If they were not entirely devoid of population and abandoned , a hypothesis now generally considered to be extremely unlikely , then were they were culturally and / or politically dominated by the former Romano -British inhabitants of this region ? In other words , was Lincolnshire , or at least parts of Lincolnshire , in some way ' sub - Roman ' or even ' Late Antique ' in these centuries , perhaps with the local Romano -British culture and institutions only gradually declining through the fifth century and the label ' Anglo - Saxon ' potentially becoming more generally appropriate towards the end of the sixth-century ? Once again , there is considerable merit in this position , with a strong case to be made for the former Romano -Britons of Lincoln having continued to control a large area around the city into at least the early sixth century . The avoidance of the former provincial capital by the major cremation cemeteries of this region is in itself important evidence for such a post - Roman British territory , offering a very marked contrast to the situation at and around other major Roman centres in eastern and northern Britain such as York , Leicester , and Caistor - by - Norwich , where significant Anglo - Saxon cremation cemeteries are found close by . This avoidance of Lincoln can be very clearly seen on the second map above , with the nearest large cremation cemetery to Lincoln being that at Loveden Hill , over 27 km to the south of the city . Furthermore , as was noted above , the small inhumation cemeteries similarly only really start to encroach on Lincoln after the early sixth century , something which is again suggestive . However , the cemetery evidence does not stand alone . Only a selection of the evidence can be cited here , but of particular note is the fact that the name of a post - Roman British territory focussed on Lincoln \u2014 * Lind\u0113s \u2014 was actually preserved in both British and Anglo - Saxon sources and names , most importantly in the seventh - century Anglo - Saxon kingdom - name Lindissi and the modern district - name Lindsey , both of which derive from the Late British territory - name * Lind\u0113s rather than any Old English name . Moreover , the Anglo - Saxons of Lincolnshire 's own name for themselves \u2014 the Lindisfaran , ' the people who migrated , faran , to the territory of * Lind\u0113s ' \u2014 makes explicit reference to the fact that they arrived as migrants into this British territory of * Lind\u0113s . Similarly , there is now a remarkable quantity of British fifth - and sixth-century high- status metalwork known from the Lincoln region , which suggests a significant degree of post - Roman British activity here and the presence of British elites throughout the region . Perhaps most notable of all , however , is the fact that a recent reconsideration of the radiocarbon and other data from the excavated apsidal church at St Paul in the Bail , Lincoln , indicates that this was almost certainly a British church of the fifth\u2013sixth centuries that was located in the centre of the Roman forum and able to hold up to 100 worshippers , not a later Anglo - Saxon construction as has sometimes been suggested . | Reconstruction of the apsidal church at St Paul in the Bail , Lincoln , within the Roman forum ( image : extract of Green , Britons and Anglo - Saxons , fig. 13 , by David Vale / SLHA ) | | The distribution of early Anglian cremation - predominant cemeteries , represented by filled squares , plotted against Saxon artefacts of the second half of the fifth century , represented by stars , and the Late Roman provincial boundaries ( image : C. R. Green , published as Green , Britons and Anglo - Saxons , fig , 21a ) . | As such , a label ' sub - Roman ' , or even ' Late Antique ' , would seem to have some applicability to the Lincoln region , especially for the fifth and earlier sixth centuries . Indeed , there are even hints that a vestige of Roman provincial control from Lincoln survived at least some way into the fifth century . Although we do need to be cautious here , it has been suggested that a real distinction appears to be observable between a mainly Anglian cultural zone and a mainly Saxon one in the archaeology of the fifth century , and that the dividing line between the two accords surprisingly well with the most recent reconstruction of the Late Roman provincial boundaries , with early Anglian cremation - predominant cemeteries being nearly all located within the province controlled by Lincoln . Equally , a tentative case can be made for the major cremation cemeteries of Lincolnshire having been sited in a ring around Lincoln as part of a deliberate defensive scheme for the protection of the former provincial capital \u2014 not only are the cemeteries at or close to potential strategic sites , but their distribution is very similar in pattern to that of the apparent last stage in the deployment of the late Roman army in the Lincoln region ( based on recent artefactual studies ) , leading to the suggestion that the people who used these large cemeteries may have been tasked with a similar defensive role with regard to Lincoln . Needless to say , both suggestions would add weight to the case for the region being effectively ' sub - Roman ' in the earlier part of the period , rather than there being a complete collapse of Romano -British culture and political institutions here . It is also interesting to note that such a scenario as the above accords interestingly well with the textual , ' Gildasian ' account of the Anglo - Saxon arrival in Britain as federate mercenaries , employed by the post - Roman Britons in the fifth century for defence after the withdrawal of the Roman army . Of course , it has to be admitted that the evidence for cultural continuity that we have from Lincoln and its surrounding territory does not approach that found on the continent , nor do we have any epigraphic evidence for continued Latin literacy or evidence for the import of Late Antique material culture and goods from the Mediterranean such as is found in western parts of Britain . Nonetheless , the indications that we have of the existence of a post - Roman British territory based around the former provincial capital are , when taken together , persuasive , and the evidence for both a degree of potential provincial continuity and a continuing Christian community located in Lincoln , using a church built in the centre of the old forum , is most intriguing . However , whilst a ' sub - Roman ' or similar label might hold good whilst the Britons retained control of Lincoln through the fifth century , what of the period after the early - mid sixth century , when the ' Anglo - Saxons ' were clearly the ascendant power , with Lincoln being the probable centre of an Anglo - Saxon polity named Lindissi \u2014 ' Lindsey ' \u2014 in the early seventh century ? Can we envisage a simple division of our period between an earlier , ' sub - Roman ' , stage , which then ended and was replaced by a new ' Anglo - Saxon ' one , or was the reality rather more complicated than this would imply ? For a number of reasons , such a model seems potentially unsatisfactory . Not only have we already seen that the ' Anglo - Saxon ' archaeology of the area immediately around Lincoln remains meagre right into the seventh century when compared to that in the ' peripheral area ' , but it can be argued that the Anglo - Saxon kingdom of Lindissi was to a large extent simply the British territory of * Lind\u0113s under new rule , both in terms of its name and also of what we can know and reconstruct of its internal organisation . Furthermore , there is no reason to think that the post - Roman Britons simply disappeared or immediately abandoned their ' Britishness ' when they lost control of * Lind\u0113s . Indeed , there is a good case to be made both for non- Anglo - Saxonised Britons having comprised the majority of the population of Lincolnshire into the seventh century and for them having continued to be distinguishable within it for some time . | The suggested minimum boundaries of the seventh - century Anglo - Saxon kingdom of Lindissi , against the likely landscape of the period and showing the Prehistoric - Medieval causeways across the Witham valley ( image : C. R. Green , derived from Green , Britons and Anglo - Saxons , fig. 25 ) | For instance , if we look at some of the available linguistic evidence , it is clear that there is rather more place - name evidence for Anglo - Saxon and British interaction than is sometimes allowed , and some of this is particularly intriguing . Thus some names from the Lincoln region seem to suggest the continued existence of communities of British -speakers in parts of Lincolnshire as late as the later eighth century ( on the basis of our usual understanding of place - name chronologies ) , whilst others appear to represent ' early Anglo - Saxon ' - ingas population - groups named after individuals who seem to possess a Brittonic ( British ) name , rather than an Anglo - Saxon one . An especially nice illustration of this comes from the area around Threekingham in south Lincolnshire . Here we have a distinct group of high - status , post - Roman British metalwork , suggestive of the presence of members of the fifth - and sixth- century British elite , which happens to come from an area that also has both an - ingas group apparently formed around a man with a British name and other place - name evidence for the existence of British -speakers into the eighth century ! Such a combination of evidence is , of course , most intriguing and the Threekingham area might consequently be seen as one in which post - Roman British elites and their dependants ' became ' Anglo - Saxon and forming an ingas- group within the new Anglo - Saxon kingdom of Lindissi after the end of British * Lind\u0113s , whilst also perhaps retaining some elements of their ' Britishness ' for a period . So , to return to the question we started with , what then should we actually call Lincolnshire in the fifth and sixth centuries ? On the whole , none of the names proposed for this era , either nationally or locally , seem fully appropriate for the entire period . Certainly , the notion that this is was truly a ' Dark Age ' does n't really work : our evidence may be thin , but if one is willing to use all of the available evidence \u2014 the archaeological , linguistic , literary and historical \u2014 then at least the general outlines seem potentially recoverable . However , even if we restrict ourselves to the less romantic labels , we are left with problems . Although the fifth century might well be described as ' sub - Roman ' and / or ' Late Antique ' , with the former Romano -Britons controlling the region from the Late Roman provincial capital , using items of high- status British metalwork which had their roots in the Late Roman period , and maintaining a church in the centre of the old forum , this label does n't really work for the sixth - century as a whole , with Lincolnshire being one of the primary areas of Anglo - Saxon immigration and the Anglo - Saxons having almost certainly taken over British * Lind\u0113s to form the kingdom of Lindissi at some point in this century . For similar reasons , the label ' early Anglo - Saxon ' does n't really work either : not only does it appear inappropriate for the earlier parts of period , but the kingdom of Lindissi had clear British roots and there arguably remained a strong British element in both the Lincolnshire population and culture through the latter part of the sixth century and into the seventh . In this context , I 'm tempted to suggest that if we decide that we must apply a label , or labels , to the fifth and sixth centuries that reflects our understanding of the period , then we might do worse than consider a variant of Chris Snyder 's suggestion that the period of British rule after the departure of the Roman legions ought to be termed ' Brittonic ' , rather than the perhaps slightly - pejorative ' sub - Roman ' , reflecting the natives own term for themselves at this time ( the Britons ) and the name of the language that they used ( Brittonic , Late British ) . A term ' Anglo -Brittonic ' for the fifth and sixth centuries in Lincolnshire would reflect many of the issues discussed above , emphasising both the undeniable new Anglian element present in the region from the fifth century onwards , whilst also acknowledging that historians no longer imagine that all of the pre-existing inhabitants were exterminated or driven out in that century by the Anglian immigrants , nor that the Britons had no impact on the political and cultural life of the region in this period . However , I fear that introducing yet another term for these centuries is unlikely to prove a popular move , and in the absence of any groundswell of support for such a movement I would suggest that the dry , factual ' post - Roman ' is probably the best alternative label that we currently possess , given that it avoids assigning any cultural designation to the period beyond acknowledging that the Roman Empire had surrendered de facto political control in the early fifth century . The above post was , in the main , written several years ago as a conference paper on the topic of whether ' sub - Roman ' or ' Anglo - Saxon ' was a better descriptor of fifth - to sixth- century Lincolnshire , and is offered here simply for interest ; fully detailed , referenced , revised , and final versions of the arguments and evidence briefly mentioned above are now available in my Britons and Anglo - Saxons , along with a significant amount of additional material .

The service history of the Shooting Star begins in 1944 , when the decision was made to deploy four service test YP - 80 As to Europe to demonstrate their capabilities to combat crews and to help in the development of tactics to be used against Luftwaffe jet fighters . 44-83026 and 83027 were shipped to England in mid-December 1944 , but 44-83026 crashed on its second flight in England , killing its pilot . 44-83027 was turned over to the British government and modified by Rolls - Royce to flight test the B -41 , the prototype of the Nene turbojet . On November 14 , 1945 , 44-83027 was destroyed in a crash landing after an engine failure . 44-83028 and 83029 were shipped to the Mediterranean . They flew some operational sorties , but they never encountered any enemy aircraft . They were both returned to the USA after the war . The tenth , eleventh , and twelfth YP - 80 As were delivered in early 1945 to the 31st Fighter Squadron of the 412th Fighter Group at Bakersfield Municipal Airport in California for service tests . The first production P-80A was accepted by the AAF in February of 1945 . The group relocated to Santa Maria AAF , California in July of 1945 . It moved again in November of 1945 to March Field , California . After the war in Europe was over , P -80 As began to replace the P-51 D and the few P-59 As which had served with stateside units . The first 17 P-80 As off the line were assigned to the 31st Squadron of the 412th Fighter Group , supplementing the YP - 80 As that the Group had already received . More P-80 As went to the 29th and the 445th Squadrons of this group in the summer of 1945 . This group was in preparation for deployment to the Pacific when Japan surrendered . In the summer of 1945 , approximately 30 P-80 As were sent aboard an aircraft carrier to the Philippines in preparation for the final assault on Japan . The planes were to be issued to the 414th Fighter Group , based at Florida Blanca . Unfortunately , the planes had been sent without their tip tanks and their aircraft batteries , so they sat aboard the aircraft carrier for 30 days waiting for this equipment . By the time that the batteries and wingtip tanks were delivered , the war in the Pacific had ended , so the P -80 never got a chance to enter combat in the war against Japan . The initial accident rate for the P-80A was alarmingly high . On July 1 , 1945 , Lt Joseph Mandl was killed when his P - 80A ( 44-85017 ) stalled on takeoff and plowed through a fence and struck a parked A - 26 . On August 2,1945 , Major Ira Jones was killed when his P - 80A ( 44-83029 ) fell apart in midair in a flight over Kentucky . August 6 , 1945 , Major Richard Bong , Medal of Honor holder and leading USAAF fighter ace with 40 victories in the Pacific , was killed when the engine of his P-80A-1 -LO ( 44-85048 ) exploded shortly after takeoff . By that time , no less than eight YP - 80 As and P-80 As had been destroyed in crashes , seven had been severely damaged , and six pilots had been killed . The day after Bong 's fatal crash , the USAAF ordered the Shooting Star grounded until the problems could be corrected . The grounding order was lifted on November 7 , but was soon followed by another grounding , this time caused by problems with the J33 - A-9 jet engine . The aircraft was cleared for flight shortly thereafter , but the accident rate still remained high , with no less than 61 Shooting Stars being involved in accidents by September of 1946 . Most of these accidents were not the result of any critical flaws in the basic design of the Shooting Star , but were caused primarily by errors on the part of pilots inexperienced with the particular idiosyncracies of jet aircraft . In spite of its high accident rate , the USAAF was anxious to show off its new jet fighter to the public . On January 26 , 1946 , three P-80A-1 -LOs equipped with auxiliary fuel tanks in place of the guns and ammunition broke the transcontinental speed record between Long Beach , California and LaGuardia Airport , New York City . Carrying standard 165 - US gallon wingtip tanks , Captain Martin Smith 's 44-85113 and Captain John Babel 's 44-85131 completed the trip respectively in 4 hours 33 minutes 25 seconds and 4 hours 23 minutes 54 seconds , which included a refuelling stop in Topeka , Kansas . The fastest time -- 4 hours 13 minutes 26 seconds for an average speed of 580.93 mph over 2453.8 miles was obtained by Col. William Council who was able to fly nonstop since his aircraft ( 44-85123 ) was fitted with special 310 - gallon drop tanks . Three months later , Col. Council flew a P -80A from New York to Washington DC in 20 minutes 15 seconds . In June 1946 , Lt. Henry Johnson set a 1000 - km speed record of 426.97 mph . In the first postwar National Air Races held in Cleveland in August of 1946 , Shooting Stars won three trophies : the Bendix Trophy awarded to Col Leon Gray for flying an FP- 80A from Van Nuys , California to Cleveland in 4 hours 8 minutes , the Thompson Trophy 180 - km closed circuit race won by Colonel Gustav Lundquist in a P -80A , and the Weatherhead Jet Speed Dash Trophy won by Lieut W. Reilly at a speed of 576.4 mph in a P -80A . The P-80A won the Bendix and Thompson trophies again in 1947 . In order to show off the USAAF 's new jet fighter , in May of 1946 , twenty - five P-80 As of the 412th Fighter Group toured the United States . However , the 412th Fighter Group was inactivated in July of 1946 after completing the operational evaluation of the first two USAAF jet fighters , the P-59A and the P-80A . Apart from the four P - 80s that had been sent to Europe just prior to V-E Day , the first overseas P -80s were issued to the 55th Fighter Group under Col Horace Hanes , which received 32 Shooting Stars for its 38th Fighter Squadron based at Gibelstadt in Germany . This unit evolved into the 31st Fighter Group . In 1946 , Shooting Stars were delivered to the 38th Squadron of the 55th Fighter Group and the 27th , 71st , and 94th of the 1st Group stationed in the USA , the 31st Group ( 307th , 308th , and 309th Squadrons ) based in Germany , and the 18th Fighter Bomber Wing ( 12th , 44th , and 67th Squadron ) based on Okinawa . In early 1946 , 30 P-80s were sent to the 414th Fighter Group at Florida Blanca Airbase on Luzon in the Philippine Islands . In November 1946 , twenty - five P-80 Bs of the 94th Squadron were taken to Alaska for six months of cold - weather testing . The 363rd Reconnaissance Group was activated at Brooks Field , Texas in July of 1946 , and received FP - 80 As . In 1947 , the following groups got the Shooting Star -- the 4th Group ( 334th , 335th , 336th Squadrons ) and 56th Group ( 61st , 62nd , and 63rd Squadrons ) based in the USA , the 36th Fighter Bomber Group ( 22nd , 23rd , and 53rd Squadrons ) based in Germany , and the 51st Interceptor Group ( 16th , 25th , and 26th Squadrons ) based in Japan . Sixteen F-80A / F-80 Bs of the 56th Fighter Group left Selfridge Field , Michigan on July 7 , 1948 and made a multi-stop transatlantic flight and then took part in two weeks of training in Germany . In 1948 , F-80 Cs began to reach operational units , the first being the 57th Interceptor Group ( 64th , 65th , and 66th Squadrons ) based in Alaska and the 49th Fighter Bomber Group ( 7th , 8th , 9th Squadrons ) based in Japan . Later in 1948 , the 36th Fighter Group took no less than 80 F-80 Bs from Florida to the Canal Zone before moving permanently to Germany . In 1949 , the 23rd Group ( 74th , 75 , 76th Squadrons ) and 81st Group ( 91st , 92nd , and 93rd Squadrons ) , both stationed in the USA , received Shooting Stars . In the same year , the 8th Fighter Bomber Group ( 35th , 36th , and 80th Squadrons ) based in Japan received F-80 Cs . The 35th Interceptor Group ( 39th , 40th , and 41st Squadrons ) based in Japan received F -80 Cs in early 1950 . By the late spring of 1950 , F-80 Cs equipped twelve Far East Air Force ( FEAF ) squadrons based in Japan -- the 7th , 8th , and 9th Squadrons of the 49th Fighter Bomber Wing based at Misawa , the 35th , 36th , and 80th Squadrons with the 8th Fighter Bomber Wing based at Itazuke , the 39th , 40th and 41st Squadrons with the 35th Fighter Interceptor Wing at Yokota , and the 16th , 25th and 26th Squadrons with the 51st Fighter Interceptor Wing at Naha . RF - 80 As equipped the 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron at Yokota . When North Korea invaded South Korea on June 25 , 1950 , four groups equipped with the P -80C ( the 8th , 51st , 49th , and 35th ) were based in Japan , as well as the 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron flying FP - 80 As . Shooting Stars saw action from June 26 onwards , taking off from their bases in Japan and flying as escorts for transports and as interceptors . On June 26 , four Shooting Stars intercepted eight North Korean Ilyushin Il - 10 attack aircraft and shot down four of them , scoring the first combat victories for an American jet fighter . On June 28 , RF - 80 As began flying operational reconnaissance sorties , while the F-80 Cs began to fly ground attack missions in support of the retreating South Korean forces . On June 30 , the ban against air operations over North Korea was lifted , and the initial commitment of US troops was approved . During the early days of service in Korea , pilots complained that the F -80 was too fast and not sufficiently maneuverable to handle the propeller - driven North Korean Yaks and Lavochkins . Two of the three F - 80 squadrons converted briefly to the F -51D Mustang , but this change was to prove short -lived . The F-80C was instrumental in quickly gaining and maintaining air superiority over the Korean battlefield , rapidly clearing the skies of any North Korean aircraft that dared to venture into the air . However , the introduction of the MiG- 15 into Korean combat On November 1 , 1950 proved to be a nasty surprise . On November 7 , 1950 , Lieut Russell J. Brown , flying F - 80C # 49-0737 , shot down a MiG- 15 near the Yalu River , scoring the first victory in air - to - air combat between jet fighters . However , it was soon apparent that the F-80C was no match for the swept - wing MiG - 15 , being almost 100 mph slower than its Russian - built opponent . Thereafter , F - 80s were employed primarily in the ground attack role , leaving air - to - air combat against the MiGs for the more capable F -86 Sabre . In order to increase the endurance of Shooting Stars operating from Japanese bases , personnel from the 49th Fighter Bomber Wing developed larger wingtip tanks by inserting sections of Fletcher tanks in the middle of standard F - 80 tanks . These tanks ( named \" Misawa \" tanks , after the airbase where the 49th was stationed ) had a capacity of 265 US gallons and were carried beneath the wingtips of the Shooting Star and increased the aircraft 's radius of action by 125 miles to 350 miles when carrying rockets . Later on , new centerline tip tanks with a 230 US gallon capacity were adopted as standard . One of the problems that faced early USAF operations with jet fighters was their relatively limited endurance and range . In order to extend the endurance of its jet fighters , experiments were made with inflight refuelling . The Wright Air Development Center fitted a probe on each of the tip tanks of a group of F -80 Cs and RF - 80 As . Success of these trials lead to the installation by the Far East Air Material Command of similar probes to the tanks of RF - 80 As of the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing . On July 6 , 1951 three RF - 80 As were refuelled three times by a Boeing KB - 29M , flying the world 's first air - refuelled combat mission . Similar operational trials were made with F - 80 Cs beginning on September 28 , 1951 . However , the air refuelling procedure proved to be cumbersome and was not adopted as standard in Korea by the Shooting Star . The Shooting Stars were superseded by later types as the Korean War proceeded . The 49th Fighter Bomber Wing traded in its F -80 Cs for F-84 Es in June / August of 1951 . The 51st Fighter Interceptor Wing acquired F-86 Es in October / November of 1951 . The 8th and 18th Fighter Bomber Wings exchanged their F -80 Cs for F-86 Fs in 1953 . By the time of the armistice agreement of July 27 , 1953 , the only Shooting Stars still flying combat missions in Korea were the RF - 80 As of the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing . During the Korean War , Shooting Stars flew 98,515 sorties and were credited with the destruction of 37 enemy aircraft in the air ( six of them MiG - 15s ) and 21 on the ground . They dropped 41,593 tons of bombs and napalm and fired over 81,000 rockets . In 34 months of combat , the F -80C suffered heavy losses ( equal to 35 percent of the F - 80 C production ) . 14 were shot down by enemy MiG fighters , 113 were brought down by ground fire , 16 were lost to unknown causes , and 150 were lost in operational accidents . There was a report that the Communist side managed to obtain a flyable F - 80 during the war and actually managed to use it to harass UN troops . If true , this would be yet another example of an aircraft which fought on both sides during a conflict . While the Korean War was in progress , the F -80A / Bs continued in service in the USA where they were primarily used for training . By late 1951 , they were finally phased out . In Europe , F-80 Bs were replaced in the 36th Fighter Bomber Group by F -84 Thunderjets during 1950 . In Alaska , the Shooting Stars were replaced by F -94 Starfires in 1951 . The recon Shooting Stars remained in service for a bit longer , the last RF - 80A / Cs being withdrawn from USAF service at the end of 1957 . The Air National Guard ( ANG ) was issued with Shooting Stars at a fairly early stage . The F-80B entered service in June 1947 with the 196th Fighter Squadron of the California ANG . When the Korean War began , the ANG had six squadrons of Shooting Stars , but they all transitioned to other types before being called to active duty . After the Korean War , the Shooting Star reentered Guard service , with F -80 Cs ( including rebuilt F-80C - 11/12 - LO aircraft ) equipping some twenty - two squadrons and the RF - 80A / C serving with some five squadrons . Air Force Reserve squadrons also flew F -80 Cs from the summer of 1953 to the autumn of 1957 . In 1958 , the F-80C was finally phased out of the Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve . In the mid-1950s , the F-80C was chosen as the replacement type for Latin American nations that were equipped with the Republic F-47 Thunderbolt . 113 Shooting Stars , including original F -80 Cs as well as some rebuilt F-80C - 11/12 - LOs , were transferred to South American air forces under the US Military Assistance Program ( MAP ) . The Forca Aerea Brasileira operated 33 F-80C - 10 -LOs between the years 1958 and 1973 . During the same period , the Fuerza Aerea del Peru ( whose 1947 order for four factory - fresh F -80 Cs had for some reason been taken over by the USAF ) operated sixteen Shooting Stars . Other Latin American operators of the Shooting Star included the Fuerza Aerea de Chile ( 18 aircraft ) , the Fuerza Aerea Colombiana ( 16 aircraft ) , the Fuerza Aerea Ecuatoriana ( 16 aircraft ) , and the Fuerza Aerea Uruguaya ( 14 aircraft ) . Several other Latin American Thunderbolt-operators ( including Cuba , the Dominican Republic , and Mexico ) were offered Shooting Stars but elected not to take them on charge . In only one example was a Latin American F-80 C used in action -- this was in Peru when a few low- level passes helped to persuade a local garrison to give up its insurrection . The last Latin American user of the Shooting Star was Uruguay , which finally turned its last F -80 Cs in exchange for Cessna A-37 Bs in 1975 . No Shooting Star survives in flyable condition today , although numerous examples are displayed in museums .

The service history of the Shooting Star begins in 1944 , when the decision was made to deploy four service test YP - 80 As to Europe to demonstrate their capabilities to combat crews and to help in the development of tactics to be used against Luftwaffe jet fighters . 44-83026 and 83027 were shipped to England in mid-December 1944 , but 44-83026 crashed on its second flight in England , killing its pilot . 44-83027 was turned over to the British government and modified by Rolls - Royce to flight test the B -41 , the prototype of the Nene turbojet . On November 14 , 1945 , 44-83027 was destroyed in a crash landing after an engine failure . 44-83028 and 83029 were shipped to the Mediterranean . They flew some operational sorties , but they never encountered any enemy aircraft . They were both returned to the USA after the war . The tenth , eleventh , and twelfth YP - 80 As were delivered in early 1945 to the 31st Fighter Squadron of the 412th Fighter Group at Bakersfield Municipal Airport in California for service tests . The first production P-80A was accepted by the AAF in February of 1945 . The group relocated to Santa Maria AAF , California in July of 1945 . It moved again in November of 1945 to March Field , California . After the war in Europe was over , P -80 As began to replace the P-51 D and the few P-59 As which had served with stateside units . The first 17 P-80 As off the line were assigned to the 31st Squadron of the 412th Fighter Group , supplementing the YP - 80 As that the Group had already received . More P-80 As went to the 29th and the 445th Squadrons of this group in the summer of 1945 . This group was in preparation for deployment to the Pacific when Japan surrendered . In the summer of 1945 , approximately 30 P-80 As were sent aboard an aircraft carrier to the Philippines in preparation for the final assault on Japan . The planes were to be issued to the 414th Fighter Group , based at Florida Blanca . Unfortunately , the planes had been sent without their tip tanks and their aircraft batteries , so they sat aboard the aircraft carrier for 30 days waiting for this equipment . By the time that the batteries and wingtip tanks were delivered , the war in the Pacific had ended , so the P -80 never got a chance to enter combat in the war against Japan . The initial accident rate for the P-80A was alarmingly high . On July 1 , 1945 , Lt Joseph Mandl was killed when his P - 80A ( 44-85017 ) stalled on takeoff and plowed through a fence and struck a parked A - 26 . On August 2,1945 , Major Ira Jones was killed when his P - 80A ( 44-83029 ) fell apart in midair in a flight over Kentucky . August 6 , 1945 , Major Richard Bong , Medal of Honor holder and leading USAAF fighter ace with 40 victories in the Pacific , was killed when the engine of his P-80A-1 -LO ( 44-85048 ) exploded shortly after takeoff . By that time , no less than eight YP - 80 As and P-80 As had been destroyed in crashes , seven had been severely damaged , and six pilots had been killed . The day after Bong 's fatal crash , the USAAF ordered the Shooting Star grounded until the problems could be corrected . The grounding order was lifted on November 7 , but was soon followed by another grounding , this time caused by problems with the J33 - A-9 jet engine . The aircraft was cleared for flight shortly thereafter , but the accident rate still remained high , with no less than 61 Shooting Stars being involved in accidents by September of 1946 . Most of these accidents were not the result of any critical flaws in the basic design of the Shooting Star , but were caused primarily by errors on the part of pilots inexperienced with the particular idiosyncracies of jet aircraft . In spite of its high accident rate , the USAAF was anxious to show off its new jet fighter to the public . On January 26 , 1946 , three P-80A-1 -LOs equipped with auxiliary fuel tanks in place of the guns and ammunition broke the transcontinental speed record between Long Beach , California and LaGuardia Airport , New York City . Carrying standard 165 - US gallon wingtip tanks , Captain Martin Smith 's 44-85113 and Captain John Babel 's 44-85131 completed the trip respectively in 4 hours 33 minutes 25 seconds and 4 hours 23 minutes 54 seconds , which included a refuelling stop in Topeka , Kansas . The fastest time -- 4 hours 13 minutes 26 seconds for an average speed of 580.93 mph over 2453.8 miles was obtained by Col. William Council who was able to fly nonstop since his aircraft ( 44-85123 ) was fitted with special 310 - gallon drop tanks . Three months later , Col. Council flew a P -80A from New York to Washington DC in 20 minutes 15 seconds . In June 1946 , Lt. Henry Johnson set a 1000 - km speed record of 426.97 mph . In the first postwar National Air Races held in Cleveland in August of 1946 , Shooting Stars won three trophies : the Bendix Trophy awarded to Col Leon Gray for flying an FP- 80A from Van Nuys , California to Cleveland in 4 hours 8 minutes , the Thompson Trophy 180 - km closed circuit race won by Colonel Gustav Lundquist in a P -80A , and the Weatherhead Jet Speed Dash Trophy won by Lieut W. Reilly at a speed of 576.4 mph in a P -80A . The P-80A won the Bendix and Thompson trophies again in 1947 . In order to show off the USAAF 's new jet fighter , in May of 1946 , twenty - five P-80 As of the 412th Fighter Group toured the United States . However , the 412th Fighter Group was inactivated in July of 1946 after completing the operational evaluation of the first two USAAF jet fighters , the P-59A and the P-80A . Apart from the four P - 80s that had been sent to Europe just prior to V-E Day , the first overseas P -80s were issued to the 55th Fighter Group under Col Horace Hanes , which received 32 Shooting Stars for its 38th Fighter Squadron based at Gibelstadt in Germany . This unit evolved into the 31st Fighter Group . In 1946 , Shooting Stars were delivered to the 38th Squadron of the 55th Fighter Group and the 27th , 71st , and 94th of the 1st Group stationed in the USA , the 31st Group ( 307th , 308th , and 309th Squadrons ) based in Germany , and the 18th Fighter Bomber Wing ( 12th , 44th , and 67th Squadron ) based on Okinawa . In early 1946 , 30 P-80s were sent to the 414th Fighter Group at Florida Blanca Airbase on Luzon in the Philippine Islands . In November 1946 , twenty - five P-80 Bs of the 94th Squadron were taken to Alaska for six months of cold - weather testing . The 363rd Reconnaissance Group was activated at Brooks Field , Texas in July of 1946 , and received FP - 80 As . In 1947 , the following groups got the Shooting Star -- the 4th Group ( 334th , 335th , 336th Squadrons ) and 56th Group ( 61st , 62nd , and 63rd Squadrons ) based in the USA , the 36th Fighter Bomber Group ( 22nd , 23rd , and 53rd Squadrons ) based in Germany , and the 51st Interceptor Group ( 16th , 25th , and 26th Squadrons ) based in Japan . Sixteen F-80A / F-80 Bs of the 56th Fighter Group left Selfridge Field , Michigan on July 7 , 1948 and made a multi-stop transatlantic flight and then took part in two weeks of training in Germany . In 1948 , F-80 Cs began to reach operational units , the first being the 57th Interceptor Group ( 64th , 65th , and 66th Squadrons ) based in Alaska and the 49th Fighter Bomber Group ( 7th , 8th , 9th Squadrons ) based in Japan . Later in 1948 , the 36th Fighter Group took no less than 80 F-80 Bs from Florida to the Canal Zone before moving permanently to Germany . In 1949 , the 23rd Group ( 74th , 75 , 76th Squadrons ) and 81st Group ( 91st , 92nd , and 93rd Squadrons ) , both stationed in the USA , received Shooting Stars . In the same year , the 8th Fighter Bomber Group ( 35th , 36th , and 80th Squadrons ) based in Japan received F-80 Cs . The 35th Interceptor Group ( 39th , 40th , and 41st Squadrons ) based in Japan received F -80 Cs in early 1950 . By the late spring of 1950 , F-80 Cs equipped twelve Far East Air Force ( FEAF ) squadrons based in Japan -- the 7th , 8th , and 9th Squadrons of the 49th Fighter Bomber Wing based at Misawa , the 35th , 36th , and 80th Squadrons with the 8th Fighter Bomber Wing based at Itazuke , the 39th , 40th and 41st Squadrons with the 35th Fighter Interceptor Wing at Yokota , and the 16th , 25th and 26th Squadrons with the 51st Fighter Interceptor Wing at Naha . RF - 80 As equipped the 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron at Yokota . When North Korea invaded South Korea on June 25 , 1950 , four groups equipped with the P -80C ( the 8th , 51st , 49th , and 35th ) were based in Japan , as well as the 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron flying FP - 80 As .

But in an industry that has all but fled American soil for cheaper labor elsewhere , he 's also the businessman who has pledged his loyalty to homegrown apparel , above - average wages and worker - friendly factory conditions . On billboards and in magazines , Charney sells youth and sex appeal packaged in extra-soft , snug T-shirts . Through shrewd marketing , he has commandeered a significant slice of the market , infusing a high level of fashion into an everyday wardrobe item . The formula has brought American Apparel rising sales and national attention . But the question remains : Can he continue to do well and do good ? His marketing acumen could falter , his rivals could offer similar high - fashion T- shirts at lower prices , and fleeting styles and tastes could shift . Pressure could build to compromise the workplace ideals on which he has built the business . \" His goals are very , very laudable , but I think a lot of people in the industry are watching to see if he 's going to be able to survive , \" says Jack Kyser , chief economist with the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. , a private nonprofit that promotes jobs and industry . With his edgy , out - front image , Charney does n't seem like a man who is worried . He is a portrait in confidence , an unsubtle and sometimes off - color company spokesman prone to manic populist discourses . He 's unapologetic about American Apparel 's in - your - face marketing , his confrontations with unions , and his love affairs with employees and women who model his T-shirts . Stories about Charney 's personal life , which circulate in industry circles and have been featured in media coverage of American Apparel , sometimes overshadow more-serious portrayals of the business he 's building , he says . \" There 's a lot of love , and a lot of commitment , and a lot of passion and blood and tears that have gone into this company , \" Charney says . \" And there are many hardworking people there that are extremely passionate that I 've never had any romantic relationship with . \" Four years ago , he pulled his then- little - known rag business into profitability after years of red ink . He did n't do it selling boxy , mass - market T-shirts . Instead , he weaves thin - fiber cotton yarn into styles favored by urban trend - seekers in cities such as San Francisco and New York . A basic women 's T-shirt from American Apparel is priced at about $ 16 retail . Much of the company 's business comes from small , independent designers who buy the shirts wholesale , embellish them with original touches and resell them in boutiques for $ 30 or more . It 's a niche market that distantly trails the multibillion - dollar reach of brands such as Hanes and Fruit of the Loom . But American Apparel reported $ 80 million in sales last year , and Charney says he expects to reach $ 140 million this year . The company opened its first retail stores last year , in New York and Los Angeles , and Charney plans to have 25 locations by the end of the year , possibly including San Francisco . Bucking the offshore trend American Apparel weaves its fabric and cuts and stitches its T-shirts , fleece pants , pullovers and panties in an immense , adobe- pink former railroad warehouse in downtown Los Angeles . A huge banner that hangs outside proclaims the company \" an industrial revolution . \" Its sewing - machine operators commonly make more than $ 500 a week working fewer days and shorter hours , with more-generous benefits and generally better working conditions , than most other garment workers in the city , according to industry observers and independent worker advocates . In recent years , much of the Los Angeles garment industry has moved away from manufacturing in favor of importing . At the same time , American Apparel has grown from 1,200 workers a year ago to nearly 2,000 , most of them Latinos who live in low-income neighborhoods . \" I 'm only 35 . You name another 35 - year - old who 's changing this many lives , \" Charney says during a factory walk - through , in the midst of a running commentary that ranges from free - market trade to cotton shrinkage and prisons in Iraq . Yet questions remain whether Charney 's business model can be broadly adopted to bring large - scale apparel manufacturing back to the United States . Charney argues that higher labor costs can be offset by happier and more - efficient workers , generating higher profit . Two decades of industry trends refute the notion . Major apparel brands such as Gap and Ralph Lauren subcontract with factories in dozens of countries outside the United States in their search for the right balance of design , quality and labor costs . \" American Apparel is an anomaly . It 's not the status of the industry , nor is it the future of where the industry is going , but it is functioning extremely well based on the model it has designed for itself , \" says Ilse Metchek , executive director of the industry - backed California Fashion Association , and LA By Design , a marketing program under the private Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp . ' Sweatshop Free ' marketing American Apparel keeps things simple , sticking with cotton tops and bottoms that require a narrow range of machinery and skills to produce . The company stresses the made - at-home mantra . American Apparel clothing tags , catalogs and billboards declare the goods \" Sweatshop Free . \" Yet , it 's unclear how much that message registers with its wholesale customers and individual shoppers . \" Customers are more attuned to quality \" than to anti-sweatshop marketing , says Roxy Buu , who owns the San Francisco boutique Buu , in San Francisco 's Hayes Valley , which carries designers who use Charney 's T-shirts . \" When I see that a shirt is American Apparel , I know it 's good . \" Los Angeles County 's roughly 67,000 apparel workers do n't make many commodity clothing products , says Kyser , the economic-development economist . The region 's garment shops more routinely churn out quick- turnaround , inexpensive fashions for specialty retailers such as Forever 21 and Wet Seal , or higher - end goods for upscale retailers such as St. John Knits . Basic apparel competes heavily on price , which generally means overseas production , Kyser says . On the factory tour , Charney -- dressed in a pink cotton - jersey leisure shirt made by his company -- seems confident that he can thrive . The company is built on more than some do -gooder social mission , he insists . \" No one can stop this , \" Charney says over the hum of sewing machines , punching the air with his fist and whooping at his workers , inviting them to shout back in a kind of impromptu pep rally . \" I 'm paving a new method of distribution . ... I have to rebuild part of America ! \" Some workers grin . They say that theatrics are typical for the boss . A lifetime in T-shirts Charney 's mother is a painter and his father a Harvard - educated architect . He first sold T-shirts as a Montreal high - school student , buying them at U.S. Kmarts and trucking them back to Canada . T-shirt brokering led to manufacturing , which led Charney to South Carolina in the early 1990s . The industry was highly competitive and increasingly moving offshore . Charney moved to Los Angeles in the summer of 1997 and partnered with Sam Lim and other garment - industry veterans to get American Apparel off the ground . The company turned a profit in 2000 after shifting its focus to fashion - conscious youth , Charney says . A tireless promoter , he has worked the floors at major trade shows such as the Magic Marketplace in Las Vegas , often flanked by models handing out American Apparel ClassicGirl Ts and women 's briefs . According to Charney , the \" Sweatshop Free \" tag has built up the company 's image but also caused headaches . The designation , combined with the company 's success , makes him a prime target of what he calls \" the liberal , PC - oppressed left . \" \" Is it a cooperative ? Is it unionized ? Are you objectifying women ? \" he says , listing the questions he says he gets from anti-sweatshop activists and union organizers . \" Of course we 're objectifying women . You want a smock ? Go to the Middle East . \" Life on the factory floor The factory is not unionized . Last year , Charney and the Union of Needletrades , Industrial and Textile Employees , AFL - CIO , or UNITE , tangled over an organizing drive . The effort failed , and at one point hundreds of American Apparel workers staged a protest against the drive . The union says that the company management intimidated workers . \" By the third day of our campaign , people were not receptive . They were very afraid , \" says Cristina Vazquez , UNITE 's regional manager in California and international vice president . She contends that American Apparel should set an example for other , smaller factories in the city by embracing the union . UNITE , in a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board , contended that Charney had meddled in union talks with employees . In a non-monetary settlement , Charney , who denied wrongdoing , agreed to post flyers spelling out workers ' collective - bargaining rights , have the list of rights read aloud to employees and stay out of future talks . Kimi Lee , director of the independent , nonprofit Garment Worker Center in Los Angeles , says that the center typically supports UNITE 's organizing efforts . But , in the case of American Apparel , the center did not believe that workers would benefit . The Garment Worker Center hears few complaints from American Apparel workers , and those that come up are typically minor and resolved relatively easily , Lee says . They tend to stem from a lack of management experience among floor supervisors who have been promoted with little training , as a result of the company 's fast growth , she says . \" Dov believes in a happy workforce , \" and that 's reflected in the factory conditions and salaries , Lee says . American Apparel workers can take free English - language classes and yoga classes on - site . They have free Internet access and massage therapy and subsidized lunches and bus passes . Employee health care has been privatized and subsidized by the company for about a year and a half , Charney says . \" This is the only factory where I 've been content , where I have been happy , \" says Benigno Navarro , 36 , of Los Angeles , who has worked there a year . He sews T-shirt hems . During his decade in the city 's garment factories , the husband and father of three rarely earned more than $ 30 or $ 40 a day at other factories , often working from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. , and had no health benefits , he says in Spanish . At American Apparel , he says that he works 7:45 a.m. to 4 p.m. most days , with a lunch break , and makes anywhere from $ 80 to $ 120 per day . In Los Angeles , Navarro says , \" This is the company people say is the best . \" The average hourly pay is about $ 13 , with some workers making more than $ 18 , Charney says . He vows that if he ever expands production overseas , he 'll pay those workers above -standard wages as well . Workers who ca n't afford hot water and an Internet connection are n't making a living wage , he says . American Apparel is n't the only Los Angeles clothing - maker that has stressed social values . A company called TeamX marketed its \" union - made , sweatshop - free clothes ( produced ) in the most socially responsible manner \" under a label called SweatX . It was founded by UNITE in 2002 with a reported $ 1 million seed investment from the Hot Fudge Social Venture Capital Fund established by Ben & Jerry 's co-founder Ben Cohen . The workers made at least $ 10 an hour and had medical coverage . But the company was n't profitable , and it folded in May , says Rick Roth , who was hired in October as chief executive . By then , TeamX was debt-ridden and beyond saving , he says . \" It was all about the social premise , and the only thing that works in this business is the product , \" says Metchek , of the California Fashion Association . After Sweat X folded , Charney bought some of its sewing machines . He says he 'll use them to expand his operation .

Educators at the Minnesota Zoo , located in a suburb south of the Twin Cities , created just such an online game a few years ago that has proved immensely popular \u2014 and educational . Called Wolf Quest , it allows players to learn about wolf ecology by exploring Yellowstone National Park as that creature . \u201c We 've always been interested in reaching out beyond our walls , educating people no matter where they are , and for us , we felt like the Internet was a great tool to provide access to educational resources and connect with kids where they 're at , \u201d said Grant Spickelmier , the zoo 's assistant director of education . High - tech games and simulations are second nature to today 's students . For educators and researchers , those virtual worlds offer the freedom to create innovative digital tools that tap into children 's motivation outside the classroom and generate excitement about science . As prominent an authority as the National Research Council has extolled the potential of computer games and simulations to better engage young people in science learning and promote a deeper understanding of and facility with the subject . \u201c They enable learners to see and interact with representations of natural phenomena that would otherwise be impossible to observe \u2014 a process that helps them to formulate scientifically correct explanations for these phenomena , \u201d the NRC said in a recent report . \u201c Simulations and games can motivate learners with challenges and rapid feedback and tailor instruction to individual learners ' needs and interests . \u201d The Minnesota Zoo 's evaluation of its own game found \u201c that kids were learning the science , were more interested in wolves , and were more interested in science as a result of playing the game , \u201d Mr. Spickelmier said . In WolfQuest , players learn about wolves by embarking on missions that a wolf would typically undertake , such as feeding and taking care of pups . Players take the role of the animal and are presented with response options when they encounter certain situations , such as the presence of other wolves . For example , when interacting with a potential mate , players can choose to leave the interaction , take a defensive stance , play , or show interest in the wolf . They are rewarded for choosing authentic wolf behavior . Wolf Quest is a multiplayer game with a chat function that allows participants to talk to one another . Launched in 2007 , it continues to receive thousands of hits daily . Although the game was created primarily for children to access on their home computers , the zoo has increasingly been contacted by teachers interested in incorporating it into their classrooms , Mr. Spickelmier said . The zoo has since crafted curricular materials to help connect the game with what students are learning in class , he said . ' Playful Experimentation ' At the New York Hall of Science , a hands - on science and technology center in New York City , digital tools are helping draw the connections between a day at a museum and children 's lives at home and at school . \u201c One of the things you struggle with in an informal science - center environment is that kids come , they have a blast , but they do n't necessarily leave with anything , \u201d said Margaret Honey , the president and chief executive officer of the facility . \u201c The potential of digital tools to capture and then allow for playful experimentation post -fact is really cool . \u201d For instance , children can enter their height and weight into a computer and wear radio-frequency identification bracelets as they go down giant slides in the science playground .

Educators at the Minnesota Zoo , located in a suburb south of the Twin Cities , created just such an online game a few years ago that has proved immensely popular \u2014 and educational . Called Wolf Quest , it allows players to learn about wolf ecology by exploring Yellowstone National Park as that creature . \u201c We 've always been interested in reaching out beyond our walls , educating people no matter where they are , and for us , we felt like the Internet was a great tool to provide access to educational resources and connect with kids where they 're at , \u201d said Grant Spickelmier , the zoo 's assistant director of education . High - tech games and simulations are second nature to today 's students . For educators and researchers , those virtual worlds offer the freedom to create innovative digital tools that tap into children 's motivation outside the classroom and generate excitement about science . As prominent an authority as the National Research Council has extolled the potential of computer games and simulations to better engage young people in science learning and promote a deeper understanding of and facility with the subject . \u201c They enable learners to see and interact with representations of natural phenomena that would otherwise be impossible to observe \u2014 a process that helps them to formulate scientifically correct explanations for these phenomena , \u201d the NRC said in a recent report . \u201c Simulations and games can motivate learners with challenges and rapid feedback and tailor instruction to individual learners ' needs and interests . \u201d The Minnesota Zoo 's evaluation of its own game found \u201c that kids were learning the science , were more interested in wolves , and were more interested in science as a result of playing the game , \u201d Mr. Spickelmier said . In WolfQuest , players learn about wolves by embarking on missions that a wolf would typically undertake , such as feeding and taking care of pups . Players take the role of the animal and are presented with response options when they encounter certain situations , such as the presence of other wolves . For example , when interacting with a potential mate , players can choose to leave the interaction , take a defensive stance , play , or show interest in the wolf . They are rewarded for choosing authentic wolf behavior . Wolf Quest is a multiplayer game with a chat function that allows participants to talk to one another . Launched in 2007 , it continues to receive thousands of hits daily . Although the game was created primarily for children to access on their home computers , the zoo has increasingly been contacted by teachers interested in incorporating it into their classrooms , Mr. Spickelmier said . The zoo has since crafted curricular materials to help connect the game with what students are learning in class , he said . ' Playful Experimentation ' At the New York Hall of Science , a hands - on science and technology center in New York City , digital tools are helping draw the connections between a day at a museum and children 's lives at home and at school . \u201c One of the things you struggle with in an informal science - center environment is that kids come , they have a blast , but they do n't necessarily leave with anything , \u201d said Margaret Honey , the president and chief executive officer of the facility . \u201c The potential of digital tools to capture and then allow for playful experimentation post -fact is really cool . \u201d For instance , children can enter their height and weight into a computer and wear radio-frequency identification bracelets as they go down giant slides in the science playground . The bracelets record data about the speed , velocity , and friction of their journey . They can then add other factors into the mix \u2014 like going down the slide on different materials , such as vinyl or felt , and holding weights \u2014 to manipulate the data and look at the relationship between the changes the children make and the read - outs they receive . \u201c What underlies the whole initiative [ of the center ] is really paying attention to the dynamics of what motivates students ' engagement , \u201d Ms. Honey said . \u201c Keeping that playful and entertaining and slightly humorous is really important to creating the right kind of positive emotional residue toward science learning .

But there was a tiny handful of settlements where all those who served returned home . With its rows of ramshackle yellow stone cottages , set amid undulating Cotswold hills , the village of Upper Slaughter belies the violence of its name . In hazy autumn sunlight , this corner of Gloucestershire might well have been rendered in watercolour . All the components of tourist - brochure Britain are here - the red phone box , the winding lanes , the wisteria draped around the windows . But one normally ubiquitous feature is missing . Unlike the overwhelming majority of British settlements , Upper Slaughter has no war memorial . Instead , tucked away in the village hall are two modest wooden plaques . They celebrate the men , and one woman , from the village who served in both world wars and , in every case , returned home . For it is not only its postcard charm that offers pacific contrast to the name Upper Slaughter . It is that rarest of British locations , a \" thankful village \" - the term coined in the 1930s by the writer Arthur Mee to describe the handful of communities which suffered no military fatalities in World War I . Mee identified 32 such places , a figure that has been revised upwards in recent years to 52 . Of these , just 14 have , like Upper Slaughter , come to be known as doubly thankful - also losing no -one from WWII . Somehow , these rare outposts - as disparate and evocative - sounding as Nether Kellet , Lancashire ; Woolley , Somerset ; and Herbrandston , Pembrokeshire - were shielded from the worst ravages of the first half of the 20th Century . Some of those they sent to fight may have returned home badly injured or deeply traumatised , but all came back alive . The scale of their good fortune is extraordinary . A million British lives were lost from 1914 - 18 in Europe 's first experience of industrialised , total warfare . No Scottish community appears to have been left unscathed , and no thankful villages have been identified in Ireland , all of which was still part of the UK during WWI . In England and Wales , the 52 so far singled out are dwarfed by over 16,000 which paid the highest sacrifice . In terms of the UK 's collective memory of 1914 - 18 , they represent a striking anomaly . Through history lessons , war poetry and popular culture , the abiding modern portrayal of WWI is as a devastating event of industrial - scale carnage . And yet this handful of communities , whose sons emerged alive from the horrors of the trenches , offers a unique insight into the experience which shattered the pre-WWI order and , in turn , transformed society irrevocably . One man who understands this is Tony Collett , an energetic 80 - year - old who has lived and worked in and around Upper Slaughter all his life . Tony was too young to have served in either world war . But after WWII he hand - painted the lettering on the plaque celebrating the 36 men from the village who came home safely . Standing in the village hall , he looks up , pauses , and places a hand on the wooden sign , before telling its story . It was erected in 1946 alongside a similar marker put up to give thanks for the 24 men and one woman of Upper Slaughter who returned in 1918 . Both the WWI and WWII versions included the name of Tony 's father , Francis George Collett , the village 's resident handyman , universally known by his middle name . Born in 1895 , George had the rare distinction of serving in two world wars . After enlisting at the age of 19 , he was sent to Mesopotamia , now Iraq , where 92,000 of the 410,000 Commonwealth troops died . As a member of the Territorial Army , Sgt Collett was one of the first to be called up in 1939 , coming under fire before long as an anti-aircraft gunner with the Royal Artillery on the home front . But it was not only those in uniform like George whose lives were at risk . On 4 February 1944 , Upper Slaughter faced an attack from the sky , with incendiary bombs raining down on the village . \" I saw it through the skylight , \" recalls Tony , who was 14 at the time and sharing a room with his sister . \" The first thing we did was dive down under the blankets . \" We came out and saw all these flames . We were dodging fires all the way down the road . \" It was 05:30 GMT , and the village was burning . Several cottages and barns had been hit . But the people of the village quickly assembled , gathering water and sand to douse the flames . Though the damage was severe , Upper Slaughter 's luck held - no-one was killed . In 1946 , it seemed natural to put up another plaque . The village hall had been acquired by the local Witts family after WWI to mark the armistice . Newly demobilised George , the village 's odd - job man , church sexton and occasional undertaker , was given the task of creating a second marker to give thanks for the men who had just come back . With his son assisting , George carved the wooden plaque , styling it to match that from 1914 - 18 . Tony then carefully painted the 36 fortunate names . Another sign , on the other side of the hall , was fashioned from brass to commemorate the \" distinguished conduct and promptitude \" shown by Upper Slaughter 's residents on the night of the incendiary bomb raid . Every time they passed the building , the people of the village were reminded of their incredible luck . And yet amid the wreckage of make - do- and - mend austerity Britain , with so many communities shattered and families destroyed , it felt unseemly to discuss this . After all , during the first half of the 20th Century , Upper Slaughter was very much the exception . While people in this corner of the Cotswolds were quietly grateful for what they had escaped , the vast majority of their compatriots were adjusting to the most profound of losses . For every village like Upper Slaughter there was another like Wadhurst , East Sussex - a place of just over 3,500 people which lost 149 men in WWI , according to research by the historian Paul Reed , author of Great War Lives . On a single day in 1915 at the Battle of Aubers , 25 men from Wadhurst were killed - just under 80 % of all those who went forward into no -man 's land , and almost certainly the heaviest per capita casualties of any community in the UK for one day 's battle . The majority of the fallen had no known grave . Indeed , according to the WWI historian Dan Snow , it was often small communities , villages and hamlets in which the psychological burden of the carnage 's aftermath was most painfully felt . Largely to blame for this , Snow believes , was the system of Pals Battalions - units of friends , work colleagues and relatives who had been promised they could fight alongside each other when they enlisted amid the patriotic fervour of 1914 . The battalions were a useful recruiting tool for War Secretary Lord Kitchener , who believed that mobilising large numbers of enthusiastic recruits quickly was the best method of winning the war . But the reality of the trenches , where thousands of men could be wiped out in a single day , meant that small communities could face disproportionate levels of bloodshed within a matter of hours . Of about 700 \" pals \" from Accrington , Lancashire who participated in the Somme offensive , some 235 were killed and 350 wounded within just 20 minutes . By the end of the first hour , 1,700 men from Bradford were dead or injured . Some 93 of the approximately 175 Chorley men who went over the top at the same time died . It was a pattern repeated many times - and on each occasion , a town or village was deeply wounded , instantly . The \" pals \" system was phased out in 1917 , but not before it left an indelible mark on the British consciousness . \" They had to stop that practice because it was so unbelievably destructive , \" says Snow , whose great-grandfather Sir Thomas D'Oyly Snow was a general at the Somme . \" When you let brothers serve together , it can be devastating for a whole community . It was a war that touched everybody in the British Isles . That 's what total war means . \" The UK may have lost 2.2 % of its population , but in other belligerent nations the toll was even higher . France lost 1.4 million , some 4.3 % of its citizens . The French equivalent of a thankful village is even more extraordinary . Thierville in Normandy has not lost any service personnel in France 's last five wars - the Franco - Prussian war of 1870 , World Wars I and II , Indochina , and Algeria . Of course , even those in the thankful villages in the UK did not escape the hardships and disruption imposed by total war . By 1918 , rationing was in force and everywhere on the home front would take many years to recover . Likewise , the fortunate veterans who made it home alive were scarcely unscathed . Many were permanently damaged by their experiences , whether physically or mentally . By the end of WWI , the Army had dealt with 80,000 cases of \" shell shock \" - psychological trauma caused by war experiences . \" Soldiers can return , but it might be with their bodies or their psyches scarred , \" says Peter Englund , author of The Beauty And The Sorrow : An Intimate History of the First World War . Nonetheless , given the scale of the losses , and the fact that virtually no family was left intact , it is scarcely surprising that the notion of thankful villages proved comforting to a British public which was still reeling from the war long after the armistice . The phrase was first used by Mee - a celebrated writer and journalist best known for his 1908 Children 's Encyclopaedia - in The King 's England , a 1930s series of books offering a guide to each of England 's counties . By this time , a war memorial was a feature of virtually every settlement in the country . Mee was struck by the tiny proportion that did not have one , and the notion of the thankful villages was born . In an interwar Britain convulsed by a fresh set of shocks - the great depression , mass unemployment , the rise of fascism in Europe - it 's hardly surprising that readers looked on such places as a nostalgic reminder of an apparently simpler time before August 1914 . Mee appears to have understood this , his prose on the subject assuming a wistful tone . \" Thirty men went from Catwick to the Great War and thirty came back , though one left an arm behind , \" he wrote of one village in a volume on the East Riding of Yorkshire . And yet somewhere along the way , in the slipstream of a second global conflict , the notion slipped from the public consciousness - even in places like Catwick . Though it never had a war memorial , the windswept village had a commemoration of its own . At the outset of WWI , the village blacksmith , John Hugill , nailed a lucky horseshoe to the door of his forge . Around it , for each man who went to the war , he nailed a coin . When WWII broke out , he did the same again . As Catwick was to prove doubly thankful , it was a remarkable monument . And yet when Hugill 's workshop closed , the coins and the horseshoe were taken away from the door . All were fixed to a board and eventually passed onto Hugill 's grandson , now 60 and also called John Hugill , who still lives in Catwick , where he runs an engineering firm . He has vowed never to let the memento leave the village and hopes to find a way to put it on public display . Hugill was too young to know his grandfather , while his father - who served as a Sergeant - at - Arms in the Home Guard during WWII - was reluctant to speak about his wartime experiences . \" All they wanted to do was forget it , \" Hugill says . \" When they 're gone , you think , ' Why did n't we talk to each other about it ? ' But there was a big age gap - there 'd been such a huge change in culture . \" Tony Collett experienced something very similar . It took decades , he says , for Upper Slaughter 's remarkable good fortune to be widely discussed in the village . Only in the past 10 years or so , he reckons , has this semi-superstitious reluctance to give voice to the village 's special status fallen away . Tony attributes this to the characteristic stoicism of his father 's era . Whatever terrifying and extraordinary sights he may have seen in battle , George , typically for his generation , rarely spoke of them . \" It 's one of these things , \" says Tony . \" Because the war and its aftermath were all around us , you needed to just live with it and carry on with your life . \" It was only in recent years that people really started to realise there were these thankful villages . It was never spoken of in my younger days . \" As the country picked itself up , Tony entered the Royal Marines for his two years ' National Service . On Remembrance Day 1950 he was in uniform in Whitehall as the King laid a wreath at the Cenotaph . After returning to civilian life in the family building firm , Tony would travel each Remembrance Sunday to the war memorial of the neighbouring village , Lower Slaughter . As he looks out over lanes and buildings he has known all his life , Tony knows Upper Slaughter is no longer the intimate , tightly - bound community in which he grew up . The cottages are no longer within the financial reach of handymen and part-time undertakers . An influx of second - home-owning weekend residents has meant that the villagers are no longer intimately acquainted with each others ' business , he says , for better or worse . But Tony is aware that for decades the community retained a sliver of pre-WWI innocence , long after the rest of the country . The generations who grew up after the wars , for whom the memories of the nation 's loss are less raw , have proved more willing to discuss the subject . And , as a result , the past decade has witnessed a growth in awareness of thankful villages . Battlefield tour guide Tom Morgan , 64 , had been a WWI enthusiast all his life , and dimly recalled during his boyhood reading a letter in a newspaper which referred to thankful villages . The story had always nagged at his memory , and in the late 1990s , Morgan posted on a history internet discussion forum asking if anyone else was aware of it , to no avail . However , the post remained one of the only references to thankful villages on the internet , and years later he was contacted through the site by another amateur historian . The two began researching the subject , and , along with another enthusiast , began producing a website identifying thankful villages . As well as investigating the places identified by Mee , the men were contacted by readers who tipped them off about other possible locations . By the end of 2010 , the number of verified thankful villages had risen to 52 , but not before Morgan and his colleagues had undertaken much painstaking research , trawling through local newspapers , church records and the archives of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission . Their efforts mean a hitherto neglected historical curiosity has been given additional prominence . For Morgan , the significance of the thankful villages is their unique mindset - one denied to the rest of Britain by the million bereavements it endured in WWI . The cultural narrative of the conflict is as a series of grossly negligent betrayals of heroic young men by the era 's political and military establishment , he says . \" The First World War changed society , \" Morgan argues . \" Everybody began to have doubts about the ruling class who were running the country by accident of birth , not ability . People decided that they 'd like a little bit of a say in their own destiny . \" But the thankful villages were able to just carry on . Elsewhere , whole communities may have been shattered , but here you have these magical places not bearing any mental scars . \" Inexplicable patterns can be composed from the list of thankful villages - Somerset was particularly fortunate , for instance , boasting nine such communities , while neighbouring Wiltshire has none at all . But there seem to be few obvious reasons why some places were luckier than others . Servicemen like George Collett , risking in his life in Mesopotamia , were hardly out of harm 's way . Nor were the thankful villages any less forthcoming when it came to providing volunteers . Arkholme , Lancashire , sent 59 men to fight in WWI , all of whom appear , incredibly , to have returned . Instead , they seem merely to have been lucky . As one researcher , Rod Morris , has observed , 21 personnel from Rodney Stoke , Somerset , may have all come back intact - yet of 73 sent by neighbouring Draycott , 11 were killed . What the thankful villages tell us , if anything , is that the prospects of survival are entirely arbitrary . They may be few in number , but it is possible that more thankful villages are out there . Several of those on Morgan 's list are there purely by virtue of a casual reader 's curiosity being nagged by their lack of a local war memorial . One of those was Minting , a small outpost in Lincolnshire with a population of 167 to which former Royal Army Educational Corps officer Roy Griffiths and his wife Karen had retired . With their shared military background - Roy served for 24 years , while Karen 's father had been in the RAF - both were puzzled . \" One of the things I 'd noticed about the village was that it did n't have a war memorial , \" Roy , 71 , recalls . \" I could n't believe that Minting did n't suffer any losses in World War I , even though it 's small . \" When we asked around , all we were told was that there was n't a war memorial and that was that . \" The pair set off on a trail , trawling old copies of the local newspaper and studying census and electoral roll data . Minting had sent 10 men to WWI , it transpired , and all of them returned . In WWII , the Griffiths found that nine had fought - although one , Pte Raymond Camp of the Lincolnshire Regiment , had been killed in action in 1943 . Thanks to the couple 's efforts , a pair of plaques now hang in the parish church , giving thanks for the 18 men of the village who came back safely and commemorating the loss of Pte Camp . Wandering around Upper Slaughter , the memorial plaques may be displayed modestly inside the village hall , away from public view , but virtually every lapel carries a poppy . And the very recent past has given Upper Slaughter yet more to be thankful for . As British forces embarked on their first campaigns of the 21st Century , the village was once again represented . A son of Upper Slaughter , Lt Fred Keeling , completed two tours of Iraq and one of Afghanistan with the Royal Artillery . When he left the Army in 2008 after five years , the community 's unbroken record of good fortune remained intact . For his family , it was a very different experience to that of anxious parents in previous conflicts . Unlike in the 20th Century 's world wars , they could take no comfort from the knowledge that virtually every other household shared their plight . But Richard Keeling , 63 , Lt Keeling 's father , says Upper Slaughter never forgot about his son . Its remarkable legacy from two world wars saw to that . \" We 've lived here for 20 years so we 've always known the history , \" Richard says . \" We know we 're from a very special village . And we 're very relieved that we have n't broken the average . \"","annotations":[{"text":"losing no -one from WWII","span":[1540,1563],"token_span":[290,294],"role":"Topic","label":"Topic","role_definition":"The Topic is the general area in which the emotion occurs.

But there was a tiny handful of settlements where all those who served returned home . With its rows of ramshackle yellow stone cottages , set amid undulating Cotswold hills , the village of Upper Slaughter belies the violence of its name . In hazy autumn sunlight , this corner of Gloucestershire might well have been rendered in watercolour . All the components of tourist - brochure Britain are here - the red phone box , the winding lanes , the wisteria draped around the windows . But one normally ubiquitous feature is missing . Unlike the overwhelming majority of British settlements , Upper Slaughter has no war memorial . Instead , tucked away in the village hall are two modest wooden plaques . They celebrate the men , and one woman , from the village who served in both world wars and , in every case , returned home . For it is not only its postcard charm that offers pacific contrast to the name Upper Slaughter . It is that rarest of British locations , a \" thankful village \" - the term coined in the 1930s by the writer Arthur Mee to describe the handful of communities which suffered no military fatalities in World War I . Mee identified 32 such places , a figure that has been revised upwards in recent years to 52 . Of these , just 14 have , like Upper Slaughter , come to be known as doubly thankful - also losing no -one from WWII . Somehow , these rare outposts - as disparate and evocative - sounding as Nether Kellet , Lancashire ; Woolley , Somerset ; and Herbrandston , Pembrokeshire - were shielded from the worst ravages of the first half of the 20th Century . Some of those they sent to fight may have returned home badly injured or deeply traumatised , but all came back alive . The scale of their good fortune is extraordinary . A million British lives were lost from 1914 - 18 in Europe 's first experience of industrialised , total warfare . No Scottish community appears to have been left unscathed , and no thankful villages have been identified in Ireland , all of which was still part of the UK during WWI . In England and Wales , the 52 so far singled out are dwarfed by over 16,000 which paid the highest sacrifice . In terms of the UK 's collective memory of 1914 - 18 , they represent a striking anomaly . Through history lessons , war poetry and popular culture , the abiding modern portrayal of WWI is as a devastating event of industrial - scale carnage . And yet this handful of communities , whose sons emerged alive from the horrors of the trenches , offers a unique insight into the experience which shattered the pre-WWI order and , in turn , transformed society irrevocably . One man who understands this is Tony Collett , an energetic 80 - year - old who has lived and worked in and around Upper Slaughter all his life . Tony was too young to have served in either world war . But after WWII he hand - painted the lettering on the plaque celebrating the 36 men from the village who came home safely . Standing in the village hall , he looks up , pauses , and places a hand on the wooden sign , before telling its story . It was erected in 1946 alongside a similar marker put up to give thanks for the 24 men and one woman of Upper Slaughter who returned in 1918 . Both the WWI and WWII versions included the name of Tony 's father , Francis George Collett , the village 's resident handyman , universally known by his middle name . Born in 1895 , George had the rare distinction of serving in two world wars . After enlisting at the age of 19 , he was sent to Mesopotamia , now Iraq , where 92,000 of the 410,000 Commonwealth troops died . As a member of the Territorial Army , Sgt Collett was one of the first to be called up in 1939 , coming under fire before long as an anti-aircraft gunner with the Royal Artillery on the home front . But it was not only those in uniform like George whose lives were at risk . On 4 February 1944 , Upper Slaughter faced an attack from the sky , with incendiary bombs raining down on the village . \" I saw it through the skylight , \" recalls Tony , who was 14 at the time and sharing a room with his sister . \" The first thing we did was dive down under the blankets . \" We came out and saw all these flames . We were dodging fires all the way down the road . \" It was 05:30 GMT , and the village was burning . Several cottages and barns had been hit . But the people of the village quickly assembled , gathering water and sand to douse the flames . Though the damage was severe , Upper Slaughter 's luck held - no-one was killed . In 1946 , it seemed natural to put up another plaque . The village hall had been acquired by the local Witts family after WWI to mark the armistice . Newly demobilised George , the village 's odd - job man , church sexton and occasional undertaker , was given the task of creating a second marker to give thanks for the men who had just come back . With his son assisting , George carved the wooden plaque , styling it to match that from 1914 - 18 . Tony then carefully painted the 36 fortunate names . Another sign , on the other side of the hall , was fashioned from brass to commemorate the \" distinguished conduct and promptitude \" shown by Upper Slaughter 's residents on the night of the incendiary bomb raid . Every time they passed the building , the people of the village were reminded of their incredible luck . And yet amid the wreckage of make - do- and - mend austerity Britain , with so many communities shattered and families destroyed , it felt unseemly to discuss this . After all , during the first half of the 20th Century , Upper Slaughter was very much the exception . While people in this corner of the Cotswolds were quietly grateful for what they had escaped , the vast majority of their compatriots were adjusting to the most profound of losses . For every village like Upper Slaughter there was another like Wadhurst , East Sussex - a place of just over 3,500 people which lost 149 men in WWI , according to research by the historian Paul Reed , author of Great War Lives . On a single day in 1915 at the Battle of Aubers , 25 men from Wadhurst were killed - just under 80 % of all those who went forward into no -man 's land , and almost certainly the heaviest per capita casualties of any community in the UK for one day 's battle . The majority of the fallen had no known grave . Indeed , according to the WWI historian Dan Snow , it was often small communities , villages and hamlets in which the psychological burden of the carnage 's aftermath was most painfully felt . Largely to blame for this , Snow believes , was the system of Pals Battalions - units of friends , work colleagues and relatives who had been promised they could fight alongside each other when they enlisted amid the patriotic fervour of 1914 . The battalions were a useful recruiting tool for War Secretary Lord Kitchener , who believed that mobilising large numbers of enthusiastic recruits quickly was the best method of winning the war . But the reality of the trenches , where thousands of men could be wiped out in a single day , meant that small communities could face disproportionate levels of bloodshed within a matter of hours . Of about 700 \" pals \" from Accrington , Lancashire who participated in the Somme offensive , some 235 were killed and 350 wounded within just 20 minutes . By the end of the first hour , 1,700 men from Bradford were dead or injured . Some 93 of the approximately 175 Chorley men who went over the top at the same time died . It was a pattern repeated many times - and on each occasion , a town or village was deeply wounded , instantly . The \" pals \" system was phased out in 1917 , but not before it left an indelible mark on the British consciousness . \" They had to stop that practice because it was so unbelievably destructive , \" says Snow , whose great-grandfather Sir Thomas D'Oyly Snow was a general at the Somme . \" When you let brothers serve together , it can be devastating for a whole community . It was a war that touched everybody in the British Isles . That 's what total war means . \" The UK may have lost 2.2 % of its population , but in other belligerent nations the toll was even higher . France lost 1.4 million , some 4.3 % of its citizens . The French equivalent of a thankful village is even more extraordinary . Thierville in Normandy has not lost any service personnel in France 's last five wars - the Franco - Prussian war of 1870 , World Wars I and II , Indochina , and Algeria . Of course , even those in the thankful villages in the UK did not escape the hardships and disruption imposed by total war . By 1918 , rationing was in force and everywhere on the home front would take many years to recover . Likewise , the fortunate veterans who made it home alive were scarcely unscathed . Many were permanently damaged by their experiences , whether physically or mentally . By the end of WWI , the Army had dealt with 80,000 cases of \" shell shock \" - psychological trauma caused by war experiences . \" Soldiers can return , but it might be with their bodies or their psyches scarred , \" says Peter Englund , author of The Beauty And The Sorrow : An Intimate History of the First World War . Nonetheless , given the scale of the losses , and the fact that virtually no family was left intact , it is scarcely surprising that the notion of thankful villages proved comforting to a British public which was still reeling from the war long after the armistice . The phrase was first used by Mee - a celebrated writer and journalist best known for his 1908 Children 's Encyclopaedia - in The King 's England , a 1930s series of books offering a guide to each of England 's counties . By this time , a war memorial was a feature of virtually every settlement in the country . Mee was struck by the tiny proportion that did not have one , and the notion of the thankful villages was born . In an interwar Britain convulsed by a fresh set of shocks - the great depression , mass unemployment , the rise of fascism in Europe - it 's hardly surprising that readers looked on such places as a nostalgic reminder of an apparently simpler time before August 1914 . Mee appears to have understood this , his prose on the subject assuming a wistful tone . \" Thirty men went from Catwick to the Great War and thirty came back , though one left an arm behind , \" he wrote of one village in a volume on the East Riding of Yorkshire . And yet somewhere along the way , in the slipstream of a second global conflict , the notion slipped from the public consciousness - even in places like Catwick . Though it never had a war memorial , the windswept village had a commemoration of its own . At the outset of WWI , the village blacksmith , John Hugill , nailed a lucky horseshoe to the door of his forge . Around it , for each man who went to the war , he nailed a coin . When WWII broke out , he did the same again . As Catwick was to prove doubly thankful , it was a remarkable monument . And yet when Hugill 's workshop closed , the coins and the horseshoe were taken away from the door . All were fixed to a board and eventually passed onto Hugill 's grandson , now 60 and also called John Hugill , who still lives in Catwick , where he runs an engineering firm . He has vowed never to let the memento leave the village and hopes to find a way to put it on public display . Hugill was too young to know his grandfather , while his father - who served as a Sergeant - at - Arms in the Home Guard during WWII - was reluctant to speak about his wartime experiences . \" All they wanted to do was forget it , \" Hugill says . \" When they 're gone , you think , ' Why did n't we talk to each other about it ? ' But there was a big age gap - there 'd been such a huge change in culture . \" Tony Collett experienced something very similar . It took decades , he says , for Upper Slaughter 's remarkable good fortune to be widely discussed in the village . Only in the past 10 years or so , he reckons , has this semi-superstitious reluctance to give voice to the village 's special status fallen away . Tony attributes this to the characteristic stoicism of his father 's era . Whatever terrifying and extraordinary sights he may have seen in battle , George , typically for his generation , rarely spoke of them . \" It 's one of these things , \" says Tony . \" Because the war and its aftermath were all around us , you needed to just live with it and carry on with your life . \" It was only in recent years that people really started to realise there were these thankful villages . It was never spoken of in my younger days . \" As the country picked itself up , Tony entered the Royal Marines for his two years ' National Service . On Remembrance Day 1950 he was in uniform in Whitehall as the King laid a wreath at the Cenotaph . After returning to civilian life in the family building firm , Tony would travel each Remembrance Sunday to the war memorial of the neighbouring village , Lower Slaughter . As he looks out over lanes and buildings he has known all his life , Tony knows Upper Slaughter is no longer the intimate , tightly - bound community in which he grew up . The cottages are no longer within the financial reach of handymen and part-time undertakers . An influx of second - home-owning weekend residents has meant that the villagers are no longer intimately acquainted with each others ' business , he says , for better or worse . But Tony is aware that for decades the community retained a sliver of pre-WWI innocence , long after the rest of the country . The generations who grew up after the wars , for whom the memories of the nation 's loss are less raw , have proved more willing to discuss the subject . And , as a result , the past decade has witnessed a growth in awareness of thankful villages . Battlefield tour guide Tom Morgan , 64 , had been a WWI enthusiast all his life , and dimly recalled during his boyhood reading a letter in a newspaper which referred to thankful villages . The story had always nagged at his memory , and in the late 1990s , Morgan posted on a history internet discussion forum asking if anyone else was aware of it , to no avail . However , the post remained one of the only references to thankful villages on the internet , and years later he was contacted through the site by another amateur historian . The two began researching the subject , and , along with another enthusiast , began producing a website identifying thankful villages . As well as investigating the places identified by Mee , the men were contacted by readers who tipped them off about other possible locations . By the end of 2010 , the number of verified thankful villages had risen to 52 , but not before Morgan and his colleagues had undertaken much painstaking research , trawling through local newspapers , church records and the archives of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission . Their efforts mean a hitherto neglected historical curiosity has been given additional prominence . For Morgan , the significance of the thankful villages is their unique mindset - one denied to the rest of Britain by the million bereavements it endured in WWI . The cultural narrative of the conflict is as a series of grossly negligent betrayals of heroic young men by the era 's political and military establishment , he says . \" The First World War changed society , \" Morgan argues . \" Everybody began to have doubts about the ruling class who were running the country by accident of birth , not ability . People decided that they 'd like a little bit of a say in their own destiny . \" But the thankful villages were able to just carry on . Elsewhere , whole communities may have been shattered , but here you have these magical places not bearing any mental scars . \" Inexplicable patterns can be composed from the list of thankful villages - Somerset was particularly fortunate , for instance , boasting nine such communities , while neighbouring Wiltshire has none at all . But there seem to be few obvious reasons why some places were luckier than others . Servicemen like George Collett , risking in his life in Mesopotamia , were hardly out of harm 's way . Nor were the thankful villages any less forthcoming when it came to providing volunteers . Arkholme , Lancashire , sent 59 men to fight in WWI , all of whom appear , incredibly , to have returned . Instead , they seem merely to have been lucky . As one researcher , Rod Morris , has observed , 21 personnel from Rodney Stoke , Somerset , may have all come back intact - yet of 73 sent by neighbouring Draycott , 11 were killed . What the thankful villages tell us , if anything , is that the prospects of survival are entirely arbitrary . They may be few in number , but it is possible that more thankful villages are out there . Several of those on Morgan 's list are there purely by virtue of a casual reader 's curiosity being nagged by their lack of a local war memorial . One of those was Minting , a small outpost in Lincolnshire with a population of 167 to which former Royal Army Educational Corps officer Roy Griffiths and his wife Karen had retired . With their shared military background - Roy served for 24 years , while Karen 's father had been in the RAF - both were puzzled . \" One of the things I 'd noticed about the village was that it did n't have a war memorial , \" Roy , 71 , recalls . \" I could n't believe that Minting did n't suffer any losses in World War I , even though it 's small . \" When we asked around , all we were told was that there was n't a war memorial and that was that . \" The pair set off on a trail , trawling old copies of the local newspaper and studying census and electoral roll data . Minting had sent 10 men to WWI , it transpired , and all of them returned . In WWII , the Griffiths found that nine had fought - although one , Pte Raymond Camp of the Lincolnshire Regiment , had been killed in action in 1943 . Thanks to the couple 's efforts , a pair of plaques now hang in the parish church , giving thanks for the 18 men of the village who came back safely and commemorating the loss of Pte Camp . Wandering around Upper Slaughter , the memorial plaques may be displayed modestly inside the village hall , away from public view , but virtually every lapel carries a poppy . And the very recent past has given Upper Slaughter yet more to be thankful for . As British forces embarked on their first campaigns of the 21st Century , the village was once again represented . A son of Upper Slaughter , Lt Fred Keeling , completed two tours of Iraq and one of Afghanistan with the Royal Artillery . When he left the Army in 2008 after five years , the community 's unbroken record of good fortune remained intact . For his family , it was a very different experience to that of anxious parents in previous conflicts . Unlike in the 20th Century 's world wars , they could take no comfort from the knowledge that virtually every other household shared their plight . But Richard Keeling , 63 , Lt Keeling 's father , says Upper Slaughter never forgot about his son . Its remarkable legacy from two world wars saw to that . \" We 've lived here for 20 years so we 've always known the history , \" Richard says . \" We know we 're from a very special village . And we 're very relieved that we have n't broken the average . \"","annotations":[{"text":"Herbrandston","span":[1694,1705],"token_span":[319,319],"role":"Experiencer","label":"Experiencer","role_definition":"The Experiencer is the person or sentient entity that experiences or feels the emotions."},{"text":"losing no -one from WWII","span":[1540,1563],"token_span":[290,294],"role":"Topic","label":"Topic","role_definition":"The Topic is the general area in which the emotion occurs.

It 's Saturday morning and we 're relaxing on the sofa with a coffee , idly scrolling through Twitter while MTV Classics plays in the background . The 1992 video for Roy Orbison 's posthumously released track ' I Drove All Night ' plays . Now , we 're partial to Roy , the American singer - songwriter behind such classics as ' You Got It ' and ' In Dreams ' . He rose to fame in the ' 60s and was in the midst of a career renaissance in 1988 when a heart attack took him at the age of 52 . His back catalogue enjoyed a revival shortly afterwards , thanks partly to the prominent use of his signature track in the hit film Pretty Woman . Consequently , despite hailing from an earlier generation , Orbison 's songs fire up late ' 80s , early ' 90s nostalgia for us in the same way as double denim and Hypercolor t-shirts . Mention his name in conversation and ' video games ' are unlikely to come up . Nintendo fans might be able to dredge up the trivia nugget that he ( and his trademark glasses ) inspired his namesake Koopa Kid courtesy of Nintendo of America 's English translation of Super Mario Bros. 3 , but the musician was from a different generation ; an analogue generation . Owing to the fact he 'd been dead for four years at the time of production , a spectral Orbison appears in the ' I Drove All Night ' video via snippets of distorted archival footage while Jason Priestley and Jennifer Connelly cavort in moody monochrome . An impossibly attractive couple \u2013 the objects of approximately 98 % of teenage crushes of the era \u2013 Priestley does his best James Dean impression behind the wheel as he drives to meet Connelly in the middle of the desert . On arrival , the two young stars then frolic on the car bonnet and other locations , generally enjoying each other 's company for the rest of the song . As we took this nostalgia trip and cursed the ravages of Mother Time , we suddenly bolted upright at a brief shot of a van the two lovers ride past , spilling our coffee as we did a cartoon - style double - take . No , it could n't be . Grabbing the remote we hit rewind just to make sure and there it was , plain as day : Skip to 3:14 in the video to see for yourself . For some reason \u2013 for the briefest of moments \u2013 Roy Orbison was plugging Super Mario Bros . from beyond the grave . Other split-second references occur throughout the video : This is perplexing for multiple reasons . Even if he was an avid gamer ( which seems unlikely ) , of all the potential artists that might have prompted early ' 90s kids to race down to their nearest gaming emporium and pick up the latest release , Roy ' Only - the - Lonely ' Orbison would have been very low down the list \u2013 somewhere between Ringo Starr and your gran . We ca n't imagine his seal of approval being the envy of consumer electronics brands in any decade , least of all the too- cool - for-school ' 90s . MC Hammer ? Perhaps . Vanilla Ice ? At a push , but Roy Orbison !? Too square , too operatic , and \u2013 frankly \u2013 too dead . Who on earth thought this would be a fruitful crossover for either party ? We had to know , and the rest of our morning was spent in search of an explanation . We should remember that this period was arguably ' peak ' Mario \u2013 or perhaps more accurately , peak Nintendo . The Super Mario Bros. Super Show ! was on TV , The Wizard had whipped up incredible levels of anticipation for Super Mario Bros . 3 before it landed in the US , and the summer of ' 91 saw the arrival of the Super Nintendo with Super Mario World ( PAL territories would have to wait until the following year ) . Sure , John Connor might have mocked the mainstream Nintendo kids in Terminator 2 while he skipped school and ripped off ATMs in his Public Enemy t-shirt , but he was being hunted by a liquid metal killing machine ; the average kid his age was Mario mad . Consequently , the plumber appeared in all sorts of places up until 1993 when the failure of the infamous Bob Hoskins live - action movie made Nintendo realise its brand could be damaged through hasty tie-ins . It put the brakes on such practices , and has arguably only recently begun branching out again with theme parks and animated movie deals . This haphazard approach to licencing presumably enabled MCA Records to get its hands on the plumber 's likeness to promote a compilation album that you may or may not be familiar with . Nintendo : White Knuckle Scorin ' is a very strange album , to say the least . Ten tracks long , it includes ' I Drove All Night ' and it , too , gets a reference in the video ( skip to 2:38 ) . While the cover could n't be more ' 90s if it tried , only the opening song by Jellyfish , ' Ignorance is Bliss ' , has any lyrical ties whatsoever to Super Mario . The remainder of the compilation is apparently made up of random tracks MCA Records had lying around the place , thrown onto a Nintendo -labelled disc because , well , those idiot kids will buy anything plastered with Mario 's face , wo n't they ?! Kotaku ran a short article on the album eight years back after Negative World posted some highlights , if they can be called such , of a short comic that came in the album sleeve . This comic weaves the song titles into a contrived narrative featuring Mario and friends . Each title is crowbarred awkwardly into one of the characters ' speech bubbles and , for the particularly slow reader , another character invariably drives the point home with a knowing ' Song cue ' . Closer examination of the comic reveals the ostensive reason for the entire endeavour \u2013 it 's an ill-conceived pro-literacy project . Set in Dinosaur Land , Yoshi and the Koopa Kids learn to read courtesy of Princess Peach ( or Toadstool here ) , while perennial loser Bowser subscribes to the mantra ' ignorance is bliss ' ( song cue ) . It 's complete nonsense but fascinating all - at-once ; a hodgepodge of ' 90s vernacular and a ( presumably mandated ) selection of hilariously inappropriate ' big ' words . For example , Princess Toadstool , the ' babe ' with the ' dynamite bod ' , stuffs magical spell book pages down her ' d\u00e9colletage ' . Head over to Negative World for a more thorough look at the liberties taken with your favourite video game characters , but suffice it to say , it 's utter rubbish . You 've got to hand it to whoever knocked this up , though ; effort has gone into this rubbish . Stringing together such woefully unrelated tracks in a Mario-branded pro-literacy wrapper was a thankless task . The result is an intriguing oddity from the height of Mario mania , for sure , but why exactly were these songs thrown together on the disc ? Were there no more fitting alternatives ? Sure , Dire Straits were a big deal at the time , but Mark Knopfler 's sombre reflection of a violent clash during the UK miner 's strike was even less likely to win over the target demographic than Roy 's contribution . Stranger still , Virgin Records \u2013 not MCA \u2013 held the rights to Orbison 's back catalogue , so getting this song on its Nintendo compilation involved work on MCA 's part , certainly more than simply sweeping the recording studio floor for random offcuts and B-sides . Examination of ' I Drove All Night 's ' single sleeve provides a vital clue . On the reverse we found the following dedication from Orbison 's wife : Bobby Brooks was Roy 's agent and friend . I am so pleased that Roy 's song , \u201c I Drove All Night \u201d pays tribute to Bobby 's memory . Roy always felt that children are our future . The work of the Bobby Brooks Foundation will promote literacy in children and ensure a more promising future for us all . The single features two ' B-sides ' , both by other artists taken from White Knuckle Scorin ' . Further investigation of this Bobby Brooks character uncovered a contemporary L.A. Times article from November 1991 highlighting the release of both the single and White Knuckle Scorin ' itself ( unfortunately , European readers may have trouble accessing the article due to geo-locking ) . Despite a few inaccuracies ( the article claims White Knuckle Scorin ' is \u201c a soundtrack album for a new Nintendo video game \u201d ) , it sheds some light on the thinking behind the project . Bobby Brooks was an agent for various artists ; 'a tremendous guy , a very funny man ' according to another of his clients , Eric Clapton . Brooks was tragically killed in the same 1990 helicopter crash that also claimed legendary guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan . According to the article , White Knuckle Scorin ' was the brainchild of MCA Chairman Al Teller \u2013 a somewhat confused attempt to fuse a tribute to the departed Brooks with a compilation album to ' tap the Nintendo youth market ' . In addition to playing Nintendo , literacy was apparently a cause close to Brooks ' heart and provided the album 's wholesome raison d'\u00eatre , with a cut of proceeds going to form a foundation in his honour . It seems that Bobby Brooks had worked ( in some capacity ) with the majority of the featured artists on the compilation ; the tangential link between this strange selection of songs .

It 's Saturday morning and we 're relaxing on the sofa with a coffee , idly scrolling through Twitter while MTV Classics plays in the background . The 1992 video for Roy Orbison 's posthumously released track ' I Drove All Night ' plays . Now , we 're partial to Roy , the American singer - songwriter behind such classics as ' You Got It ' and ' In Dreams ' . He rose to fame in the ' 60s and was in the midst of a career renaissance in 1988 when a heart attack took him at the age of 52 . His back catalogue enjoyed a revival shortly afterwards , thanks partly to the prominent use of his signature track in the hit film Pretty Woman . Consequently , despite hailing from an earlier generation , Orbison 's songs fire up late ' 80s , early ' 90s nostalgia for us in the same way as double denim and Hypercolor t-shirts . Mention his name in conversation and ' video games ' are unlikely to come up . Nintendo fans might be able to dredge up the trivia nugget that he ( and his trademark glasses ) inspired his namesake Koopa Kid courtesy of Nintendo of America 's English translation of Super Mario Bros. 3 , but the musician was from a different generation ; an analogue generation . Owing to the fact he 'd been dead for four years at the time of production , a spectral Orbison appears in the ' I Drove All Night ' video via snippets of distorted archival footage while Jason Priestley and Jennifer Connelly cavort in moody monochrome . An impossibly attractive couple \u2013 the objects of approximately 98 % of teenage crushes of the era \u2013 Priestley does his best James Dean impression behind the wheel as he drives to meet Connelly in the middle of the desert . On arrival , the two young stars then frolic on the car bonnet and other locations , generally enjoying each other 's company for the rest of the song . As we took this nostalgia trip and cursed the ravages of Mother Time , we suddenly bolted upright at a brief shot of a van the two lovers ride past , spilling our coffee as we did a cartoon - style double - take . No , it could n't be . Grabbing the remote we hit rewind just to make sure and there it was , plain as day : Skip to 3:14 in the video to see for yourself . For some reason \u2013 for the briefest of moments \u2013 Roy Orbison was plugging Super Mario Bros . from beyond the grave . Other split-second references occur throughout the video : This is perplexing for multiple reasons . Even if he was an avid gamer ( which seems unlikely ) , of all the potential artists that might have prompted early ' 90s kids to race down to their nearest gaming emporium and pick up the latest release , Roy ' Only - the - Lonely ' Orbison would have been very low down the list \u2013 somewhere between Ringo Starr and your gran . We ca n't imagine his seal of approval being the envy of consumer electronics brands in any decade , least of all the too- cool - for-school ' 90s . MC Hammer ? Perhaps . Vanilla Ice ? At a push , but Roy Orbison !? Too square , too operatic , and \u2013 frankly \u2013 too dead . Who on earth thought this would be a fruitful crossover for either party ? We had to know , and the rest of our morning was spent in search of an explanation . We should remember that this period was arguably ' peak ' Mario \u2013 or perhaps more accurately , peak Nintendo . The Super Mario Bros. Super Show ! was on TV , The Wizard had whipped up incredible levels of anticipation for Super Mario Bros . 3 before it landed in the US , and the summer of ' 91 saw the arrival of the Super Nintendo with Super Mario World ( PAL territories would have to wait until the following year ) . Sure , John Connor might have mocked the mainstream Nintendo kids in Terminator 2 while he skipped school and ripped off ATMs in his Public Enemy t-shirt , but he was being hunted by a liquid metal killing machine ; the average kid his age was Mario mad . Consequently , the plumber appeared in all sorts of places up until 1993 when the failure of the infamous Bob Hoskins live - action movie made Nintendo realise its brand could be damaged through hasty tie-ins . It put the brakes on such practices , and has arguably only recently begun branching out again with theme parks and animated movie deals . This haphazard approach to licencing presumably enabled MCA Records to get its hands on the plumber 's likeness to promote a compilation album that you may or may not be familiar with . Nintendo : White Knuckle Scorin ' is a very strange album , to say the least . Ten tracks long , it includes ' I Drove All Night ' and it , too , gets a reference in the video ( skip to 2:38 ) . While the cover could n't be more ' 90s if it tried , only the opening song by Jellyfish , ' Ignorance is Bliss ' , has any lyrical ties whatsoever to Super Mario . The remainder of the compilation is apparently made up of random tracks MCA Records had lying around the place , thrown onto a Nintendo -labelled disc because , well , those idiot kids will buy anything plastered with Mario 's face , wo n't they ?! Kotaku ran a short article on the album eight years back after Negative World posted some highlights , if they can be called such , of a short comic that came in the album sleeve . This comic weaves the song titles into a contrived narrative featuring Mario and friends . Each title is crowbarred awkwardly into one of the characters ' speech bubbles and , for the particularly slow reader , another character invariably drives the point home with a knowing ' Song cue ' . Closer examination of the comic reveals the ostensive reason for the entire endeavour \u2013 it 's an ill-conceived pro-literacy project . Set in Dinosaur Land , Yoshi and the Koopa Kids learn to read courtesy of Princess Peach ( or Toadstool here ) , while perennial loser Bowser subscribes to the mantra ' ignorance is bliss ' ( song cue ) . It 's complete nonsense but fascinating all - at-once ; a hodgepodge of ' 90s vernacular and a ( presumably mandated ) selection of hilariously inappropriate ' big ' words . For example , Princess Toadstool , the ' babe ' with the ' dynamite bod ' , stuffs magical spell book pages down her ' d\u00e9colletage ' . Head over to Negative World for a more thorough look at the liberties taken with your favourite video game characters , but suffice it to say , it 's utter rubbish . You 've got to hand it to whoever knocked this up , though ; effort has gone into this rubbish . Stringing together such woefully unrelated tracks in a Mario-branded pro-literacy wrapper was a thankless task . The result is an intriguing oddity from the height of Mario mania , for sure , but why exactly were these songs thrown together on the disc ? Were there no more fitting alternatives ? Sure , Dire Straits were a big deal at the time , but Mark Knopfler 's sombre reflection of a violent clash during the UK miner 's strike was even less likely to win over the target demographic than Roy 's contribution . Stranger still , Virgin Records \u2013 not MCA \u2013 held the rights to Orbison 's back catalogue , so getting this song on its Nintendo compilation involved work on MCA 's part , certainly more than simply sweeping the recording studio floor for random offcuts and B-sides . Examination of ' I Drove All Night 's ' single sleeve provides a vital clue . On the reverse we found the following dedication from Orbison 's wife : Bobby Brooks was Roy 's agent and friend . I am so pleased that Roy 's song , \u201c I Drove All Night \u201d pays tribute to Bobby 's memory . Roy always felt that children are our future . The work of the Bobby Brooks Foundation will promote literacy in children and ensure a more promising future for us all . The single features two ' B-sides ' , both by other artists taken from White Knuckle Scorin ' . Further investigation of this Bobby Brooks character uncovered a contemporary L.A. Times article from November 1991 highlighting the release of both the single and White Knuckle Scorin ' itself ( unfortunately , European readers may have trouble accessing the article due to geo-locking ) . Despite a few inaccuracies ( the article claims White Knuckle Scorin ' is \u201c a soundtrack album for a new Nintendo video game \u201d ) , it sheds some light on the thinking behind the project . Bobby Brooks was an agent for various artists ; 'a tremendous guy , a very funny man ' according to another of his clients , Eric Clapton . Brooks was tragically killed in the same 1990 helicopter crash that also claimed legendary guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan . According to the article , White Knuckle Scorin ' was the brainchild of MCA Chairman Al Teller \u2013 a somewhat confused attempt to fuse a tribute to the departed Brooks with a compilation album to ' tap the Nintendo youth market ' . In addition to playing Nintendo , literacy was apparently a cause close to Brooks ' heart and provided the album 's wholesome raison d'\u00eatre , with a cut of proceeds going to form a foundation in his honour . It seems that Bobby Brooks had worked ( in some capacity ) with the majority of the featured artists on the compilation ; the tangential link between this strange selection of songs . The peculiar dual role of ' Nintendo - branded album for the cool kids ' and tribute to Brooks seems to have left the album in an awkward no - man 's land , satisfying neither function . None of the songs are an obvious fit for the ' Nintendo youth ' demographic Al Teller was reportedly targeting , although it 's conceivable the two objectives were inextricable . If the Nintendo licence were contingent on the pro-literacy angle provided by the Brooks connection ( therefore limiting the tracks MCA had to work with ) , that would provide a reasonable explanation for this conceptually odd Nintendo tie - in that features veteran folk rockers Crosby , Stills & Nash rubbing shoulders with Sheena Easton , while Roy Orbison warbles \u201c I drove all night ... to make love to you \u201d . We all know sex sells , but really ? Which brings us back to the video . Perhaps MCA was contractually obliged to include Nintendo references in it or maybe stipulations from Virgin Records or Orbison 's widow prevented Mario from being jammed into every frame .

In the four years prior to this Act 's passage a dozen states had passed similar laws and guidance for state specific business purposes , and in the five years since the Act 's passing every other state has passed similar laws and legislation . What does it all mean , and in the end how can it benefit businesses , individuals and the nation or world as a whole ? The best way to answer a question like this is to take a look at the origins of the law , and understand the reasoning behind its passage and the passage of federal and state laws . Over 100 years ago , people were using Morse code and the telegraph to electronically accept contracts . An early validation of electronic signatures came from the New Hampshire Supreme Court in 1869 [ Howley v. Whipple , 48 N.H. 487 ] . \" It makes no difference whether [ the telegraph ] operator writes the offer or the acceptance in the presence of his principal and by his express direction , with a steel pen an inch long attached to an ordinary penholder , or whether his pen be a copper wire a thousand miles long . In either case the thought is communicated to the paper by the use of the finger resting upon the pen ; nor does it make any difference that in one case common record ink is used , while in the other case a more subtle fluid , known as electricity , performs the same office . \" But it was the invention of another wired box that brought electronic signatures into everyday usage . In the 1980 's companies and even some progressive individuals began using fax machines for high priority or time sensitive delivery of paper based documents . Today , the fax machine is a staple of the business world . Most people do not even consider the original hurdles this new medium created , nor do they consider its impact on the speed of communication and the advantages of its use . However in its infancy many of the same issues surrounding electronic communications and electronic signatures had to be resolved when utilizing the facsimile . When the first contract was signed and faxed it created the basis for the discussion of electronic signature validity . After all it was the first time someone could sign something , place it in a machine , send it from one phone line to another and deliver a digitally reproduced signature . The path this signature took was not controllable or traceable , and in most cases it traversed miles of wire before reaching its destination , so how could it be considered a valid signature ? The intentions of the signature were clear to everyone , but businesses wanted to know they could count on the validity of the signature , and if no one actually witnessed the action of one individual or of a corporation how could a business put any faith in it ? This of course caused quite a stir and in rapid fashion the courts ruled this signature carried the same validity as if the parties were standing in the room together . With this , the fax became standard operating procedure world - wide . The courts found validity in this method of signature capturing and businesses also felt secure in this method . Quite a leap of faith considering the complications initially caused by fax machines . Many people did n't realize that the original fax paper 's ink would vanish after a period of time and you had to make another copy of the fax using a copier if you wanted to store it permanently . Also many times the quality of the image was poor or barely legible , but businesses understood the intention and would consider it signed even if there was only a partially legible signature . So in essence you had a copy of a copy of a digital image , and even with so many loopholes for alteration and criminal malfeasance the fax still worked and business flourished . The business logic behind this thinking was easily justifiable . Before the fax machine , the contract could have been signed verbally between the sales person and the client , and then somewhere down the road a paper copy would have been signed and mailed . Many sales before the fax machine were consummated with a simple \u201c OK let 's do it \u201d comment over the phone . This drive to get business and make the wheels turn demonstrates the most vital point in an electronic communications based world , or for that matter in a digital world with no physical or direct contact , is most businesses can operate on trust . They provide a service to a customer and the customer trusts they will provide that service in a satisfactory manner , while the service provider trusts that the customer will pay for services rendered . Trust is not a new thing in business ; it was often indicated by a hand - shake or \u201c You have a deal \u201d , and that was all you needed to get a deal done . Has that changed today ? I believe the answer is no , but what about the courts , and their opinion on the validity of the electronic signature ? After all the courts ' goal is not just to keep the wheels turning and generate revenue , so why did they trust this type of signature and what was the legal question this signature answered ? This line of thinking brings us back to Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act ( \u201c ESIGN \u201d ) and the other federal and state guidelines . The Government Paperwork Elimination Act ( \u201c GPEA \u201d ) , Uniform Electronic Transactions Act ( \u201c UETA \u201d ) , sections within the Code of Federal Regulations ( \u201c CFR \u201d ) , as well as the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act ( \u201c ESIGN \u201d ) are all attempts by Congress , federal departments and the states to define the liability and validity of an electronic signature , and help the courts answer the questions about enforceability . So what exactly is an electronic signature ? Here are the definitions from laws important laws and government agencies . ESIGN Act Sec 106 definitions : ( 2 ) ELECTRONIC - The term `electronic ' means relating to technology having electrical , digital , magnetic , wireless , optical , electromagnetic , or similar capabilities . ( 4 ) ELECTRONIC RECORD - The term `electronic record ' means a contract or other record created , generated , sent , communicated , received , or stored by electronic means . ( 5 ) ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE - The term `electronic signature ' means an electronic sound , symbol , or process , attached to or logically associated with a contract or other record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record . GPEA Sec 1710 definitions : ( 1 ) ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE . \u2014 the term \" electronic signature \" means a method of signing an electronic message that \u2014 ( A ) identifies and authenticates a particular person as the source of the electronic message ; and ( B ) indicates such person 's approval of the information contained in the electronic message . UETA Sec 2 definitions : ( 5 ) \" Electronic \" means relating to technology having electrical , digital , magnetic , wireless , optical , electromagnetic , or similar capabilities . ( 6 ) \" Electronic agent \" means a computer program or an electronic or other automated means used independently to initiate an action or respond to electronic records or performances in whole or in part , without review or action by an individual . ( 7 ) \" Electronic record \" means a record created , generated , sent , communicated , received , or stored by electronic means . ( 8 ) \" Electronic signature \" means an electronic sound , symbol , or process attached to or logically associated with a record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record . Federal Reserve 12 CFR 202 definitions : refers to the ESIGN Act Commodity Futures Trading Commission 17 CFR Part 1 Sec. 1.3 definitions : ( tt ) Electronic signature means an electronic sound , symbol , or process attached to or logically associated with a record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record . Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Sec. 11.3 definitions : ( 5 ) Digital signature means an electronic signature based upon cryptographic methods of originator authentication , computed by using a set of rules and a set of parameters such that the identity of the signer and the integrity of the data can be verified . ( 7 ) Electronic signature means a computer data compilation of any symbol or series of symbols executed , adopted , or authorized by an individual to be the legally binding equivalent of the individual 's handwritten signature . These laws and guidelines merely provide for the legality of the electronic signature , and not the specific method or technology . Actually , Congress and the law left it to each of us to determine what method works best for our purpose when implementing an electronic signature capturing system . For example , an electronic signature could be a pen pad device connected to a computer where consumers can sign for products at the checkout counter . But for a business in California , trying to send a contract to Florida , pen pad devices are not practical and therefore the California business may choose a more Internet friendly implementation . It is this openness to technology that not only benefits businesses but also the consumers ; because in trying to comply with Sec. 101.b/c/d the business will strive to use a technology that best meets the needs of their specific business and consumers .

But as Peter Daszak , the head of the small non-profit organization \u2014 EcoHealth Alliance in New York City \u2014 found out in early July , the funding ca n't be used unless the organization meets what he says are absurd conditions . The demands , detailed in a letter from the NIH , are politically motivated , he says . To carry out its research , EcoHealth Alliance partners with the Wuhan Institute of Virology ( WIV ) in China , which has been at the centre of unfounded rumours that the COVID - 19 pandemic was caused by a coronavirus released from its laboratory . The NIH cancelled EcoHealth Alliance 's grant in April , days after US President Donald Trump told a reporter that the United States would stop funding work at the WIV . EcoHealth Alliance and Daszak have been working with Shi Zhengli , a virologist at the WIV , for more than 15 years . Since 2014 , an NIH grant has funded EcoHealth 's research in China , which involves collecting faeces and other samples from bats , and blood samples from people at risk of infection from bat-origin viruses . Scientific studies suggest that the SARS - CoV - 2 coronavirus most likely originated in bats , and research on the topic could be crucial to identifying other viruses that might cause future pandemics . The WIV is a subrecipient on the grant . The NIH makes seven demands of EcoHealth ; these were first reported by the Wall Street Journal this week , and have been viewed by Nature . The agency asks EcoHealth to obtain a vial of the SARS - CoV - 2 sample that was used by the WIV to determine the virus 's genetic sequence . It also requests that EcoHealth arranges an inspection of the WIV by US federal officials . Daszak calls the demands from the NIH \u201c heinous \u201d , and worries that the funding freeze is delaying vital work to identify and prevent the next pandemic . The NIH declined to comment , saying that the agency does not disclose internal deliberations on a specific grant . In an e-mail to Nature , Shi calls the NIH 's demands \u201c outrageous \u201d and echoes Daszak 's assertions that the agency 's demands are unrelated to the WIV 's collaboration with EcoHealth . Nature spoke with Daszak about being caught in the political cross-hairs . How have you been doing since your grant was suspended ? It 's just a very difficult and disappointing and worrisome time . I 've lost people that I know to COVID - 19 . It 's a bat-origin coronavirus . We should have been there trying to find out why this thing emerged . And right now I 'm sat in my house , looking out the window , unable to do this work , because the NIH has told us that it 's not appropriate . It 's extremely frustrating . What is the aim of the project that 's been affected ? We have specific aims : to go into rural regions of China to find bat-origin coronaviruses and determine which ones are high risk , then to work with local communities in rural China in five provinces . We target communities that are at high risk for viral ' spillover ' and see whether they 're getting infected \u2014 and then finally see whether people are getting sick from novel coronaviruses . How have you responded to the NIH 's letter ? We 've written to the NIH and said : we think that this is inappropriate and wrong for the following reasons . Please , allow us to continue this work . But I doubt they 're going to do that right now . How do you plan to continue your work ? The NIH have told us not to work on this project . Obviously , we 're not going to break any NIH rules . But we have an ongoing collaboration , we have data that we 've gathered over 15 years of working in China \u2014 5 years under a previous grant from the NIH \u2014 which have n't been published yet . So we need to carry on with that work . How is your work relevant to the pandemic today ? We estimate that every single day , somebody in China or in southeast Asia gets infected with a new bat coronavirus . Right now , somebody is walking around , and they might be developing the first signs of a cough from the next COVID . We fully intend to be an organization that helps to prevent the next pandemic . That is our mission . The NIH has asked you to obtain a vial of isolated SARS - CoV - 2 from the WIV . Did you work on the novel coronavirus during your project ? The grant is n't used to fund work on SARS - CoV - 2 . Our organization has not actually published any data on SARS - CoV - 2 . We work on bat coronaviruses that are out there in the wild and try to predict what the next one is . We do n't work on sequencing SARS - CoV - 2 . It 's absurd because it 's absolutely outside the remit of the work we do . Your grant has received widespread attention in the past few months . How has that been ? Conspiracy - theory outlets and politically motivated organizations have made Freedom of Information Act requests on our grants and all of our letters and e-mails to the NIH . We do n't think it 's fair that we should have to reveal everything we do . When you submit a grant , you put in all your best ideas . We do n't want to hand those over to conspiracy theorists for them to publish and ruin and make a mockery of . What are you most worried about ? We 're not a political organization .

But as Peter Daszak , the head of the small non-profit organization \u2014 EcoHealth Alliance in New York City \u2014 found out in early July , the funding ca n't be used unless the organization meets what he says are absurd conditions . The demands , detailed in a letter from the NIH , are politically motivated , he says . To carry out its research , EcoHealth Alliance partners with the Wuhan Institute of Virology ( WIV ) in China , which has been at the centre of unfounded rumours that the COVID - 19 pandemic was caused by a coronavirus released from its laboratory . The NIH cancelled EcoHealth Alliance 's grant in April , days after US President Donald Trump told a reporter that the United States would stop funding work at the WIV . EcoHealth Alliance and Daszak have been working with Shi Zhengli , a virologist at the WIV , for more than 15 years . Since 2014 , an NIH grant has funded EcoHealth 's research in China , which involves collecting faeces and other samples from bats , and blood samples from people at risk of infection from bat-origin viruses . Scientific studies suggest that the SARS - CoV - 2 coronavirus most likely originated in bats , and research on the topic could be crucial to identifying other viruses that might cause future pandemics . The WIV is a subrecipient on the grant . The NIH makes seven demands of EcoHealth ; these were first reported by the Wall Street Journal this week , and have been viewed by Nature . The agency asks EcoHealth to obtain a vial of the SARS - CoV - 2 sample that was used by the WIV to determine the virus 's genetic sequence . It also requests that EcoHealth arranges an inspection of the WIV by US federal officials . Daszak calls the demands from the NIH \u201c heinous \u201d , and worries that the funding freeze is delaying vital work to identify and prevent the next pandemic . The NIH declined to comment , saying that the agency does not disclose internal deliberations on a specific grant . In an e-mail to Nature , Shi calls the NIH 's demands \u201c outrageous \u201d and echoes Daszak 's assertions that the agency 's demands are unrelated to the WIV 's collaboration with EcoHealth . Nature spoke with Daszak about being caught in the political cross-hairs . How have you been doing since your grant was suspended ? It 's just a very difficult and disappointing and worrisome time . I 've lost people that I know to COVID - 19 . It 's a bat-origin coronavirus . We should have been there trying to find out why this thing emerged . And right now I 'm sat in my house , looking out the window , unable to do this work , because the NIH has told us that it 's not appropriate . It 's extremely frustrating . What is the aim of the project that 's been affected ? We have specific aims : to go into rural regions of China to find bat-origin coronaviruses and determine which ones are high risk , then to work with local communities in rural China in five provinces . We target communities that are at high risk for viral ' spillover ' and see whether they 're getting infected \u2014 and then finally see whether people are getting sick from novel coronaviruses . How have you responded to the NIH 's letter ? We 've written to the NIH and said : we think that this is inappropriate and wrong for the following reasons . Please , allow us to continue this work . But I doubt they 're going to do that right now . How do you plan to continue your work ? The NIH have told us not to work on this project . Obviously , we 're not going to break any NIH rules . But we have an ongoing collaboration , we have data that we 've gathered over 15 years of working in China \u2014 5 years under a previous grant from the NIH \u2014 which have n't been published yet . So we need to carry on with that work . How is your work relevant to the pandemic today ? We estimate that every single day , somebody in China or in southeast Asia gets infected with a new bat coronavirus . Right now , somebody is walking around , and they might be developing the first signs of a cough from the next COVID . We fully intend to be an organization that helps to prevent the next pandemic . That is our mission . The NIH has asked you to obtain a vial of isolated SARS - CoV - 2 from the WIV . Did you work on the novel coronavirus during your project ? The grant is n't used to fund work on SARS - CoV - 2 . Our organization has not actually published any data on SARS - CoV - 2 . We work on bat coronaviruses that are out there in the wild and try to predict what the next one is . We do n't work on sequencing SARS - CoV - 2 . It 's absurd because it 's absolutely outside the remit of the work we do . Your grant has received widespread attention in the past few months . How has that been ? Conspiracy - theory outlets and politically motivated organizations have made Freedom of Information Act requests on our grants and all of our letters and e-mails to the NIH . We do n't think it 's fair that we should have to reveal everything we do . When you submit a grant , you put in all your best ideas . We do n't want to hand those over to conspiracy theorists for them to publish and ruin and make a mockery of . What are you most worried about ? We 're not a political organization . We 're just trying to do good work to prevent pandemics . We 're feeling the pressure of a very aggressive administration in the US picking fights with a country where we happen to be collaborating . And it turns out that they decided that this issue and our work is going to be one of the angles of attack . That 's extremely unfortunate .

At the time , U.S. political and demographic developments were inspiring major changes in attitudes about , and approaches to , higher education . Prior to 1959 , there was just one national college - entrance testing program , a program that focused on identifying the most academically able students for admission to the nation 's selective universities . The remainder of college students were admitted either on the basis of scores earned on entrance exams offered by individual states or colleges or on the basis of family ties . In the late 1950s , large numbers of students were approaching college age and wanted to attend college . Financial aid to students was increasing , and most colleges desired increasing enrollments . It was in this environment that ACT 's founders established The American College Testing Program , Inc. , now known as ACT . ACT 's first testing program , the ACT Assessment , was designed to serve two purposes : As the nation 's view of education evolved to embrace lifelong learning , ACT 's programs and services have similarly grown and evolvedhelping people plan for , and assess , learning and training throughout their lives , while in school or the workplace . As a result , ACT has played an increasingly important role in the nation 's educational enterprise , by contributing to the scope of the nation 's educational vision and delivering programs that support that vision . In late 1996 , we changed our name from American College Testing to ACT ( pronounced In 2002 , we officially acknowledged our growing role in supporting both education and the workforce . A new corporate structure was announced , comprising two divisions : Education and Workforce Development . The new governance structure consists of a 14 - member Board of Directors , and the expanded advising structure retains the ACT State Organizations but now also includes two distinct Advisory Boards , one for each of the new divisions .

At the time , U.S. political and demographic developments were inspiring major changes in attitudes about , and approaches to , higher education . Prior to 1959 , there was just one national college - entrance testing program , a program that focused on identifying the most academically able students for admission to the nation 's selective universities . The remainder of college students were admitted either on the basis of scores earned on entrance exams offered by individual states or colleges or on the basis of family ties . In the late 1950s , large numbers of students were approaching college age and wanted to attend college . Financial aid to students was increasing , and most colleges desired increasing enrollments . It was in this environment that ACT 's founders established The American College Testing Program , Inc. , now known as ACT . ACT 's first testing program , the ACT Assessment , was designed to serve two purposes : As the nation 's view of education evolved to embrace lifelong learning , ACT 's programs and services have similarly grown and evolvedhelping people plan for , and assess , learning and training throughout their lives , while in school or the workplace . As a result , ACT has played an increasingly important role in the nation 's educational enterprise , by contributing to the scope of the nation 's educational vision and delivering programs that support that vision . In late 1996 , we changed our name from American College Testing to ACT ( pronounced In 2002 , we officially acknowledged our growing role in supporting both education and the workforce . A new corporate structure was announced , comprising two divisions : Education and Workforce Development . The new governance structure consists of a 14 - member Board of Directors , and the expanded advising structure retains the ACT State Organizations but now also includes two distinct Advisory Boards , one for each of the new divisions . These changes all undergird our ongoing commitment to providing information for transitions into both education and the world of work . In 2005 , the creation of ACT International , B.V. enabled us to build upon the services we had developed over the past five decades and to extend them to individuals and organizations throughout the world .

In the second half of the twentieth century , Americans were taught to see both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union as the greatest of evils . Hitler was worse , because his regime propagated the unprecedented horror of the Holocaust , the attempt to eradicate an entire people on racial grounds . Yet Stalin was also worse , because his regime killed far , far more people \u2014 tens of millions , it was often claimed \u2014 in the endless wastes of the Gulag . For decades , and even today , this confidence about the difference between the two regimes \u2014 quality versus quantity \u2014 has set the ground rules for the politics of memory . Even historians of the Holocaust generally take for granted that Stalin killed more people than Hitler , thus placing themselves under greater pressure to stress the special character of the Holocaust , since this is what made the Nazi regime worse than the Stalinist one . Discussion of numbers can blunt our sense of the horrific personal character of each killing and the irreducible tragedy of each death . As anyone who has lost a loved one knows , the difference between zero and one is an infinity . Though we have a harder time grasping this , the same is true for the difference between , say , 780,862 and 780,863 \u2014 which happens to be the best estimate of the number of people murdered at Treblinka . Large numbers matter because they are an accumulation of small numbers : that is , precious individual lives . Today , after two decades of access to Eastern European archives , and thanks to the work of German , Russian , Israeli , and other scholars , we can resolve the question of numbers . The total number of noncombatants killed by the Germans \u2014 about 11 million \u2014 is roughly what we had thought . The total number of civilians killed by the Soviets , however , is considerably less than we had believed . We know now that the Germans killed more people than the Soviets did . That said , the issue of quality is more complex than was once thought . Mass murder in the Soviet Union sometimes involved motivations , especially national and ethnic ones , that can be disconcertingly close to Nazi motivations . It turns out that , with the exception of the war years , a very large majority of people who entered the Gulag left alive . Judging from the Soviet records we now have , the number of people who died in the Gulag between 1933 and 1945 , while both Stalin and Hitler were in power , was on the order of a million , perhaps a bit more . The total figure for the entire Stalinist period is likely between two million and three million . The Great Terror and other shooting actions killed no more than a million people , probably a bit less . The largest human catastrophe of Stalinism was the famine of 1930 \u2013 1933 , in which more than five million people starved . Of those who starved , the 3.3 million or so inhabitants of Soviet Ukraine who died in 1932 and 1933 were victims of a deliberate killing policy related to nationality . In early 1930 , Stalin had announced his intention to \u201c liquidate \u201d prosperous peasants ( \u201c kulaks \u201d ) as a class so that the state could control agriculture and use capital extracted from the countryside to build industry . Tens of thousands of people were shot by Soviet state police and hundreds of thousands deported . Those who remained lost their land and often went hungry as the state requisitioned food for export . The first victims of starvation were the nomads of Soviet Kazakhstan , where about 1.3 million people died . The famine spread to Soviet Russia and peaked in Soviet Ukraine . Stalin requisitioned grain in Soviet Ukraine knowing that such a policy would kill millions . Blaming Ukrainians for the failure of his own policy , he ordered a series of measures \u2014 such as sealing the borders of that Soviet republic \u2014 that ensured mass death . In 1937 , as his vision of modernization faltered , Stalin ordered the Great Terror . Because we now have the killing orders and the death quotas , inaccessible so long as the Soviet Union existed , we now know that the number of victims was not in the millions . We also know that , as in the early 1930s , the main victims were the peasants , many of them survivors of hunger and of concentration camps . The highest Soviet authorities ordered 386,798 people shot in the \u201c Kulak Operation \u201d of 1937 \u2013 1938 . The other major \u201c enemies \u201d during these years were people belonging to national minorities who could be associated with states bordering the Soviet Union : some 247,157 Soviet citizens were killed by the NKVD in ethnic shooting actions . Advertisement In the largest of these , the \u201c Polish Operation \u201d that began in August 1937 , 111,091 people accused of espionage for Poland were shot . In all , 682,691 people were killed during the Great Terror , to which might be added a few hundred thousand more Soviet citizens shot in smaller actions . The total figure of civilians deliberately killed under Stalinism , around six million , is of course horribly high . But it is far lower than the estimates of twenty million or more made before we had access to Soviet sources . At the same time , we see that the motives of these killing actions were sometimes far more often national , or even ethnic , than we had assumed . Indeed it was Stalin , not Hitler , who initiated the first ethnic killing campaigns in interwar Europe . Until World War II , Stalin 's regime was by far the more murderous of the two . Nazi Germany began to kill on the Soviet scale only after the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in the summer of 1939 and the joint German - Soviet invasion of Poland that September . About 200,000 Polish civilians were killed between 1939 and 1941 , with each regime responsible for about half of those deaths . This figure includes about 50,000 Polish citizens shot by German security police and soldiers in the fall of 1939 , the 21,892 Polish citizens shot by the Soviet NKVD in the Katyn massacres of spring 1940 , and the 9,817 Polish citizens shot in June 1941 in a hasty NKVD operation after Hitler betrayed Stalin and Germany attacked the USSR . Under cover of the war and the occupation of Poland , the Nazi regime also killed the handicapped and others deemed unfit in a large - scale \u201c euthanasia \u201d program that accounts for 200,000 deaths . It was this policy that brought asphyxiation by carbon monoxide to the fore as a killing technique . Beyond the numbers killed remains the question of intent . Most of the Soviet killing took place in times of peace , and was related more or less distantly to an ideologically - informed vision of modernization . Germany bears the chief responsibility for the war , and killed civilians almost exclusively in connection with the practice of racial imperialism . Germany invaded the Soviet Union with elaborate colonization plans . Thirty million Soviet citizens were to starve , and tens of millions more were to be shot , deported , enslaved , or assimilated . Such plans , though unfulfilled , provided the rationale for the bloodiest occupation in the history of the world . The Germans placed Soviet prisoners of war in starvation camps , where 2.6 million perished from hunger and another half million ( disproportionately Soviet Jews ) were shot . A million Soviet citizens also starved during the siege of Leningrad . In \u201c reprisals \u201d for partisan action , the Germans killed about 700,000 civilians in grotesque mass executions , most of them Belarusians and Poles . At the war 's end the Soviets killed tens of thousands of people in their own \u201c reprisals , \u201d especially in the Baltic states , Belarus , and Ukraine . Some 363,000 German soldiers died in Soviet captivity . Hitler came to power with the intention of eliminating the Jews from Europe ; the war in the east showed that this could be achieved by mass killing . Within weeks of the attack by Germany ( and its Finnish , Romanian , Hungarian , Italian , and other allies ) on the USSR , Germans , with local help , were exterminating entire Jewish communities . By December 1941 , when it appears that Hitler communicated his wish that all Jews be murdered , perhaps a million Jews were already dead in the occupied Soviet Union . Most had been shot over pits , but thousands were asphyxiated in gas vans . From 1942 , carbon monoxide was used at the death factories Che\u0142mno , Be\u0142\u017cec , Sobib\u00f3r , and Treblinka to kill Polish and some other European Jews . As the Holocaust spread to the rest of occupied Europe , other Jews were gassed by hydrogen cyanide at Auschwitz - Birkenau . Overall , the Germans , with much local assistance , deliberately murdered about 5.4 million Jews , roughly 2.6 million by shooting and 2.8 million by gassing ( about a million at Auschwitz , 780,863 at Treblinka , 434,508 at Be\u0142zec , about 180,000 at Sobib\u00f3r , 150,000 at Che\u0142mno , 59,000 at Majdanek , and many of the rest in gas vans in occupied Serbia and the occupied Soviet Union ) . A few hundred thousand more Jews died during deportations to ghettos or of hunger or disease in ghettos . Another 300,000 Jews were murdered by Germany 's ally Romania . Most Holocaust victims had been Polish or Soviet citizens before the war ( 3.2 million and 1 million respectively ) . The Germans also killed more than a hundred thousand Roma . Advertisement All in all , the Germans deliberately killed about 11 million noncombatants , a figure that rises to more than 12 million if foreseeable deaths from deportation , hunger , and sentences in concentration camps are included . For the Soviets during the Stalin period , the analogous figures are approximately six million and nine million . These figures are of course subject to revision , but it is very unlikely that the consensus will change again as radically as it has since the opening of Eastern European archives in the 1990s . Since the Germans killed chiefly in lands that later fell behind the Iron Curtain , access to Eastern European sources has been almost as important to our new understanding of Nazi Germany as it has been to research on the Soviet Union itself . ( The Nazi regime killed approximately 165,000 German Jews . ) Apart from the inacessibilty of archives , why were our earlier assumptions so wrong ? One explanation is the cold war . Our wartime and postwar European alliances , after all , required a certain amount of moral and thus historical flexibility . In 1939 Germany and the Soviet Union were military allies . By the end of 1941 , after the Germans had attacked the Soviet Union and Japan the United States , Moscow in effect had traded Berlin for Washington . By 1949 , the alliances had switched again , with the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany together in NATO , facing off against the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies , including the smaller German Democratic Republic . During the cold war , it was sometimes hard for Americans to see clearly the particular evils of Nazis and Soviets . Hitler had brought about a Holocaust : but Germans were now our allies . Stalin too had killed millions of people : but the some of the worst episodes , taking place as they had before the war , had already been downplayed in wartime US propaganda , when we were on the same side . We formed an alliance with Stalin right at the end of the most murderous years of Stalinism , and then allied with a West German state a few years after the Holocaust . It was perhaps not surprising that in this intellectual environment a certain compromise position about the evils of Hitler and Stalin \u2014 that both , in effect , were worse \u2014 emerged and became the conventional wisdom . New understandings of numbers , of course , are only a part of any comparison , and in themselves pose new questions of both quantity and quality . How to count the battlefield casualties of World War II in Europe , not considered here ? It was a war that Hitler wanted , and so German responsibility must predominate ; but in the event it began with a German - Soviet alliance and a cooperative invasion of Poland in 1939 . Somewhere near the Stalinist ledger must belong the thirty million or more Chinese starved during the Great Leap Forward , as Mao followed Stalin 's model of collectivization . The special quality of Nazi racism is not diluted by the historical observation that Stalin 's motivations were sometimes national or ethnic . The pool of evil simply grows deeper . The most fundamental proximity of the two regimes , in my view , is not ideological but geographical . Given that the Nazis and the Stalinists tended to kill in the same places , in the lands between Berlin and Moscow , and given that they were , at different times , rivals , allies , and enemies , we must take seriously the possibility that some of the death and destruction wrought in the lands between was their mutual responsibility . What can we make of the fact , for example , that the lands that suffered most during the war were those occupied not once or twice but three times : by the Soviets in 1939 , the Germans in 1941 , and the Soviets again in 1944 ? The Holocaust began when the Germans provoked pogroms in June and July 1941 , in which some 24,000 Jews were killed , on territories in Poland annexed by the Soviets less than two years before . The Nazis planned to eliminate the Jews in any case , but the prior killings by the NKVD certainly made it easier for local gentiles to justify their own participation in such campaigns . As I have written in Bloodlands , where all of the major Nazi and Soviet atrocities are discussed , we see , even during the German - Soviet war , episodes of belligerent complicity in which one side killed more because provoked or in some sense aided by the other . Germans took so many Soviet prisoners of war in part because Stalin ordered his generals not to retreat . The Germans shot so many civilians in part because Soviet partisans deliberately provoked reprisals . The Germans shot more than a hundred thousand civilians in Warsaw in 1944 after the Soviets urged the locals to rise up and then declined to help them . In Stalin 's Gulag some 516,543 people died between 1941 and 1943 , sentenced by the Soviets to labor , but deprived of food by the German invasion . Were these people victims of Stalin or of Hitler ?

In the second half of the twentieth century , Americans were taught to see both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union as the greatest of evils . Hitler was worse , because his regime propagated the unprecedented horror of the Holocaust , the attempt to eradicate an entire people on racial grounds . Yet Stalin was also worse , because his regime killed far , far more people \u2014 tens of millions , it was often claimed \u2014 in the endless wastes of the Gulag . For decades , and even today , this confidence about the difference between the two regimes \u2014 quality versus quantity \u2014 has set the ground rules for the politics of memory . Even historians of the Holocaust generally take for granted that Stalin killed more people than Hitler , thus placing themselves under greater pressure to stress the special character of the Holocaust , since this is what made the Nazi regime worse than the Stalinist one . Discussion of numbers can blunt our sense of the horrific personal character of each killing and the irreducible tragedy of each death .

That question preoccupied Dr. Madhukar H. Trivedi , a professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas , after several of his patients , all suffering from serious depression , mentioned that they felt happier if they went for a walk . The patients in question were taking the widely prescribed antidepressants known as S.S.R.I. 's , for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , but not responding fully . They remained , by clinical standards , depressed . Dr. Trivedi and his colleagues began to wonder if adding a formal \u201c dose \u201d of exercise would increase their chances of getting better . Certainly the possibility was worth investigating . Clinical depression , as anyone who has experienced or watched a loved one struggle with the condition knows , can be stubbornly intractable . Even if patients have been taking an antidepressant for months , recovery rates tend to hover below 50 percent . In order to increase the odds of improvement , doctors frequently add a second treatment \u2014 often another drug , like lithium or an antipsychotic \u2014 to the S.S.R.I. regimen at some point , Dr. Trivedi said . Most patients ultimately require at least two concurrent treatments to achieve remission of their depression , he said . Studies have shown that these secondary drug treatments help an additional 20 to 30 percent of depressed patients to improve , but the medications can be expensive and have unpleasant side effects . Which prompted Dr. Trivedi to look to exercise . His investigation joins a growing movement among some physiologists and doctors to consider and study exercise as a formal medicine , with patients given a prescription and their progress monitored , as it would be if they were prescribed a pill . In this case , Dr. Trivedi and his collaborators , who included researchers at the Cooper Institute in Dallas , the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana and other institutions , recruited 126 people with depression who had been using S.S.R.I. 's for a minimum of two months , without achieving remission . None of the patients exercised . Dr. Trivedi and his colleagues divided these volunteers into two groups . One began a gentle aerobic exercise routine , under the tutelage of Cooper Institute researchers , which required them to burn a certain amount of calories per session , depending on their weight . How the subjects expended the energy was up to them . Some walked for about 10 minutes a day , on a treadmill or by strolling around the block , at a pace of three miles an hour . Others chose an equivalent easy cycling workout .

That question preoccupied Dr. Madhukar H. Trivedi , a professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas , after several of his patients , all suffering from serious depression , mentioned that they felt happier if they went for a walk . The patients in question were taking the widely prescribed antidepressants known as S.S.R.I. 's , for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , but not responding fully . They remained , by clinical standards , depressed . Dr. Trivedi and his colleagues began to wonder if adding a formal \u201c dose \u201d of exercise would increase their chances of getting better . Certainly the possibility was worth investigating . Clinical depression , as anyone who has experienced or watched a loved one struggle with the condition knows , can be stubbornly intractable . Even if patients have been taking an antidepressant for months , recovery rates tend to hover below 50 percent . In order to increase the odds of improvement , doctors frequently add a second treatment \u2014 often another drug , like lithium or an antipsychotic \u2014 to the S.S.R.I. regimen at some point , Dr. Trivedi said . Most patients ultimately require at least two concurrent treatments to achieve remission of their depression , he said . Studies have shown that these secondary drug treatments help an additional 20 to 30 percent of depressed patients to improve , but the medications can be expensive and have unpleasant side effects . Which prompted Dr. Trivedi to look to exercise . His investigation joins a growing movement among some physiologists and doctors to consider and study exercise as a formal medicine , with patients given a prescription and their progress monitored , as it would be if they were prescribed a pill . In this case , Dr. Trivedi and his collaborators , who included researchers at the Cooper Institute in Dallas , the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana and other institutions , recruited 126 people with depression who had been using S.S.R.I. 's for a minimum of two months , without achieving remission . None of the patients exercised . Dr. Trivedi and his colleagues divided these volunteers into two groups . One began a gentle aerobic exercise routine , under the tutelage of Cooper Institute researchers , which required them to burn a certain amount of calories per session , depending on their weight . How the subjects expended the energy was up to them . Some walked for about 10 minutes a day , on a treadmill or by strolling around the block , at a pace of three miles an hour . Others chose an equivalent easy cycling workout . The second group was more energetic , walking briskly for about 30 minutes a day at a pace of four miles an hour , or the cycling equivalent , a regimen that meets the current exercise recommendations from the American College of Sports Medicine . Each volunteer exercised for four months , while continuing to take an antidepressant . At the end of that time , according to the study published recently in The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry , 29.5 percent had achieved remission , \u201c which is a very robust result , \u201d Dr. Trivedi said , equal to or better than the remission rates achieved using drugs as a back - up treatment . \u201c I think that our results indicate that exercise is a very valid treatment option \u201d for people whose depression has n't yielded to S.S.R.I.

The bombing came just a week after security forces arrested the Indonesian wife -- Istiada Oemar Sovie and her two boys ages six and eight -- of a Jemaah Islamiya militant , Dulmatin , in Jolo island . North Cotabato Provincial Police Chief Federico Dulay said the bomb , believed to be made from an 88 mm mortar shell , went off at about 8 p.m. in front of the town hall of Makilala town in the southern part of the province . \" Clearly this is a terrorist act , \" Dulay said .

Whichever way you look at it , however , the administration loses . Of the 136 Saudi detainees originally held as the \" worst of the worst , \" 107 have now been released ( 45 in the last four months alone ) . Removing from these figures the three men who died , this means that just 26 Saudi detainees remain in Guant\u00e1namo . Drawing on the research I conducted for my book The Guant\u00e1namo Files : The Stories of the 774 Detainees in America 's Illegal Prison - and additional information released by the Pentagon just two months ago - I can reveal exclusively that the stories of these men do nothing to bolster the administration 's claims , first voiced nearly six years ago , that those detained in the \" War on Terror \" were so uniquely dangerous that it was worth breaking domestic and international law , shredding the Constitution , abandoning the Geneva Conventions and introducing torture as official US policy to hold them without charge or trial - potentially forever - in conditions that are worse than those endured by the most hardened convicted criminals on the US mainland . Of the 14 men , seven - five humanitarian aid workers and two missionaries - had no connection whatsoever with any kind of militancy . The first of the missionaries , 24 - year old Khalid al - Bawardi , who pompously lectured his tribunal about the finer details of Sunni Islamic practice , explained that he had traveled around Pakistan and Afghanistan hectoring his fellow Muslims for their failings - mainly to do with raised graves and good luck charms - and had been handed over to US forces by opportunistic border guards , after crossing into Pakistan after the US - led invasion began . The second , 26 - year old Sultan al - Uwaydah , did not take part in any of the tribunals or review boards in which , though deprived of legal representation and subject to secret evidence obtained through torture , coercion or bribery , the detainees were at least allowed to present their stories . Looking at the \" evidence \" presented by the administration , however , his explanation for being in Afghanistan - that he traveled to \" teach the Koran to poor and disadvantaged Muslims , \" and that he duly taught the Koran to children in various locations , before hooking up with his uncle in Khost and escaping to Pakistan , where he was arrested - was severely at odds with the authorities ' version . This other scenario included an allegation that he was \" arrested after crossing into Pakistan from Afghanistan with 30 other persons suspected of being Osama bin Laden bodyguards , \" and other allegations , from various sources , including \" a senior al - Qaeda operative , \" that purported to reinforce this notion that he was one of 30 bodyguards for bin Laden . Noticeably , however , it has been established that the bodyguard story was concocted by a fellow detainee , Mohammed al - Qahtani , the alleged \" 20th hijacker \" on 9/11 , during the four months that he was tortured in Guant\u00e1namo in late 2002 , and it 's difficult , therefore , to lend much credence to all the other unsubstantiated allegations . Of the five humanitarian aid workers , the most complete story was told by 28 - year old Mohammed al - Harbi , whose release was clearly long overdue . A successful grocer in Saudi Arabia , al - Harbi batted away an allegation that he was a mujahideen fighter in Kandahar , insisting that he had never been to Afghanistan , and explaining that he traveled to Pakistan in November 2001 to deliver nearly $ 12,000 to those in need of humanitarian aid . Adding that he was only planning to stay for a few weeks at most , because his wife was pregnant at the time , he proceeded to explain that \" The Pakistani police sold me for money to the Americans , \" even though \" I had a return ticket home and it was clear I was n't planning to stay or ever cross into Afghanistan . \" He added that , although the Saudi authorities intervened to help him while he was in custody in Pakistan , the ISI ( the Pakistani intelligence services ) deliberately hid his passport , presumably to protect the reward money they were receiving from the Americans , who were paying an average of $ 5,000 a head for al - Qaeda and Taliban suspects . The story of the second aid worker , 28 - year old Sa'id al - Shihri , was unknown until the Pentagon released its new batch of documents in September . According to the government 's own \" evidence , \" al- Shihri decided to do charity work in Pakistan after hearing a speech by a sheikh in his local mosque . Twelve days after 9/11 , he flew to Pakistan , and then \" traveled with an Afghan driver , another Saudi man who worked with the Red Crescent , and a member from the Saudi embassy in Pakistan , \" in a vehicle taking supplies to a refugee camp near the Afghan border between Spin Boldak and Quetta . Wounded in a bombing raid , he was taken to a Red Crescent hospital in Quetta , where he and four others stayed for a month and a half , \" awaiting a plane to come and take them back to Saudi Arabia . However , when they were moved from the hospital they were put on a plane and taken to Kandahar , \" to the US prison at the airport , where al - Shihri stayed for ten days before being flown to Guant\u00e1namo . To counter this detailed and non-military explanation for al - Shihri 's presence on the Afghan border , the authorities managed to come up with nothing more than a few wildly tangential allegations : that he \" trained in urban warfare at the Libyan Camp north of Kabul , \" and , even more improbably , that , according to \" an individual , \" he \" instigated him and another person to assassinate a writer , \" based on a fatwa issued by a radical sheikh . The other three aid workers were involved with the Saudi charity al - Wafa , whose headquarters were in Kabul . Blacklisted two weeks after 9/11 and regarded as a front for al - Qaeda , dozens of detainees were tarred as terrorists because of their association with the charity , even though humanitarian aid was clearly the main focus of the organization . 27 - year old Zaid al - Husain al- Ghamdi , who traveled to Afghanistan in July 2001 , was declared an \" enemy combatant \" after his tribunal in October 2004 on the basis of three particularly thin allegations : that he was a member of al - Wafa , that he \" carried a weapon in Afghanistan , \" and that he was \" present and wounded during military operations at Khost \" in December 2001 . These allegations were augmented in the years that followed , but nothing about these additional claims suggests that they were reliable . The authorities alleged that he \" was identified \" as the \" occasional leader \" of a group of fighters in the northern city of Taloqan , but ignored another narrative that could be pieced together from other statements : that al - Ghamdi reported that he left home \" to provide help for the refugees in Afghanistan , \" that he worked for al - Wafa as a laborer in Kabul , and that he traveled to Taloqan because , after approaching Taliban representatives in Kabul to find out \" places needing assistance with orphans , \" he had been told that Taloqan was a suitable area . The additional information compiled by the authorities also provided an explanation of the circumstances of his capture , which contradicted the claim that he was \" wounded during military operations . \" After fleeing to Khost , al - Ghamdi said that he \" stopped in the first Taliban center he came to , \" which was subsequently bombed . Injured and \" rendered unconscious , \" he awoke in a hospital in Miram Shah , in Pakistan , where he was arrested and transferred to US custody . The stories of the other two were unknown until this September , because they did not take part in any tribunals or review boards , and the Pentagon had not released any of the \" evidence \" against them . Al - Wafa litters the story of 23 - year old Jabir al - Qahtani , but none of the allegations come close to any evidence of militant activity . By the time of his last administrative review , all the authorities had managed to come up with were allegations that he traveled to Lahore in March 2001 , \" with his travel partly financed by the head of al - Wafa , \" that he worked in a warehouse in Lahore for six months , and that he then moved to a warehouse in Kabul . Captured by the Northern Alliance in November 2001 , he was held for four months before being turned over to US forces . With only one dubious allegation of militancy - that he \" was identified as a fighter who preferred to spend most of his time lounging around [ various ] guest houses \" - the authorities resorted to alleging that he \" depicts ( sic ) many counter - interrogation techniques attributed to al - Qaeda training and consistent with al - Qaeda members , \" and that , in Guant\u00e1namo , he \" was identified as the leader of a cell block , and has issued a fatwa on the United States . \" A more shocking set of allegations was leveled against 35 - year old Abdullah al - Wafi al - Harbi . He told his interrogators that he traveled to Afghanistan via Iran , three weeks after 9/11 , and that , when he reached the border and told the guards that \" he had come to Afghanistan to assist in humanitarian efforts , \" they \" informed him about a group called al - Wafa and advised him to join the group if he wished to help the poor . \" After two weeks in Kabul - in other words , when the US - led invasion of Afghanistan began - he said that \" he was told by the Afghanis that they had to leave because there was a problem with Arabs , \" and explained that representatives of al - Wafa provided him \" with directions on how to leave Afghanistan . \" He then traveled by taxi , with three other men , to Khost , where they stayed for a month before crossing into Pakistan , where he was arrested . Ranged against this account was a bewildering array of unsubstantiated allegations : that he \" was identified as an experienced fighter who allegedly fought against the Russians in Afghanistan and Bosnia ( sic ) , \" and that various \" sources \" claimed that he attended the Khaldan training camp in Afghanistan , that he was \" well known by clerics and imams in Saudi Arabia as a recruiter and fundraiser for jihad , \" and that he , along with others from Mecca , who were known as \" the Mecca Group , \" \" ate with Osama bin Laden while at Tora Bora . \" Another unidentified \" individual \" made the astonishing claim that al - Harbi told him that several of the 9/11 hijackers \" stayed at his house during Haj , possibly in 1999 . \" Another \" source \" said that al - Harbi \" told him he had lied to interrogators \" in Kandahar , claiming to work for al - Wafa \" rather than admitting to fighting in the jihad , \" even though this was directly contradicted by the next allegation from another \" source , \" who stated that he was \" ranked high in al - Wafa . \" Of the seven men who fought with the Taliban , three of the stories appear fairly straightforward , although two of the men - 26 - year old Turki al - Asiri and 19 - year old Nayif al - Nukhaylan - did not take part in any tribunals or review boards . Al - Asiri was accused of answering a fatwa urging support for the Taliban , of training at al - Farouq ( the main camp for Arabs , associated with Osama bin Laden ) , and of fleeing , via Tora Bora , from Jalalabad to Pakistan , where he was arrested . Al - Nukhaylan , who was also accused of attending al - Farouq , apparently received additional training at a Moroccan camp in Jalalabad , where he was wounded in a US air strike and spent some time in a coma in an Afghan hospital . The third man , 25 - year old Fahd al - Sharif , who had been a policeman in Mecca , apparently remained seduced by the jihadist fantasies that had been used to recruit him . He told his review board that he traveled to Afghanistan in 2000 \" for the purpose of jihad with the Taliban government \" and that he hoped to become a martyr , but added that he went only to fight the Northern Alliance , \" to help thousands of millions of Afghan Muslims to return their hopes , their countries and their lives . \" The stories of two other willing recruits are notable only because of the additional allegations that mounted up against them . 29 - year old Hani al - Khalif , who had served as a soldier in the Saudi army during the Gulf War , explained that he wanted to fight in Chechnya , which was \" a greater jihad , \" because \" the fight was not against other Muslims as in Afghanistan , \" but was unable to arrange travel to Chechnya , and settled on Afghanistan instead , where he trained at al - Farouq , and then fought on the front lines against the Northern Alliance until he was ordered to surrender to General Dostum , one of the Alliance leaders . Despite the coherence of this narrative arc , however , it was also alleged that \" a senior al - Qaeda operative \" identified him as the leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group in Karachi , Pakistan . The story of 29 - year old Faha Sultan was unknown until just two months ago . After responding to a fatwa , he traveled to Afghanistan in January 2001 , and was identified as having worked in a distribution center . Less reliable was an allegation that he was \" identified as a friend of a senior al - Qaeda leader and had a good relationship with another individual who was a close associate of the senior al - Qaeda leader , \" because it was also stated that , as long ago as July 2002 , \" a foreign delegation \" - presumably Saudi intelligence - identified him as being \" of low law enforcement and low intelligence value . \" The stories of the last two Taliban recruits are particularly depressing , not because of their military recruitment , which followed a well - established pattern , but because of what happened to them in Guant\u00e1namo . Yousef al - Shehri was just 16 years old when he was captured by Northern Alliance soldiers , in a group of around 120 fighters , after the surrender of the northern Afghan city of Kunduz in November 2001 . Although dozens of juveniles have been held at Guant\u00e1namo , the US administration ( as one of only two nations that has refused to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child ) has , with only a few exceptions , pointedly refused to recognize that all juveniles - even \" child soldiers \" - should be treated differently from adults , and al - Shehri was not one of the exceptions . His suffering became particularly pronounced when he took part in a prison - wide hunger strike , which involved at least 200 detainees , in the summer of 2005 . In July 2005 , and again in January 2006 , his weight , which had been 141 pounds when he arrived at Guant\u00e1namo in February 2002 , dropped to just 97 pounds , and his lawyers , who visited him in October 2005 , said that he was \" emaciated and had lost a disturbing amount of weight , \" adding that he was \" visibly weak and frail \" and \" had difficulty speaking because of lesions in his throat that were a result of the involuntary force - feeding \" to which he had been subjected . Murtadha Makram , who was 25 years old when he was captured , was an even more committed long - term hunger striker . A Taliban recruit who spent 16 months in Afghanistan and was seized after crossing into Pakistan , Makram was force - fed from October 2005 to January 2006 , when his weight , which had been 142 pounds when he arrived in Guant\u00e1namo , fell at one point to just 87 pounds . After resuming his hunger strike later in the year , he was then force - fed from November onwards . In March 2007 , when detailed notes about the ongoing hunger strikes - compiled by the imprisoned al - Jazeera cameraman Sami al - Haj - were declassified , al - Haj explained that Makram \" has tried to kill himself many times . He last tried to do this on May 18 , 2006 . Now he is on a hunger strike to try to kill himself . He has been without food for three months and is being force - fed . \" Though no one in the administration has admitted it , it 's plausible that Makram was released in this latest batch of detainees because of fears that his desire to kill himself was close to becoming another PR - damaging reality . In conclusion , though many readers may have no sympathy for the suffering of Taliban recruits ( whether on hunger strike or not ) , the unpalatable truth is that force - feeding competent prisoners against their will is widely considered illegal , and is only being undertaken because otherwise Guant\u00e1namo would be filled with emaciated corpses . The reason for these men 's despair - which is such that many have sought to end their lives , even though Islam prohibits suicide - is , quite simply , the intolerable burden of indefinite detention without charge or trial , which is unique to Guant\u00e1namo and the administration 's secret prisons . In the cases of the innocent men described above , this is clearly a moral outrage and a colossal miscarriage of justice , but even in the cases of the Taliban foot soldiers , who , lest we forget , traveled to Afghanistan before 9/11 to take part in an inter - Muslim civil war , it has yet to be demonstrated that the administration 's flight from domestic and international law has been justified . After depriving these men of the protections of the Geneva Conventions , refusing to allow them to challenge the basis of their detention and interrogating them for nearly six years , the administration 's decision to release them , though clearly affected by diplomacy , also suggests that , in the end , their knowledge of al - Qaeda and 9/11 was , effectively , non-existent .","annotations":[{"text":"the Saudi government","span":[199,218],"token_span":[38,40],"role":"Crime_jurisdiction","label":"Crime_jurisdiction","role_definition":"The jurisdiction (generally a nation) to which the Suspect is sent."},{"text":"Guant\u00e1namo","span":[269,278],"token_span":[50,50],"role":"Current_jurisdiction","label":"Current_jurisdiction","role_definition":"The jurisdiction (generally a nation) the Suspect starts off in."},{"text":"the US administration","span":[299,319],"token_span":[56,58],"role":"Authorities","label":"Authorities","role_definition":"The Authorities act on behalf of the Current_jurisdiction, giving up the Suspect to the Crime_jurisdiction."},{"text":"US","span":[303,304],"token_span":[57,57],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the extradition occurs."},{"text":"14 Saudi detainees","span":[338,355],"token_span":[61,63],"role":"Suspect","label":"Suspect","role_definition":"The Suspect is forced to go to the jurisdiction where a crime he or she is suspected of took place or is being tried."},{"text":"Saturday","span":[360,367],"token_span":[65,65],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the Suspect is moved."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"2007-07-15 00516 Ghanim Abdul Rahman Al Harbi Repatriated to Saudi custody , with fifteen other men , on July 16 , 2007 . 2007-02-20 00536 Mohamed Abdullah Al Harbi Released with thirteen other men on November 12 , 2007 .","annotations":[{"text":"to Saudi custody","span":[58,73],"token_span":[8,10],"role":"Crime_jurisdiction","label":"Crime_jurisdiction","role_definition":"The jurisdiction (generally a nation) to which the Suspect is sent."},{"text":"Ghanim Abdul Rahman Al Harbi","span":[17,44],"token_span":[2,6],"role":"Suspect","label":"Suspect","role_definition":"The Suspect is forced to go to the jurisdiction where a crime he or she is suspected of took place or is being tried."},{"text":"fifteen other men","span":[82,98],"token_span":[13,15],"role":"Suspect","label":"Suspect","role_definition":"The Suspect is forced to go to the jurisdiction where a crime he or she is suspected of took place or is being tried."},{"text":"July 16 , 2007","span":[105,118],"token_span":[18,21],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the Suspect is moved."}],"trigger":{"text":"Repatriated","start_char":46,"end_char":56,"start_token":7,"end_token":7,"frame":"Extradition"}},"source":{"text":"Whether through a desire to impress the Supreme Court with its sense of justice prior to next month 's showdown over the detainees ' rights , or , as is more probable , through a placatory deal with the Saudi government following the death of a third Saudi detainee in Guant\u00e1namo in May this year , the US administration released another 14 Saudi detainees on Saturday . Whichever way you look at it , however , the administration loses . Of the 136 Saudi detainees originally held as the \" worst of the worst , \" 107 have now been released ( 45 in the last four months alone ) . Removing from these figures the three men who died , this means that just 26 Saudi detainees remain in Guant\u00e1namo . Drawing on the research I conducted for my book The Guant\u00e1namo Files : The Stories of the 774 Detainees in America 's Illegal Prison - and additional information released by the Pentagon just two months ago - I can reveal exclusively that the stories of these men do nothing to bolster the administration 's claims , first voiced nearly six years ago , that those detained in the \" War on Terror \" were so uniquely dangerous that it was worth breaking domestic and international law , shredding the Constitution , abandoning the Geneva Conventions and introducing torture as official US policy to hold them without charge or trial - potentially forever - in conditions that are worse than those endured by the most hardened convicted criminals on the US mainland . Of the 14 men , seven - five humanitarian aid workers and two missionaries - had no connection whatsoever with any kind of militancy . The first of the missionaries , 24 - year old Khalid al - Bawardi , who pompously lectured his tribunal about the finer details of Sunni Islamic practice , explained that he had traveled around Pakistan and Afghanistan hectoring his fellow Muslims for their failings - mainly to do with raised graves and good luck charms - and had been handed over to US forces by opportunistic border guards , after crossing into Pakistan after the US - led invasion began . The second , 26 - year old Sultan al - Uwaydah , did not take part in any of the tribunals or review boards in which , though deprived of legal representation and subject to secret evidence obtained through torture , coercion or bribery , the detainees were at least allowed to present their stories . Looking at the \" evidence \" presented by the administration , however , his explanation for being in Afghanistan - that he traveled to \" teach the Koran to poor and disadvantaged Muslims , \" and that he duly taught the Koran to children in various locations , before hooking up with his uncle in Khost and escaping to Pakistan , where he was arrested - was severely at odds with the authorities ' version . This other scenario included an allegation that he was \" arrested after crossing into Pakistan from Afghanistan with 30 other persons suspected of being Osama bin Laden bodyguards , \" and other allegations , from various sources , including \" a senior al - Qaeda operative , \" that purported to reinforce this notion that he was one of 30 bodyguards for bin Laden . Noticeably , however , it has been established that the bodyguard story was concocted by a fellow detainee , Mohammed al - Qahtani , the alleged \" 20th hijacker \" on 9/11 , during the four months that he was tortured in Guant\u00e1namo in late 2002 , and it 's difficult , therefore , to lend much credence to all the other unsubstantiated allegations . Of the five humanitarian aid workers , the most complete story was told by 28 - year old Mohammed al - Harbi , whose release was clearly long overdue . A successful grocer in Saudi Arabia , al - Harbi batted away an allegation that he was a mujahideen fighter in Kandahar , insisting that he had never been to Afghanistan , and explaining that he traveled to Pakistan in November 2001 to deliver nearly $ 12,000 to those in need of humanitarian aid . Adding that he was only planning to stay for a few weeks at most , because his wife was pregnant at the time , he proceeded to explain that \" The Pakistani police sold me for money to the Americans , \" even though \" I had a return ticket home and it was clear I was n't planning to stay or ever cross into Afghanistan . \" He added that , although the Saudi authorities intervened to help him while he was in custody in Pakistan , the ISI ( the Pakistani intelligence services ) deliberately hid his passport , presumably to protect the reward money they were receiving from the Americans , who were paying an average of $ 5,000 a head for al - Qaeda and Taliban suspects . The story of the second aid worker , 28 - year old Sa'id al - Shihri , was unknown until the Pentagon released its new batch of documents in September . According to the government 's own \" evidence , \" al- Shihri decided to do charity work in Pakistan after hearing a speech by a sheikh in his local mosque . Twelve days after 9/11 , he flew to Pakistan , and then \" traveled with an Afghan driver , another Saudi man who worked with the Red Crescent , and a member from the Saudi embassy in Pakistan , \" in a vehicle taking supplies to a refugee camp near the Afghan border between Spin Boldak and Quetta . Wounded in a bombing raid , he was taken to a Red Crescent hospital in Quetta , where he and four others stayed for a month and a half , \" awaiting a plane to come and take them back to Saudi Arabia . However , when they were moved from the hospital they were put on a plane and taken to Kandahar , \" to the US prison at the airport , where al - Shihri stayed for ten days before being flown to Guant\u00e1namo . To counter this detailed and non-military explanation for al - Shihri 's presence on the Afghan border , the authorities managed to come up with nothing more than a few wildly tangential allegations : that he \" trained in urban warfare at the Libyan Camp north of Kabul , \" and , even more improbably , that , according to \" an individual , \" he \" instigated him and another person to assassinate a writer , \" based on a fatwa issued by a radical sheikh . The other three aid workers were involved with the Saudi charity al - Wafa , whose headquarters were in Kabul . Blacklisted two weeks after 9/11 and regarded as a front for al - Qaeda , dozens of detainees were tarred as terrorists because of their association with the charity , even though humanitarian aid was clearly the main focus of the organization . 27 - year old Zaid al - Husain al- Ghamdi , who traveled to Afghanistan in July 2001 , was declared an \" enemy combatant \" after his tribunal in October 2004 on the basis of three particularly thin allegations : that he was a member of al - Wafa , that he \" carried a weapon in Afghanistan , \" and that he was \" present and wounded during military operations at Khost \" in December 2001 . These allegations were augmented in the years that followed , but nothing about these additional claims suggests that they were reliable . The authorities alleged that he \" was identified \" as the \" occasional leader \" of a group of fighters in the northern city of Taloqan , but ignored another narrative that could be pieced together from other statements : that al - Ghamdi reported that he left home \" to provide help for the refugees in Afghanistan , \" that he worked for al - Wafa as a laborer in Kabul , and that he traveled to Taloqan because , after approaching Taliban representatives in Kabul to find out \" places needing assistance with orphans , \" he had been told that Taloqan was a suitable area . The additional information compiled by the authorities also provided an explanation of the circumstances of his capture , which contradicted the claim that he was \" wounded during military operations . \" After fleeing to Khost , al - Ghamdi said that he \" stopped in the first Taliban center he came to , \" which was subsequently bombed . Injured and \" rendered unconscious , \" he awoke in a hospital in Miram Shah , in Pakistan , where he was arrested and transferred to US custody . The stories of the other two were unknown until this September , because they did not take part in any tribunals or review boards , and the Pentagon had not released any of the \" evidence \" against them . Al - Wafa litters the story of 23 - year old Jabir al - Qahtani , but none of the allegations come close to any evidence of militant activity . By the time of his last administrative review , all the authorities had managed to come up with were allegations that he traveled to Lahore in March 2001 , \" with his travel partly financed by the head of al - Wafa , \" that he worked in a warehouse in Lahore for six months , and that he then moved to a warehouse in Kabul . Captured by the Northern Alliance in November 2001 , he was held for four months before being turned over to US forces . With only one dubious allegation of militancy - that he \" was identified as a fighter who preferred to spend most of his time lounging around [ various ] guest houses \" - the authorities resorted to alleging that he \" depicts ( sic ) many counter - interrogation techniques attributed to al - Qaeda training and consistent with al - Qaeda members , \" and that , in Guant\u00e1namo , he \" was identified as the leader of a cell block , and has issued a fatwa on the United States . \" A more shocking set of allegations was leveled against 35 - year old Abdullah al - Wafi al - Harbi . He told his interrogators that he traveled to Afghanistan via Iran , three weeks after 9/11 , and that , when he reached the border and told the guards that \" he had come to Afghanistan to assist in humanitarian efforts , \" they \" informed him about a group called al - Wafa and advised him to join the group if he wished to help the poor . \" After two weeks in Kabul - in other words , when the US - led invasion of Afghanistan began - he said that \" he was told by the Afghanis that they had to leave because there was a problem with Arabs , \" and explained that representatives of al - Wafa provided him \" with directions on how to leave Afghanistan . \" He then traveled by taxi , with three other men , to Khost , where they stayed for a month before crossing into Pakistan , where he was arrested . Ranged against this account was a bewildering array of unsubstantiated allegations : that he \" was identified as an experienced fighter who allegedly fought against the Russians in Afghanistan and Bosnia ( sic ) , \" and that various \" sources \" claimed that he attended the Khaldan training camp in Afghanistan , that he was \" well known by clerics and imams in Saudi Arabia as a recruiter and fundraiser for jihad , \" and that he , along with others from Mecca , who were known as \" the Mecca Group , \" \" ate with Osama bin Laden while at Tora Bora . \" Another unidentified \" individual \" made the astonishing claim that al - Harbi told him that several of the 9/11 hijackers \" stayed at his house during Haj , possibly in 1999 . \" Another \" source \" said that al - Harbi \" told him he had lied to interrogators \" in Kandahar , claiming to work for al - Wafa \" rather than admitting to fighting in the jihad , \" even though this was directly contradicted by the next allegation from another \" source , \" who stated that he was \" ranked high in al - Wafa . \" Of the seven men who fought with the Taliban , three of the stories appear fairly straightforward , although two of the men - 26 - year old Turki al - Asiri and 19 - year old Nayif al - Nukhaylan - did not take part in any tribunals or review boards . Al - Asiri was accused of answering a fatwa urging support for the Taliban , of training at al - Farouq ( the main camp for Arabs , associated with Osama bin Laden ) , and of fleeing , via Tora Bora , from Jalalabad to Pakistan , where he was arrested . Al - Nukhaylan , who was also accused of attending al - Farouq , apparently received additional training at a Moroccan camp in Jalalabad , where he was wounded in a US air strike and spent some time in a coma in an Afghan hospital . The third man , 25 - year old Fahd al - Sharif , who had been a policeman in Mecca , apparently remained seduced by the jihadist fantasies that had been used to recruit him . He told his review board that he traveled to Afghanistan in 2000 \" for the purpose of jihad with the Taliban government \" and that he hoped to become a martyr , but added that he went only to fight the Northern Alliance , \" to help thousands of millions of Afghan Muslims to return their hopes , their countries and their lives . \" The stories of two other willing recruits are notable only because of the additional allegations that mounted up against them . 29 - year old Hani al - Khalif , who had served as a soldier in the Saudi army during the Gulf War , explained that he wanted to fight in Chechnya , which was \" a greater jihad , \" because \" the fight was not against other Muslims as in Afghanistan , \" but was unable to arrange travel to Chechnya , and settled on Afghanistan instead , where he trained at al - Farouq , and then fought on the front lines against the Northern Alliance until he was ordered to surrender to General Dostum , one of the Alliance leaders . Despite the coherence of this narrative arc , however , it was also alleged that \" a senior al - Qaeda operative \" identified him as the leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group in Karachi , Pakistan . The story of 29 - year old Faha Sultan was unknown until just two months ago . After responding to a fatwa , he traveled to Afghanistan in January 2001 , and was identified as having worked in a distribution center . Less reliable was an allegation that he was \" identified as a friend of a senior al - Qaeda leader and had a good relationship with another individual who was a close associate of the senior al - Qaeda leader , \" because it was also stated that , as long ago as July 2002 , \" a foreign delegation \" - presumably Saudi intelligence - identified him as being \" of low law enforcement and low intelligence value . \" The stories of the last two Taliban recruits are particularly depressing , not because of their military recruitment , which followed a well - established pattern , but because of what happened to them in Guant\u00e1namo . Yousef al - Shehri was just 16 years old when he was captured by Northern Alliance soldiers , in a group of around 120 fighters , after the surrender of the northern Afghan city of Kunduz in November 2001 . Although dozens of juveniles have been held at Guant\u00e1namo , the US administration ( as one of only two nations that has refused to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child ) has , with only a few exceptions , pointedly refused to recognize that all juveniles - even \" child soldiers \" - should be treated differently from adults , and al - Shehri was not one of the exceptions . His suffering became particularly pronounced when he took part in a prison - wide hunger strike , which involved at least 200 detainees , in the summer of 2005 . In July 2005 , and again in January 2006 , his weight , which had been 141 pounds when he arrived at Guant\u00e1namo in February 2002 , dropped to just 97 pounds , and his lawyers , who visited him in October 2005 , said that he was \" emaciated and had lost a disturbing amount of weight , \" adding that he was \" visibly weak and frail \" and \" had difficulty speaking because of lesions in his throat that were a result of the involuntary force - feeding \" to which he had been subjected . Murtadha Makram , who was 25 years old when he was captured , was an even more committed long - term hunger striker . A Taliban recruit who spent 16 months in Afghanistan and was seized after crossing into Pakistan , Makram was force - fed from October 2005 to January 2006 , when his weight , which had been 142 pounds when he arrived in Guant\u00e1namo , fell at one point to just 87 pounds . After resuming his hunger strike later in the year , he was then force - fed from November onwards . In March 2007 , when detailed notes about the ongoing hunger strikes - compiled by the imprisoned al - Jazeera cameraman Sami al - Haj - were declassified , al - Haj explained that Makram \" has tried to kill himself many times . He last tried to do this on May 18 , 2006 . Now he is on a hunger strike to try to kill himself . He has been without food for three months and is being force - fed . \" Though no one in the administration has admitted it , it 's plausible that Makram was released in this latest batch of detainees because of fears that his desire to kill himself was close to becoming another PR - damaging reality . In conclusion , though many readers may have no sympathy for the suffering of Taliban recruits ( whether on hunger strike or not ) , the unpalatable truth is that force - feeding competent prisoners against their will is widely considered illegal , and is only being undertaken because otherwise Guant\u00e1namo would be filled with emaciated corpses . The reason for these men 's despair - which is such that many have sought to end their lives , even though Islam prohibits suicide - is , quite simply , the intolerable burden of indefinite detention without charge or trial , which is unique to Guant\u00e1namo and the administration 's secret prisons . In the cases of the innocent men described above , this is clearly a moral outrage and a colossal miscarriage of justice , but even in the cases of the Taliban foot soldiers , who , lest we forget , traveled to Afghanistan before 9/11 to take part in an inter - Muslim civil war , it has yet to be demonstrated that the administration 's flight from domestic and international law has been justified .

How might it be conceptualised ? What do we know about it ? What do responses to the problem currently look like ? And finally , in what ways might psychology be able to contribute to this underexplored area ? ' He 'll scream and shout at me , awful abuse , absolutely awful abuse , he 'll throw things at me , he 'll punch holes in doors , he 'll threaten to hit me , and this 'll be all in front of my three little ones . ' ( Maddie ) The quote above is taken from a research project that was not intending to explore ' parent abuse ' , but to look at how parents manage children who are involved in ' offending ' . However , in many interviews with mothers and fathers who were talking about life with their teenage sons and daughters , parents told me about these harrowing experiences ( see Holt , 2009 ) . ' Parent abuse ' has been defined by Cottrell ( 2001 , p.3 ) as ' any harmful act of a teenage child intended to gain power and control over a parent . The abuse can physical , psychological , or financial . ' The term is useful in highlighting the abusive dynamic which appears to be at play in Maddie 's and other parents ' experiences , the effects of which have been found to be similar to the effects of other forms of family abuse ( e.g. child abuse and elder abuse ) . However , this term is not without its problems : the term ' parent ' hides the reality that it is most commonly ' mother ' who is the recipient of such abuse . Furthermore , the term ' abuse ' implicitly implies a ' perpetrator ' who is an ' abuser ' and this may not be an appropriate or helpful way of positioning somebody who is under 18 years of age . On the other hand , another frequently used term , child - to - parent violence ( or ' CPV ' ) , is perhaps too narrow , given that we are clearly talking about more than ' violence ' . We are also talking about more than children ' hitting out ' at parents , which in many ways may constitute ' normal ' child / teenage behaviour ( although it is debatable whether such normalisation is acceptable and at what point the ' normal ' becomes ' abusive ' ) . Other terms , such as mother abuse , adolescent violence towards parents and youth - to - parent abuse have also been suggested in the literature . But again , they are all somewhat inadequate both in terms of what they over - or under-emphasise and in the binaries of power which they imply . Such difficulties in ' naming ' highlight the complicated nature of the power relations involved in parent abuse . Given their access to economic , political and social capital , it could be persuasively argued that it is the parent who has significant power in this relationship . However , the increasing dominance of a discourse of children 's rights over the past two decades has meant that parents are increasingly feeling that their own parental rights are being subsumed ( Holt , 2011 ; Reece , 2009 ) . Indeed , it may be that any apparent increase in parent abuse is one consequence of the way in which government policy has increasingly framed the parent\u2013child relationship in adversarial terms . The issue is further complicated by the gendered power relations that frequently ( although not always \u2013 see below ) characterise parent abuse : for example , in their observations of restorative justice conferences , Daly and Nancarrow ( 2009 ) found that in many ways ( e.g. tactics of control , its cyclical nature ) son-to - mother abuse mirrors the dynamics involved in adult male - to - female domestic violence within the home . What do we know ? The prevalence of parent abuse is difficult to ascertain . Notwithstanding the definitional problems , neither the police nor the British Crime Survey records such incidents and , in any case , it is likely to be hugely underreported by parents themselves . Furthermore , despite the recognition of parent abuse among practitioners who work with families , there is surprisingly little research that has looked at it within the UK . In 2009 Parentline Plus reported that they received an average of 95 calls to the helpline every month from parents concerned about their child 's verbal and / or physical aggression towards them : 91 per cent of the callers were female , with the majority of children aged between 13 and 15 years . More directly , research predominantly from the US , Canada and Oceania has explored parent abuse , and a number of consistent findings have come up . In particular , Kennair and Mellor ( 2007 ) review the literature to suggest that it is predominantly mothers , lone parents and those parents facing significant social and family stressors who are most likely to experience physical , psychological and financial abuse from their children . The children are more likely to be teenage ( or the behaviour is more likely to be identified as ' abusive ' at that point ) and are more likely to have previously witnessed or experienced abuse or violence within the family home . They are also more likely to display significantly higher levels of ' oppositional ' or aggressive behaviour than their peers , with a lack of engagement in school a further correlative factor . However , it appears that social class , ethnicity and the gender of the child is not significant , although Kennair and Mellor ( 2007 ) report some evidence that physical abuse is more prevalent in boys . As mentioned , the effects of experiencing abuse from one 's child can be profound . In the short term , ongoing parent abuse has been found to impact on a parent 's and other family members ' physical and psychological health , with specific negative emotions such as fear , shame , guilt and despair commonly reported ( Cottrell & Monk , 2004 ) . These effects extend to the child in question , who may experience helplessness and isolation , and in the longer term , there are concerns over the ways in which this form of abuse may transfer to other targets or be reproduced by other family members who witness it . A factor that perhaps is unique to this kind of abuse is the ' culture of blame ' , which has intensified over the past decade in relation to parenting . There is much evidence that this cultural climate has shaped both parental and societal responses to the problematic behaviour of children and young people . Furthermore , the introduction of Parenting Orders in 1998 has formalised this culture of blame by making parents ' take responsibility ' for their children 's troublesome behaviour by issuing them with a court order , breaches of which can result in a summary conviction . This wider cultural and policy context may well have contributed to the sense that parents are in some way ' deserving victims ' and who therefore attract less sympathy and support in comparison to others ( e.g. children or elders ) who experience family abuse . Policy and practice responses One of the key features of parent abuse is the way in which the experience is silenced . In writing about parent abuse while in the process of researching other aspects of parenting , both Hunter et al. ( 2010 ) and I myself ( Holt , 2009 ) found parental experiences of stress and isolation , and that it was difficult for parents to articulate and ' name ' the experience ( which in itself is likely to contribute to experiences of stress and isolation ) . Furthermore , families and communities have been found to be unsupportive and in some cases may actively devalue parents ' painful experiences of parent abuse ( Edenborough et al. , 2008 ) . There is currently a lack of acknowledgement of parent abuse within social and public policy , meaning that parent abuse tends to be framed within already existing policy discourses that are ill-fitting for the problem in hand . A ' criminal justice response ' to parent abuse seems to be dominant in the UK , but the prospect of telephoning the police and pressing charges against their child is an option many parents will resist \u2013 not least because the outcome may be their own criminalisation in the form of a Parenting Order . Furthermore , any support that is offered alongside the criminalisation of child or parent is unlikely to be sufficient to adequately deal with the complexities of parent abuse . This is particularly so since youth justice support programmes tend to be offered to parents and children / young people separately , with little interaction between the two ( Youth Justice Board , 2010 ) . Other agencies , such as domestic violence agencies or child protection departments within social services , may be sources of support , but again there are likely to be complexities when dealing with children ( and adults ) who may be seen as both ' victims ' and ' victimisers ' , making both options problematic ( particularly as the agencies are likely to be already overwhelmed in responding to their own particular form of family abuse ) . Perhaps the most fruitful area for intervention work then is at the local level , where a number of different support agencies can focus specifically on ' parent abuse ' within its own community and structural context . One recent positive example is Brighton and Hove 's Break 4 Change programme , which combined the efforts of the local Youth Offending Team , the Targeted Youth Support Service , Rise ( a local domestic violence support service ) , the Family Intervention Project and support from Brighton Community CAMHS . The pilot support programme involved two parallel weekly sessions running for eight weeks \u2013 one for parents and one for young people aged 11\u201316 years . The programme was underpinned by a brief solution - focused therapeutic approach , and participants explored feelings of anger , blame and isolation , as well as strategies for change , including assertiveness , boundary - making , beliefs and self - care . Evaluation of the pilot programme found that it was successful in initiating change , with parents reporting a reduction in violence and isolation , and young people reporting increased empathy , reduced violence and increased satisfaction at home ( Munday , 2009 ) . Although it is yet unclear whether such changes can be maintained over the longer term , Break 4 Change is an inspiring case study which suggests that a non-punitive , multi-agency , whole - family approach is where thinking and practice should be heading . A role for psychology Clearly , new perspectives are required to help us to understand this troubling social problem . After all , if academics struggle to articulate and respond to the phenomenon , then one wonders how parents are able to do so \u2013 particularly those parents who are already facing multiple disadvantages and stressors . So , how might psychology help ? Three specific suggestions come to mind . Firstly , there is a need for new theoretical frameworks to enable us to conceptualise and understand ' parent abuse ' adequately \u2013 something that is yet to be achieved . This will require further research to highlight the intricacies of what is at play at an individual level , at a familial level and at a structural level , and a transdisciplinary approach may be the best way of teasing out how these levels intertwine . Such an approach is currently lacking : as in practice responses to parent abuse , there appears to be an over- preponderance of research and theoretical thinking at the criminological level . While useful , this risks inevitably constraining theoretical frameworks . I would argue that psychology , as a discipline that does not take a ' topic ' as its focus ( as criminology , social work and youth studies arguably do ) , is better placed to examine such complexities . However , this is going to be difficult for researchers in the current economic climate \u2013 and more so given that there are no robust data about the prevalence of the problem to draw on when making funding bids . Nevertheless , academics and practitioners from a range of subject disciplines have recently come together to create a UK research network ( see ' resources ' ) to enable discussion and to think about developing research and practice agendas , and I would encourage more psychologists to participate . Secondly , as the case study of Break 4 Change illustrates , there is also a role for psychology at a practice level in terms of supporting individuals , families and communities . Something as complex as parent abuse constitutes a key social problem where psychologists can draw on their specialist knowledge and skills across a number of specialisms ( including educational , health , clinical , occupational and counselling psychology ) and work together . Indeed , the programme that underpins Break 4 Change was developed by Eddie Gallagher , an Australian psychologist who has worked in family therapy and social work and has drawn on his work experience and psychological knowledge to develop specific resources for working with families characterised by parent abuse ( see ' resources ' ) . Finally , in the interests of balance , perhaps one response from which psychology might refrain is the current and seemingly knee - jerk reaction of attempting to isolate and identify ' risk factors ' in relation to parent abuse , whether of likely ' perpetrators ' or ' victims ' . Psychology has a rich history of responding positively to concerns about child and adolescent behaviour ( as well as parental behaviour ) using contextualising theoretical frameworks , dating back from Erikson 's work and the notion of ' identity crisis ' in adolescence . However , ' risk factors ' do not tell us anything about causation ( although they are often misunderstood as such ) and serve to decontextualise what is clearly a complex phenomenon upon which issues of power and violence , gender and masculinities , rights and responsibilities and structure and agency all rise and collapse into each other . Risk factors also work as a tool for blaming individuals , particularly by governments who have been known to cite particular marginalised groups ( e.g. ' lone parents ' ) or behaviours ( e.g. ' poor parenting ' ) as a ' risk factor ' to justify particularly pernicious policies ( as in the case of Parenting Orders in 1998 \u2013 see Holt , 2008 ) . This perhaps presents psychologists with a more critical role to play in informing policy makers about the ways in which government rhetoric can work to stigmatise families and individualise problems that are much more structurally complex , and can ultimately serve to exacerbate such problems . Clearly there is further debate to be had , and this article has only touched on some of the many complicated issues raised when conceptualising , researching and working with parent abuse . Nevertheless , from the little we do know , it would appear that psychology is very well placed to contribute a huge amount to help parents , families and communities to overcome the immediate and long - term effects of a problem that has been hidden for too long . - Amanda Holt Senior Lecturer in Criminal Psychology at the Institute of Criminal Justice Studies , University of Portsmouth [ email protected ] References Cottrell , B.

How might it be conceptualised ? What do we know about it ? What do responses to the problem currently look like ? And finally , in what ways might psychology be able to contribute to this underexplored area ? ' He 'll scream and shout at me , awful abuse , absolutely awful abuse , he 'll throw things at me , he 'll punch holes in doors , he 'll threaten to hit me , and this 'll be all in front of my three little ones . ' ( Maddie ) The quote above is taken from a research project that was not intending to explore ' parent abuse ' , but to look at how parents manage children who are involved in ' offending ' . However , in many interviews with mothers and fathers who were talking about life with their teenage sons and daughters , parents told me about these harrowing experiences ( see Holt , 2009 ) . ' Parent abuse ' has been defined by Cottrell ( 2001 , p.3 ) as ' any harmful act of a teenage child intended to gain power and control over a parent . The abuse can physical , psychological , or financial . ' The term is useful in highlighting the abusive dynamic which appears to be at play in Maddie 's and other parents ' experiences , the effects of which have been found to be similar to the effects of other forms of family abuse ( e.g. child abuse and elder abuse ) . However , this term is not without its problems : the term ' parent ' hides the reality that it is most commonly ' mother ' who is the recipient of such abuse . Furthermore , the term ' abuse ' implicitly implies a ' perpetrator ' who is an ' abuser ' and this may not be an appropriate or helpful way of positioning somebody who is under 18 years of age . On the other hand , another frequently used term , child - to - parent violence ( or ' CPV ' ) , is perhaps too narrow , given that we are clearly talking about more than ' violence ' . We are also talking about more than children ' hitting out ' at parents , which in many ways may constitute ' normal ' child / teenage behaviour ( although it is debatable whether such normalisation is acceptable and at what point the ' normal ' becomes ' abusive ' ) . Other terms , such as mother abuse , adolescent violence towards parents and youth - to - parent abuse have also been suggested in the literature . But again , they are all somewhat inadequate both in terms of what they over - or under-emphasise and in the binaries of power which they imply . Such difficulties in ' naming ' highlight the complicated nature of the power relations involved in parent abuse . Given their access to economic , political and social capital , it could be persuasively argued that it is the parent who has significant power in this relationship . However , the increasing dominance of a discourse of children 's rights over the past two decades has meant that parents are increasingly feeling that their own parental rights are being subsumed ( Holt , 2011 ; Reece , 2009 ) . Indeed , it may be that any apparent increase in parent abuse is one consequence of the way in which government policy has increasingly framed the parent\u2013child relationship in adversarial terms . The issue is further complicated by the gendered power relations that frequently ( although not always \u2013 see below ) characterise parent abuse : for example , in their observations of restorative justice conferences , Daly and Nancarrow ( 2009 ) found that in many ways ( e.g. tactics of control , its cyclical nature ) son-to - mother abuse mirrors the dynamics involved in adult male - to - female domestic violence within the home . What do we know ? The prevalence of parent abuse is difficult to ascertain . Notwithstanding the definitional problems , neither the police nor the British Crime Survey records such incidents and , in any case , it is likely to be hugely underreported by parents themselves . Furthermore , despite the recognition of parent abuse among practitioners who work with families , there is surprisingly little research that has looked at it within the UK . In 2009 Parentline Plus reported that they received an average of 95 calls to the helpline every month from parents concerned about their child 's verbal and / or physical aggression towards them : 91 per cent of the callers were female , with the majority of children aged between 13 and 15 years . More directly , research predominantly from the US , Canada and Oceania has explored parent abuse , and a number of consistent findings have come up . In particular , Kennair and Mellor ( 2007 ) review the literature to suggest that it is predominantly mothers , lone parents and those parents facing significant social and family stressors who are most likely to experience physical , psychological and financial abuse from their children . The children are more likely to be teenage ( or the behaviour is more likely to be identified as ' abusive ' at that point ) and are more likely to have previously witnessed or experienced abuse or violence within the family home . They are also more likely to display significantly higher levels of ' oppositional ' or aggressive behaviour than their peers , with a lack of engagement in school a further correlative factor . However , it appears that social class , ethnicity and the gender of the child is not significant , although Kennair and Mellor ( 2007 ) report some evidence that physical abuse is more prevalent in boys . As mentioned , the effects of experiencing abuse from one 's child can be profound . In the short term , ongoing parent abuse has been found to impact on a parent 's and other family members ' physical and psychological health , with specific negative emotions such as fear , shame , guilt and despair commonly reported ( Cottrell & Monk , 2004 ) . These effects extend to the child in question , who may experience helplessness and isolation , and in the longer term , there are concerns over the ways in which this form of abuse may transfer to other targets or be reproduced by other family members who witness it . A factor that perhaps is unique to this kind of abuse is the ' culture of blame ' , which has intensified over the past decade in relation to parenting . There is much evidence that this cultural climate has shaped both parental and societal responses to the problematic behaviour of children and young people . Furthermore , the introduction of Parenting Orders in 1998 has formalised this culture of blame by making parents ' take responsibility ' for their children 's troublesome behaviour by issuing them with a court order , breaches of which can result in a summary conviction . This wider cultural and policy context may well have contributed to the sense that parents are in some way ' deserving victims ' and who therefore attract less sympathy and support in comparison to others ( e.g. children or elders ) who experience family abuse . Policy and practice responses One of the key features of parent abuse is the way in which the experience is silenced . In writing about parent abuse while in the process of researching other aspects of parenting , both Hunter et al. ( 2010 ) and I myself ( Holt , 2009 ) found parental experiences of stress and isolation , and that it was difficult for parents to articulate and ' name ' the experience ( which in itself is likely to contribute to experiences of stress and isolation ) . Furthermore , families and communities have been found to be unsupportive and in some cases may actively devalue parents ' painful experiences of parent abuse ( Edenborough et al. , 2008 ) . There is currently a lack of acknowledgement of parent abuse within social and public policy , meaning that parent abuse tends to be framed within already existing policy discourses that are ill-fitting for the problem in hand . A ' criminal justice response ' to parent abuse seems to be dominant in the UK , but the prospect of telephoning the police and pressing charges against their child is an option many parents will resist \u2013 not least because the outcome may be their own criminalisation in the form of a Parenting Order . Furthermore , any support that is offered alongside the criminalisation of child or parent is unlikely to be sufficient to adequately deal with the complexities of parent abuse . This is particularly so since youth justice support programmes tend to be offered to parents and children / young people separately , with little interaction between the two ( Youth Justice Board , 2010 ) . Other agencies , such as domestic violence agencies or child protection departments within social services , may be sources of support , but again there are likely to be complexities when dealing with children ( and adults ) who may be seen as both ' victims ' and ' victimisers ' , making both options problematic ( particularly as the agencies are likely to be already overwhelmed in responding to their own particular form of family abuse ) . Perhaps the most fruitful area for intervention work then is at the local level , where a number of different support agencies can focus specifically on ' parent abuse ' within its own community and structural context . One recent positive example is Brighton and Hove 's Break 4 Change programme , which combined the efforts of the local Youth Offending Team , the Targeted Youth Support Service , Rise ( a local domestic violence support service ) , the Family Intervention Project and support from Brighton Community CAMHS . The pilot support programme involved two parallel weekly sessions running for eight weeks \u2013 one for parents and one for young people aged 11\u201316 years . The programme was underpinned by a brief solution - focused therapeutic approach , and participants explored feelings of anger , blame and isolation , as well as strategies for change , including assertiveness , boundary - making , beliefs and self - care . Evaluation of the pilot programme found that it was successful in initiating change , with parents reporting a reduction in violence and isolation , and young people reporting increased empathy , reduced violence and increased satisfaction at home ( Munday , 2009 ) . Although it is yet unclear whether such changes can be maintained over the longer term , Break 4 Change is an inspiring case study which suggests that a non-punitive , multi-agency , whole - family approach is where thinking and practice should be heading . A role for psychology Clearly , new perspectives are required to help us to understand this troubling social problem . After all , if academics struggle to articulate and respond to the phenomenon , then one wonders how parents are able to do so \u2013 particularly those parents who are already facing multiple disadvantages and stressors . So , how might psychology help ? Three specific suggestions come to mind . Firstly , there is a need for new theoretical frameworks to enable us to conceptualise and understand ' parent abuse ' adequately \u2013 something that is yet to be achieved . This will require further research to highlight the intricacies of what is at play at an individual level , at a familial level and at a structural level , and a transdisciplinary approach may be the best way of teasing out how these levels intertwine .

They now number about over two million people and live in a 404 - square - mile ( 1,050 \u00c2 k m2 ) homeland which they also refer to as Ogoni , or Ogoniland . They share common oil - related environmental problems with the Ijaw people of Niger Delta . The Ogoni rose to international attention after a massive public protest campaign against Shell Oil , led by the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People ( MOSOP ) , which is also a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization ( UNPO ) . The territory is located in Rivers State on the coast of the Gulf of Guinea , east of the city of Port Harcourt . It extends across the Local Government Areas ( LGAs ) of Khana , Gokana , Eleme and Tai . Traditionally , Ogoniland was divided into the six kingdoms : Babbe , Gokana , Ken - Khana , Nyo - Khana , Eleme and Tai. Nyo - Khana is on the East while Ken-Khana is on the west . The Ogoni people speak Ogoni languages , or Kegboid languages . According to Roger Blench \" Ogoni languages are considered to be part of Cross River , which in turn is part of Benue - Congo and then Niger -Congo . \" The Ogoni of River States speak the related , mutually intelligible languages of Khana , Gokana , Tae ( T\u00e1\u00ba\u00b9\u00e1\u00ba\u00b9 ) , Eleme , and Ban Ogoi . They fall into two clusters , with a limited degree of mutual intelligibility between members of each cluster . However , the Ogoni think of them as separate languages . The Eastern languages are Khana and T\u00e1\u00ba\u00b9\u00e1\u00ba\u00b9 , with a quarter million or so speakers , and Gokana , with about half that number . The Western languages are Eleme , with about 70,000 speakers , and Baan , with about a tenth that number . Ogoni language has drawn some attention from general linguists ; Hyman ( 1983 ) used examples from Gokana in developing his theories of the syllable . More recently , Bond and Anderson ( 2003 ) have compared logophoricity in the ' Ogonoid ' lects . Most striking , however is the presence of a series of numeral classifiers . Typical of many Asian language families , these are extremely rare in Africa , and their evolution therefore typologically extremely unusual . This monograph has two predecessors . Ikoro ( 1991 ) reconstructed ' Kegboid ' [ a name constructed from the initials of the four languages ( Kana , Eleme , Gokana , Baan ) at the time considered to be part of the group . V\u00e1 \u00bb bnu ( 2001 ) is not a reconstruction , but provides some valuable information on each dialect and a short comparative word list ( partially tone marked ) . V\u00e1 \u00bb bnu ( op. cit. ) also includes some cultural background and information on orthographic systems . According to oral tradition , the Ogoni people migrated from ancient Ghana down to the Atlantic coast eventually making their way over to the eastern Niger Delta . Linguistic calculations done by Kay Williamson place the Ogoni in the Niger Delta since before 15 BC , making them one of the oldest settlers in the eastern Niger Delta region . Radiocarbon dating taken from sites around Ogoniland and the neighboring communities oral traditions also support this claim . Traditionally , the Ogoni are agricultural , also known for livestock herding , fishing , salt and palm oil cultivation and trade . Like many peoples on the Guinea coast , the Ogoni have an internal political structure subject to community - by- community arrangement , including appointment of chiefs and community development bodies , some recognized by government and others not . They survived the period of the slave trade in relative isolation , and did not lose any of their members to enslavement . After Nigeria was colonized by the British in 1885 , British soldiers arrived in Ogoni by 1901 . Major resistance to their presence continued through 1914 . The Ogoni were integrated into a succession of economic systems at a pace that was extremely rapid and exacted a great toll from them . At the turn of the twentieth century , \u201c the world to them did not extend beyond the next three or four villages , \u201d but that soon changed . Ken Saro-Wiwa , the late president of MOSOP , described the transition this way : \u201c if you then think that within the space of seventy years they were struck by the combined forces of modernity , colonialism , the money economy , indigenous colonialism and then the Nigerian Civil War , and that they had to adjust to these forces without adequate preparation or direction , you will appreciate the bafflement of the Ogoni people and the subsequent confusion engendered in the society . \u201d The Ogoni are an agricultural and fishing society . Yam and cassava farming are important ways of making a living , although the revenues of these products are not very high . The most important export product of Nigeria is oil , but the Ogoni people have never profited from these exports . Once the ' food basket ' for the Niger Delta and beyond , Ogoniland 's agricultural production has now been severely reduced . This is partly due to loss of farmlands through oil polution and partly to soil fertility problems arising from acid / alkaline rain caused by gas flaring . Large areas of fresh and salt water resources as fishing grounds have also been rendered useless by oil spills . Food is becoming increasingly expensive and potential farmers are too poor to pay for seeds and labour . Poverty has worsened in the Ogoni areas during the last years . Nearly all oil workers are people coming from outside the area whom the local people have had to compete with for basic commodities . Besides the oil installations and refineries there are no manufacturing industries in Ogoni to reduce unemployment . This situation increasingly results in psycho-social degradation . There are no government projects to address the problems of development in Ogoni-land . Health facilities are almost non-existent and school buildings are collapsing with the classrooms and laboratories empty . Attracting foreign aid to Ogoni-land has been difficult and a couple of community self - help initiatives by the people were branded ' MOSOP - inspired ' and stopped . Ogoni-land is in total economic isolation by the government and most roads have been left to wear , making transportation extremely difficult . The environmental costs of the oil exploration have been and still are , very high . The agricultural and fishing communities experienced huge oil spills and pollution of drinking water , fishing grounds and farmlands . Large flares burnt gas from the oil extraction process , illuminating the sky day and night and polluting the air . The 1970 's brought increasing activity from the oil companies , claiming more space in an already crowded territory , and resulting in a deteriorating environment and in decreasing crop yields and fish catches . The Ogoni people believe and worship a Supreme Deity and creator called Waa Bari . Ogoni people regards Waa Bari as a female God . Her role and position stems from traditional thinking about creativity and motherhood . According to Paul Bedey : \" \u00e2\u00a6 the Ogoni people have the implicit belief that this female creator resides in the earth and that man and all animals and plants are created out of the earth . All libations and incarnation to Waa Bari are poured on the earth and it is believed she receives it as the wine or water sinks down into the earth . The dead are buried in the earth to return to Waa Bari Ogoni from where they come . It is clear in the traditional belief of the people that Waa Bari Ogoni is omnipotent and omniscient . \" The land on which they live and the rivers that surround them are very important to the Ogoni people . They not only provided enough food , they are also believed to be a god and are worshiped as such . This explains why the Ogoni people have so many difficulties with the degradation of the environment as a result of oil pollution . The fruit of the land , especially yams , are honoured in festivals . The annual festival of the Ogoni people is held during the period of the yam harvest . The planting season is not just a period of agricultural activity , but it is a spiritual , religious and social occasion . ' Tradition ' in Ogoni means in the local tongue ( doonu kuneke ) the honouring of the land . The Ogoni people believe that the soul of every human being has the ability to leave its human form and enter into that of an animal , taking on the shape of that animal . These characteristics show that nature is very important for the Ogoni people . Socially , the Ogoni is endowed with a large variety of cultural practices . These include masks and masquerades , human figure representation of the ancestors , as maybe used in Ka-elu performances and the puppet shows which are performed exclusively by the Amanikpo Society . Majority of these cultural performances in this relatively small region are extraordinarily varied . Most if not all , Ogoni villages have their own festivals , some of long standing , others introduced within living memory . The festivals are mainly held to commemorate the founding of the villages , to pay allegiance to particular ancestral land or water spirits , to mark the planting and harvesting seasons , for the fertility deity , to recognize the taking of titles , to restore peace in troubled community , to maintain cohesion within social groupings and for general entertainment . The Karikpo Mask / Masquerade Of all their known festivals and masquerades , the mask style for which the Ogoni are probably most renowned is the one called Karikpo . The Marikpo mask represents animals and is worn on the front of the face by men and boys . It is used for vigorous acrobatic play , performed originally during planting and harvesting seasons for fertility , new yam festivals , and burial ceremonies of members and recently for Christmas and New year celebrations , including reception for a distinguished guest or an illustrious son . The masquerade Performance is believed , especially in Khana to have originated in a certain community known as Bien - Gwara . Although there may not be substantial proof to this , but it is believed the community 's interaction with the Ibibios of Akwa Ibom State , where Ekpo mask has its provenance , may have influenced its adaptation and modification hence its name Kari ( Carved ) Kpo ( Ekpo ) . Membership into the Karikpo Society does not require an elaborate ritual or initiation , but an intending member is made to provide items like a bottle of gin , palm wine , a plate of oiled fish . These would be eaten by the members who then accepts him as one of them . The Ogoni people have been victims of human rights violations for many years . In 1956 , four years before Nigerian Independence , Royal Dutch / Shell , in collaboration with the British government , found a commercially viable oil field on the Niger Delta and began oil production in 1958 . In a 15 - year period from 1976 to 1991 there were reportedly 2,976 oil spills of about 2.1 million barrels of oil in Ogoniland , accounting for about 40 % of the total oil spills of the Royal Dutch / Shell company worldwide . In a 2011 assessment of over 200 locations in Ogoniland by the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , they found that impacts of the 50 years of oil production in the region extended deeper than previously thought . Because of oil spills , oil flaring , and waste discharge , the alluvial soil of the Niger Delta is no longer viable for agriculture . Furthermore , in many areas that seemed to be unaffected , groundwater was found to have high levels of hydrocarbons or were contaminated with benzene , a carcinogen , at 900 levels above WHO guidelines . UNEP estimated that it could take up to 30 years to rehabilitate Ogoniland to its full potential and that the first five years of rehabilitation would require funding of about US $ 1 billion . In 2012 , the Nigerian Minister of Petroleum Resources , Deizani Alison - Madueke , announced the establishment of the Hydrocarbon Pollution Restoration Project , which intends to follow the UNEP report suggestions of Ogoniland to prevent further degradation . [ 6 ] In 1990 , under the leadership of activist and environmentalist Ken Saro -Wiwa , the Movement of the Survival of the Ogoni People ( MOSOP ) planned to take action against the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the oil companies . In October 1990 , MOSOP presented The Ogoni Bill of Rights to the government . The Bill hoped to gain political and economic autonomy for the Ogoni people , leaving them in control of the natural resources of Ogoniland protecting against further land degradation . The movement lost steam in 1994 after Saro -Wiwa and several other MOSOP leaders were executed by the Nigerian government In 1993 , following protests that were designed to stop contractors from laying a new pipeline for Shell , the Mobile Police raided the area to quell the unrest . In the chaos that followed , it has been alleged that 27 villages were raided , resulting in the death of 2,000 Ogoni people and displacement of 80,000 .

They now number about over two million people and live in a 404 - square - mile ( 1,050 \u00c2 k m2 ) homeland which they also refer to as Ogoni , or Ogoniland . They share common oil - related environmental problems with the Ijaw people of Niger Delta . The Ogoni rose to international attention after a massive public protest campaign against Shell Oil , led by the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People ( MOSOP ) , which is also a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization ( UNPO ) . The territory is located in Rivers State on the coast of the Gulf of Guinea , east of the city of Port Harcourt . It extends across the Local Government Areas ( LGAs ) of Khana , Gokana , Eleme and Tai . Traditionally , Ogoniland was divided into the six kingdoms : Babbe , Gokana , Ken - Khana , Nyo - Khana , Eleme and Tai. Nyo - Khana is on the East while Ken-Khana is on the west . The Ogoni people speak Ogoni languages , or Kegboid languages . According to Roger Blench \" Ogoni languages are considered to be part of Cross River , which in turn is part of Benue - Congo and then Niger -Congo . \" The Ogoni of River States speak the related , mutually intelligible languages of Khana , Gokana , Tae ( T\u00e1\u00ba\u00b9\u00e1\u00ba\u00b9 ) , Eleme , and Ban Ogoi . They fall into two clusters , with a limited degree of mutual intelligibility between members of each cluster . However , the Ogoni think of them as separate languages . The Eastern languages are Khana and T\u00e1\u00ba\u00b9\u00e1\u00ba\u00b9 , with a quarter million or so speakers , and Gokana , with about half that number . The Western languages are Eleme , with about 70,000 speakers , and Baan , with about a tenth that number . Ogoni language has drawn some attention from general linguists ; Hyman ( 1983 ) used examples from Gokana in developing his theories of the syllable . More recently , Bond and Anderson ( 2003 ) have compared logophoricity in the ' Ogonoid ' lects . Most striking , however is the presence of a series of numeral classifiers . Typical of many Asian language families , these are extremely rare in Africa , and their evolution therefore typologically extremely unusual . This monograph has two predecessors . Ikoro ( 1991 ) reconstructed ' Kegboid ' [ a name constructed from the initials of the four languages ( Kana , Eleme , Gokana , Baan ) at the time considered to be part of the group . V\u00e1 \u00bb bnu ( 2001 ) is not a reconstruction , but provides some valuable information on each dialect and a short comparative word list ( partially tone marked ) . V\u00e1 \u00bb bnu ( op. cit. ) also includes some cultural background and information on orthographic systems . According to oral tradition , the Ogoni people migrated from ancient Ghana down to the Atlantic coast eventually making their way over to the eastern Niger Delta . Linguistic calculations done by Kay Williamson place the Ogoni in the Niger Delta since before 15 BC , making them one of the oldest settlers in the eastern Niger Delta region . Radiocarbon dating taken from sites around Ogoniland and the neighboring communities oral traditions also support this claim . Traditionally , the Ogoni are agricultural , also known for livestock herding , fishing , salt and palm oil cultivation and trade . Like many peoples on the Guinea coast , the Ogoni have an internal political structure subject to community - by- community arrangement , including appointment of chiefs and community development bodies , some recognized by government and others not . They survived the period of the slave trade in relative isolation , and did not lose any of their members to enslavement . After Nigeria was colonized by the British in 1885 , British soldiers arrived in Ogoni by 1901 . Major resistance to their presence continued through 1914 . The Ogoni were integrated into a succession of economic systems at a pace that was extremely rapid and exacted a great toll from them . At the turn of the twentieth century , \u201c the world to them did not extend beyond the next three or four villages , \u201d but that soon changed . Ken Saro-Wiwa , the late president of MOSOP , described the transition this way : \u201c if you then think that within the space of seventy years they were struck by the combined forces of modernity , colonialism , the money economy , indigenous colonialism and then the Nigerian Civil War , and that they had to adjust to these forces without adequate preparation or direction , you will appreciate the bafflement of the Ogoni people and the subsequent confusion engendered in the society . \u201d The Ogoni are an agricultural and fishing society . Yam and cassava farming are important ways of making a living , although the revenues of these products are not very high . The most important export product of Nigeria is oil , but the Ogoni people have never profited from these exports . Once the ' food basket ' for the Niger Delta and beyond , Ogoniland 's agricultural production has now been severely reduced . This is partly due to loss of farmlands through oil polution and partly to soil fertility problems arising from acid / alkaline rain caused by gas flaring . Large areas of fresh and salt water resources as fishing grounds have also been rendered useless by oil spills . Food is becoming increasingly expensive and potential farmers are too poor to pay for seeds and labour . Poverty has worsened in the Ogoni areas during the last years . Nearly all oil workers are people coming from outside the area whom the local people have had to compete with for basic commodities . Besides the oil installations and refineries there are no manufacturing industries in Ogoni to reduce unemployment . This situation increasingly results in psycho-social degradation . There are no government projects to address the problems of development in Ogoni-land . Health facilities are almost non-existent and school buildings are collapsing with the classrooms and laboratories empty . Attracting foreign aid to Ogoni-land has been difficult and a couple of community self - help initiatives by the people were branded ' MOSOP - inspired ' and stopped . Ogoni-land is in total economic isolation by the government and most roads have been left to wear , making transportation extremely difficult . The environmental costs of the oil exploration have been and still are , very high . The agricultural and fishing communities experienced huge oil spills and pollution of drinking water , fishing grounds and farmlands . Large flares burnt gas from the oil extraction process , illuminating the sky day and night and polluting the air . The 1970 's brought increasing activity from the oil companies , claiming more space in an already crowded territory , and resulting in a deteriorating environment and in decreasing crop yields and fish catches . The Ogoni people believe and worship a Supreme Deity and creator called Waa Bari . Ogoni people regards Waa Bari as a female God . Her role and position stems from traditional thinking about creativity and motherhood . According to Paul Bedey : \" \u00e2\u00a6 the Ogoni people have the implicit belief that this female creator resides in the earth and that man and all animals and plants are created out of the earth . All libations and incarnation to Waa Bari are poured on the earth and it is believed she receives it as the wine or water sinks down into the earth . The dead are buried in the earth to return to Waa Bari Ogoni from where they come . It is clear in the traditional belief of the people that Waa Bari Ogoni is omnipotent and omniscient . \" The land on which they live and the rivers that surround them are very important to the Ogoni people . They not only provided enough food , they are also believed to be a god and are worshiped as such .

Gamasutra spoke to Barel about the Z-Cam , which the company is aiming to release in the second half of 2008 for as yet un - revealed platforms , and he explained how the camera might work for development , synchronize with games , and change the way players interact with them . Can you give me a picture of what differentiates this camera from some of the other pointing and sensing peripherals that have already been released on the market ? Tomer Barel : From a purely technical point of view , in any pointing device that you have , you have one , two -- or as many pointing devices as that might have -- points in space . You can add some information about that , but still these are points in space . What you have here is complete coverage of the whole field of view of the camera , in terms of depth information , or distance information . So it 's the difference between one or two points , to the whole area . And this allows you to really have control of games with however is fit , or most natural , to control the game . So this is real natural input , while , if you think about it , doing boxing with these two pointers in your hands is unnatural . It 's more natural than using a traditional controller , that 's true , but it 's unnatural still . And the way people play boxing , as I said earlier , demonstrates that . When you have full coverage of the whole field of view , either of your whole body , or whatever part of the body you want to use , you can be much more natural . And you talked about how this sends its own light pulses forward from the sensor array on the camera , so it 's not reliant on the lighting , and since it does depth , it 's not reliant on the background ; can you talk a little bit about that ? TB : So , if you compare this to standard 2D cameras , the way this works involves transmitting active illumination . That solves the light problem -- which is a big problem with 2D cameras , and the Eye Toy , or Microsoft Vision . That , obviously , not because they 're not good cameras , they are good cameras , good technologies , but there are limitations to what you can do without light with 2D . Here , you have you have your own illumination source , that enables you to work in any lighting conditions , including complete darkness -- there 's no problem with that . That 's one thing , the other thing that makes many people critical about 2D cameras is the background issues . And again , in 2D you cannot really separate your mother in the background from yourself . Because it does n't understand that one is the gamer and the other is someone that has nothing to do with it . Here , based on distance , you can decide to open a window , or just refer to a certain area , and have like a wall behind that area , and ignore everything else . So you can have a wall , a kind of a virtual wall around the player , and ignore whatever is in the background . That 's another big advantage of these 2D cameras . I would say another thing that is , I think , even more important than the other two things that I mentioned , comparing to other 2D cameras , and that is the fact that -- it 's not only when the background is far apart , it 's also your own background , or your own body . You cannot detect gestures that are in front of the body . If you think about all the games you 're playing with cameras that are 2D , they 're always motion to the side . And that is very unnatural , because we do not do a lot -- if you think of our day- to - day lives -- we do not do a lot of things to the side . We do not do like this [ gestures like someone playing EyeToy . ] We interact to the front . That 's almost impossible to detect with 2D information ; that 's very easy to detect with 3D information . Even if it 's not big movement . It could be static , still something , anything , is detectable because of the depth information . One thing that you showed me was a current application to drop out the background and replace it with video , with the implication that it could be used with games that immersively take place around you . Could you talk about that a little bit ? TB : We have here two complementing capabilities : One is the ability to recognize gestures -- that I was talking about -- and the other , also based on the depth information , the capability to replace background . Because as I said , you can ignore the background , and if you can ignore it , you can easily replace it . We do that real-time , sixty frames per second . You just replace it with whatever you want . The combination is that you can put yourself in a virtual environment , or the game environment , and control the game with gestures . So actually for game design , you have two options : One is to control games by gestures and be represented either as an avatar instead of you , or in a first - person , kind - of have your hands or whatever , kind - of virtual hands , without the concept of your own image ; and the alternative is to have your own image in the game , as you see in some of the Eye Toy games , but also use the control of gestures when you are in the game . We can see a lot of potential for that in social networking -- anything that is online -- have yourself in the game . Not all gamers would like that , but in some situations , that 's relevant for social networking , for MMOs , etc . You were showing me the detection , and it seemed like it could detect five fingers and your palm pretty easily ; is that , would you say , an accurate representation of what its capabilities are , presently ? TB : I also showed you the full skeleton . It can recognize whatever ... But I mean in terms of ' number of points ' . TB : It could generate any number of points . I mean , the thing to understand is : What the camera generates is the depth information . After you have the depth information , you decide what image processing algorithms to use to analyze this data . So if you invest a lot in algorithms , you can have fifty points on your body , and generate , and recognize your head , your palms , your elbow , your shoulders , your feet ; whatever you want . It 's just a matter of what you need , and what you invest in terms of processing . We are working , as a service to developers ' community , on recognizing skeleton tracking . At the moment , we already have it recognizing the head , the two palms , and the torso ; and on recognizing fingers , because we believe that this is the basis of developing further things . But , based on the application , if the application requires recognizing any other point on the body , there is no problem doing that . Investing in a process to do that . What kind of resolution does a version that could go to market generate ? What resolution image is it ? TB : Well , we have n't made a decision about the concrete specs of the camera that will go to the market . I can say that this camera that you see here , the Z-Cam , has an X -Y resolution of 320 by 240 , and that 's definitely enough to recognize fingers , as you could see . That 's in X - Y , and in depth , it has a resolution of 1 centimeter or more . Now there is a big advantage to the technology here , because you can open a window around yourself , and then the resolution spreads across a smaller area . So , the 256 variables spread across the resolution that is high like you need . If you are not interested in the whole range of the camera , you can limit yourself to around the gamer , and get better resolution , in terms of depth . I see . So if you limit it from the perspective of the depth that you pick , the movement control could be finer , basically . TB : Yes. Exactly . And about how far back could you potentially go from the camera , and still have it be an effective input method ? Is that something you 've tested ? TB : This prototype has a range of half a meter to three meters , or ten feet . And this is because this is what we seem to need for livingroom applications . The technology we have used in previous versions has been used up to a hundred meters . So , there is no real limit ; you just need much more light , and that will make it much more costly to buy . It 's just a matter of what you want it for , and we do n't want you to pay for things that you do n't need the camera for . So this is why we limit ourselves to three meters . And , speaking of costs , you talked about why you 're not nailing down the cost of a potential production version yet . You think it will be in a comfortable range for mainstream applications . Could you talk about where you see that right now ? TB : Well , first of all , the camera will not be released rendered as a 3DV camera , so we will have a partner working with us -- obviously , a \" bigger partner \" could be a publisher bundling a game with this , it could be one of the first parties , it could be a hardware player of any other sort . I guess , any pricing decision will be made together . But what I can say in terms of the cost is , as you said , it will be comfortably in the zone that is relevant for peripherals in the gaming arena , and it will be definitely possible to sell it as a bundle for the kind - of $ 69.99 price point that one can feel comfortable about . Or , sell it together with any webcam that is on the shelves in Best Buy or Fry's . Similar price-point . So it 's definitely comparable to the PlayStation Eye , or even just to , say , a Guitar Hero controller , potentially . TB : Oh , the Guitar Hero controller is much more expensive . Although , if you think about Rock Band -- people who say that you cannot charge for peripherals should open their eyes and see what 's happening with Rock Band , and how many units they 've sold . This will be definitely cheaper than Rock Band . It will be comparable in range to the Playstation Eye , definitely . One thing we talked about is that there is both a potential in the casual games , in the Wii Sports sort of vein , and for using this as a peripheral for more serious gamer -games , like an FPS or an RTS . Can you talk about how you see those two different , similar potentials rising ? TB : Because of the way that the market has developed around the Wii , and what we see happening around us , the natural thing to think about is : Instead of playing boxing with these two silly things in your hand , and doing it very quickly , you can do real boxing . Or you can do real baseball -- you can take your own bat from your room , and do the whole thing . And the camera , if the sophistication is enough , can detect the subtleties of how exactly you have held the bat , and how you hit , and you can even use gestures for the capture , and all that -- I 'm not that familiar with baseball , because we do n't play baseball in Israel ! But , it seems like a good direction . That 's just one direction to kind - of take the game -- casual games , sports games -- and make the experience more natural , either with holding something , or not holding , depending on the concrete application . Another direction is to use this for hardcore gaming . And we think the same kind of logic that makes you think , \" Well , let 's hold something that looks like a real baseball bat , or is a real baseball bat , \" holds for action games or action games and first-person shooters . You can even combine a traditional controller and some relevant body gestures . You could duck , you could dodge , you could jump , you could sneak behind something . You could use your hands to do things that today are done kind - of with touching some buttons , like open a lock , throw stuff , throw a grenade , pick up a weapon , etc. , and you can go all the way to thinking about new control schemes that are more convenient to control games . Think about RTS : How difficult and unsuccessful it is for consoles . The reason is that there has n't been found , so far , a control scheme that is convenient , that is nearly as comfortable for people as the mouse and PC . And we think that with your two hands , you can grab a unit , you can put it somewhere , you can use sort - of i Phone - like gestures to zoom in , zoom out , move your map , build something with your hands ... So , just using your two hands , you can get an accuracy that is much better than any pointer , because you 're used to that . We can measure , because of the depth information , with respect to your eye , and this combination can create a control that can make RTS work on consoles maybe for the first time . So there 's a wide range of genres and games that you can apply this control scheme to . I can also envision a control scheme where you 'd have your controller for things that are natural for your controller , but then there are things you could manipulate -- because you could have this camera basically running all the time while you play , but it is n't required for every aspect of ... TB : Absolutely . Absolutely . We definitely do n't think that - There are things that the controllers we are used to using for many years are good for , and we are not trying to say , \" Let 's throw them away . \" But this could be a real enhancement to games that fit the controller . Because most games you use controllers for -- I mean , you use controllers for every game , but -- even for games that fit the controller , you do a lot of things that can be much more fun if you used your body for them . Like the FPS , the action games ; think about spells , think about , I do n't know , Harry Potter . How much fun - They are now trying this with the Wii , but think about the context of using your hands to do this ; holding a real wand , whatever wand you want , not this piece of metal ; using both your hands , detecting very fine gestures that you do with your finger -- all this can make even a controller - based game much more fun . One thing I want to talk about is , you talk about a ' handlebar ' that you guys mocked up to do a racing game ; could you talk about that a little bit ? TB : Yeah , so , again this is a concept - The camera is not limited to body . It just looks at whats in front of it , and recognizes what is happening . So any shape can be a part of what the camera recognizes , and to illustrate that , we thought : \" Well , there are many games that you do n't want to play with your bare hands ; you want to hold something . \" So we tried that with a motorcycle game . We bought a grip in a bike shop -- a plastic grip -- and we used that to control the gas . So in order to make it very easy to detect very fine movements of the grip , we put reflective tape -- which costs , I do n't know , a cent or something -- on the grip , and every time you rotate it , you see the tape moving , and you can distinguish very fine movement between gas on and off , and even level of gas . And think about the potential of this in the wider context : It does n't have to be a grip . It could be a baseball bat , it could be a ball that you throw at something , it could be a basketball , it could be a sword , it could be a lightsaber , it could be anything that you would want to hold as part of the game . So the opportunities , the possibilities , are endless . Are there any current partnerships that you 're pursuing , or currently involved with , or are you just looking for people to work with on this project ? TB : I cannot comment on relationships that we have in this industry , and people outside of the industry , because of NDAs . But you are still looking for people to work with , or interested parties ? TB : We are talking to many people now . We are mainly looking now for developers to experiment with the camera , and think about -- because again , as I said , the possibilities are endless , and what we are looking for is the creative power in the industry . So we now have the ZCam in larger quantities , and we are really interested in developers coming -- independent developers or whatever -- in coming to us and cooperating around creating content . That 's the main goal of this interview and launching , announcing this product . And when do you think that it could potentially reach the market ? TB : Again , this depends . As I said , we are not going to release this on the market on our own ; we 're going to partner , and it depends on the relationships that we have , and again I cannot comment on specifics . What can say is that the product is going to be ready for mass production in the second half of 2008 .","annotations":[{"text":"game","span":[14,17],"token_span":[3,3],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place is where the gesturing occurs."},{"text":"whatever part of the body you want to use","span":[1745,1785],"token_span":[343,351],"role":"Body_part","label":"Body_part","role_definition":"The Body_part is the specific body part of the Communicator which gestures."},{"text":"Z-Cam","span":[7262,7266],"token_span":[1475,1475],"role":"Addressee","label":"Addressee","role_definition":"This is the person to whom a non-verbal Message is communicated.

Gamasutra spoke to Barel about the Z-Cam , which the company is aiming to release in the second half of 2008 for as yet un - revealed platforms , and he explained how the camera might work for development , synchronize with games , and change the way players interact with them . Can you give me a picture of what differentiates this camera from some of the other pointing and sensing peripherals that have already been released on the market ? Tomer Barel : From a purely technical point of view , in any pointing device that you have , you have one , two -- or as many pointing devices as that might have -- points in space . You can add some information about that , but still these are points in space . What you have here is complete coverage of the whole field of view of the camera , in terms of depth information , or distance information . So it 's the difference between one or two points , to the whole area . And this allows you to really have control of games with however is fit , or most natural , to control the game . So this is real natural input , while , if you think about it , doing boxing with these two pointers in your hands is unnatural . It 's more natural than using a traditional controller , that 's true , but it 's unnatural still . And the way people play boxing , as I said earlier , demonstrates that . When you have full coverage of the whole field of view , either of your whole body , or whatever part of the body you want to use , you can be much more natural . And you talked about how this sends its own light pulses forward from the sensor array on the camera , so it 's not reliant on the lighting , and since it does depth , it 's not reliant on the background ; can you talk a little bit about that ? TB : So , if you compare this to standard 2D cameras , the way this works involves transmitting active illumination . That solves the light problem -- which is a big problem with 2D cameras , and the Eye Toy , or Microsoft Vision . That , obviously , not because they 're not good cameras , they are good cameras , good technologies , but there are limitations to what you can do without light with 2D . Here , you have you have your own illumination source , that enables you to work in any lighting conditions , including complete darkness -- there 's no problem with that . That 's one thing , the other thing that makes many people critical about 2D cameras is the background issues . And again , in 2D you cannot really separate your mother in the background from yourself . Because it does n't understand that one is the gamer and the other is someone that has nothing to do with it . Here , based on distance , you can decide to open a window , or just refer to a certain area , and have like a wall behind that area , and ignore everything else . So you can have a wall , a kind of a virtual wall around the player , and ignore whatever is in the background . That 's another big advantage of these 2D cameras . I would say another thing that is , I think , even more important than the other two things that I mentioned , comparing to other 2D cameras , and that is the fact that -- it 's not only when the background is far apart , it 's also your own background , or your own body . You cannot detect gestures that are in front of the body . If you think about all the games you 're playing with cameras that are 2D , they 're always motion to the side . And that is very unnatural , because we do not do a lot -- if you think of our day- to - day lives -- we do not do a lot of things to the side . We do not do like this [ gestures like someone playing EyeToy . ] We interact to the front . That 's almost impossible to detect with 2D information ; that 's very easy to detect with 3D information . Even if it 's not big movement . It could be static , still something , anything , is detectable because of the depth information . One thing that you showed me was a current application to drop out the background and replace it with video , with the implication that it could be used with games that immersively take place around you . Could you talk about that a little bit ? TB : We have here two complementing capabilities : One is the ability to recognize gestures -- that I was talking about -- and the other , also based on the depth information , the capability to replace background . Because as I said , you can ignore the background , and if you can ignore it , you can easily replace it . We do that real-time , sixty frames per second . You just replace it with whatever you want . The combination is that you can put yourself in a virtual environment , or the game environment , and control the game with gestures . So actually for game design , you have two options : One is to control games by gestures and be represented either as an avatar instead of you , or in a first - person , kind - of have your hands or whatever , kind - of virtual hands , without the concept of your own image ; and the alternative is to have your own image in the game , as you see in some of the Eye Toy games , but also use the control of gestures when you are in the game . We can see a lot of potential for that in social networking -- anything that is online -- have yourself in the game . Not all gamers would like that , but in some situations , that 's relevant for social networking , for MMOs , etc . You were showing me the detection , and it seemed like it could detect five fingers and your palm pretty easily ; is that , would you say , an accurate representation of what its capabilities are , presently ? TB : I also showed you the full skeleton . It can recognize whatever ... But I mean in terms of ' number of points ' . TB : It could generate any number of points . I mean , the thing to understand is : What the camera generates is the depth information . After you have the depth information , you decide what image processing algorithms to use to analyze this data . So if you invest a lot in algorithms , you can have fifty points on your body , and generate , and recognize your head , your palms , your elbow , your shoulders , your feet ; whatever you want . It 's just a matter of what you need , and what you invest in terms of processing . We are working , as a service to developers ' community , on recognizing skeleton tracking . At the moment , we already have it recognizing the head , the two palms , and the torso ; and on recognizing fingers , because we believe that this is the basis of developing further things . But , based on the application , if the application requires recognizing any other point on the body , there is no problem doing that . Investing in a process to do that . What kind of resolution does a version that could go to market generate ? What resolution image is it ? TB : Well , we have n't made a decision about the concrete specs of the camera that will go to the market . I can say that this camera that you see here , the Z-Cam , has an X -Y resolution of 320 by 240 , and that 's definitely enough to recognize fingers , as you could see . That 's in X - Y , and in depth , it has a resolution of 1 centimeter or more . Now there is a big advantage to the technology here , because you can open a window around yourself , and then the resolution spreads across a smaller area . So , the 256 variables spread across the resolution that is high like you need . If you are not interested in the whole range of the camera , you can limit yourself to around the gamer , and get better resolution , in terms of depth . I see . So if you limit it from the perspective of the depth that you pick , the movement control could be finer , basically . TB : Yes. Exactly . And about how far back could you potentially go from the camera , and still have it be an effective input method ? Is that something you 've tested ? TB : This prototype has a range of half a meter to three meters , or ten feet . And this is because this is what we seem to need for livingroom applications . The technology we have used in previous versions has been used up to a hundred meters . So , there is no real limit ; you just need much more light , and that will make it much more costly to buy . It 's just a matter of what you want it for , and we do n't want you to pay for things that you do n't need the camera for . So this is why we limit ourselves to three meters . And , speaking of costs , you talked about why you 're not nailing down the cost of a potential production version yet . You think it will be in a comfortable range for mainstream applications . Could you talk about where you see that right now ? TB : Well , first of all , the camera will not be released rendered as a 3DV camera , so we will have a partner working with us -- obviously , a \" bigger partner \" could be a publisher bundling a game with this , it could be one of the first parties , it could be a hardware player of any other sort . I guess , any pricing decision will be made together . But what I can say in terms of the cost is , as you said , it will be comfortably in the zone that is relevant for peripherals in the gaming arena , and it will be definitely possible to sell it as a bundle for the kind - of $ 69.99 price point that one can feel comfortable about . Or , sell it together with any webcam that is on the shelves in Best Buy or Fry's . Similar price-point . So it 's definitely comparable to the PlayStation Eye , or even just to , say , a Guitar Hero controller , potentially . TB : Oh , the Guitar Hero controller is much more expensive . Although , if you think about Rock Band -- people who say that you cannot charge for peripherals should open their eyes and see what 's happening with Rock Band , and how many units they 've sold . This will be definitely cheaper than Rock Band . It will be comparable in range to the Playstation Eye , definitely . One thing we talked about is that there is both a potential in the casual games , in the Wii Sports sort of vein , and for using this as a peripheral for more serious gamer -games , like an FPS or an RTS . Can you talk about how you see those two different , similar potentials rising ? TB : Because of the way that the market has developed around the Wii , and what we see happening around us , the natural thing to think about is : Instead of playing boxing with these two silly things in your hand , and doing it very quickly , you can do real boxing . Or you can do real baseball -- you can take your own bat from your room , and do the whole thing . And the camera , if the sophistication is enough , can detect the subtleties of how exactly you have held the bat , and how you hit , and you can even use gestures for the capture , and all that -- I 'm not that familiar with baseball , because we do n't play baseball in Israel ! But , it seems like a good direction . That 's just one direction to kind - of take the game -- casual games , sports games -- and make the experience more natural , either with holding something , or not holding , depending on the concrete application . Another direction is to use this for hardcore gaming . And we think the same kind of logic that makes you think , \" Well , let 's hold something that looks like a real baseball bat , or is a real baseball bat , \" holds for action games or action games and first-person shooters . You can even combine a traditional controller and some relevant body gestures . You could duck , you could dodge , you could jump , you could sneak behind something . You could use your hands to do things that today are done kind - of with touching some buttons , like open a lock , throw stuff , throw a grenade , pick up a weapon , etc. , and you can go all the way to thinking about new control schemes that are more convenient to control games . Think about RTS : How difficult and unsuccessful it is for consoles . The reason is that there has n't been found , so far , a control scheme that is convenient , that is nearly as comfortable for people as the mouse and PC . And we think that with your two hands , you can grab a unit , you can put it somewhere , you can use sort - of i Phone - like gestures to zoom in , zoom out , move your map , build something with your hands ... So , just using your two hands , you can get an accuracy that is much better than any pointer , because you 're used to that . We can measure , because of the depth information , with respect to your eye , and this combination can create a control that can make RTS work on consoles maybe for the first time . So there 's a wide range of genres and games that you can apply this control scheme to . I can also envision a control scheme where you 'd have your controller for things that are natural for your controller , but then there are things you could manipulate -- because you could have this camera basically running all the time while you play , but it is n't required for every aspect of ... TB : Absolutely . Absolutely . We definitely do n't think that - There are things that the controllers we are used to using for many years are good for , and we are not trying to say , \" Let 's throw them away . \" But this could be a real enhancement to games that fit the controller . Because most games you use controllers for -- I mean , you use controllers for every game , but -- even for games that fit the controller , you do a lot of things that can be much more fun if you used your body for them .

One thing I want to talk about is , you talk about a ' handlebar ' that you guys mocked up to do a racing game ; could you talk about that a little bit ? TB : Yeah , so , again this is a concept - The camera is not limited to body . It just looks at whats in front of it , and recognizes what is happening . So any shape can be a part of what the camera recognizes , and to illustrate that , we thought : \" Well , there are many games that you do n't want to play with your bare hands ; you want to hold something . \" So we tried that with a motorcycle game . We bought a grip in a bike shop -- a plastic grip -- and we used that to control the gas . So in order to make it very easy to detect very fine movements of the grip , we put reflective tape -- which costs , I do n't know , a cent or something -- on the grip , and every time you rotate it , you see the tape moving , and you can distinguish very fine movement between gas on and off , and even level of gas . And think about the potential of this in the wider context : It does n't have to be a grip . It could be a baseball bat , it could be a ball that you throw at something , it could be a basketball , it could be a sword , it could be a lightsaber , it could be anything that you would want to hold as part of the game . So the opportunities , the possibilities , are endless . Are there any current partnerships that you 're pursuing , or currently involved with , or are you just looking for people to work with on this project ?

So when it comes to any job I work , I 'm gonna do it good , I 'm going to bring it over the top . \u201d Mr. T's latest venture is certainly over the top . He has signed on as the spokesman for Gold Promise , a new gold - buying venture launched by publicly - traded Cash America , one of the world 's largest pawn brokers . Starting this week , Mr. T will appear in a series of television ads where he tries new things \u2014 playing golf , getting a spa treatment \u2014 a product , the story goes , of him selling a few excess chains . In the campaign , which also features a range of print and web ads , Mr. T exhorts customers to take their unwanted gold , drop it in a special envelope , and mail it to Gold Promise in exchange for cash . \u201c Getting a great price was important to me , \u201d he says in the television spots . \u201c That 's why I chose Gold Promise , a company I trust . \u201d ( Read on : The Softer Side of Mr. T ) So is it wise to sell your stray gold to the company trusted by Mr. T ? Not necessarily . Although Gold Promise boasts that it will beat any competitor 's price by 200 % , it 's important to note that the guarantee only extends to online competitors , which are notoriously shady . A recent study by The Today Show found that online dealers offered as much as little as 8 cents on the dollar for gold jewelry . Most fell in the 50 - 80 cents - on - the - dollar range . Local pawn shops will give you a quote over the phone if you tell them how many karats , and how heavy , your item is . Gold Promise refused such a request , explaining that doing so would \u201c offer the competition the opportunity to adjust their pricing strategy in the short - term to attempt to drive us out of this business . \u201d According to chief executive Dan Feehan , Cash America 's gross margin on scrap gold is 20 % - 25 % , which suggests Gold Promise pays about 80 cents on the dollar for gold , placing it at the high end of the online gold - buying spectrum . Though Gold Promise may be among the better options for selling gold online , most professionals recommend having jewelry appraised before plopping it in an envelope and shipping it away . \u201c This may be a great time to sell unwanted gold jewelry , as the price of gold has shot up over the past few years due to the economic crisis , \u201d says Mary A. Malgoire , president of The Family Firm , a financial advisory in Bethesda , Md . \u201c But do n't jump at the first offer . Get quotes from several local jewelers . \u201d Even though online buyers usually pay less for gold than their bricks - and - mortar counterparts , many consumers are considering buyers like Cash America 's Gold Promise in the wake of the contraction in consumer credit . \u201c Customers that have not traditionally been our customers are looking for new options for small short - term loans since credit limits on cards have been reduced or eliminated , \u201d says Feehan . \u201c They 're looking online \u2026 it 's a lot less intimidating than walking into a pawn shop . \u201d Feehan believes Mr. T will help drum up new customers for his company , which enjoys healthy margins on gold regardless of price fluctuations . But regular investors thinking of sinking more cash into precious metals would be wise to note Mr. T 's presence as a sign of frothy gold prices . \u201c Gold is a poor investment because the return is based solely on price appreciation and , more often than not , fear , rather than sound fundamentals in the demand for the metal , \u201d says Malgoire . \u201c The more TV pitches you see for investing in gold , the more you should run the other way . This is a sign of the end of gold 's run . \u201d So what 's the best investment strategy going forward ? Take some advice from Mr. T. \u201c I still believe in T-Bills , and not just because of the T , \u201d he says . Most of all , though , he stresses the importance of a balanced portfolio . \u201c Diversify \u2014 go here , go there , so you wo n't be caught out in the cold . \u201d http://video.forbes.com/fvn/business/mrt-on-gold[forbesvid id= \" fvn/business/mrt-on-gold \" showid= \" 5 \" ]","annotations":[{"text":"He","span":[667,668],"token_span":[153,153],"role":"Employee","label":"Employee","role_definition":"The person who enters an employment relation with an Employer."},{"text":"as the spokesman for Gold Promise , a new gold - buying venture launched by publicly - traded Cash America , one of the world 's largest pawn brokers","span":[684,832],"token_span":[157,185],"role":"Position","label":"Position","role_definition":"The label given to a particular type of employment."},{"text":"Gold Promise","span":[705,716],"token_span":[161,162],"role":"Employer","label":"Employer","role_definition":"The person (or institution) that the Employee enters an employment relationship with."},{"text":"will appear in a series of television ads where he tries new things \u2014 playing golf , getting a spa treatment \u2014 a product , the story goes , of him selling a few excess chains","span":[863,1036],"token_span":[193,228],"role":"Task","label":"Task","role_definition":"The action that the Employee is obligated to do for the Employer."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"In 2010 , Mr. T signed up as the spokesman for Gold Promise , a gold - buying company .","annotations":[{"text":"Mr. T","span":[10,14],"token_span":[3,4],"role":"Employee","label":"Employee","role_definition":"The person who enters an employment relation with an Employer."},{"text":"Gold Promise","span":[47,58],"token_span":[11,12],"role":"Employer","label":"Employer","role_definition":"The person (or institution) that the Employee enters an employment relationship with."},{"text":"as the spokesman for Gold Promise , a gold - buying company","span":[26,84],"token_span":[7,18],"role":"Position","label":"Position","role_definition":"The label given to a particular type of employment."},{"text":"2010","span":[3,6],"token_span":[1,1],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time when an Employee signs on with an Employer."}],"trigger":{"text":"signed up","start_char":16,"end_char":24,"start_token":5,"end_token":6,"frame":"Get_a_job"}},"source":{"text":"It 's a gray day in midtown Manhattan , and Mr. T is waxing philosophical on the mythology of gold . \u201c Midas forgot , when he asked for the golden touch , that everything he touched turned to gold .

Starting this week , Mr. T will appear in a series of television ads where he tries new things \u2014 playing golf , getting a spa treatment \u2014 a product , the story goes , of him selling a few excess chains . In the campaign , which also features a range of print and web ads , Mr. T exhorts customers to take their unwanted gold , drop it in a special envelope , and mail it to Gold Promise in exchange for cash . \u201c Getting a great price was important to me , \u201d he says in the television spots . \u201c That 's why I chose Gold Promise , a company I trust . \u201d ( Read on : The Softer Side of Mr. T ) So is it wise to sell your stray gold to the company trusted by Mr. T ? Not necessarily . Although Gold Promise boasts that it will beat any competitor 's price by 200 % , it 's important to note that the guarantee only extends to online competitors , which are notoriously shady . A recent study by The Today Show found that online dealers offered as much as little as 8 cents on the dollar for gold jewelry . Most fell in the 50 - 80 cents - on - the - dollar range . Local pawn shops will give you a quote over the phone if you tell them how many karats , and how heavy , your item is . Gold Promise refused such a request , explaining that doing so would \u201c offer the competition the opportunity to adjust their pricing strategy in the short - term to attempt to drive us out of this business . \u201d According to chief executive Dan Feehan , Cash America 's gross margin on scrap gold is 20 % - 25 % , which suggests Gold Promise pays about 80 cents on the dollar for gold , placing it at the high end of the online gold - buying spectrum . Though Gold Promise may be among the better options for selling gold online , most professionals recommend having jewelry appraised before plopping it in an envelope and shipping it away . \u201c This may be a great time to sell unwanted gold jewelry , as the price of gold has shot up over the past few years due to the economic crisis , \u201d says Mary A. Malgoire , president of The Family Firm , a financial advisory in Bethesda , Md . \u201c But do n't jump at the first offer . Get quotes from several local jewelers . \u201d Even though online buyers usually pay less for gold than their bricks - and - mortar counterparts , many consumers are considering buyers like Cash America 's Gold Promise in the wake of the contraction in consumer credit . \u201c Customers that have not traditionally been our customers are looking for new options for small short - term loans since credit limits on cards have been reduced or eliminated , \u201d says Feehan . \u201c They 're looking online \u2026 it 's a lot less intimidating than walking into a pawn shop . \u201d Feehan believes Mr. T will help drum up new customers for his company , which enjoys healthy margins on gold regardless of price fluctuations . But regular investors thinking of sinking more cash into precious metals would be wise to note Mr. T 's presence as a sign of frothy gold prices . \u201c Gold is a poor investment because the return is based solely on price appreciation and , more often than not , fear , rather than sound fundamentals in the demand for the metal , \u201d says Malgoire . \u201c The more TV pitches you see for investing in gold , the more you should run the other way . This is a sign of the end of gold 's run . \u201d So what 's the best investment strategy going forward ? Take some advice from Mr. T. \u201c I still believe in T-Bills , and not just because of the T , \u201d he says . Most of all , though , he stresses the importance of a balanced portfolio . \u201c Diversify \u2014 go here , go there , so you wo n't be caught out in the cold . \u201d http://video.forbes.com/fvn/business/mrt-on-gold[forbesvid id= \" fvn/business/mrt-on-gold \" showid= \" 5 \" ]","annotations":[{"text":"He","span":[667,668],"token_span":[153,153],"role":"Employee","label":"Employee","role_definition":"The person who enters an employment relation with an Employer."},{"text":"Gold Promise","span":[705,716],"token_span":[161,162],"role":"Employer","label":"Employer","role_definition":"The person (or institution) that the Employee enters an employment relationship with."},{"text":"as the spokesman for Gold Promise , a new gold - buying venture","span":[684,746],"token_span":[157,169],"role":"Position","label":"Position","role_definition":"The label given to a particular type of employment."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-0763-7-frame-Getting","frame":"Getting","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Recipient starts off without the Theme in their possession, and then comes to possess it.","frame_ancestors":["Event"],"frame_descendants":["Amassing","Commerce_buy","Renting","Commerce_collect","Earnings_and_losses","Receiving","Borrowing","Taking","Theft"],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"but is best known for having served as a large - scale patron of African - American art that helped gain recognition for African - American artists who otherwise would have remained largely unknown .

RNA molecules adopt diverse structures in response to these functional requirements . RNA has a covalent structure very similar to that of DNA , the only differences being the change from a 2 ' - deoxyribose sugar in DNA to a ribose sugar in RNA and from a methyl group in thymidine to a hydrogen atom in uracil . However , their functional differences lead to correspondingly different structures . The requirement for storage of genetic information imposes the double - helical structure on most DNA molecules , whereas RNA molecules adopt an array of structures to rival protein structures in their complexity . This is not the result of an intrinsic limitation of DNA stereochemistry , but rather the result of different functional requirements . It is convenient to describe RNA structure in hierarchical terms ( Fig. 1 ) , comparable to those used in describing protein structure : primary , secondary , tertiary , and quaternary structures . The primary structure refers to the sequence of an RNA molecule . Unlike proteins , which in most cases function only when properly folded , many RNAs function as unstructured , single-stranded species . For example , messenger RNA must be unfolded for the genetic message to be translated , and stable RNA secondary structures inhibit protein biosynthesis . Figure 1 . Hierarchy of RNA folding . ( a) The primary structure corresponds to the RNA sequence . ( b , and c) The secondary structure ( in this case , two stem - loops or hairpins ) form by Watson - Crick base pairing between complementary nucleotides . ( d) Tertiary interactions ( coaxial stacking of double helices ) lead to the final three - dimensional structure ( in this case , a pseudoknot ) . 1 . Secondary Structure of RNA Secondary structure in DNA and RNA is dominated by Watson - Crick base pairing , leading to the formation of double - helical structures of varying length . Isolated base pairs are not thermodynamically stable , but formation of several consecutive base pairs readily occurs , resulting in a variety of possible arrangements ( Fig. 2 ) . These so- called secondary structure motifs represent the building blocks through which the most complex RNA three - dimensional structures are constructed . There is a fundamental difference between RNA and protein structures . Protein secondary structure is generally only marginally stable in the absence of stabilizing tertiary structure interactions , whereas RNA secondary structure is often stable on its own . Thus , formation of the secondary structure dominates the process of RNA folding , and RNA tertiary structure forms through relatively weak interactions between pre-formed secondary structure motives . Because of this property , RNA secondary structure can often be predicted successfully from thermodynamics Figure 2. RNA secondary structure motifs . ( a) Duplexes ; ( b) Single -stranded regions ; ( c ) hairpins ; ( d ) bulges ; ( e ) internal loops . RNA secondary structure is dominated by the formation of double helices stabilized by Watson - Crick base pairs between complementary stretches . Unlike DNA , these helices are relatively short , seldom more than 8 to 10 base pairs in length , and are interrupted by single - stranded nucleotides ( 1 ) or phylogeny ( 2 ) . forming loop elements : hairpins , bulges , and internal loops ( Fig. 2 ) . These , together with the helical junction that is formed when more than two double helices come together , are the secondary structure motives and the building blocks upon which the most complex RNA structures are built . In many RNAs , more than half of all nucleotides are incorporated into double - stranded helices . Duplex regions can form through very long - range interactions , and these interactions are crucial to determine and stabilize the overall fold of an RNA molecule . For example , opposite strands in double helices within ribosomal RNA can be separated by as many as 2000 nucleotides . In RNA , G-U pairs are almost as common as the canonical G - C or A -U base pairs , and they introduce slight distortions in double - helical structure that are recognized by proteins and other RNAs ( 3 , 4 ) . RNA ( and DNA ) double helices have an antiparallel right - handed helical conformation . RNA double helices adopt the A-form structure , which differs significantly from the canonical B-form adopted by DNA double helices ( see DNA Structure ) . RNA duplex structures are not uniform , although their variability is less than that in DNA . These variations depend on the sequence and structural context of the helix relative to the global three - dimensional structure . A-form double helices differ from B-DNA in the conformation of the sugar and the displacement of the bases from the helical axis . These local differences lead to very diverse shapes , with profound consequences for recognition by proteins and other ligands ( 5 ) . The most common element of RNA secondary structure is the hairpin ( or stem - loop ) ( Fig. 2 ) . For example , bacterial 16S ribosomal RNAs contains approximately 30 phylogenetically conserved hairpins ( 2 ) . A hairpin forms when the phosphodiester backbone folds back on itself to form a double - helical tract ( called the stem ) , leaving unpaired nucleotides to form a single - stranded region , called the loop . Hairpin loops represent the most extensively studied RNA structure motif ( apart from double helices ) . Small hairpin loops contain a high degree of structure , whereas longer loops ( containing more than 7 to 8 unpaired nucleotides , such as those present in transfer RNA ) are generally more poorly structured and thermodynamically less stable . Most loops in ribosomal RNA are small , 4 to 9 nucleotides in length , perhaps reflecting these thermodynamic preferences . 1.1 . Tetraloops Hairpins containing four nucleotides ( tetraloops ) are unusually common in cellular RNAs , and their sequences cluster within three exceptionally common families : UNCG , GNRA , and CUUG ( where N is any of four nucleotides and R is a purine ) . For example , 70 % of all tetraloops in 16S - like ribosomal RNAs from all organisms belong to the UNCG and GNRA families . The exceptionally common tetraloop structures have high thermodynamic stabilities , UNCG being the most stable . Capping a double - helical tract with a UNCG tetraloop is thermodynamically equivalent to extending the double - helical stem by two base pairs . Despite the differences in sequence , there are extensive structural similarities between these three families . In each of them , the first and last unpaired nucleotides form non- Watson - Crick base pairs to close the loop , reducing the number of unpaired nucleotides to only two . Longer loops , such as those found in tRNA , preserve extensive base stacking interactions that presumably stabilize the loop structure , but are generally characterized by significant conformational flexibility . 1.2 . Bulges and Internal Loops Bulges and internal loops form when two double - helical tracts are separated on either one ( bulge ) or both strands ( internal loops ) by one or more unpaired nucleotides . Internal loops containing equal numbers of bases on each strand are symmetric , whereas they are asymmetric when the number of bases are different . For example , single base mismatches are symmetric internal loops of two nucleotides . The presence of an internal loop or bulge reduces the thermodynamic stability , when compared to a perfect double helix , but unpaired nucleotides are more readily accessible to protein or nucleic acid ligands , which often recognize such sites . Non-Watson - Crick base pairs readily form within internal loops , while unpaired nucleotides within a bulge may stack within the helix or be bulged outside . The presence of an internal loop or bulge can induce bending in an RNA molecule ; the extent of bending depends on the RNA sequence within the loop and can change upon ligand binding ( 6 , 7 ) . Thus , these motifs are ideal sites for conformational switches , where ligand binding can result in long - range conformational changes . 2 . Tertiary Structure of RNA Interactions between two or more secondary structure elements give rise to RNA tertiary structure and define the overall folding of RNA molecules . In essentially all cases investigated thus far , RNA secondary structure elements maintain their three - dimensional structure even when extracted from very complex tertiary structures . Noncanonical base pairs , unpaired bases , and the backbone functional groups ( the negatively charged phosphate groups and the unique 2 - hydroxyl group of RNA ) are very important for tertiary interactions . Unpaired bases can twist or flip out of an helical patch to define unique surfaces for recognition by other RNAs during formation of the tertiary structure . The RNA secondary structure helps in orienting key residues into appropriate positions for tertiary interactions to occur . For example , the geometry of the four - way junction in tRNA , combined with a conserved length of the double - helical regions , help in positioning T-loop and D-loop nucleotides in close proximity to facilitate the tertiary loop - loop base pairs that define the L shape of all tRNAs ( 8 ) . Tertiary interactions often consist of base stacking and hydrogen bond interactions . Helical stacking between the terminal base pairs of two helices enables the building of the molecule into an extended helix ( coaxial stacking ) ( Fig. 1 ) . A common example of a structural module built upon base - stacking interactions is provided by the adenosine platform motif . Consecutive adenine bases within an internal loop can form a pseudo - A-A non - Watson - Crick base pair , to create a platform capable of mediating long - range tertiary interactions ( 9 ) . Base triplets form when a preformed base pair becomes involved in another set of hydrogen bonds with a third base ( 8 ) ; this can occur on either the minor groove or major groove side of an RNA double helix . Hydrogen bonds between bases and backbones are observed when double helices are packed together in compact structures ( 10 ) . Finally , divalent metal ions , especially hydrated magnesium ions , are often used to screen the negatively charged phosphate groups along the helical backbone , in order to build a compactly folded structure with close packing of negatively charged phosphates ( 11 ) . Unpaired nucleotides embedded within a secondary structure motif often form tertiary structures by interacting with unpaired nucleotides from another secondary structure module . These interactions can involve any secondary structure motif : hairpin loops , internal loops , and bulge loops . The nature of the tertiary contacts can be intercalation , base triplet formation , and Watson - Crick base pairing between complementary loop sequences . The loop-loop interaction module is best illustrated by the tertiary interaction of tRNA ( 8 ) . The folding of tRNA is initiated by the formation of four hairpin loops via Watson - Crick base pairing , resulting in the organization of a four - way helical junction . Tertiary interactions , by helical stacking , further organize the tRNA into two extended helical domains . This arrangement positions all unpaired residues in the loop regions close in space and facilitates the formation of the tertiary base pairing and base triplets that lock the tRNA into the L-shaped three - dimensional structure . 2.1 . Pseudoknots Pseudoknots form when complementary primary sequences of a hairpin or internal loop and a single - stranded region interact with each other by Watson - Crick base pairing ( 12 ) . When a pseudoknot forms between a hairpin loop and a complementary single - stranded region , then formation of two alternative hairpin structures can occur ( Fig. 1 ) . The formation of a pseudoknot creates an extended helical region through helical stacking of the hairpin double - helical stem and the newly formed loop- loop interaction helix . Although the pseudoknot is only marginally more stable than the two hairpins , tertiary interactions ( such as base triplets ) between unpaired nucleotides in the bridging loops and between base pairs within the extended helix can increase the stability of this structure . 2.2 . Magnesium Ions Double-helical regions must be packed together to build compact RNA structures , as found for example in the catalytic core of catalytic RNA ribozymes . This process is opposed by the strong electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged phosphate groups . RNA molecules overcome this repulsion through the direct or indirect coordination of divalent metal ions . In group I self - splicing introns , a magnesium - organized ion core containing five magnesium ions constructs an exterior surface that facilitates the close packing of noncanonical loops into the minor groove of a double helix . Within the interior of this ion core , base - stacking and hydrogen- bonding interactions between nucleotides form specific metal ion binding sites ( 10 , 11 ) . 3 . Quaternary Structure of RNA There are relatively few well - characterized examples of the association of RNA molecules to form supramolecular quaternary structures , but these are relatively important . For example , during pre-mRNA splicing , messenger RNAs associate with five major ribonucleoprotein ( RNP ) particles called small nuclear RNPs ; such snRNPs interact with each other and with mRNAs . These interactions and their dynamic disruption and formation by means of RNA - RNA quaternary interactions are essential for RNA splicing to occur ( 13 ) . In most examples characterized thus far , the quaternary association of RNA molecules occurs by conventional Watson - Crick base pairing . For example , small regulatory RNAs with longer complementary sequences within RNA molecules ( antisense RNAs ) form intermolecular duplexes during the control of gene expression in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes ( 14 ) . Similarly , guide RNA recognizes complementary sequences to identify sites where mRNAs are edited post-transcriptionally ( 15 ) ( see RNA Editing ) . Although more complex RNA quaternary structures do not rely exclusively on Watson - Crick pairing , base pairs are still very important . So - called \" kissing - hairpins \" form between self - complementary loop nucleotides in two stem - loop structures ( 16 , 17 ) . These structures provide protein-recognition sites during the regulation of prokaryotic plasmid copy number , and possibly during the dimerization of the HIV genome . The best-characterized example of supramolecular association of RNA molecules by means of non- Watson - Crick interactions is provided by so-called \" G-quartet structures \" ( 18 ) . These structures form readily in vitro for RNA and DNA sequences containing stretches of guanidines or uracils ( 18 ) , but it is not clear whether these structures occur at all in vivo . 4 . Summary In conclusion , formation of Watson - Crick base pairs provide a simple structural code of RNA secondary structure formation , and helical pairing can be predicted very successfully by phylogeny and thermodynamics . As demonstrated for the first time by tRNA , tertiary interactions between the secondary structural elements fold RNA molecules into their three - dimensional structures . Helical regions generally define the RNA secondary structure . Tertiary contacts between secondary structure regions of the RNA , often involving nucleotides in single - stranded regions , fold the RNA into its three - dimensional structure .

RNA molecules adopt diverse structures in response to these functional requirements . RNA has a covalent structure very similar to that of DNA , the only differences being the change from a 2 ' - deoxyribose sugar in DNA to a ribose sugar in RNA and from a methyl group in thymidine to a hydrogen atom in uracil . However , their functional differences lead to correspondingly different structures . The requirement for storage of genetic information imposes the double - helical structure on most DNA molecules , whereas RNA molecules adopt an array of structures to rival protein structures in their complexity . This is not the result of an intrinsic limitation of DNA stereochemistry , but rather the result of different functional requirements . It is convenient to describe RNA structure in hierarchical terms ( Fig. 1 ) , comparable to those used in describing protein structure : primary , secondary , tertiary , and quaternary structures . The primary structure refers to the sequence of an RNA molecule . Unlike proteins , which in most cases function only when properly folded , many RNAs function as unstructured , single-stranded species . For example , messenger RNA must be unfolded for the genetic message to be translated , and stable RNA secondary structures inhibit protein biosynthesis . Figure 1 . Hierarchy of RNA folding . ( a) The primary structure corresponds to the RNA sequence . ( b , and c) The secondary structure ( in this case , two stem - loops or hairpins ) form by Watson - Crick base pairing between complementary nucleotides . ( d) Tertiary interactions ( coaxial stacking of double helices ) lead to the final three - dimensional structure ( in this case , a pseudoknot ) . 1 . Secondary Structure of RNA Secondary structure in DNA and RNA is dominated by Watson - Crick base pairing , leading to the formation of double - helical structures of varying length . Isolated base pairs are not thermodynamically stable , but formation of several consecutive base pairs readily occurs , resulting in a variety of possible arrangements ( Fig. 2 ) . These so- called secondary structure motifs represent the building blocks through which the most complex RNA three - dimensional structures are constructed . There is a fundamental difference between RNA and protein structures . Protein secondary structure is generally only marginally stable in the absence of stabilizing tertiary structure interactions , whereas RNA secondary structure is often stable on its own . Thus , formation of the secondary structure dominates the process of RNA folding , and RNA tertiary structure forms through relatively weak interactions between pre-formed secondary structure motives . Because of this property , RNA secondary structure can often be predicted successfully from thermodynamics Figure 2. RNA secondary structure motifs . ( a) Duplexes ; ( b) Single -stranded regions ; ( c ) hairpins ; ( d ) bulges ; ( e ) internal loops . RNA secondary structure is dominated by the formation of double helices stabilized by Watson - Crick base pairs between complementary stretches . Unlike DNA , these helices are relatively short , seldom more than 8 to 10 base pairs in length , and are interrupted by single - stranded nucleotides ( 1 ) or phylogeny ( 2 ) . forming loop elements : hairpins , bulges , and internal loops ( Fig. 2 ) . These , together with the helical junction that is formed when more than two double helices come together , are the secondary structure motives and the building blocks upon which the most complex RNA structures are built . In many RNAs , more than half of all nucleotides are incorporated into double - stranded helices . Duplex regions can form through very long - range interactions , and these interactions are crucial to determine and stabilize the overall fold of an RNA molecule . For example , opposite strands in double helices within ribosomal RNA can be separated by as many as 2000 nucleotides . In RNA , G-U pairs are almost as common as the canonical G - C or A -U base pairs , and they introduce slight distortions in double - helical structure that are recognized by proteins and other RNAs ( 3 , 4 ) . RNA ( and DNA ) double helices have an antiparallel right - handed helical conformation . RNA double helices adopt the A-form structure , which differs significantly from the canonical B-form adopted by DNA double helices ( see DNA Structure ) . RNA duplex structures are not uniform , although their variability is less than that in DNA . These variations depend on the sequence and structural context of the helix relative to the global three - dimensional structure . A-form double helices differ from B-DNA in the conformation of the sugar and the displacement of the bases from the helical axis . These local differences lead to very diverse shapes , with profound consequences for recognition by proteins and other ligands ( 5 ) . The most common element of RNA secondary structure is the hairpin ( or stem - loop ) ( Fig. 2 ) . For example , bacterial 16S ribosomal RNAs contains approximately 30 phylogenetically conserved hairpins ( 2 ) . A hairpin forms when the phosphodiester backbone folds back on itself to form a double - helical tract ( called the stem ) , leaving unpaired nucleotides to form a single - stranded region , called the loop . Hairpin loops represent the most extensively studied RNA structure motif ( apart from double helices ) . Small hairpin loops contain a high degree of structure , whereas longer loops ( containing more than 7 to 8 unpaired nucleotides , such as those present in transfer RNA ) are generally more poorly structured and thermodynamically less stable . Most loops in ribosomal RNA are small , 4 to 9 nucleotides in length , perhaps reflecting these thermodynamic preferences . 1.1 . Tetraloops Hairpins containing four nucleotides ( tetraloops ) are unusually common in cellular RNAs , and their sequences cluster within three exceptionally common families : UNCG , GNRA , and CUUG ( where N is any of four nucleotides and R is a purine ) . For example , 70 % of all tetraloops in 16S - like ribosomal RNAs from all organisms belong to the UNCG and GNRA families . The exceptionally common tetraloop structures have high thermodynamic stabilities , UNCG being the most stable . Capping a double - helical tract with a UNCG tetraloop is thermodynamically equivalent to extending the double - helical stem by two base pairs . Despite the differences in sequence , there are extensive structural similarities between these three families . In each of them , the first and last unpaired nucleotides form non- Watson - Crick base pairs to close the loop , reducing the number of unpaired nucleotides to only two . Longer loops , such as those found in tRNA , preserve extensive base stacking interactions that presumably stabilize the loop structure , but are generally characterized by significant conformational flexibility . 1.2 . Bulges and Internal Loops Bulges and internal loops form when two double - helical tracts are separated on either one ( bulge ) or both strands ( internal loops ) by one or more unpaired nucleotides . Internal loops containing equal numbers of bases on each strand are symmetric , whereas they are asymmetric when the number of bases are different . For example , single base mismatches are symmetric internal loops of two nucleotides . The presence of an internal loop or bulge reduces the thermodynamic stability , when compared to a perfect double helix , but unpaired nucleotides are more readily accessible to protein or nucleic acid ligands , which often recognize such sites . Non-Watson - Crick base pairs readily form within internal loops , while unpaired nucleotides within a bulge may stack within the helix or be bulged outside . The presence of an internal loop or bulge can induce bending in an RNA molecule ; the extent of bending depends on the RNA sequence within the loop and can change upon ligand binding ( 6 , 7 ) . Thus , these motifs are ideal sites for conformational switches , where ligand binding can result in long - range conformational changes . 2 . Tertiary Structure of RNA Interactions between two or more secondary structure elements give rise to RNA tertiary structure and define the overall folding of RNA molecules . In essentially all cases investigated thus far , RNA secondary structure elements maintain their three - dimensional structure even when extracted from very complex tertiary structures . Noncanonical base pairs , unpaired bases , and the backbone functional groups ( the negatively charged phosphate groups and the unique 2 - hydroxyl group of RNA ) are very important for tertiary interactions . Unpaired bases can twist or flip out of an helical patch to define unique surfaces for recognition by other RNAs during formation of the tertiary structure . The RNA secondary structure helps in orienting key residues into appropriate positions for tertiary interactions to occur . For example , the geometry of the four - way junction in tRNA , combined with a conserved length of the double - helical regions , help in positioning T-loop and D-loop nucleotides in close proximity to facilitate the tertiary loop - loop base pairs that define the L shape of all tRNAs ( 8 ) . Tertiary interactions often consist of base stacking and hydrogen bond interactions . Helical stacking between the terminal base pairs of two helices enables the building of the molecule into an extended helix ( coaxial stacking ) ( Fig. 1 ) . A common example of a structural module built upon base - stacking interactions is provided by the adenosine platform motif . Consecutive adenine bases within an internal loop can form a pseudo - A-A non - Watson - Crick base pair , to create a platform capable of mediating long - range tertiary interactions ( 9 ) . Base triplets form when a preformed base pair becomes involved in another set of hydrogen bonds with a third base ( 8 ) ; this can occur on either the minor groove or major groove side of an RNA double helix . Hydrogen bonds between bases and backbones are observed when double helices are packed together in compact structures ( 10 ) . Finally , divalent metal ions , especially hydrated magnesium ions , are often used to screen the negatively charged phosphate groups along the helical backbone , in order to build a compactly folded structure with close packing of negatively charged phosphates ( 11 ) . Unpaired nucleotides embedded within a secondary structure motif often form tertiary structures by interacting with unpaired nucleotides from another secondary structure module . These interactions can involve any secondary structure motif : hairpin loops , internal loops , and bulge loops . The nature of the tertiary contacts can be intercalation , base triplet formation , and Watson - Crick base pairing between complementary loop sequences . The loop-loop interaction module is best illustrated by the tertiary interaction of tRNA ( 8 ) . The folding of tRNA is initiated by the formation of four hairpin loops via Watson - Crick base pairing , resulting in the organization of a four - way helical junction . Tertiary interactions , by helical stacking , further organize the tRNA into two extended helical domains . This arrangement positions all unpaired residues in the loop regions close in space and facilitates the formation of the tertiary base pairing and base triplets that lock the tRNA into the L-shaped three - dimensional structure . 2.1 . Pseudoknots Pseudoknots form when complementary primary sequences of a hairpin or internal loop and a single - stranded region interact with each other by Watson - Crick base pairing ( 12 ) . When a pseudoknot forms between a hairpin loop and a complementary single - stranded region , then formation of two alternative hairpin structures can occur ( Fig. 1 ) . The formation of a pseudoknot creates an extended helical region through helical stacking of the hairpin double - helical stem and the newly formed loop- loop interaction helix . Although the pseudoknot is only marginally more stable than the two hairpins , tertiary interactions ( such as base triplets ) between unpaired nucleotides in the bridging loops and between base pairs within the extended helix can increase the stability of this structure . 2.2 . Magnesium Ions Double-helical regions must be packed together to build compact RNA structures , as found for example in the catalytic core of catalytic RNA ribozymes . This process is opposed by the strong electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged phosphate groups . RNA molecules overcome this repulsion through the direct or indirect coordination of divalent metal ions . In group I self - splicing introns , a magnesium - organized ion core containing five magnesium ions constructs an exterior surface that facilitates the close packing of noncanonical loops into the minor groove of a double helix . Within the interior of this ion core , base - stacking and hydrogen- bonding interactions between nucleotides form specific metal ion binding sites ( 10 , 11 ) . 3 .
