Pombo ( Printer Friendly ) This August my family and I rented an RV and set out to explore the West . We spent two weeks on vacation , stopping along the way to enjoy the splendor of many of our national parks . As we came upon Rocky Mountain National Park in western Colorado , we were overcome by the majesty of those peaks . It is still easy to see what inspired poet Katharine Lee Bates to pen the song , ' America the Beautiful ' more than a century ago . America 's parks are the envy of nations . Capturing our natural and cultural heritage , they showcase a cache that includes everything from one of the seven natural wonders of the world to lighthouses that remain active aids to navigation . Attracting more than 300 million people last year alone , it is not surprising that visitors to our parks give their experience a 95 % approval rating . Most Americans do n't even know that the system 's 388 units include parks , preserves , historical sites , battlefields , monuments and seashores . On Wednesday , the National Parks Conservation Association published a list of 10 parks in need of repair . Among them are the nation 's first park , Yellowstone , Shenandoah National Park in Virginia , and Biscayne National Park in Florida . The list also includes the Underground Railroad Network to Freedom , which covers 26 states and Washington , D.C. , reflecting an effort to safeguard a rich and critical part of our national heritage . Gratefully , President Bush is making good on his pledge to preserve and protect park resources . His administration has already slated nearly $ 2.9 billion to address the maintenance backlog since 2002 . So far , this has funded nearly 900 repair and rehabilitation projects , with another 500 projects under way . Last year the Park Service spent $ 2.1 million in Yellowstone alone . Following a decade of disregard , the current administration inherited a parks system in utter disarray . President Bush has already dedicated 40 % more annually to addressing the backlog than during the eight years Clinton was in office . While effectively ignoring a growing list of needed repairs and facilities management , the Clinton administration chose instead to cling to its penchant for grabbing up land rather than preserving icons like Yellowstone . Ironically , environmental extremists and their allies in Congress continue to advocate a policy of unbridled land acquisition at the expense of a world - class parks system , while at the same time attacking the Bush Administration 's record on cleaning up the parks . Recklessly adding more land to the system increases the burden on budgets , facilities and staff , thus perpetuating a vicious cycle . This cycle must stop . In July , Interior Secretary Gale Norton announced a new program to inventory and prioritize all of the units managed by the Park Service , including the millions of acres hastily added and then neglected by the last administration . This program is the first - ever effort to triage and systematically improve all of our parks , from Yosemite National Park to the Yucca House National Monument . For the first time , the Park Service is articulating clearly and consistently its priorities , the investment needed to sustain them , and their respective rates of deterioration . Rather than simply writing a blank check , the Assets Management Program finally enables experts to monitor and fix the most pressing problems first .

Pombo ( Printer Friendly ) This August my family and I rented an RV and set out to explore the West . We spent two weeks on vacation , stopping along the way to enjoy the splendor of many of our national parks . As we came upon Rocky Mountain National Park in western Colorado , we were overcome by the majesty of those peaks . It is still easy to see what inspired poet Katharine Lee Bates to pen the song , ' America the Beautiful ' more than a century ago . America 's parks are the envy of nations . Capturing our natural and cultural heritage , they showcase a cache that includes everything from one of the seven natural wonders of the world to lighthouses that remain active aids to navigation . Attracting more than 300 million people last year alone , it is not surprising that visitors to our parks give their experience a 95 % approval rating . Most Americans do n't even know that the system 's 388 units include parks , preserves , historical sites , battlefields , monuments and seashores . On Wednesday , the National Parks Conservation Association published a list of 10 parks in need of repair . Among them are the nation 's first park , Yellowstone , Shenandoah National Park in Virginia , and Biscayne National Park in Florida . The list also includes the Underground Railroad Network to Freedom , which covers 26 states and Washington , D.C. , reflecting an effort to safeguard a rich and critical part of our national heritage . Gratefully , President Bush is making good on his pledge to preserve and protect park resources . His administration has already slated nearly $ 2.9 billion to address the maintenance backlog since 2002 . So far , this has funded nearly 900 repair and rehabilitation projects , with another 500 projects under way . Last year the Park Service spent $ 2.1 million in Yellowstone alone . Following a decade of disregard , the current administration inherited a parks system in utter disarray . President Bush has already dedicated 40 % more annually to addressing the backlog than during the eight years Clinton was in office . While effectively ignoring a growing list of needed repairs and facilities management , the Clinton administration chose instead to cling to its penchant for grabbing up land rather than preserving icons like Yellowstone . Ironically , environmental extremists and their allies in Congress continue to advocate a policy of unbridled land acquisition at the expense of a world - class parks system , while at the same time attacking the Bush Administration 's record on cleaning up the parks . Recklessly adding more land to the system increases the burden on budgets , facilities and staff , thus perpetuating a vicious cycle . This cycle must stop . In July , Interior Secretary Gale Norton announced a new program to inventory and prioritize all of the units managed by the Park Service , including the millions of acres hastily added and then neglected by the last administration . This program is the first - ever effort to triage and systematically improve all of our parks , from Yosemite National Park to the Yucca House National Monument . For the first time , the Park Service is articulating clearly and consistently its priorities , the investment needed to sustain them , and their respective rates of deterioration . Rather than simply writing a blank check , the Assets Management Program finally enables experts to monitor and fix the most pressing problems first . As the National Park Service is charged with creating a premiere system of parks , our commitment to care for this very unique resource is a stewardship that must be taken seriously . However , policies of the past and those driven by radical environmentalists do not recognize that our parks must be maintained for the public to visit and enjoy . Common sense dictates that we carefully manage our crown jewels and reaffirm public access in order to guarantee family vacation memories for generations to come . ### As Chairman of the House Resources Committee , Pombo has jurisdiction over the National Park Service in Congress .","annotations":[{"text":"my family","span":[88,96],"token_span":[14,15],"role":"Lessee","label":"Lessee","role_definition":"The individual that gains temporary use of the Goods by paying the Lessor"},{"text":"I","span":[102,102],"token_span":[17,17],"role":"Lessee","label":"Lessee","role_definition":"The individual that gains temporary use of the Goods by paying the Lessor"},{"text":"an RV","span":[111,115],"token_span":[19,20],"role":"Goods","label":"Goods","role_definition":"The role Goods is an item which is temporarily exchanged for Money in a transaction."},{"text":"This August","span":[76,86],"token_span":[12,13],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the event occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-1641-302-frame-Renting","frame":"Renting","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Lessee gains the use of Goods owned by a Lessor by payment to the Lessor.","frame_ancestors":["Commerce_buy","Getting","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"In Texas , Direct Energy offers a pre-paid electricity plan , Power - To - Go .

Raymour & Flanigan spokesperson Elisabeth Dwyer said the new store occupies a 38,000 - square - foot portion of what used to be the first floor of Sears , which has been an anchor store for Morris County 's largest shopping destination since it opened in September 1977 . The store has its own outside entrance , separate from the outside and inside entrances to Sears , and signs have been erected on the outside of the building . \" We felt it was a great location for our customers and our brand , \" Dwyer said . We are excited to be in that market and serving our customers in the area as we continue to expand . \" The company currently is planning for a formal grand opening later in August after what they called a \" soft-opening \" over the weekend . \u201c We are thrilled to welcome Raymour & Flanigan to our expansive collection of retailers at Rockaway Townsquare , \" mall owners Simon Properties announced in a statement released on Friday . \" Raymour & Flanigan 's fine home furnishings are the perfect complement to the retail mix and we believe shoppers will be pleased and impressed by its furniture and accessories for every room . \u201d Dwyer was unaware if Raymour & Flanigan had ever opened a store leasing space from another existing store that is still open . The Rockaway Township Planning Board approved the company 's application for minor site plan tenancy and associated variances in June of 2015 . Raymour & Flanigan operates 111 stores in seven northeast states , including 19 in New Jersey . The closest stores to Morris County are currently in Bridgewater and on Route 46 in Fairfield , where it operates both a standard store and a clearance center . Like many national department store chains , Sears has struggled in recent years due to the economic slowdown and competition from both so - called \" big - box \" retailers like Costco and increasing Internet sales . For Sears , this transaction at Rockaway Townsquare mall could help bring in more revenue and customers to the store . \u201c During the last seven years , we have executed a number of these transactions that serve as an additional revenue stream , drive efficiency in our store operations and bring in increased customer traffic , \u201d said Howard Riefs , a spokesperson for Sears Holdings , based in Hoffman Estates , Illinois , which owns retail store brands Sears and Kmart . The deal with Raymour & Flanigan is an example of the holding company 's real estate strategy where \u201c we right - size our stores through leasing a portion of our real estate to great complementary tenants , \u201d said Riefs . \u201c We have done this across the country with other retailers such as Primark , Whole Foods , DICK 's Sporting Goods , Nordstrom Rack , Forever 21 , Corner Bakery , West Elm , ALDI and others . \u201d Riefs said the company leased approximately 38,000 square feet on the lower level of the Sears store at Rockaway Townsquare mall , then turned the raw space over to Raymour & Flanigan . The furniture retailer then reconfigured the internal space and external appearance for their needs , designing it with a separate entrance for Raymour & Flanigan customers and no internal connection between the two stores , according to Riefs . \u201c We then reconfigured the Sears store to better serve our customers and members , \u201d he said .

Raymour & Flanigan spokesperson Elisabeth Dwyer said the new store occupies a 38,000 - square - foot portion of what used to be the first floor of Sears , which has been an anchor store for Morris County 's largest shopping destination since it opened in September 1977 . The store has its own outside entrance , separate from the outside and inside entrances to Sears , and signs have been erected on the outside of the building . \" We felt it was a great location for our customers and our brand , \" Dwyer said . We are excited to be in that market and serving our customers in the area as we continue to expand . \" The company currently is planning for a formal grand opening later in August after what they called a \" soft-opening \" over the weekend . \u201c We are thrilled to welcome Raymour & Flanigan to our expansive collection of retailers at Rockaway Townsquare , \" mall owners Simon Properties announced in a statement released on Friday . \" Raymour & Flanigan 's fine home furnishings are the perfect complement to the retail mix and we believe shoppers will be pleased and impressed by its furniture and accessories for every room . \u201d Dwyer was unaware if Raymour & Flanigan had ever opened a store leasing space from another existing store that is still open . The Rockaway Township Planning Board approved the company 's application for minor site plan tenancy and associated variances in June of 2015 . Raymour & Flanigan operates 111 stores in seven northeast states , including 19 in New Jersey . The closest stores to Morris County are currently in Bridgewater and on Route 46 in Fairfield , where it operates both a standard store and a clearance center . Like many national department store chains , Sears has struggled in recent years due to the economic slowdown and competition from both so - called \" big - box \" retailers like Costco and increasing Internet sales . For Sears , this transaction at Rockaway Townsquare mall could help bring in more revenue and customers to the store . \u201c During the last seven years , we have executed a number of these transactions that serve as an additional revenue stream , drive efficiency in our store operations and bring in increased customer traffic , \u201d said Howard Riefs , a spokesperson for Sears Holdings , based in Hoffman Estates , Illinois , which owns retail store brands Sears and Kmart . The deal with Raymour & Flanigan is an example of the holding company 's real estate strategy where \u201c we right - size our stores through leasing a portion of our real estate to great complementary tenants , \u201d said Riefs . \u201c We have done this across the country with other retailers such as Primark , Whole Foods , DICK 's Sporting Goods , Nordstrom Rack , Forever 21 , Corner Bakery , West Elm , ALDI and others . \u201d Riefs said the company leased approximately 38,000 square feet on the lower level of the Sears store at Rockaway Townsquare mall , then turned the raw space over to Raymour & Flanigan . The furniture retailer then reconfigured the internal space and external appearance for their needs , designing it with a separate entrance for Raymour & Flanigan customers and no internal connection between the two stores , according to Riefs . \u201c We then reconfigured the Sears store to better serve our customers and members , \u201d he said . Sears announced in April that it would close 78 stores , 10 under the Sears brand and the rest being Kmart and SuperK stores that the company also owns and operates . None of those shuttered stores were located in New Jersey .

Allied Properties Real Estate Investment Trust said it will invest $ 30 - million in the downtown Toronto building , as it renovates some 168,000 square feet of space to make way for the telecommunications gear that help the city 's downtown businesses access the Internet . The 1.5 million square foot building has been sitting about a third empty for years , as cutbacks at the public broadcaster have reduced its need for space . It has had difficulty leasing the space because zoning rules restrict it to government employees \u2013 but having it serve as a data hub gets around those issues . Allied Properties REIT already owns buildings around the CBC , including a nearby property that is one of the largest Internet hubs in North America .

Will state suffer from lack of climate action ? After keeping a climate study secret for nearly two years , South Carolina 's wildlife agency publicly released the report in the spring of 2013 amid criticism that it had bottled up the information for political reasons . The study called on the wildlife department to take a leadership role in addressing a variety of climate - related problems \u2014 ranging from the invasion of exotic wildlife to extensive flooding \u2014 that were expected as temperatures increase , rains fall harder and seas rise . But the wildlife department report was n't the only study to call for action on climate in South Carolina . Five years earlier , a special task force appointed by Gov. Mark Sanford recommended more than 50 ways to stop rising greenhouse gas pollution from worsening global warming . Today , those reports remain on the shelf in a state where residents are increasingly feeling the uncomfortable effects of climate change . Criticized by powerful electric utilities and political appointees , the studies never resulted in a comprehensive state climate strategy to guide South Carolina leaders as the globe warms . Unlike North Carolina , South Carolina 's failure to develop a comprehensive climate plan means the state has no overall effort to cut greenhouse gas pollution , limit sprawl or educate the public on how to adapt to the changing climate . And while the state has made strides in encouraging the use of solar power , the future of solar expansion in South Carolina remains unresolved . Why is this important ? Powerful changes to the landscape are rippling across South Carolina . Rising seas , in part the result of warmer water and melting glaciers , are flooding coastal property in Charleston and sending salty water farther up rivers near Georgetown , threatening to spread disease . Four hurricanes and a major flood in the past five years , suspected to be linked to global warming , have swamped South Carolina , killing more than 30 people , pushing toxins into yards and causing billions of dollars in damage . Nichols , a tiny town in eastern South Carolina , has been flooded so frequently it resembles a ghost town . Heavy rains , a sign of the earth 's changing climate , have flooded crops in rural communities at key harvest times , causing state financial bailouts to farmers . Between those times of intense precipitation , extended periods of dry weather have put a strain on groundwater that Aiken-area residents need for drinking . At the same time , increasingly hot summers are making life miserable , if not outright dangerous , for inner city Columbia residents who ca n't afford to run air conditioning . \u201c We are vulnerable , '' said former Department of Natural Resources chief John Frampton , who was forced out as director more than a year before the wildlife agency 's climate report was finally released . \u201c We happen to have one of the most valuable environmental habitats of any state on the East Coast . Absolutely we ought to be looking at that . Why not ? '' Hamilton Davis , a former energy director at the S.C. Coastal Conservation League , said South Carolina leaders are n't thinking enough about addressing climate change on a broad - scale . \u201c We are not having that conversation in South Carolina today because there is no vision , no expectation that is driving this , '' said Davis , now an executive with a solar energy company . \u201c What we 're doing is a little bit ad hoc and kind of piecemeal . '' Ideally , a climate action strategy would include two key components : a comprehensive initiative to cut greenhouse emissions and an effort to systematically respond to climate - related changes in South Carolina communities , said Trish Jerman , a former state Energy Office official who has tracked climate issues for more than 20 years . Some question whether a small state like South Carolina could have much impact in reducing global greenhouse gas pollution that is causing the earth to warm . But boosters of a statewide plan say the effort would show leadership , and it would dovetail with efforts by other states to cut emissions . For now , rather than attacking climate change head - on , South Carolina leaders are taking disjointed steps and often are reacting to the looming crisis , critics say . In some cases , South Carolina leaders have even approved or pushed for rules that could encourage development along flood - prone beaches and rivers . Rollbacks in beachfront protection regulations are among them . Meanwhile , at the local level , some cities that have attempted to address climate change are struggling to carry out their own climate plans without support from the state or federal governments . Davis said the state should pay attention to North Carolina 's efforts . North Carolina 's comprehensive climate strategy , put in place by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper about two years ago , includes goals to put thousands of zero emission vehicles on the road , reduce energy use in state offices , cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent below 2005 levels and brace for the effects of climate change in North Carolina communities . Cooper also formed a climate commission to make sure the comprehensive effort to address climate change stays on course . South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster , a Republican and booster of President Donald Trump , is cool to the idea of a statewide climate plan , saying it could create more bureaucracy . \u201c No , there is n't any climate plan in South Carolina , but there also does n't need to be one , '' McMaster spokesman Brian Symmes said . \u201c It 's incumbent upon individuals , state agencies , and businesses to do what they can to be good stewards of the environment . Between regulations handed down by the feds , and the free market 's demand for businesses to be environmentally conscious , private industry is more than capable of adapting to a 21st century economy without imposing more regulations . \u201d McMaster 's office said the governor has done plenty . He recently signed a bill to help the solar industry , formed the state Floodwater Commission and supports investing $ 9.3 million in cleaner - running school buses and public buses , his supporters say . McMaster has proposed hiring a chief resilience officer , who would coordinate responses to \u201c future crises as they arise . '' Rising seas and dead trees The way things looked 13 years ago , it appeared South Carolina was on track to develop an aggressive , statewide climate strategy . That 's when Gov. Sanford formed a 28 - member commission to study how rising global temperatures were affecting the state \u2014 and what South Carolina could do about it . Sanford , a maverick Republican and a moderate on environmental issues , said at the time he had seen the effects of climate change on his Beaufort County farm , where pine trees were dying from encroaching salt water and the roots of dead hardwood trees lay exposed in areas flooded by rising sea levels . But the phenomenon was n't unique to his property , making it \u201c very reasonable for us to study climate change and its possible impacts for South Carolina , '' the governor said in an executive order that founded the climate committee . The executive order said global warming could hurt the state 's economy and its quality of life , while costing the state government money . Sanford then persuaded scientists , government officials , business people , farmers , politicians , utility executives and environmentalists to serve on his Climate , Energy and Commerce Advisory Committee . The commission 's formation , however , drew almost immediate criticism from the influential state Chamber of Commerce , which said addressing climate change should be handled at the national level . Then , as the commission began meeting regularly to discuss climate , it became increasingly evident that two of South Carolina 's biggest utilities , SCE&G and state - owned Santee Cooper , did n't like the direction the committee was taking in addressing global warming , some committee members said . Eastern South Carolina 's Progress Energy , now a part of Duke Energy , also was uncomfortable with some of the discussions , records show . Retired state Energy Office chief John Clark , a member of Sanford 's climate task force , said it was clear that utilities with seats on the committee did n't want the state taking aggressive action on climate change . \u201c They actively opposed any requirements for utilities to incorporate renewable energy into the electric utility generation mix , '' Clark said , noting that Duke Energy was the only utility willing to seriously discuss action . Records obtained by The State show that utilities with representatives on Sanford 's climate commission favored using nuclear power over renewable energy to attack greenhouse gas pollution \u2014 a stance that later haunted SCE&G and Santee Cooper . In 2017 , the companies drew the public 's wrath for bungling the V.C. Summer nuclear construction project . The decision to quit the project , which followed years of raising rates to pay for two new reactors northwest of Columbia , ultimately led to the acquisition of a weakened SCE&G by Virginia utility giant Dominion Energy . The companies had spent $ 9 billion when they walked away . In an Aug. 28 , 2008 , letter to climate committee chairman Ben Hagood , then a Republican state representative from Charleston , SCE&G chief executive Kevin Marsh said he could not endorse the entire climate study because some proposals \u201c could have negative consequences for SCE&G 's customers and on South Carolina 's economic competitiveness . '' Despite reticence by utilities , the climate committee eventually hammered out a report that called for reducing greenhouse gases in South Carolina by 5 percent below 1990 levels , a modest goal compared to other states . The goal could be achieved in South Carolina by the target date of 2020 if the state would adopt more than 50 different recommendations , the study said . Sanford 's plan , however , never got very far in the Legislature because power companies let politicians know they were uncomfortable with it , Clark said . Hagood , who retired from the Legislature the same year the Sanford climate report was released , said recommendations from the governor 's committee did n't gain much traction with his colleagues or Sanford . \u201c I do n't think there was the political will to do much at the time , '' he said . Clark lays part of the blame on Sanford , who he said did n't pound the table to get key recommendations approved by the Legislature . \u201c He went from being proactively supporting this to being neutral , '' Clark said Sanford said the climate task force was never intended to be the final say on climate . The idea was to acknowledge the problem and begin discussing it \u201c in the hope that , by doing so , more people will begin to address the obvious , '' said Sanford , who also served in Congress and briefly challenged Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination for president . Dominion Energy declined comment on past SCE&G participation in the Sanford climate panel . But the company said it is committed to addressing climate change with reduced carbon emissions . The company also said it has seen a substantial increase in solar power use in its South Carolina service territory . Santee Cooper also declined comment on its participation in the Sanford committee and on whether the state needs an overall climate plan . The company did say it has closed two coal plants and plans to shutter a third one to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , which should contribute to a 30 percent decrease in carbon dioxide pollution by Santee Cooper , as compared to 2015 . The company says it has shifted its reliance on coal from 77 % in 2008 to 46 % today . Dying on the vine No state agency contacted by The State newspaper has been keeping track of whether any recommendations in the Sanford report have been adopted , but South Carolina has taken some steps that could help lower carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions . The state has adopted two solar friendly laws since 2014 that industry boosters say have helped sun power grow in South Carolina . Energy efficiency also has become more of an emphasis in South Carolina since 2008 as the public has demanded ways to lower some of the nation 's highest electricity bills . But the solar issue remains unresolved in South Carolina , with battles ahead over pricing that could determine whether solar lives or dies in the long - run . And many of the Sanford report 's cornerstone recommendations remain unaddressed by the S.C Legislature , former state Energy Office executives Clark and Jerman said . Among those recommendations was a requirement that utilities rely on renewable energy to supply 5 % of the power they generate and distribute . The proposal - called a renewable portfolio standard , or RPS - was similar to what has been required in other states , including North Carolina . \u201c North Carolina is one of the only states that has an RPS in the Southeast , but a lot of others \u2014 like us \u2014 have done more of a piecemeal approach , '' said Tyson Grinstead , a government affairs representative of the Sunrun solar company . Grinstead said the solar industry is working to expand without a renewable portfolio standard , \u201c but it would be a good thing if South Carolina wanted to do it . '' Today , less than 1 % of the energy produced in South Carolina comes from wind and solar , according to the S.C. Office of Regulatory Staff . Most renewable energy sources are from hydroelectric energy produced by dams , about 2.3 % . In comparison , about 95 % of the energy produced in South Carolina comes from coal , nuclear and natural gas . One of the most important parts of the Sanford climate report was a recommendation that the state update the plan every five years . Jerman , the former energy office official , said that was never done . Clark and fellow Sanford commission panel member Stephen Smith , director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy , said South Carolina could have met the goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels if state leaders had closely followed recommendations . \u201c You not only would have hit the target , you would have exceeded the target , '' Smith said . \u201c There is a certain momentum that takes hold in states that adopt these things . '' South Carolina 's carbon dioxide emissions reached a 30 - year peak in 2004 , at 87 million metric tons , federal statistics show . Since that time , they have dropped to 69 million metric tons , in part because of federal efforts to cut greenhouse gas pollution and increased reliance on natural gas . Still , carbon dioxide emissions in South Carolina have not dropped to 5 percent below 1990 levels , as recommended by the Sanford climate committee , according to statistics from the U.S. Energy Information Administration . South Carolina generates more carbon dioxide pollution than 23 states and roughly the same amount as countries such as Austria , Greece and Israel , according to the Center for Climate Strategies , a Washington , D.C. , group that helped with the Sanford climate report . By failing to embrace the climate report and keep it updated , the state has missed an opportunity to aggressively address climate change , the Southern Alliance 's Smith said . A comprehensive state climate strategy , like the one in North Carolina , is overdue , Smith said . \u201c You would set an aspirational target that is aligning the arrows of state government , \u201d Smith said . \u201c You look at what Roy Cooper 's doing , and there are so many departments and so many agencies ( involved ) . If you can get the power of government in alignment , you can do a lot of good . '' Swamp eels and politics The 2013 Department of Natural Resources report , commissioned under then - agency chief Frampton , presented a chilling assessment about the looming effects of climate change on wildlife and the landscape . Written by an 18 - member study group that included biologists and veteran agency officials , the study said South Carolina should brace for an invasion of exotic wildlife and a loss of native species as temperatures warm and sea levels rise . Warmer temperatures would mean animals , such as Asian swamp eels and other non-native species that have taken hold in Florida , could migrate north to South Carolina , the study said . It warned that some species of fish would dwindle as oxygen levels declined and hotter seawater killed the tiny food sources they thrive on . In addition to the effects on wildlife , the report warned that rising seas and increased flooding would cause troubles for people living along the coast and rivers of South Carolina . The predictions are similar to what 's happening in Charleston , Nichols and other areas today . To tackle these and other future problems , the report said the Department of Natural Resources should take a lead role in educating the public about the threats of global warming and increase climate - related scientific research . It recommended acquiring land to protect habitat , adopting strategies to deal with the effects of climate change on agency properties , developing partnerships with other agencies and \u201c leading by example . '' But the draft study ran into trouble in the summer of 2011 that kept it out of the public eye for nearly two years \u2014 and likely chilled the agency 's enthusiasm for addressing climate change since that time . At a board meeting in Edisto Beach , a remote coastal community well away from the spotlight of the agency 's Columbia headquarters , then - board members Caroline Rhodes and Cary Chastain took issue with the report 's findings . \u201c You do n't want to falsely build a case and scare people , '' Chastain said during the meeting . He could not be reached for comment for this story . Later that year , Rhodes \u2014 appointed as board chairman by Gov. Nikki Haley after Haley took office in 2011 \u2014 led the charge to oust Frampton as Department of Natural Resources director , which deep sixed the climate report . Haley had been elected on a pro-business agenda , raising questions about her commitment to environmental issues . Haley had nothing to do with Frampton 's departure , her office said at the time . But it was never clear why he was pushed out . The report remained hidden , out of the public eye , until The State newspaper reported in 2013 that the study had not been released . The DNR then released the report and sought public comments . Since then , the DNR has used some individual recommendations in the report , but it has not established a specific climate action plan , said Robert Boyles , the agency 's recently appointed director . Cities go it alone With state and federal guidance lacking , some South Carolina 's cities , including Columbia , have announced their own efforts to tackle climate change through plans to use more renewable energy and rely on cleaner burning cars and trucks . Some of the effort comes in response to President Trump 's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord , an international effort to reduce greenhouse gas pollution that is driving up temperatures and causing sea level rise . Columbia has established a goal of the city relying 100 percent on clean and renewable energy during the next 16 years . Major initiatives tackled by the city include building a solar farm to help power Columbia 's wastewater treatment plant , one of the largest users of energy in the city . The city also is updating its water meter system , which will reduce leaks , and it has a systematic plan to take polluting , city - owned vehicles off the road . But the city is n't moving fast enough , say some people who are following the city 's efforts . Columbia has n't completed 42 of the 67 climate goals it has established , according to the city 's website . \u201c The pledge is not the hard thing , '' said Penny Cothran , an organizer with the Sierra Club in South Carolina . \u201c The hard thing is delivering on the pledge . '' The city has plenty of work to do if it wants to reach the clean and renewable energy goal by 2036 . Part of that is persuading Dominion Energy and state electric cooperatives to provide the clean and renewable energy Columbia wants , Cothran said . University of South Carolina professor Lori Ziolkowski , chair of the city 's Climate Protection Action Committee , said that , overall , the city 's plan is n't aggressive enough . Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin , a one - time president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors , said he 's pleased with the city 's efforts , particularly since little leadership on climate is occurring at the federal and state levels . The city is planning to roll out updates to its climate plan this month . Many of the city 's climate goals are still underway , he said . One major effort is restoring a hydroelectric plant that was knocked out during a historic flood that swamped the city in 2015 . When that work is completed , the hydro 's 10 megawatt production should be enough to provide energy for 10,000 homes , the mayor said . Benjamin acknowledged Columbia still has challenges . \u201c There are a number of cities across the state that are doing some things , and across the country , but it 's difficult with a lack of state leadership or federal leadership , '' Benjamin said , noting that \u201c we 're not giving up . '' Cothran , an organizer with the Sierra Club in South Carolina , said that while she 'd like the city to move faster , Columbia 's efforts are appreciated . Columbia is the only city in South Carolina to commit to the Sierra Club 's \u201c Ready for 100 ' ' campaign , the program to use 100 percent renewable energy by 2036 , Cothran said . Rising floodwater Perhaps the closest things to active , statewide climate plans are the state 's energy plan and one produced in 2019 through Gov. McMaster 's office . But neither look comprehensively at a wide range of climate issues , critics say . The governor 's Floodwater Commission report , compiled by a group that includes business people , university professors and state government officials , offers recommendations on how to control flooding caused by rising sea levels and more frequent storms . Among other things , the Floodwater Commission report says the state should protect wetlands , look for environmentally sensitive ways to keep salt marshes from eroding and protect power lines and electrical generating stations . Critics say the report , which exceeds 600 pages , is heavy on background and also includes questionable recommendations . The report does n't say much about other impacts from climate change , such as the threat of increasing forest fires , the advance of disease - carrying insects due to hot weather or how heat is affecting the poor . It also does n't focus on what South Carolina can do to reduce carbon emissions that are among the leading causes of climate change . Chaired by a former hazardous waste industry lobbyist , the commission included recommendations in its report that would allow for an increase in development near lakes and rivers , instead of moving development away from potentially flood - prone areas . The study says the state should consider establishing experimental artificial reefs to limit beach erosion , while building more lakes and channelizing rivers to attack flood problems .

Will state suffer from lack of climate action ? After keeping a climate study secret for nearly two years , South Carolina 's wildlife agency publicly released the report in the spring of 2013 amid criticism that it had bottled up the information for political reasons . The study called on the wildlife department to take a leadership role in addressing a variety of climate - related problems \u2014 ranging from the invasion of exotic wildlife to extensive flooding \u2014 that were expected as temperatures increase , rains fall harder and seas rise . But the wildlife department report was n't the only study to call for action on climate in South Carolina . Five years earlier , a special task force appointed by Gov. Mark Sanford recommended more than 50 ways to stop rising greenhouse gas pollution from worsening global warming . Today , those reports remain on the shelf in a state where residents are increasingly feeling the uncomfortable effects of climate change . Criticized by powerful electric utilities and political appointees , the studies never resulted in a comprehensive state climate strategy to guide South Carolina leaders as the globe warms . Unlike North Carolina , South Carolina 's failure to develop a comprehensive climate plan means the state has no overall effort to cut greenhouse gas pollution , limit sprawl or educate the public on how to adapt to the changing climate . And while the state has made strides in encouraging the use of solar power , the future of solar expansion in South Carolina remains unresolved . Why is this important ? Powerful changes to the landscape are rippling across South Carolina . Rising seas , in part the result of warmer water and melting glaciers , are flooding coastal property in Charleston and sending salty water farther up rivers near Georgetown , threatening to spread disease . Four hurricanes and a major flood in the past five years , suspected to be linked to global warming , have swamped South Carolina , killing more than 30 people , pushing toxins into yards and causing billions of dollars in damage . Nichols , a tiny town in eastern South Carolina , has been flooded so frequently it resembles a ghost town . Heavy rains , a sign of the earth 's changing climate , have flooded crops in rural communities at key harvest times , causing state financial bailouts to farmers . Between those times of intense precipitation , extended periods of dry weather have put a strain on groundwater that Aiken-area residents need for drinking . At the same time , increasingly hot summers are making life miserable , if not outright dangerous , for inner city Columbia residents who ca n't afford to run air conditioning . \u201c We are vulnerable , '' said former Department of Natural Resources chief John Frampton , who was forced out as director more than a year before the wildlife agency 's climate report was finally released . \u201c We happen to have one of the most valuable environmental habitats of any state on the East Coast . Absolutely we ought to be looking at that . Why not ? '' Hamilton Davis , a former energy director at the S.C. Coastal Conservation League , said South Carolina leaders are n't thinking enough about addressing climate change on a broad - scale . \u201c We are not having that conversation in South Carolina today because there is no vision , no expectation that is driving this , '' said Davis , now an executive with a solar energy company . \u201c What we 're doing is a little bit ad hoc and kind of piecemeal . '' Ideally , a climate action strategy would include two key components : a comprehensive initiative to cut greenhouse emissions and an effort to systematically respond to climate - related changes in South Carolina communities , said Trish Jerman , a former state Energy Office official who has tracked climate issues for more than 20 years . Some question whether a small state like South Carolina could have much impact in reducing global greenhouse gas pollution that is causing the earth to warm . But boosters of a statewide plan say the effort would show leadership , and it would dovetail with efforts by other states to cut emissions . For now , rather than attacking climate change head - on , South Carolina leaders are taking disjointed steps and often are reacting to the looming crisis , critics say . In some cases , South Carolina leaders have even approved or pushed for rules that could encourage development along flood - prone beaches and rivers . Rollbacks in beachfront protection regulations are among them . Meanwhile , at the local level , some cities that have attempted to address climate change are struggling to carry out their own climate plans without support from the state or federal governments . Davis said the state should pay attention to North Carolina 's efforts . North Carolina 's comprehensive climate strategy , put in place by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper about two years ago , includes goals to put thousands of zero emission vehicles on the road , reduce energy use in state offices , cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent below 2005 levels and brace for the effects of climate change in North Carolina communities . Cooper also formed a climate commission to make sure the comprehensive effort to address climate change stays on course . South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster , a Republican and booster of President Donald Trump , is cool to the idea of a statewide climate plan , saying it could create more bureaucracy . \u201c No , there is n't any climate plan in South Carolina , but there also does n't need to be one , '' McMaster spokesman Brian Symmes said . \u201c It 's incumbent upon individuals , state agencies , and businesses to do what they can to be good stewards of the environment . Between regulations handed down by the feds , and the free market 's demand for businesses to be environmentally conscious , private industry is more than capable of adapting to a 21st century economy without imposing more regulations . \u201d McMaster 's office said the governor has done plenty . He recently signed a bill to help the solar industry , formed the state Floodwater Commission and supports investing $ 9.3 million in cleaner - running school buses and public buses , his supporters say . McMaster has proposed hiring a chief resilience officer , who would coordinate responses to \u201c future crises as they arise . '' Rising seas and dead trees The way things looked 13 years ago , it appeared South Carolina was on track to develop an aggressive , statewide climate strategy . That 's when Gov. Sanford formed a 28 - member commission to study how rising global temperatures were affecting the state \u2014 and what South Carolina could do about it . Sanford , a maverick Republican and a moderate on environmental issues , said at the time he had seen the effects of climate change on his Beaufort County farm , where pine trees were dying from encroaching salt water and the roots of dead hardwood trees lay exposed in areas flooded by rising sea levels . But the phenomenon was n't unique to his property , making it \u201c very reasonable for us to study climate change and its possible impacts for South Carolina , '' the governor said in an executive order that founded the climate committee . The executive order said global warming could hurt the state 's economy and its quality of life , while costing the state government money . Sanford then persuaded scientists , government officials , business people , farmers , politicians , utility executives and environmentalists to serve on his Climate , Energy and Commerce Advisory Committee . The commission 's formation , however , drew almost immediate criticism from the influential state Chamber of Commerce , which said addressing climate change should be handled at the national level . Then , as the commission began meeting regularly to discuss climate , it became increasingly evident that two of South Carolina 's biggest utilities , SCE&G and state - owned Santee Cooper , did n't like the direction the committee was taking in addressing global warming , some committee members said . Eastern South Carolina 's Progress Energy , now a part of Duke Energy , also was uncomfortable with some of the discussions , records show . Retired state Energy Office chief John Clark , a member of Sanford 's climate task force , said it was clear that utilities with seats on the committee did n't want the state taking aggressive action on climate change . \u201c They actively opposed any requirements for utilities to incorporate renewable energy into the electric utility generation mix , '' Clark said , noting that Duke Energy was the only utility willing to seriously discuss action . Records obtained by The State show that utilities with representatives on Sanford 's climate commission favored using nuclear power over renewable energy to attack greenhouse gas pollution \u2014 a stance that later haunted SCE&G and Santee Cooper . In 2017 , the companies drew the public 's wrath for bungling the V.C. Summer nuclear construction project . The decision to quit the project , which followed years of raising rates to pay for two new reactors northwest of Columbia , ultimately led to the acquisition of a weakened SCE&G by Virginia utility giant Dominion Energy . The companies had spent $ 9 billion when they walked away . In an Aug. 28 , 2008 , letter to climate committee chairman Ben Hagood , then a Republican state representative from Charleston , SCE&G chief executive Kevin Marsh said he could not endorse the entire climate study because some proposals \u201c could have negative consequences for SCE&G 's customers and on South Carolina 's economic competitiveness . '' Despite reticence by utilities , the climate committee eventually hammered out a report that called for reducing greenhouse gases in South Carolina by 5 percent below 1990 levels , a modest goal compared to other states . The goal could be achieved in South Carolina by the target date of 2020 if the state would adopt more than 50 different recommendations , the study said . Sanford 's plan , however , never got very far in the Legislature because power companies let politicians know they were uncomfortable with it , Clark said . Hagood , who retired from the Legislature the same year the Sanford climate report was released , said recommendations from the governor 's committee did n't gain much traction with his colleagues or Sanford . \u201c I do n't think there was the political will to do much at the time , '' he said . Clark lays part of the blame on Sanford , who he said did n't pound the table to get key recommendations approved by the Legislature . \u201c He went from being proactively supporting this to being neutral , '' Clark said Sanford said the climate task force was never intended to be the final say on climate . The idea was to acknowledge the problem and begin discussing it \u201c in the hope that , by doing so , more people will begin to address the obvious , '' said Sanford , who also served in Congress and briefly challenged Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination for president . Dominion Energy declined comment on past SCE&G participation in the Sanford climate panel . But the company said it is committed to addressing climate change with reduced carbon emissions . The company also said it has seen a substantial increase in solar power use in its South Carolina service territory . Santee Cooper also declined comment on its participation in the Sanford committee and on whether the state needs an overall climate plan . The company did say it has closed two coal plants and plans to shutter a third one to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , which should contribute to a 30 percent decrease in carbon dioxide pollution by Santee Cooper , as compared to 2015 . The company says it has shifted its reliance on coal from 77 % in 2008 to 46 % today . Dying on the vine No state agency contacted by The State newspaper has been keeping track of whether any recommendations in the Sanford report have been adopted , but South Carolina has taken some steps that could help lower carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions . The state has adopted two solar friendly laws since 2014 that industry boosters say have helped sun power grow in South Carolina . Energy efficiency also has become more of an emphasis in South Carolina since 2008 as the public has demanded ways to lower some of the nation 's highest electricity bills . But the solar issue remains unresolved in South Carolina , with battles ahead over pricing that could determine whether solar lives or dies in the long - run . And many of the Sanford report 's cornerstone recommendations remain unaddressed by the S.C Legislature , former state Energy Office executives Clark and Jerman said . Among those recommendations was a requirement that utilities rely on renewable energy to supply 5 % of the power they generate and distribute . The proposal - called a renewable portfolio standard , or RPS - was similar to what has been required in other states , including North Carolina . \u201c North Carolina is one of the only states that has an RPS in the Southeast , but a lot of others \u2014 like us \u2014 have done more of a piecemeal approach , '' said Tyson Grinstead , a government affairs representative of the Sunrun solar company . Grinstead said the solar industry is working to expand without a renewable portfolio standard , \u201c but it would be a good thing if South Carolina wanted to do it . '' Today , less than 1 % of the energy produced in South Carolina comes from wind and solar , according to the S.C. Office of Regulatory Staff . Most renewable energy sources are from hydroelectric energy produced by dams , about 2.3 % . In comparison , about 95 % of the energy produced in South Carolina comes from coal , nuclear and natural gas . One of the most important parts of the Sanford climate report was a recommendation that the state update the plan every five years . Jerman , the former energy office official , said that was never done . Clark and fellow Sanford commission panel member Stephen Smith , director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy , said South Carolina could have met the goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels if state leaders had closely followed recommendations . \u201c You not only would have hit the target , you would have exceeded the target , '' Smith said . \u201c There is a certain momentum that takes hold in states that adopt these things . '' South Carolina 's carbon dioxide emissions reached a 30 - year peak in 2004 , at 87 million metric tons , federal statistics show . Since that time , they have dropped to 69 million metric tons , in part because of federal efforts to cut greenhouse gas pollution and increased reliance on natural gas . Still , carbon dioxide emissions in South Carolina have not dropped to 5 percent below 1990 levels , as recommended by the Sanford climate committee , according to statistics from the U.S. Energy Information Administration . South Carolina generates more carbon dioxide pollution than 23 states and roughly the same amount as countries such as Austria , Greece and Israel , according to the Center for Climate Strategies , a Washington , D.C. , group that helped with the Sanford climate report . By failing to embrace the climate report and keep it updated , the state has missed an opportunity to aggressively address climate change , the Southern Alliance 's Smith said . A comprehensive state climate strategy , like the one in North Carolina , is overdue , Smith said . \u201c You would set an aspirational target that is aligning the arrows of state government , \u201d Smith said . \u201c You look at what Roy Cooper 's doing , and there are so many departments and so many agencies ( involved ) . If you can get the power of government in alignment , you can do a lot of good . '' Swamp eels and politics The 2013 Department of Natural Resources report , commissioned under then - agency chief Frampton , presented a chilling assessment about the looming effects of climate change on wildlife and the landscape . Written by an 18 - member study group that included biologists and veteran agency officials , the study said South Carolina should brace for an invasion of exotic wildlife and a loss of native species as temperatures warm and sea levels rise . Warmer temperatures would mean animals , such as Asian swamp eels and other non-native species that have taken hold in Florida , could migrate north to South Carolina , the study said . It warned that some species of fish would dwindle as oxygen levels declined and hotter seawater killed the tiny food sources they thrive on . In addition to the effects on wildlife , the report warned that rising seas and increased flooding would cause troubles for people living along the coast and rivers of South Carolina . The predictions are similar to what 's happening in Charleston , Nichols and other areas today . To tackle these and other future problems , the report said the Department of Natural Resources should take a lead role in educating the public about the threats of global warming and increase climate - related scientific research . It recommended acquiring land to protect habitat , adopting strategies to deal with the effects of climate change on agency properties , developing partnerships with other agencies and \u201c leading by example . '' But the draft study ran into trouble in the summer of 2011 that kept it out of the public eye for nearly two years \u2014 and likely chilled the agency 's enthusiasm for addressing climate change since that time . At a board meeting in Edisto Beach , a remote coastal community well away from the spotlight of the agency 's Columbia headquarters , then - board members Caroline Rhodes and Cary Chastain took issue with the report 's findings . \u201c You do n't want to falsely build a case and scare people , '' Chastain said during the meeting . He could not be reached for comment for this story . Later that year , Rhodes \u2014 appointed as board chairman by Gov. Nikki Haley after Haley took office in 2011 \u2014 led the charge to oust Frampton as Department of Natural Resources director , which deep sixed the climate report . Haley had been elected on a pro-business agenda , raising questions about her commitment to environmental issues . Haley had nothing to do with Frampton 's departure , her office said at the time . But it was never clear why he was pushed out . The report remained hidden , out of the public eye , until The State newspaper reported in 2013 that the study had not been released . The DNR then released the report and sought public comments . Since then , the DNR has used some individual recommendations in the report , but it has not established a specific climate action plan , said Robert Boyles , the agency 's recently appointed director . Cities go it alone With state and federal guidance lacking , some South Carolina 's cities , including Columbia , have announced their own efforts to tackle climate change through plans to use more renewable energy and rely on cleaner burning cars and trucks . Some of the effort comes in response to President Trump 's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord , an international effort to reduce greenhouse gas pollution that is driving up temperatures and causing sea level rise . Columbia has established a goal of the city relying 100 percent on clean and renewable energy during the next 16 years . Major initiatives tackled by the city include building a solar farm to help power Columbia 's wastewater treatment plant , one of the largest users of energy in the city . The city also is updating its water meter system , which will reduce leaks , and it has a systematic plan to take polluting , city - owned vehicles off the road . But the city is n't moving fast enough , say some people who are following the city 's efforts . Columbia has n't completed 42 of the 67 climate goals it has established , according to the city 's website . \u201c The pledge is not the hard thing , '' said Penny Cothran , an organizer with the Sierra Club in South Carolina . \u201c The hard thing is delivering on the pledge . '' The city has plenty of work to do if it wants to reach the clean and renewable energy goal by 2036 . Part of that is persuading Dominion Energy and state electric cooperatives to provide the clean and renewable energy Columbia wants , Cothran said . University of South Carolina professor Lori Ziolkowski , chair of the city 's Climate Protection Action Committee , said that , overall , the city 's plan is n't aggressive enough . Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin , a one - time president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors , said he 's pleased with the city 's efforts , particularly since little leadership on climate is occurring at the federal and state levels . The city is planning to roll out updates to its climate plan this month . Many of the city 's climate goals are still underway , he said . One major effort is restoring a hydroelectric plant that was knocked out during a historic flood that swamped the city in 2015 . When that work is completed , the hydro 's 10 megawatt production should be enough to provide energy for 10,000 homes , the mayor said . Benjamin acknowledged Columbia still has challenges . \u201c There are a number of cities across the state that are doing some things , and across the country , but it 's difficult with a lack of state leadership or federal leadership , '' Benjamin said , noting that \u201c we 're not giving up . '' Cothran , an organizer with the Sierra Club in South Carolina , said that while she 'd like the city to move faster , Columbia 's efforts are appreciated . Columbia is the only city in South Carolina to commit to the Sierra Club 's \u201c Ready for 100 ' ' campaign , the program to use 100 percent renewable energy by 2036 , Cothran said . Rising floodwater Perhaps the closest things to active , statewide climate plans are the state 's energy plan and one produced in 2019 through Gov. McMaster 's office . But neither look comprehensively at a wide range of climate issues , critics say . The governor 's Floodwater Commission report , compiled by a group that includes business people , university professors and state government officials , offers recommendations on how to control flooding caused by rising sea levels and more frequent storms . Among other things , the Floodwater Commission report says the state should protect wetlands , look for environmentally sensitive ways to keep salt marshes from eroding and protect power lines and electrical generating stations . Critics say the report , which exceeds 600 pages , is heavy on background and also includes questionable recommendations . The report does n't say much about other impacts from climate change , such as the threat of increasing forest fires , the advance of disease - carrying insects due to hot weather or how heat is affecting the poor . It also does n't focus on what South Carolina can do to reduce carbon emissions that are among the leading causes of climate change . Chaired by a former hazardous waste industry lobbyist , the commission included recommendations in its report that would allow for an increase in development near lakes and rivers , instead of moving development away from potentially flood - prone areas . The study says the state should consider establishing experimental artificial reefs to limit beach erosion , while building more lakes and channelizing rivers to attack flood problems . In one case , the study suggests developing a lake in rural Marion County , where the small community of Nichols is located . \u201c I certainly would not describe it as a plan addressing climate change , at all , '' said Barry Beasley , a retired DNR biologist who is among a group of scientists critical of the Floodwater Commission report . \u201c Climate change is a much bigger issue than flooding .

Photo : Mick Nicholson collection This bridge has been constructed to replace a wrought iron swing bridge , erected by Thomas Cabry in 1853 , to carry the Victoria , or East Dock , Railway over the River Hull upon which river is founded the ancient town ( now city ) of Kingston-upon - Hull . The dock which gave the name to this railway , and which is now known as the Victoria Dock , lies to the east of the river , and north of the ancient citadel , whilst the railway , originally skirting the northern suburbs of the town from east to west , at the present time passes through the thickly populated districts of Sculcoates , Southcoates and Drypool , and forms connection with the subsequently formed railways leading to the seaside resorts of Hornsea and Withernsea . The railway traffic was very busy and the North Eastern Railway company experienced great difficulty in passing it over the old single - line bridge , particularly as the speed and axle loads were both restricted , although the bridge had been strengthened more than once to meet the more modern requirements . The new bridge is designed for a double - line railway . The Hull Corporation agreed with the railway company to provide , at the Corporation 's cost , a public footway , and this is carried on brackets on the north side of the bridge . The new bridge was built in close proximity to the old one , notwithstanding that it involved interference with the working of the old bridge , thus necessitating the construction of a temporary foundation on the east bank of the river at a point just clear of the old bridge when opened for river traffic , and of the east abutment of the new bridge . A site , either north or south , which would not interfere with the swinging of the old bridge , would have involved sharp curves in the railway and very great cost by interference with important buildings . Captured on 25th October 1906 , the original bridge is seen still in position , with the new one under construction in the background . Photo : Mick Nicholson collection The clear waterway of the old bridge was 37ft 6in , whereas in the new bridge it is 53 ft 6in , and provision has also been made under the east , or land , arm for an additional waterway of 40ft in connection with the future widening of the river . The increase in the waterway necessitated a considerable amount of dredging of the river bed , the setting back of the west abutment , and the provision of a substantial river wall about 100 yards long . A clearer idea of what we wish to convey will be gained by reference to the photograph above , which shows the old bridge in the foreground . The far bank of the river is the east bank . The particular design adopted for the new bridge was largely determined by local conditions . The rail level over the new bridge was fixed by the public road level crossing at the west end of the bridge . It was not possible to raise this level more than 12in , and maintain the road traffic over the crossing . The depth for construction of the steelwork was limited by the height of the water level in the river during floods , the highest recorded flood level being 15.38 ft above Ordnance datum , and 4.20 ft below the new rail level . By adopting the method of carrying the bridge on a centre pivot a considerable saving in depth was obtained over the usual method of construction of rollers , with an upper and lower roller path . | || | Click this icon for a higher resolution version ( 385 kB ) | | The bridge is built on a skew of 75deg 33min , is 160 ft over all , and is 29 ft 6in wide centre to centre of main girders . The main girders have plate- webs , and are hog - backed , being 14ft deep at the centre , and 7ft at the ends . The bridge floor consists of rail bearers with cross girders . At the centre of the bridge there are two special cross girders designed to transmit the whole weight of the bridge , by means of a forged steel crosshead and two steel suspension bolts , to the centre pivot upon which the bridge turns . The steel crosshead and the cast iron centre pivot were tested after manufacture with a proof load of 1,000 tons , and the two suspension bolts and the two special cross girders received a proof load of 500 tons each . These proof loads were intended to be 50 per cent in excess of the greatest load to be carried . The bridge was completed on the temporary foundation , above referred to , on the east bank of the river , and after completion it was intended to balance it there previous to moving it to the permanent position ; but owing to a settlement which took place under the temporary centre pier , this could not be done . Its position during erection may be seen in the photograph above , behind the old bridge . The bridge ( including machinery ) , when completed , was moved into position along a specially constructed path , consisting of a double row of piles with waybeams , and a double line of rails under each main girder . The bridge was carried by eight six- wheeled bogies placed as close to the centre of the bridge as possible , four under each main girder . They were designed to carry a load of 90 tons each . In order that the centre pivot , when travelling with the bridge , should clear the east abutment and top of the roller - path on the centre pier , it was necessary to erect and launch the bridge at a level 3 ft 10in higher than it would occupy upon the permanent site . The bridge being hauled into position . Photo : Mick Nicholson collection The bridge was hauled into position by a wire cable attached to a locomotive , the power being increased about 12 to 1 by means of blocks etc . The bridge moved freely when travelling . Some delay , however , was caused by two of the rails upon which the bridge was travelling breaking just at the edge of the abutment . These breakages also caused one of the tyres to be sheared off one of the bogies under each main girder . The bridge , when brought into position on the centre pier , was lowered by means of four hydraulic jacks , placed two on each side of the centre pier , under the ends of cross girders 9 and 12 , the position of the bridge being finally adjusted by sliding it on greased rails , plates , and rollers by means of jacks placed on the centre pier . The bridge may be seen in position while being hauled in the photograph above ; below is the old bridge removed from its foundation . The old bridge removed from its foundation . Photo : Mick Nicholson collection The total weight of steel and ironwork in the bridge is about 460 tons , and the launching weight about 500 tons . The bridge was finally balanced after it was lowered on to its permanent site . A general description of this bridge having been given , a more detailed account of the turning gear and the way in which the bridge is manipulated will be interesting . A steel roller path , with eight steadying rollers , is provided . The arrangement of the rollers and centre pivot is shown in the diagram above . If it should be necessary at any time to take the weight of the bridge off the centre pivot in order to renew the bearing discs etc , sufficient rollers have been provided to enable the bridge to be turned as usual , the four centre cross girders being specially designed to take the abnormal loads induced thereby . The centre pivot and rollers are also shown in the photograph below . Arrangement of the centre pivot and rollers . Photo : Mick Nicholson collection At each end of the bridge , under the bottom flanges of the main girders , wedges sliding into rest plates at the corners of the two abutments are provided to take out the droop of the bridge after swinging , and to fix the bridge in position for railway traffic . These are shown below . The centre pier , which carries the centre pivot and the roller path , is constructed entirely of 6 to 1 concrete , as are also the two abutments , and the foundations are carried down to the clay which overlies the chalk . This clay is approximately 22 ft thick . These foundations are about 19ft below Ordnance datum and approximately 21ft below low- water level . Owing to the proximity of the new bridge to the old one , and also to the nature of the material passed through - this material being silt and warp - great anxiety was caused during the sinking of these foundations , and special precautions were taken by means of trestles , strutting , and tying back the centre pier and abutments of the existing bridge , to prevent settlement or movement as far as possible . It was only possible to use a single - walled cofferdam for the centre pier , and this , composed of 12in by 12 in piles tongued and grooved , stood very well . As the level of the roller path is 12.55 ft , and the highest recorded flood level 15.38 ft Ordnance datum , it has been necessary to surround the top of the centre pier with a cast iron shield 3 ft 6in high , thoroughly caulked and made watertight to keep the spring tides from overflowing into the centre pier . An interior view of the overhead cabin . Photo : Mick Nicholson collection The machinery for inserting and withdrawing the wedges and for turning the bridge is carried in an overhead cabin . An interior view is provided above . The machinery for operating the bridge and withdrawing the wedges by power is in duplicate , and has interchangeable hand - gear for turning the bridge and withdrawing the wedges . The motive power is electricity , supplied by the Hull Corporation . It is conveyed across the river by means of an overhead armoured cable , supported by two steel lattice masts 150 ft high , the end of the cable being dropped through the roof of the overhead cabin . The motors , which may be seen in the figures previously referred to , are series wound , and were made by Messrs Siemens Brothers and Co Limited . They are each capable of developing 30 horse - power at 440 volts , and revolve at 240 revolutions per minute . Each motor is fitted with a double - pole switch and automatic cut - out and fuses , and is controlled by a Siemens ' controller with gridiron resistances . For swinging the bridge , these motors can be worked together , but each motor must be worked by its own controller . The commutator is made of hard - drawn copper , and should stand an inch of wear before it requires to be renewed . The brushes are of carbon , and sparking is guaranteed not to take place until 50 per cent above the estimated load is reached ( 45 horse - power ) . The switch - board , which is also fitted for lighting purposes , has the necessary ampere-meter and volt-meter , and was made by Messrs Siemens Brothers . The bracket carrying the bevel - wheel and pinion , which transmit the power down to the circular rack on the top of the foundations , are shown with the wheel and pinion below . The horse - power required to work the bridge is approximately as follows - | | | Withdrawing wedges || | 17.7 hp | | 13.25 hp | Swinging bridge || | 26.5 hp | | 17.7hp | Inserting wedges || | 13hp | | 14.75 hp | | The bridge was opened and closed 30 times at an expenditure of 12 \u00bd electrical units . The average time per cycle was two minutes . In order to facilitate the withdrawal of the wedges by hand when required , by taking the weight of the bridge off the wedges , two hydraulic rams are provided at each end of the bridge . They may be seen in the diagram below . The pump for actuating the rams is in the overhead cabin , and may be seen on the right - hand side of the turning gear . The overhead cabin also contains the necessary levers for working and locking up the bridge . The bridge is in charge of an experienced mechanic , assisted by two steersmen , who divide the duties into three shifts . Three signal boxes control the working of the bridge , two being outpost boxes 345 yards and 455 yards respectively from the centre of the bridge , and the other , the Sculcoates station box , near the west end of the bridge , being for the central control and also for the station and level crossing . | | | | | | When the bridge is to be opened for river traffic , the bridgeman by bell cable notifies the signalman in Sculcoates station box , who , if no train has been accepted , places his levers , when not already so placed , to the normal position , pulls over a lever to release the bridge , and by a plunging instrument indicates to the bridgeman that the bridge is free for working . The bridgeman will then back - lock the releasing lever in Sculcoates station box , operate the levers which work the latch - bolt of the bridge to disengage the signal rodding , and finally withdraw the wedges and turn the bridge . Special lock and block instruments with plungers are provided at Sculcoates station box , and instruments without plungers at the outpost boxes . The dials of the instruments give the usual indications of the state of the section or trains in both directions , and bells are also provided for indicating the class of train in the usual way . Directly the signalman at either of the outpost boxes replaces the signal for the line leading to the bridge to \u201c Danger \u201d , the signal levers become automatically locked , and cannot again be pulled over until the Sculcoates station signalman plunges his instrument to release the lever electrically . The signals for the lines approaching the bridge at all the three boxes are so electrically controlled by the wedges of the bridge that the signal arms will not fall to the \u201c All right \u201d or \u201c off \u201d position until the wedges are fully home ; and if the wedges are partially withdrawn during the time any signal is \u201c off \u201d , the movement will cause the arms to be placed to the \u201c on \u201d or \u201c Danger \u201d position . Telephones connect the three signal boxes , and also connect the overhead cabin with Sculcoates station box . The north side of the finished structure , showing the public footway .

Photo : Mick Nicholson collection This bridge has been constructed to replace a wrought iron swing bridge , erected by Thomas Cabry in 1853 , to carry the Victoria , or East Dock , Railway over the River Hull upon which river is founded the ancient town ( now city ) of Kingston-upon - Hull . The dock which gave the name to this railway , and which is now known as the Victoria Dock , lies to the east of the river , and north of the ancient citadel , whilst the railway , originally skirting the northern suburbs of the town from east to west , at the present time passes through the thickly populated districts of Sculcoates , Southcoates and Drypool , and forms connection with the subsequently formed railways leading to the seaside resorts of Hornsea and Withernsea . The railway traffic was very busy and the North Eastern Railway company experienced great difficulty in passing it over the old single - line bridge , particularly as the speed and axle loads were both restricted , although the bridge had been strengthened more than once to meet the more modern requirements . The new bridge is designed for a double - line railway . The Hull Corporation agreed with the railway company to provide , at the Corporation 's cost , a public footway , and this is carried on brackets on the north side of the bridge . The new bridge was built in close proximity to the old one , notwithstanding that it involved interference with the working of the old bridge , thus necessitating the construction of a temporary foundation on the east bank of the river at a point just clear of the old bridge when opened for river traffic , and of the east abutment of the new bridge . A site , either north or south , which would not interfere with the swinging of the old bridge , would have involved sharp curves in the railway and very great cost by interference with important buildings . Captured on 25th October 1906 , the original bridge is seen still in position , with the new one under construction in the background . Photo : Mick Nicholson collection The clear waterway of the old bridge was 37ft 6in , whereas in the new bridge it is 53 ft 6in , and provision has also been made under the east , or land , arm for an additional waterway of 40ft in connection with the future widening of the river . The increase in the waterway necessitated a considerable amount of dredging of the river bed , the setting back of the west abutment , and the provision of a substantial river wall about 100 yards long . A clearer idea of what we wish to convey will be gained by reference to the photograph above , which shows the old bridge in the foreground . The far bank of the river is the east bank . The particular design adopted for the new bridge was largely determined by local conditions . The rail level over the new bridge was fixed by the public road level crossing at the west end of the bridge . It was not possible to raise this level more than 12in , and maintain the road traffic over the crossing . The depth for construction of the steelwork was limited by the height of the water level in the river during floods , the highest recorded flood level being 15.38 ft above Ordnance datum , and 4.20 ft below the new rail level . By adopting the method of carrying the bridge on a centre pivot a considerable saving in depth was obtained over the usual method of construction of rollers , with an upper and lower roller path . | || | Click this icon for a higher resolution version ( 385 kB ) | | The bridge is built on a skew of 75deg 33min , is 160 ft over all , and is 29 ft 6in wide centre to centre of main girders . The main girders have plate- webs , and are hog - backed , being 14ft deep at the centre , and 7ft at the ends . The bridge floor consists of rail bearers with cross girders . At the centre of the bridge there are two special cross girders designed to transmit the whole weight of the bridge , by means of a forged steel crosshead and two steel suspension bolts , to the centre pivot upon which the bridge turns . The steel crosshead and the cast iron centre pivot were tested after manufacture with a proof load of 1,000 tons , and the two suspension bolts and the two special cross girders received a proof load of 500 tons each . These proof loads were intended to be 50 per cent in excess of the greatest load to be carried . The bridge was completed on the temporary foundation , above referred to , on the east bank of the river , and after completion it was intended to balance it there previous to moving it to the permanent position ; but owing to a settlement which took place under the temporary centre pier , this could not be done . Its position during erection may be seen in the photograph above , behind the old bridge . The bridge ( including machinery ) , when completed , was moved into position along a specially constructed path , consisting of a double row of piles with waybeams , and a double line of rails under each main girder . The bridge was carried by eight six- wheeled bogies placed as close to the centre of the bridge as possible , four under each main girder . They were designed to carry a load of 90 tons each . In order that the centre pivot , when travelling with the bridge , should clear the east abutment and top of the roller - path on the centre pier , it was necessary to erect and launch the bridge at a level 3 ft 10in higher than it would occupy upon the permanent site . The bridge being hauled into position . Photo : Mick Nicholson collection The bridge was hauled into position by a wire cable attached to a locomotive , the power being increased about 12 to 1 by means of blocks etc . The bridge moved freely when travelling . Some delay , however , was caused by two of the rails upon which the bridge was travelling breaking just at the edge of the abutment . These breakages also caused one of the tyres to be sheared off one of the bogies under each main girder . The bridge , when brought into position on the centre pier , was lowered by means of four hydraulic jacks , placed two on each side of the centre pier , under the ends of cross girders 9 and 12 , the position of the bridge being finally adjusted by sliding it on greased rails , plates , and rollers by means of jacks placed on the centre pier . The bridge may be seen in position while being hauled in the photograph above ; below is the old bridge removed from its foundation . The old bridge removed from its foundation .

Though called the Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle , the project has evolved well beyond a straightforward replacement for the aging Light Armored Vehicle ( LAV ) into a networked family of manned vehicles , ground robots , and drones , collectively capable of not only reconnaissance but also electronic warfare and long - range precision strikes . Industry response has been overwhelming . Interested companies have submitted some 282 white papers and counting , deputy commandant Lt. Gen. Robert Walsh said last week . These are n't just traditional prime contractors proposing manned vehicles , but a host of smaller companies proposing also unmanned systems , sensors , networks , EW , weapons , and more , Walsh and his staff said . The Office of Naval Research ( ONR ) , which is running the $ 42 million science , technology , and prototyping effort for the Marines , has actually had to push back deadlines to sort through this embarrassment of riches . That 's a stark contrast to the Marines ' first stab at the Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle , when a small number of big contractors proposed modest improvements on the 1980s - vintage LAV . \u201c The reason we did this ( i.e. reboot the program and work with ONR ) : I was n't seeing the bright ideas coming from industry , \u201d Walsh said . By contrast , the former fighter pilot said , \u201c I could see it on F - 35 , \u201d which started in the 1990s as a stealthy strike fighter but has evolved into an electronic / cyber warfare platform that can gather and \u201c fuse \u201d a vast amount of data to guide the rest of the force . Walsh wanted to see the same ferment of new tactics and technologies for ground reconnaissance . Now , by all accounts , he 's getting it . Big Ambitions The Marines have big ambitions for the ARV . \u201c The vehicle should be able to launch a UAS ( Unmanned Aerial System ) , scout deep , and then use precision fires ( and ) electronic warfare , \u201d Walsh said last week . Speaking , at the Modular Open Systems Summit , he emphasized the importance of an open architecture design that could be \u201c constantly \u201d upgraded with new technologies as they become available . What kinds of technologies ? His staff and online materials for a January 9 industry day lay out a long wishlist : - the ability to operate for extended periods with minimal resupply , part of the emerging Army and Marine Corps focus on \u201c distributed operations \u201d where units disperse and keep on the move to avoid presenting easy targets for precision strikes . - better amphibious performance than the current LAV while remaining as easy to transport on landing craft ( four vehicles per LCAC hovercraft ) . - an arsenal of medium - caliber automatic cannon ( e.g. 30 mm ) for lightly armored targets , anti-armor firepower for heavy tanks , long - range missiles ( the Israeli Spike ) or kamikaze drones ( Switchblade ) for targets over the horizon , and some means to shoot down enemy drones . ( The systems in parentheses were listed in the industry day briefings as examples , not mandates ) . - advanced long - range sensors and a secure communications network to share the data they collect , even in the face of enemy jamming and hacking . - electronic warfare capability to detect , classify , and jam enemy transmissions , to include downing drones by scrambling their control links . - Active Protection Systems , like the Israeli Trophy APS now being studied by the Army , to shoot down incoming anti-tank warheads before they hit , as well as unspecified counter - IED ( Improvised Explosive Device ) defenses . - passenger capacity for scouts who can dismount and fight on foot ( the current LAV carries six , but the number for ARV is not yet fixed ) . Now , not all of this equipment has to fit on one vehicle . Even the current LAV exists in multiple variants for different missions : armed troop carrier , mobile command post , mortar carrier , anti-tank , anti-aircraft , and so on . The future ARV , likewise , will be the basis of \u201c Next Generation Armored Reconnaissance Family of Vehicles , \u201d the briefing materials say . And those vehicles will be accompanied by multiple types of unmanned air and ground vehicles , including a small ( Group 1 ) recon / kamikaze drone and larger ( Group 3 ) drones for long - range recon and to air- drop mini-robots to scout targets at ground level . This kind of complex integration of different systems , emphasizing different ways to gather information , is increasingly typical of US defense programs , not just in the Marine Corps . \u201c The general approach reflects a consistent theme across the services , i.e. attempts to leverage modern technologies involving sensors , communications , and information fusing / analysis to make operators more aware of their environment and forces more effective in general , \u201d said Dakota Wood , a retired Marine now with the Heritage Foundation . \u201c Whether that can be done at acceptable cost and in a reasonable period of time remains to be seen . \u201d Can They Do It ? Can the Marine Corps , the smallest service , pull together all these disparate technologies into a successful program ? With its plan for a family of manned vehicles supported by drones and ground robots , all networked together to share data , the Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle sounds a little like the Army 's cancelled Future Combat Systems , which has become a byword for overreach . ARV looks a lot more likely to succeed , however , said one experienced observer of ground force modernization programs . \u201c It 's much less ambitious than FCS , though , and it will be bought in fairly small numbers , \u201d the source said . The Marines only aim to buy 500 ARVs \u2014 plus associated drones and robots \u2014 which is a relatively small number for a defense program . On a technical level , the source said , \u201c a wheeled vehicle is much less ambitious ( than a tracked one as in FCS ) , \u201d and that 's what the Marines will probably build . There are plenty of wheeled armored vehicles available on the market today , including the Army 's 8\u00d78 Stryker , itself the big brother of the Marines ' LAV , in turn a descendant of the Swiss MOWAG Piranha . Italian and Singaporean designs are currently competing for the Marines ' Amphibious Combat Vehicle ( ACV , not to be confused with ARV or for that matter AAV ) . All these vehicles are basically bulletproof boxes capable of being reconfigured for a wide range of missions , so the ARV program does n't need to invent some radically new vehicle to carry its capabilities , as FCS tried to . Likewise , there are a lot of different drones available that can perform the missions called for in the ARV briefing materials . Ground robotics are n't as advanced , but at least the Marines are only looking at scout bots , rather than armed remote- controlled vehicles as in the Army 's Next Generation Combat Vehicle program .

Though called the Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle , the project has evolved well beyond a straightforward replacement for the aging Light Armored Vehicle ( LAV ) into a networked family of manned vehicles , ground robots , and drones , collectively capable of not only reconnaissance but also electronic warfare and long - range precision strikes . Industry response has been overwhelming . Interested companies have submitted some 282 white papers and counting , deputy commandant Lt. Gen. Robert Walsh said last week . These are n't just traditional prime contractors proposing manned vehicles , but a host of smaller companies proposing also unmanned systems , sensors , networks , EW , weapons , and more , Walsh and his staff said . The Office of Naval Research ( ONR ) , which is running the $ 42 million science , technology , and prototyping effort for the Marines , has actually had to push back deadlines to sort through this embarrassment of riches . That 's a stark contrast to the Marines ' first stab at the Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle , when a small number of big contractors proposed modest improvements on the 1980s - vintage LAV . \u201c The reason we did this ( i.e. reboot the program and work with ONR ) : I was n't seeing the bright ideas coming from industry , \u201d Walsh said . By contrast , the former fighter pilot said , \u201c I could see it on F - 35 , \u201d which started in the 1990s as a stealthy strike fighter but has evolved into an electronic / cyber warfare platform that can gather and \u201c fuse \u201d a vast amount of data to guide the rest of the force . Walsh wanted to see the same ferment of new tactics and technologies for ground reconnaissance . Now , by all accounts , he 's getting it . Big Ambitions The Marines have big ambitions for the ARV . \u201c The vehicle should be able to launch a UAS ( Unmanned Aerial System ) , scout deep , and then use precision fires ( and ) electronic warfare , \u201d Walsh said last week . Speaking , at the Modular Open Systems Summit , he emphasized the importance of an open architecture design that could be \u201c constantly \u201d upgraded with new technologies as they become available . What kinds of technologies ? His staff and online materials for a January 9 industry day lay out a long wishlist : - the ability to operate for extended periods with minimal resupply , part of the emerging Army and Marine Corps focus on \u201c distributed operations \u201d where units disperse and keep on the move to avoid presenting easy targets for precision strikes . - better amphibious performance than the current LAV while remaining as easy to transport on landing craft ( four vehicles per LCAC hovercraft ) . - an arsenal of medium - caliber automatic cannon ( e.g. 30 mm ) for lightly armored targets , anti-armor firepower for heavy tanks , long - range missiles ( the Israeli Spike ) or kamikaze drones ( Switchblade ) for targets over the horizon , and some means to shoot down enemy drones . ( The systems in parentheses were listed in the industry day briefings as examples , not mandates ) . - advanced long - range sensors and a secure communications network to share the data they collect , even in the face of enemy jamming and hacking . - electronic warfare capability to detect , classify , and jam enemy transmissions , to include downing drones by scrambling their control links . - Active Protection Systems , like the Israeli Trophy APS now being studied by the Army , to shoot down incoming anti-tank warheads before they hit , as well as unspecified counter - IED ( Improvised Explosive Device ) defenses . - passenger capacity for scouts who can dismount and fight on foot ( the current LAV carries six , but the number for ARV is not yet fixed ) . Now , not all of this equipment has to fit on one vehicle . Even the current LAV exists in multiple variants for different missions : armed troop carrier , mobile command post , mortar carrier , anti-tank , anti-aircraft , and so on . The future ARV , likewise , will be the basis of \u201c Next Generation Armored Reconnaissance Family of Vehicles , \u201d the briefing materials say . And those vehicles will be accompanied by multiple types of unmanned air and ground vehicles , including a small ( Group 1 ) recon / kamikaze drone and larger ( Group 3 ) drones for long - range recon and to air- drop mini-robots to scout targets at ground level . This kind of complex integration of different systems , emphasizing different ways to gather information , is increasingly typical of US defense programs , not just in the Marine Corps . \u201c The general approach reflects a consistent theme across the services , i.e. attempts to leverage modern technologies involving sensors , communications , and information fusing / analysis to make operators more aware of their environment and forces more effective in general , \u201d said Dakota Wood , a retired Marine now with the Heritage Foundation . \u201c Whether that can be done at acceptable cost and in a reasonable period of time remains to be seen . \u201d Can They Do It ? Can the Marine Corps , the smallest service , pull together all these disparate technologies into a successful program ? With its plan for a family of manned vehicles supported by drones and ground robots , all networked together to share data , the Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle sounds a little like the Army 's cancelled Future Combat Systems , which has become a byword for overreach . ARV looks a lot more likely to succeed , however , said one experienced observer of ground force modernization programs . \u201c It 's much less ambitious than FCS , though , and it will be bought in fairly small numbers , \u201d the source said . The Marines only aim to buy 500 ARVs \u2014 plus associated drones and robots \u2014 which is a relatively small number for a defense program . On a technical level , the source said , \u201c a wheeled vehicle is much less ambitious ( than a tracked one as in FCS ) , \u201d and that 's what the Marines will probably build . There are plenty of wheeled armored vehicles available on the market today , including the Army 's 8\u00d78 Stryker , itself the big brother of the Marines ' LAV , in turn a descendant of the Swiss MOWAG Piranha . Italian and Singaporean designs are currently competing for the Marines ' Amphibious Combat Vehicle ( ACV , not to be confused with ARV or for that matter AAV ) . All these vehicles are basically bulletproof boxes capable of being reconfigured for a wide range of missions , so the ARV program does n't need to invent some radically new vehicle to carry its capabilities , as FCS tried to . Likewise , there are a lot of different drones available that can perform the missions called for in the ARV briefing materials . Ground robotics are n't as advanced , but at least the Marines are only looking at scout bots , rather than armed remote- controlled vehicles as in the Army 's Next Generation Combat Vehicle program . What 's more , while the Army wants to get its first prototype NGCVs in 2019 ( with tests running through 2024 ) , the Marines do n't plan to get prototype ARVs until late 2023 ( tests will run through 2025 ) . Low- rate initial production of the first 50 vehicles will run from 2026 - 2027 , at which point the first ARV unit will reach Initial Operational Capability ( IOC ) .

We have a lot of practice reconstructing 3D objects from our experiences with TV screens , magazines , photographs , and paintings . However , not only do we incidentally learn to deal with how 2D represents 3D , but many professions train people to make such representations accurate . Thus , architects and home decorators draw sketches of buildings they design for clients or the layout of a room for your dream home . Artistic attempts to depict 3 D in 2D are as old as the caves in Lascaux , the tombs in Egypt , and walls of the villas in Pompeii and as new as Andy Warhol 's canvasses . However , many of the ancient depictions of 3D in 2D are nifty but stylized , as , for example , the way of drawing people in ancient Egyptian art . By the Renaissance professional artists were consciously trying to find ways to make realistic looking representations in 2D of what the eye saw in 3D . Does it surprise you that many of these pioneer artists ( Brunelleschi , Alberti , Veneziano , Piero della Francesca , etc. ) were involved with mathematics as well as art ? Perhaps not , for mathematicians are no less concerned with patterns than artists . What was the challenge that these artists faced ? Clearly 2D is not 3D , so in a broad sense a 3D object must be distorted or transformed to turn it into something 2D . The goal , of course , is that we recognize what the object is from its representation , so the transformed version can not be too different in some ways from the original . This suggests thinking about representing an object in 2D from 3D in terms of the properties that must be given up and those properties that the artist wishes to preserve . If the 3D object is red , there is no reason we can not make our 2D object red , so we do not have to give up color . However , what potentially might have to go ? The Renaissance artists were very sensitive to the issue of what aspects of the original object they wanted to be preserved in the paintings they made . In representing box shaped buildings , the originators of the use of parallel projection and perspective were willing to sacrifice some geometrical information about the original box in order to preserve some other information . For example , one might be willing to distort length , parallelism of lines , angle size , or preservation of area . However , suppose that one wants to preserve the lengths of lines and angles in the representation of the polygons that make up a building . For simplicity we will assume that buildings are convex polyhedra . Is such a representation possible ? The surprising answer is a resounding , \" We are not sure ! \" Perhaps it will also surprise you that one of the early pioneers of developing such a representation was the mathematically inclined artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer ( 1471 - 1528 ) . To understand the situation fully , let us explore further . Consider a simple example of the kind of thing I mean . Perhaps the most familiar of 3 - dimensional convex polyhedra is the cube . The cube can be thought of as a certain combinatorial object , where attention is paid to how its pieces fit together , along with additional geometrical information that involves distances and angles ( so called metrical information ) . Thus , combinatorially , one can think of the cube as a convex polyhedron which has 8 vertices , 12 edges , and 6 faces , where each face is a polygon consisting of 4 sides . A 3-dimensional solid that obeys these conditions I will call a combinatorial cube . Can you visualize the kind of object I am describing ? If you are having trouble visualizing the combinatorial cube , there is a simple way to do this using a geometrical diagram called a graph . A graph is a geometrical tool which involves a collection of points called vertices joined by line segments called edges . The figure below shows some examples of graphs which have been drawn in a plane . In the diagram shown only the small circles represent vertices . If lines cross at points other than vertices , then these crossings are not vertices of the graph . However , not all of these diagrams can correspond to the graph ( sometimes called the 1- skeleton ) of the vertices and edges of 3 - dimensional polyhedra . Can you identify which one can represent a polyhedron ? None of them represents a cube . Below is a whole group of graphs which are each structurally like a cube , and , thus , represent combinatorial cubes . Can you locate in each of these diagrams the 8 vertices , 12 edges , and 6 four-sided regions that correspond to the 6 4- sided polygons ? The top right diagram is especially clear because the edges meet only at vertices . Notice that although you probably recognized the top left diagram as a cube because cubes are often shown this way , there are two pairs of edges of the combinatorial cube which meet at points which are not vertices of the graph . The edges shown crossing in the 2D version do not cross in 3D . There are , in fact , a lot of things that are familiar to you that have this shape : a cereal box , a box - like skyscraper , or a square pyramid with its top cut off parallel to the base ! To this combinatorial information we can add geometric information . One way to add geometric information would be to add information about the lengths of the sides of the polygons . If we say that edges that make up the polyhedron all have length 1 , then we certainly can not be thinking about a truncated pyramid , but it is not yet the solid that is called a cube . Can you visualize a combinatorial cube which is not a cube but where all the edges have the same length ? ( Note : there are ways to measure lengths of distances between points in 3 - dimensional space other than Euclidean distance so when I mention length , I should make clear , as I mean here , that I am talking about Euclidean distance . ) The reason is that what has just been described might have all its faces consisting of rhombuses which are not squares . Can you visualize a combinatorial cube all of whose faces are rhombuses such as the one below ? However , think about the combinatorial cube endowed with all the faces being squares . In this case it is possible to cut along the edges of the cube to release the polygonal faces that make up the cube , thereby drawing a 2D representation with lengths and angles in the faces preserved . Can you visualize the polygon that results from unfolding and flattening out the polygonal faces that make up a cube when the cuts along the dark edges shown below are made ? A polygonal region which can be folded up to form a polyhedron is usually called a net of the polyhedron , and some polyhedra have many nets , in the sense that very different looking polygons will fold to the same 3 - dimensional polyhedron . Can you verify that there are 11 different nets for the cube ? In attempting to open a polyhedron by cutting along its edges so as to be able to flatten it out and open it up into a polygon , one can not choose any edges one wants . Clearly if one cuts along all the edges that surround a face , that face will separate from the rest of the polygons , which is something one wants to avoid . Furthermore , if one does not cut at least one edge at a vertex , one will not be able to release the polygons at that vertex . This means that the edges that one cuts consist of a special kind of graph called a spanning tree of the graph of the polyhedron . A tree is a connected graph which has no circuit . A spanning tree of a graph is a subgraph of the original that includes all the vertices of the original . Some experiments should convince you that many of the polyhedra you are most familiar with such as the regular tetrahedron , the regular octahedron , a square based pyramid , or a triangular prism have nets ; in fact , they have several different ones . The edges of a convex polyhedron which are not part of the spanning tree that one cuts in attempting to produce a net wind up as the lines to fold along in folding the net back up to form the original polyhedron . Can you see how to fold the polygon below ( internal diagonals shown ) into a cube ? The word net of a polyhedron is not defined everywhere in exactly the same way . We will see some problems with the definition as given above shortly . Note that not every diagram that looks like a net is a net ! An example is shown in the diagram below . What goes wrong when you try to fold this diagram into a polyhedron ? However , I am sure that you can convince yourself that a 1 x1x2 brick ( which is a combinatorial cube ) has many nets . The next problem is that the definition that we gave for net is not as well defined as it might seem from the examples of nets one might try , based on ideas about familiar polyhedra such as a regular tetrahedron , a square pyramid , or a triangular prism ( whose faces are equilateral triangles and squares ) . What polyhedron results if you fold the polygon shown below ? You may be surprised to learn that there is not a unique answer to this question ! There are two different ways to fold the polygon shown . One way yields the convex 3 - dimensional solid known as the ( regular ) octahedron . The other solid is non-convex and also consists of eight triangles , so it is an octahedron , too . Below , the earlier polygon is redrawn showing the different gluing instructions for the edges along the boundary which give rise to two different polyhedra . Unfortunately , when one cuts along some spanning trees of the vertex - graph of a 3 - dimensional convex polyhedron , sometimes the result has its polygonal faces overlap . This can occur for surprisingly simple polyhedra , even for ( non-regular ) tetrahedra ! There is an example due to M. Namiki that illustrates this phenomenon . This raises the natural question of whether or not for any convex 3 - dimensional polyhedra there is a spanning tree that one can cut along which will open the polyhedron so that it can be unfolded and flattened out without the polygons making up the polyhedron overlapping . In other words does every convex 3 - dimensional polyhedron have a net ? This question , which seems to have been first raised by the British mathematician G. C. Shephard in 1975 , is still unsolved ! Perhaps some reader can provide a proof or a counterexample . ( This would require find a convex polyhedron such that cutting along every spanning tree would yield an overlapping unfolding . ) A variety of efforts to resolve and get deeper insight into nets for polyhedra has been undertaken . One approach was that of Catherine Schevon , a doctoral student of Joseph O'Rourke ( then in the Computer Science Department at Johns Hopkins and now in the Computer Science Department at Smith College ) . Her work related to finding a way of generating random 3 - dimensional convex polyhedra and then choosing a random unfolding ( not such simple issues ) and seeing if the random unfolding overlapped .

However , in all the cases that were studied it was possible to find an unfolding . A different tack was taken by Wolfram Schlickenrieder , a doctoral student of G\u00fcnther Ziegler .

We have a lot of practice reconstructing 3D objects from our experiences with TV screens , magazines , photographs , and paintings . However , not only do we incidentally learn to deal with how 2D represents 3D , but many professions train people to make such representations accurate . Thus , architects and home decorators draw sketches of buildings they design for clients or the layout of a room for your dream home . Artistic attempts to depict 3 D in 2D are as old as the caves in Lascaux , the tombs in Egypt , and walls of the villas in Pompeii and as new as Andy Warhol 's canvasses . However , many of the ancient depictions of 3D in 2D are nifty but stylized , as , for example , the way of drawing people in ancient Egyptian art . By the Renaissance professional artists were consciously trying to find ways to make realistic looking representations in 2D of what the eye saw in 3D . Does it surprise you that many of these pioneer artists ( Brunelleschi , Alberti , Veneziano , Piero della Francesca , etc. ) were involved with mathematics as well as art ? Perhaps not , for mathematicians are no less concerned with patterns than artists . What was the challenge that these artists faced ? Clearly 2D is not 3D , so in a broad sense a 3D object must be distorted or transformed to turn it into something 2D . The goal , of course , is that we recognize what the object is from its representation , so the transformed version can not be too different in some ways from the original . This suggests thinking about representing an object in 2D from 3D in terms of the properties that must be given up and those properties that the artist wishes to preserve . If the 3D object is red , there is no reason we can not make our 2D object red , so we do not have to give up color . However , what potentially might have to go ? The Renaissance artists were very sensitive to the issue of what aspects of the original object they wanted to be preserved in the paintings they made . In representing box shaped buildings , the originators of the use of parallel projection and perspective were willing to sacrifice some geometrical information about the original box in order to preserve some other information . For example , one might be willing to distort length , parallelism of lines , angle size , or preservation of area . However , suppose that one wants to preserve the lengths of lines and angles in the representation of the polygons that make up a building . For simplicity we will assume that buildings are convex polyhedra . Is such a representation possible ? The surprising answer is a resounding , \" We are not sure ! \" Perhaps it will also surprise you that one of the early pioneers of developing such a representation was the mathematically inclined artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer ( 1471 - 1528 ) . To understand the situation fully , let us explore further . Consider a simple example of the kind of thing I mean . Perhaps the most familiar of 3 - dimensional convex polyhedra is the cube . The cube can be thought of as a certain combinatorial object , where attention is paid to how its pieces fit together , along with additional geometrical information that involves distances and angles ( so called metrical information ) . Thus , combinatorially , one can think of the cube as a convex polyhedron which has 8 vertices , 12 edges , and 6 faces , where each face is a polygon consisting of 4 sides . A 3-dimensional solid that obeys these conditions I will call a combinatorial cube . Can you visualize the kind of object I am describing ? If you are having trouble visualizing the combinatorial cube , there is a simple way to do this using a geometrical diagram called a graph . A graph is a geometrical tool which involves a collection of points called vertices joined by line segments called edges . The figure below shows some examples of graphs which have been drawn in a plane . In the diagram shown only the small circles represent vertices . If lines cross at points other than vertices , then these crossings are not vertices of the graph . However , not all of these diagrams can correspond to the graph ( sometimes called the 1- skeleton ) of the vertices and edges of 3 - dimensional polyhedra . Can you identify which one can represent a polyhedron ? None of them represents a cube . Below is a whole group of graphs which are each structurally like a cube , and , thus , represent combinatorial cubes . Can you locate in each of these diagrams the 8 vertices , 12 edges , and 6 four-sided regions that correspond to the 6 4- sided polygons ? The top right diagram is especially clear because the edges meet only at vertices . Notice that although you probably recognized the top left diagram as a cube because cubes are often shown this way , there are two pairs of edges of the combinatorial cube which meet at points which are not vertices of the graph . The edges shown crossing in the 2D version do not cross in 3D . There are , in fact , a lot of things that are familiar to you that have this shape : a cereal box , a box - like skyscraper , or a square pyramid with its top cut off parallel to the base ! To this combinatorial information we can add geometric information . One way to add geometric information would be to add information about the lengths of the sides of the polygons . If we say that edges that make up the polyhedron all have length 1 , then we certainly can not be thinking about a truncated pyramid , but it is not yet the solid that is called a cube . Can you visualize a combinatorial cube which is not a cube but where all the edges have the same length ? ( Note : there are ways to measure lengths of distances between points in 3 - dimensional space other than Euclidean distance so when I mention length , I should make clear , as I mean here , that I am talking about Euclidean distance . ) The reason is that what has just been described might have all its faces consisting of rhombuses which are not squares . Can you visualize a combinatorial cube all of whose faces are rhombuses such as the one below ? However , think about the combinatorial cube endowed with all the faces being squares . In this case it is possible to cut along the edges of the cube to release the polygonal faces that make up the cube , thereby drawing a 2D representation with lengths and angles in the faces preserved . Can you visualize the polygon that results from unfolding and flattening out the polygonal faces that make up a cube when the cuts along the dark edges shown below are made ? A polygonal region which can be folded up to form a polyhedron is usually called a net of the polyhedron , and some polyhedra have many nets , in the sense that very different looking polygons will fold to the same 3 - dimensional polyhedron . Can you verify that there are 11 different nets for the cube ? In attempting to open a polyhedron by cutting along its edges so as to be able to flatten it out and open it up into a polygon , one can not choose any edges one wants . Clearly if one cuts along all the edges that surround a face , that face will separate from the rest of the polygons , which is something one wants to avoid . Furthermore , if one does not cut at least one edge at a vertex , one will not be able to release the polygons at that vertex . This means that the edges that one cuts consist of a special kind of graph called a spanning tree of the graph of the polyhedron . A tree is a connected graph which has no circuit . A spanning tree of a graph is a subgraph of the original that includes all the vertices of the original . Some experiments should convince you that many of the polyhedra you are most familiar with such as the regular tetrahedron , the regular octahedron , a square based pyramid , or a triangular prism have nets ; in fact , they have several different ones . The edges of a convex polyhedron which are not part of the spanning tree that one cuts in attempting to produce a net wind up as the lines to fold along in folding the net back up to form the original polyhedron . Can you see how to fold the polygon below ( internal diagonals shown ) into a cube ? The word net of a polyhedron is not defined everywhere in exactly the same way . We will see some problems with the definition as given above shortly . Note that not every diagram that looks like a net is a net ! An example is shown in the diagram below . What goes wrong when you try to fold this diagram into a polyhedron ? However , I am sure that you can convince yourself that a 1 x1x2 brick ( which is a combinatorial cube ) has many nets . The next problem is that the definition that we gave for net is not as well defined as it might seem from the examples of nets one might try , based on ideas about familiar polyhedra such as a regular tetrahedron , a square pyramid , or a triangular prism ( whose faces are equilateral triangles and squares ) . What polyhedron results if you fold the polygon shown below ? You may be surprised to learn that there is not a unique answer to this question ! There are two different ways to fold the polygon shown . One way yields the convex 3 - dimensional solid known as the ( regular ) octahedron . The other solid is non-convex and also consists of eight triangles , so it is an octahedron , too . Below , the earlier polygon is redrawn showing the different gluing instructions for the edges along the boundary which give rise to two different polyhedra . Unfortunately , when one cuts along some spanning trees of the vertex - graph of a 3 - dimensional convex polyhedron , sometimes the result has its polygonal faces overlap . This can occur for surprisingly simple polyhedra , even for ( non-regular ) tetrahedra ! There is an example due to M. Namiki that illustrates this phenomenon . This raises the natural question of whether or not for any convex 3 - dimensional polyhedra there is a spanning tree that one can cut along which will open the polyhedron so that it can be unfolded and flattened out without the polygons making up the polyhedron overlapping . In other words does every convex 3 - dimensional polyhedron have a net ? This question , which seems to have been first raised by the British mathematician G. C. Shephard in 1975 , is still unsolved ! Perhaps some reader can provide a proof or a counterexample . ( This would require find a convex polyhedron such that cutting along every spanning tree would yield an overlapping unfolding . ) A variety of efforts to resolve and get deeper insight into nets for polyhedra has been undertaken . One approach was that of Catherine Schevon , a doctoral student of Joseph O'Rourke ( then in the Computer Science Department at Johns Hopkins and now in the Computer Science Department at Smith College ) .

America still is - and probably will remain for a long time - the world 's undisputed leader in military , economic and technological power . However , the politics of austerity at home and pressing realities abroad necessitate a new U.S. foreign policy . The U.S. cannot go it alone . Indeed , the U.S. has been refocusing its foreign policy and Obama has been using the term multilateralism repeatedly . Multilateralism is a prudent strategy for the U.S. and the international system at large , however it is incomplete . Multilateralism has reached its limits when it comes to Iran 's nuclear program , recognition of Palestine , the six party talks on North Korea , and Kosovo 's independence - to name just a few thorny issues . In a world of diminished U.S. involvement and unsuccessful multilateralist endeavors , an alternative vision for global engagement is necessary . Instead we are faced with a reluctant China , an unprepared India , an European Union in the midst of a financial debacle and a host of regional powers that focus on their neighborhood rather than claiming a global role . Given these realities , regional multilateralism can serve as the way out from this dead end . Regionally , the Middle East is as explosive as ever . The Western Balkans are doubtful about their future within the European Union and may again implode . The African continent has many ongoing conflicts and even more potential ones unresolved . In Latin America at least two alternative visions for the region are competing . The Far East is actively searching ways to live with the rise of China . These and other contemporary problems can be better solved at the regional rather than the bilateral or global levels . This context highlights the importance of regional integration and multilateralism . Regional multilateralism is building on these very ideas . Bringing these two together is necessary in today 's world . The buds of regional integration are everywhere in the making but they have not yet been clearly connected with the principles of multilateralism . The EU serves as an example of regional integration and others are following its steps . The African Union has also stepped up its peacekeeping efforts and moved toward further economic integration . However , the quest for regional multilateralism should not be confined by a conventional understanding of geography . For instance , Russia may be a force for stability both in the Far East and Central Asia , China may have a stake in the affairs of Latin America and Africa , and different parts of what we call the Middle East may integrate with parts of Central Asia or Europe . The very prospect of Turkey joining the EU may be a sign of such developments . Cross-regional cooperation is key to regional multilateralism . The transatlantic dialogue model between the U.S. and Europe can and should be exported . For instance , in the Far East the U.S. and the EU both cooperate with ASEAN .

This however did not prevent Russia from establishing the Eurasian Union , in a way reclaiming its sphere of influence . The Middle East , on the other hand , is in dire need of broader - albeit imaginative - regional integration . The inability of any one power to confront global challenges will lead responsible powers into the fold of regional multilateralism . The transition will be facilitated if it builds on existing regional integration structures . This way , every state will ultimately become a stakeholder in the international system . For that to happen , regional leaders need to operate as focal points . They need to listen , persuade and inspire insiders , while coordinating with outsiders . This process is different from the traditional spheres of influence system . It is based not on Monroe Doctrine - type of arrangements and coercion but rather on reassuring security umbrellas and mutually beneficial trade blocs . Within this new paradigm , emerging regional leaders - such as China , Russia , India , Japan , Brazil , Turkey , and South Africa - will play a more significant role within their regions while at the same time will take part in cross regional and global issues .

CSPI is a nonprofit organization dealing with food and nutrition issues advocating on behalf of consumers including education on genetically engineered foods ( GE ) and ingredients . \u201c How shameful and exploitative for Stonyfield to use children to spread unsophisticated , anti-science fearmongering messages in this YouTube video , \u201d Gregory Jaffe , director of the project on biotechnology for CSPI , said in a statement on the organization 's website . User comments on the YouTube video have expressed similar criticism of the video where young girls describe the GMOs as \u201c monstrous , \u201d to which Stonyfield 's president , Gary Hirshberg , told Forbes those commenters are likely \u201c trolls \u201d using \u201c fake names . \u201d Dairy Reporter has reached out to Stonyfield for comment but has not yet received a response . \u201c Consumers can choose to purchase different kinds of products \u2026 and that 's a good thing , but we should n't promote one product [ and ] disparage another product with untruthful information about that product , \u201d Jaffe told DairyReporter . \u201c I think there is a lot of misinformation out there about genetically engineered foods and ingredients and there are a lot of consumers out there that do n't know a lot about them , \u201d Jaffe said . Similar to Stonyfield , Dean Foods ' TruMoo milk brand produced a video featuring kids also trying to understand GMOs and Arla Foods put out a television advertisement portraying the growth hormone rBST as a multi-eyed monster with fangs last year . \u201c Many of these marketing campaigns try to suggest to consumers that somehow their product is better and safer for not having ingredients that came from those crops and that 's particularly disingenuous . \u201d Is it about consumer choice ? Other dairy companies like Dannon have not explicitly promoted non-GMO products as \u201c better , \u201d but have said they are meeting current consumer demands by selling products made without GE ingredients , such as sourcing milk from cows fed non -GM feed .

When asked for one word to sum up their 1974 counterparts , Williams had no hesitation in firing back : \" aggressive \" . It 's a word that seems to fit the bill perfectly , encapsulating a tour that has since gone down in Lions history , as the men from Britain and Ireland stood tall with the Springboks , fighting fire with fire . This was the tour of ' the Invincibles ' , Willie John McBride 's last Lions hurrah , Fergus Slattery 's try that was n't and a certain ' 99 ' call that has since down in rugby folklore . \" I do n't think there 's ever been a team playing in South Africa where they 've been physically dominant , \" says Williams . \" The South Africans , still , are very much a macho rugby - playing nation and we actually out - scrummaged them , the forwards were all over them and at the time the South Africans could n't take that . But if you are in South Africa and you talk of the 74 Lions , we are absolutely revered over there , because we took them on at their own game and we beat them at it . \" It will be the job of those that follow in 2009 to emulate the feats of those that went before them in 1974 and again in 1997 and win a Test Series in South Africa . Like their 1997 predecessors , the latest crop to pull on that coveted red jersey will be facing the reigning world champions . However , it was the crop of 74 that paved the way , by not just beating the Springboks , but by beating them at their own game . And in doing so , establishing a legacy that still thrives today . \" The esteem of the 74 Lions in South Africa is absolutely huge , having been back there a few times . And when you consider that we actually beat them comfortably and gave them a good hammering , they revere us , \" says Williams . Much has been made of the ' 99 ' call on that tour . Williams is adamant that it was a crucial component in the team 's success in South Africa . \" I think it was a major factor ; Willie John McBride was on his fifth Lions tour and if you think about it , that 's almost two years of your life on tour with the Lions . He 'd been to South Africa before and played in good sides who were always on the losing end because of the physicality of the South Africans , \" recalls Williams . \" Willie John was a senior figure and he said , ' look , I 've been out here twice before , we 've played pretty well but we 've been intimidated and we 're going to have none of that . If anybody gets into trouble , you all get involved wherever you are and you all hit the nearest South African to you , the referee ca n't send off the whole team ' and that was what Willie John said to us . \" With their new ' 99 ' call in their armoury , the Lions headed to South Africa where , over the next three and a half months , they would earn the respect of their hosts . However , as Williams is keen to point out , the ' 99 ' call was used far more sparingly than legend might have it . The Lions set their stall out early not to be intimidated , and Port Elizabeth , during the Lions ' clash with Eastern Province would witness the call 's first use . It would not be deemed necessary to call upon it again until the Third Test . After edging an opening Test played in atrocious conditions in Cape Town , thanks to Phil Bennett and a Gareth Edwards drop goal , the Lions moved on to Pretoria where JJ Williams ran in two tries in a comprehensive 28 - 9 win . The South Africans were in disarray , and hitting the panic button , selected a No.8 at scrum-half . It was here , in Port Elizabeth once again , that the 99 call would come to prominence . \" We had the 99 call because we were under a lot of threat . The first - half we were hardly out of our half , and I think we kicked the ball down , had a lineout on their line and Gordon Brown scored a try , and we were in the lead , \" says Williams , \" It was the first - half and we were under a lot of pressure , and I 'm not particularly proud of it now , but I remember sprinting about 40 yards to hit their biggest guy in the second row , Johnnes van Heerden . As I went towards him , there were two players running the other way , Phil Bennett and Andy Irvine . At least I 'd picked on the biggest guy . \" I met him on the train about three or four years ago when South Africa were playing Wales and he was coming down to present the jerseys to the South Africans , and he paid me a great compliment , he said it was the best punch he 'd ever had in his life . \" Only a controversially disallowed Fergus Slattery try in the fourth Test prevented the Lions from returning home with a 100 per cent record . However , for Williams , after three and a half months on the road , there is no lingering sense of injustice . The tour 's main objective , to win the series , had been emphatically achieved . \" The amazing thing was that the South Africans were so elated that they 'd drawn the fourth Test , and we could n't really understand that , \" says Williams . \" I actually made the break and gave him [ Slattery ] the ball and he was over the line , took a long time putting the ball down and the referee blew up before he touched it down . Having said that , we had a rather dubious try through Roger Uttley earlier on in the game , so I think it was a fair result . But the Slattery try was definitely a try . \" Williams will be back in South Africa this summer watching with keen interest as former Lions team - mates Ian McGeechan and Gerald Davies look to steer the Lions to a third series win over the Springboks . And with the experience of two Lions tours under his belt , Williams believes that the discarding of nationalities is essential if the players are to gel together , under the Lions banner . \" I was misquoted in 2005 , that ' the Lions should sleep together ' but they should share rooms , and there should not be anyone from the same country sharing rooms with each other . I think that 's very important and I think that 's already been implemented for this tour , \" says Williams . \" You 've got to get rid of all nationalities and be united as a British Lions team .

When asked for one word to sum up their 1974 counterparts , Williams had no hesitation in firing back : \" aggressive \" . It 's a word that seems to fit the bill perfectly , encapsulating a tour that has since gone down in Lions history , as the men from Britain and Ireland stood tall with the Springboks , fighting fire with fire . This was the tour of ' the Invincibles ' , Willie John McBride 's last Lions hurrah , Fergus Slattery 's try that was n't and a certain ' 99 ' call that has since down in rugby folklore . \" I do n't think there 's ever been a team playing in South Africa where they 've been physically dominant , \" says Williams . \" The South Africans , still , are very much a macho rugby - playing nation and we actually out - scrummaged them , the forwards were all over them and at the time the South Africans could n't take that . But if you are in South Africa and you talk of the 74 Lions , we are absolutely revered over there , because we took them on at their own game and we beat them at it . \" It will be the job of those that follow in 2009 to emulate the feats of those that went before them in 1974 and again in 1997 and win a Test Series in South Africa . Like their 1997 predecessors , the latest crop to pull on that coveted red jersey will be facing the reigning world champions . However , it was the crop of 74 that paved the way , by not just beating the Springboks , but by beating them at their own game . And in doing so , establishing a legacy that still thrives today . \" The esteem of the 74 Lions in South Africa is absolutely huge , having been back there a few times . And when you consider that we actually beat them comfortably and gave them a good hammering , they revere us , \" says Williams . Much has been made of the ' 99 ' call on that tour . Williams is adamant that it was a crucial component in the team 's success in South Africa . \" I think it was a major factor ; Willie John McBride was on his fifth Lions tour and if you think about it , that 's almost two years of your life on tour with the Lions . He 'd been to South Africa before and played in good sides who were always on the losing end because of the physicality of the South Africans , \" recalls Williams . \" Willie John was a senior figure and he said , ' look , I 've been out here twice before , we 've played pretty well but we 've been intimidated and we 're going to have none of that . If anybody gets into trouble , you all get involved wherever you are and you all hit the nearest South African to you , the referee ca n't send off the whole team ' and that was what Willie John said to us . \" With their new ' 99 ' call in their armoury , the Lions headed to South Africa where , over the next three and a half months , they would earn the respect of their hosts . However , as Williams is keen to point out , the ' 99 ' call was used far more sparingly than legend might have it . The Lions set their stall out early not to be intimidated , and Port Elizabeth , during the Lions ' clash with Eastern Province would witness the call 's first use . It would not be deemed necessary to call upon it again until the Third Test . After edging an opening Test played in atrocious conditions in Cape Town , thanks to Phil Bennett and a Gareth Edwards drop goal , the Lions moved on to Pretoria where JJ Williams ran in two tries in a comprehensive 28 - 9 win . The South Africans were in disarray , and hitting the panic button , selected a No.8 at scrum-half . It was here , in Port Elizabeth once again , that the 99 call would come to prominence . \" We had the 99 call because we were under a lot of threat . The first - half we were hardly out of our half , and I think we kicked the ball down , had a lineout on their line and Gordon Brown scored a try , and we were in the lead , \" says Williams , \" It was the first - half and we were under a lot of pressure , and I 'm not particularly proud of it now , but I remember sprinting about 40 yards to hit their biggest guy in the second row , Johnnes van Heerden . As I went towards him , there were two players running the other way , Phil Bennett and Andy Irvine . At least I 'd picked on the biggest guy . \" I met him on the train about three or four years ago when South Africa were playing Wales and he was coming down to present the jerseys to the South Africans , and he paid me a great compliment , he said it was the best punch he 'd ever had in his life . \" Only a controversially disallowed Fergus Slattery try in the fourth Test prevented the Lions from returning home with a 100 per cent record . However , for Williams , after three and a half months on the road , there is no lingering sense of injustice . The tour 's main objective , to win the series , had been emphatically achieved . \" The amazing thing was that the South Africans were so elated that they 'd drawn the fourth Test , and we could n't really understand that , \" says Williams . \" I actually made the break and gave him [ Slattery ] the ball and he was over the line , took a long time putting the ball down and the referee blew up before he touched it down . Having said that , we had a rather dubious try through Roger Uttley earlier on in the game , so I think it was a fair result . But the Slattery try was definitely a try . \" Williams will be back in South Africa this summer watching with keen interest as former Lions team - mates Ian McGeechan and Gerald Davies look to steer the Lions to a third series win over the Springboks . And with the experience of two Lions tours under his belt , Williams believes that the discarding of nationalities is essential if the players are to gel together , under the Lions banner . \" I was misquoted in 2005 , that ' the Lions should sleep together ' but they should share rooms , and there should not be anyone from the same country sharing rooms with each other . I think that 's very important and I think that 's already been implemented for this tour , \" says Williams . \" You 've got to get rid of all nationalities and be united as a British Lions team . It 's much harder to do on a shorter tour , but when I went to New Zealand I shared a room with David Duckham and John Pullen , the two Englishmen . \" And then in South Africa I shared with Billy Steel who is a Scot , so I never shared a room with a Welsh player and I think that 's very important . \" Register for free to continue reading Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering , you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles , exclusive newsletters , commenting , and virtual events with our leading journalists Already have an account ? sign in By clicking ' Register ' you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use , Cookie policy and Privacy notice .

Police baton- charged protesters outside Trinity police station and along Old Market . Thanks very much to Kathryn Mottram for the photo , taken by a local press photographer , which family lore believes shows her grandfather , who was an inspector in the Bristol Police Force at the time . The Mottram family have a sneaking suspicion that he may be the police officer on the right of the photo with the flat peaked hat , as worn by inspectors , as opposed to all the other baton- wielding pointed hat constables . The following is a contemporary news story from the Bristol Evening World newspaper , with thanks to Gerry Brooke , editor of the Bristol Times nostalgia supplement which appears in the Evening Post every Monday : Grave riots broke out in the streets of Bristol yesterday afternoon and last night , when unemployed demonstrators came into violent conflict with the police . In Old Market Street yesterday afternoon , nearly 3,000 demonstrators , who intended to send a deputation into the City Council , were stopped by a double line of police when they attempted to march through the most congested part of the city . Thick sticks and lengths of gas piping were used by the crowd as weapons against the baton attack of the police . Bricks , stones and coke were also hurled . Thirty of the unemployed were injured , and several police were struck by missiles . The conflict occurred after the police had refused to allow the men to march up Castle Street . The whole crowd momentarily paused , and when one of the leaders pushed an inspector and raised a stick , the rest pressed forward and broke through the lines of police , who drew their batons and used them to repulse the attacking mob of shouting men . Within the twinkling of an eye , almost , four or five of the crowd were lying , stunned and inert , in the road , while others fought hand - to - hand with members of the police , who , in some cases without helmets and bleeding from face wounds , fought fiercely until they finally repulsed the marchers and drove them up Old Market Street . There were no deaths , but some 20 men were treated for minor injuries .","annotations":[{"text":"Old Market Street","span":[50,66],"token_span":[9,11],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the revenge occurs."},{"text":"February 23 , 1932","span":[71,88],"token_span":[13,16],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time when the revenge occurs."},{"text":"some 3,000 unemployed","span":[95,115],"token_span":[19,21],"role":"Avenger","label":"Avenger","role_definition":"The Avenger exacts revenge from the Offender for the Injury."},{"text":"with the police","span":[144,158],"token_span":[26,28],"role":"Offender","label":"Offender","role_definition":"The Offender has committed the earlier Injury for which the Avenger seeks revenge."},{"text":"Thick sticks and lengths of gas piping were used by the crowd as weapons","span":[1394,1465],"token_span":[248,261],"role":"Punishment","label":"Punishment","role_definition":"The Avenger carries out a Punishment in order to exact revenge on the Offender."},{"text":"Bricks , stones and coke were also hurled","span":[1508,1548],"token_span":[270,277],"role":"Punishment","label":"Punishment","role_definition":"The Avenger carries out a Punishment in order to exact revenge on the Offender."},{"text":"baton attack","span":[1479,1490],"token_span":[264,265],"role":"Injury","label":"Injury","role_definition":"The Injury is the injurious action committed by the Offender against the Injured_Party.

Police baton- charged protesters outside Trinity police station and along Old Market . Thanks very much to Kathryn Mottram for the photo , taken by a local press photographer , which family lore believes shows her grandfather , who was an inspector in the Bristol Police Force at the time . The Mottram family have a sneaking suspicion that he may be the police officer on the right of the photo with the flat peaked hat , as worn by inspectors , as opposed to all the other baton- wielding pointed hat constables . The following is a contemporary news story from the Bristol Evening World newspaper , with thanks to Gerry Brooke , editor of the Bristol Times nostalgia supplement which appears in the Evening Post every Monday : Grave riots broke out in the streets of Bristol yesterday afternoon and last night , when unemployed demonstrators came into violent conflict with the police . In Old Market Street yesterday afternoon , nearly 3,000 demonstrators , who intended to send a deputation into the City Council , were stopped by a double line of police when they attempted to march through the most congested part of the city . Thick sticks and lengths of gas piping were used by the crowd as weapons against the baton attack of the police . Bricks , stones and coke were also hurled . Thirty of the unemployed were injured , and several police were struck by missiles . The conflict occurred after the police had refused to allow the men to march up Castle Street . The whole crowd momentarily paused , and when one of the leaders pushed an inspector and raised a stick , the rest pressed forward and broke through the lines of police , who drew their batons and used them to repulse the attacking mob of shouting men . Within the twinkling of an eye , almost , four or five of the crowd were lying , stunned and inert , in the road , while others fought hand - to - hand with members of the police , who , in some cases without helmets and bleeding from face wounds , fought fiercely until they finally repulsed the marchers and drove them up Old Market Street . There were no deaths , but some 20 men were treated for minor injuries .","annotations":[{"text":"some 3,000 unemployed","span":[95,115],"token_span":[19,21],"role":"Avenger","label":"Avenger","role_definition":"The Avenger exacts revenge from the Offender for the Injury."},{"text":"with the police","span":[144,158],"token_span":[26,28],"role":"Offender","label":"Offender","role_definition":"The Offender has committed the earlier Injury for which the Avenger seeks revenge."},{"text":"Thick sticks and lengths of gas piping were used by the crowd as weapons","span":[1394,1465],"token_span":[248,261],"role":"Punishment","label":"Punishment","role_definition":"The Avenger carries out a Punishment in order to exact revenge on the Offender."},{"text":"Bricks , stones and coke were also hurled","span":[1508,1548],"token_span":[270,277],"role":"Punishment","label":"Punishment","role_definition":"The Avenger carries out a Punishment in order to exact revenge on the Offender."},{"text":"baton attack","span":[1479,1490],"token_span":[264,265],"role":"Injury","label":"Injury","role_definition":"The Injury is the injurious action committed by the Offender against the Injured_Party.

With the help of a brutal defense that knocks opponents silly , of course . After all , these are the Ravens , who love nothing more than to win grudge matches . And , this one was worthy of the WWE . Baltimore survived 13 - 10 on Saturday against the Tennessee Titans thanks to Matt Stover 's 43 - yard field goal with 53 seconds remaining . The unflappable Flacco was certain the 40- year - old kicker would get his team into next weekend 's AFC title game at either Pittsburgh or San Diego . \" I just watched on the big screen , \" said the first rookie quarterback to win two playoff games . \" I did n't watch it live for whatever reason . \" Maybe Flacco 's reason was simply that he never flinches .

It does n't matter to us . We 're going to go out there and battle the crowd , battle the other team , and give it our best . \" Their best has them at 13 - 5 after Stover , the last member of the Ravens who played when the franchise was in Cleveland , nailed his field goal . \" I would say this would be the No. 1 [ kick in my career ] , \" Stover said , then added , \" but we 've got some more kicks , too . So let 's just be humble about that . \" Humble after a rumble . Two teams with an extreme dislike for each other never stopped pounding it out in the wind and rain . The difference : Baltimore forced three turnovers and never gave away the ball . \" We just continued to fight and refused to let them in [ the end zone ] , \" linebacker Bart Scott said . \" We made the plays we had to ... the ball came out . We 'll take it any way we can get it . \" Baltimore 's postseason run looks eerily similar to when it won the championship after the 2000 season . Back then , it also was a wild card and also won in Tennessee on the way to the title . \" It 's great to make our own history , our own path , \" Scott said . \" That team has its own identity and we 're trying to create our own . \" It was so rugged that the highlight - reel play was All - Pro linebacker Ray Lewis ' explosive second - quarter hit on Titans fullback Ahmard Hall near the sideline . Hall 's helmet flew off and both players began jawing at each other . The nasty words never stopped flowing . But the Ravens backed it up with just enough points , climaxed by the winning kick . \" It 's a little shocking , \" said Titans linebacker Keith Bulluck , who slammed down a few small metal barriers lining the tunnel leading to the Titans ' locker room at the end . \" You go out and play defense the way you did . At the end of the day , realistically you have two , three turnovers inside the 20 , you 're not supposed to win . \" Playoff football , those are the mistakes you ca n't have as a team . \" The 40- year-old Stover also made a 21 - yard field goal early in the fourth quarter for a 10 - 7 lead . Rob Bironas ' 27 - yarder with 4:23 left in regulation tied it at 10 . Then Flacco connected with Todd Heap on a 23 - yard pass on third down , eventually leading to the winning kick . Flacco almost had a major blunder on Baltimore 's next - to - last series when he nearly stepped out of the back of the end zone while passing . Few replays were shown at LP Field , and Titans coach Jeff Fisher dismissed the play afterward . \" I was n't out because they did n't call it , \" Flacco said . Tennessee , a plus - 14 in turnover margin while winning the AFC South , wasted a half - dozen scoring opportunities with errors . One came on Samari Rolle 's interception at the Ravens 12 on a popup Kerry Collins threw under pressure from a blitz in the second period . Another was Collins ' fourth - down fumble in Baltimore territory , which the quarterback recovered . The third was LenDale White 's fumble at the Baltimore 17 in the final minute of the half . White was in for rookie Chris Johnson , who left with his right ankle wrapped late in the first half . Without Johnson , the Titans moved well through the air , with Justin Gage making 10 receptions for 135 yards . But they could n't finish . \" We really have no one to blame but ourselves , \" Collins said . \" This one 's going to hurt for a while . \" Baltimore led the league with 34 takeaways , won the turnover battle last week in a 27 - 9 wild - card victory at Miami , then did so again Saturday . Perhaps the biggest Tennessee turnover came with about 9 minutes to go when Alge Crumpler fumbled near the Baltimore goal line . Fabian Washington recovered , preventing the Titans from taking a late lead . With Johnson dominating early , the Titans went on top 7 - 0 . Collins hit all three passes on a 65 - yard drive that was helped by an illegal contact penalty on former Titans cornerback Rolle . Johnson , the only rookie in the Pro Bowl , covered 28 yards with a screen pass , and Collins hit Gage for 20 yards before Johnson surged right and dived into the end zone for a 7 - 0 edge . Flacco , who struggled in a 13 - 10 loss to the Titans on Oct. 5 in Baltimore , matched that touchdown with a 48 - yard throw down the right sideline to another former Titan , Derrick Mason . The second quarter was scoreless , but very confrontational , with as much pushing , shoving and yelling as catching and tackling . Bironas missed a 51 - yarder midway in the third period despite having the wind at his back , adding to Tennessee 's litany of blunders . And when Jim Leonhard returned a punt 29 yards to the Titans 41 , Baltimore finally had good field position . A 37 - yard pass to Mark Clayton on which two defenders missed the ball got the Ravens to the 4 . Stover 's 21 - yard field goal 50 seconds into the fourth quarter gave the Ravens their first lead .

Mellors will create a film that will form the centrepiece of a 15 month exhibition on the themes of Samuel Beckett and The Theatre of the Absurd . The \u00a3 40,000 prize , generously supported by the Sfumato Foundation , is one of the country 's highest value contemporary art awards and this year was presented by Turner Prize - winning artist Martin Creed . Mellors will be making a hybrid work of fiction , sculpture , performance and film , using the architecturally monumental , brutalist Preston Bus Station as its focus . The Bus Station has recently been Grade II listed and this , as well as the compact and architecturally diverse city centre of Preston , makes for an ideal film set . His current practice and this film commission are part of Mellor 's ongoing Ourhouse body of works , produced by NOMAD , which has featured a panoply of British acting talent including Richard Bremmer ( Control , Harry Potter & The Philosopher 's Stone ) , Gwendoline Christie ( Game of Thrones , Star Wars : The Force Awakens ) , Patrick Kennedy ( Atonement , Boardwalk Empire ) , David Birkin ( Sylvia , Les Miserables ) & Johnny Vivash ( Perdition County , Vigilante ) as well as local performers in supporting roles . Nathaniel Mellors said : The support and faith in my work that this award represents is impossible to put a price on , particularly from such a strong shortlist . It is a unique opportunity to consolidate recent developments in my practice and pull out some deeper weirdness , both with my amazing collaborators and through the extraordinary locations in and around Preston . Caroline Douglas , Director , Contemporary Art Society , said : In a year with exceptionally strong applications for the Award , the Harris Museum proposal with Nathaniel Mellors was outstanding . Nathaniel Mellors ' work connects with a tradition of absurdist and satirical film making in Britain that includes such figures as Lindsay Anderson and Derek Jarman . I am delighted that the Award will enable the production of a substantial new work within Mellors ' oeuvre , and one that links so directly to the city it will be made in . Cllr Veronica Afrin , Cabinet Member for Culture & Leisure Services ; Preston City Council , said : Nathaniel Mellors is a prestigious and fascinating artist , and we are immensely proud to be working with him on this major commission . His unique imagination and approach to film making will enable him to draw on and re-imagine the museum 's collections and the fabric of the city , cementing Preston 's growing reputation as a centre for high quality cultural activity .

Mellors will create a film that will form the centrepiece of a 15 month exhibition on the themes of Samuel Beckett and The Theatre of the Absurd . The \u00a3 40,000 prize , generously supported by the Sfumato Foundation , is one of the country 's highest value contemporary art awards and this year was presented by Turner Prize - winning artist Martin Creed . Mellors will be making a hybrid work of fiction , sculpture , performance and film , using the architecturally monumental , brutalist Preston Bus Station as its focus . The Bus Station has recently been Grade II listed and this , as well as the compact and architecturally diverse city centre of Preston , makes for an ideal film set . His current practice and this film commission are part of Mellor 's ongoing Ourhouse body of works , produced by NOMAD , which has featured a panoply of British acting talent including Richard Bremmer ( Control , Harry Potter & The Philosopher 's Stone ) , Gwendoline Christie ( Game of Thrones , Star Wars : The Force Awakens ) , Patrick Kennedy ( Atonement , Boardwalk Empire ) , David Birkin ( Sylvia , Les Miserables ) & Johnny Vivash ( Perdition County , Vigilante ) as well as local performers in supporting roles . Nathaniel Mellors said : The support and faith in my work that this award represents is impossible to put a price on , particularly from such a strong shortlist . It is a unique opportunity to consolidate recent developments in my practice and pull out some deeper weirdness , both with my amazing collaborators and through the extraordinary locations in and around Preston . Caroline Douglas , Director , Contemporary Art Society , said : In a year with exceptionally strong applications for the Award , the Harris Museum proposal with Nathaniel Mellors was outstanding . Nathaniel Mellors ' work connects with a tradition of absurdist and satirical film making in Britain that includes such figures as Lindsay Anderson and Derek Jarman . I am delighted that the Award will enable the production of a substantial new work within Mellors ' oeuvre , and one that links so directly to the city it will be made in . Cllr Veronica Afrin , Cabinet Member for Culture & Leisure Services ; Preston City Council , said : Nathaniel Mellors is a prestigious and fascinating artist , and we are immensely proud to be working with him on this major commission . His unique imagination and approach to film making will enable him to draw on and re-imagine the museum 's collections and the fabric of the city , cementing Preston 's growing reputation as a centre for high quality cultural activity .

Update , July 26 , 2019 : This story has been corrected . OXFORD , Miss . \u2014 Three University of Mississippi students have been suspended from their fraternity house and face possible investigation by the Department of Justice after posing with guns in front of a bullet - riddled sign honoring slain civil rights icon Emmett Till . One of the students posted a photo to his private Instagram account in March showing the trio in front of a roadside plaque commemorating the site where Till 's body was recovered from the Tallahatchie River . The 14-year - old black youth was tortured and murdered in August 1955 . An all - white , all - male jury acquitted two white men accused of the slaying . The photo , which was obtained by the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting and ProPublica , shows an Ole Miss student named Ben LeClere holding a shotgun while standing in front of the bullet - pocked sign . His Kappa Alpha fraternity brother , John Lowe , squats below the sign . A third fraternity member stands on the other side with an AR - 15 semi-automatic rifle . The photo appears to have been taken at night , the scene illuminated by lights from a vehicle . LeClere posted the picture on Lowe 's birthday on March 1 with the message \u201c one of Memphis 's finest and the worst influence I 've ever met . \u201d Neither LeClere nor Lowe responded to repeated attempts to contact them . It is not clear whether the fraternity students shot the sign or are simply posing before it . The sign is part of a memorial effort by the Emmett Till Memorial Commission , a Mississippi civil rights group , and has been repeatedly vandalized , most recently in August 2018 . Till 's death helped propel the modern civil rights movement in America . Five days after LeClere posted the photo , a person who saw it filed a bias report to the university 's Office of Student Conduct . The complaint pointed out there may have been a fourth person present , who took the picture . \u201c The photo is on Instagram with hundreds of ' likes , ' and no one said a thing , \u201d said the complaint , a copy of which was reviewed by the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting and ProPublica . \u201c I cannot tell Ole Miss what to do , I just thought it should be brought to your attention . \u201d The photo was removed from LeClere 's Instagram account after the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting and ProPublica began contacting fraternity members and friends . It had received 247 likes within a day of being posted . Kappa Alpha suspended the trio on Wednesday , after the news organizations provided a copy of the photo to fraternity officials at Ole Miss . The fraternity , which honors Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as its \u201c spiritual founder \u201d on its website , has a history of racial controversy , including an incident in which students wore blackface at a Kappa Alpha sponsored Halloween party at the University of Virginia in 2002 . \u201c The photo is inappropriate , insensitive and unacceptable . It does not represent our chapter , \u201d Taylor Anderson , president of Ole Miss ' Kappa Alpha Order , wrote in an email . \u201c We have and will continue to be in communication with our national organization and the University . \u201d After viewing the photo , U.S. Attorney Chad Lamar of the Northern District of Mississippi in Oxford said the information has been referred to the Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division for further investigation . \u201c We will be working with them closely , \u201d he said Thursday . University officials called the photo \u201c offensive and hurtful . \u201d University spokesman Rod Guajardo acknowledged that an Ole Miss official had received a copy of the Instagram picture in March . The university referred the matter to the university police department , which in turn gave it to the FBI . Guajardo said the FBI told police it would not further investigate the incident because the photo did not pose a specific threat . Guajardo said that while the university considered the picture \u201c offensive , \u201d the image did not present a violation of the university 's code of conduct . He noted the incident depicted in the photo occurred off campus and was not part of a university - affiliated event . \u201c We stand ready to assist the fraternity with educational opportunities for those members and the chapter , \u201d Guajardo said . He said the university will continue to build programs to engage students in \u201c deliberate , honest and candid conversations while making clear that we unequivocally reject attitudes that do not respect the dignity of each individual in our community . \u201d Since the first sign was erected in 2008 , it has been the object of repeated animosity . Vandals threw the first sign in the river . The second sign was blasted with 317 bullets or shotgun pellets before the Emmett Till Memorial Commission officials removed it . The third sign , featured in the Instagram photo , was damaged by 10 bullet holes before officials took it down last week . A fourth sign , designed to better withstand attacks , is expected to be installed soon . News of the suspensions and referral to the Justice Department came as Till 's cousin , Deborah Watts , co-founder of the Emmett Till Legacy Foundation , was already planning a moment of silence Thursday to honor her cousin with a gathering of supporters and friends dressed in black and white in \u201c a silent yet powerful protest against racism , hatred and violence . \u201d Thursday is Till 's birthday . Had he lived , he would have been 78 years old . This is not the first time Ole Miss fraternity students have been caught up in an incident involving an icon from the civil rights movement . In 2014 , three students from the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity house placed a noose around the neck of a statue on campus of James Meredith , the first known black student to attend Ole Miss . They also placed a Georgia flag of the past that contains the Confederate battle emblem . According to federal prosecutors , the freshmen students hatched the plan during a drinking fest at the house , where one student disparaged African Americans , saying this act would create a sensation : \u201c It 's James Meredith . People will go crazy . \u201d One pleaded guilty and received six months in prison for using a threat of force to intimidate African American students and employees because of their race or color . Another student also pleaded guilty . He received probation and community service after he cooperated with the FBI . A third man was n't charged . All three students withdrew from Ole Miss , and the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity 's national headquarters shuttered its chapter on the Ole Miss campus after its own investigation , blaming the closing on behavior that included \u201c hazing , underage drinking , alcohol abuse and failure to comply with the university and fraternity 's codes of conduct . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"July 26 , 2019","span":[170,183],"token_span":[27,30],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the event occurs."},{"text":"Three University of Mississippi students","span":[237,276],"token_span":[43,47],"role":"Evaluee","label":"Evaluee","role_definition":"Evaluee is the person or thing about whom/which a judgment has made and to whom reward/punishment is dealt.

Most of the irregularly shaped , calcareous specimens are largely composed of fragmented conifer wood ( 13 % \u2013 85 % ) and can be identified as coprolites by the presence of distinctive backfilled dung beetle burrows . The large size ( up to 7 L in volume ) , fibrous contents , and associated bones and eggshell strongly suggest that the source animals at one site were Maiasaura hadrosaurs . The wood - bearing coprolites occur in strata ranging in age from \u223c 74\u201380 Ma , revealing a recurring ( possibly seasonal ) habit of wood ingestion . The preponderance of wood in the specimens and the absence of recognizable small-diameter twig fragments suggest that wood ingestion was intentional \u2014 that the coprolite producers had not merely consumed wood inadvertently when feeding on the leaves and bark of terminal branches . Because undegraded wood provides inconsequential nutritive value for vertebrates , it is unlikely that ornithischians would have expended the energy to masticate intact wood for little benefit . Furthermore , patterns of tissue damage in the fecal wood fragments suggest fungal degradation .

Most of the irregularly shaped , calcareous specimens are largely composed of fragmented conifer wood ( 13 % \u2013 85 % ) and can be identified as coprolites by the presence of distinctive backfilled dung beetle burrows . The large size ( up to 7 L in volume ) , fibrous contents , and associated bones and eggshell strongly suggest that the source animals at one site were Maiasaura hadrosaurs . The wood - bearing coprolites occur in strata ranging in age from \u223c 74\u201380 Ma , revealing a recurring ( possibly seasonal ) habit of wood ingestion . The preponderance of wood in the specimens and the absence of recognizable small-diameter twig fragments suggest that wood ingestion was intentional \u2014 that the coprolite producers had not merely consumed wood inadvertently when feeding on the leaves and bark of terminal branches . Because undegraded wood provides inconsequential nutritive value for vertebrates , it is unlikely that ornithischians would have expended the energy to masticate intact wood for little benefit . Furthermore , patterns of tissue damage in the fecal wood fragments suggest fungal degradation . Thus , the most parsimonious explanation for the high fecal wood content is that the coprolite producers consumed decomposing wood to capitalize on resources released by fungal attack , along with the tissues of the decomposers and associated invertebrate detritivores .

Malaysia Airlines is said to be open to outright sale or lease , reports respected aviation industry site Leeham News . Also on the block are six MAS freight aircraft \u2013 two Boeing 747-400s and four Airbus A330 - 200s \u2013 which Leeham News ' Scott Hamilton says ' wipes out MASCargo ' . Malaysia Airlines took delivery of its first A380 just less than three years ago , in May 2012 , and currently flies the superjumbos from its home hub in Kuala Lumpur to London and Paris . The A380 's list price in 2012 was US$ 389.9 , although it 's speculated that airlines typically pay barely half the sticker . Each Malaysia Airlines A380 contains eight first class suites , which MAS boasted at the time were the world 's widest first class beds , along with 66 lie-flat business class seats and 420 economy seats . The airline was nationalised in late 2014 by Malaysia 's government - owned investment arm Khazanah Nasional , after years of mounting debt . The airline has racked up debts approaching $ 1.5 billion since 2011 and last year analysts predicted Malaysia Airlines would not break even until at least 2016 . Under KN 's watch , MAS was to receive a A $ 2 billion injection from 2014 to 2016 to fund a dramatic restructure \u2013 including a 30 % cut to its workforce \u2013 in a drive to return the airline to profitability by 2017 . \" Malaysia Airlines refers to the speculation on its fleet . It is currently still working to finalise the Business Plan . Exploring fleet options to enhance viability of long haul sectors is one area being looked into Approached for comment by Australian Business Traveller , Malaysia Airlines issued a statement saying the airline \" is currently still working to finalise the Business Plan . Exploring fleet options to enhance viability of long haul sectors is one area being looked into . \" However , the airline refused to confirm or deny that it plans to sell or lease any Airbus A380s . Incoming Malaysia Airlines CEO Christoph Mueller has added that \" recent speculations on the airline offering some of its fleet for sale or lease is too premature when nothing concrete has been achieved . \" \u201c MAS needs to operate and utilize its fleet at an optimum level besides maximizing revenue on the route it flies . The market needs to give Malaysia Airlines room to explore various options in determining the most viable strategy . \" Read more : Malaysia Airlines fleet restructuring Follow Australian Business Traveller on Twitter : we 're @ AusBT I feel for you . Suspect that Malaysia Airlines will have a hard time . Universal demand for A380 is pretty low , aside from Emirates - but I doubt they 'll be interested in 2nd hand aircraft anyway . The A380 is too big for Virgin Australia . Qantas - Qantas Frequent Flyer 09 Feb 2015 Total posts 344 Could be an opportunity for Qantas to pick up a great deal on near new aircraft , but I doubt it will happen though !! WHATTTT ??? not surprised if Emirates want to buy their A380 to top up the gazillion number they already have . Etihad and Qatar could take advantage since they only ordered a small amount and might want to bring in more luxury travel . I am curious what their new CEO Christoph Mueller has in store for the airline in the next few months and years . Route cuts , capacity reductions , customer service changes , frequent flyer programs , new fleet ? , etc. Their B777-200ER seems pretty old . Not sure who would want them . Did n't Christoph Mueller oversee the exit of Aer Lingus from Oneworld ? Maybe it 's time to poke around and look for a new partner in SEA ? BA also do n't have many they would like them . Maybe carriers like LAN can maybe pick them up . So what will MH use to fly to LHR and CDG ? Clapped - out 772 ??? Goodness ! Unfortunately MH needs to cut its losses and the next round of cuts will definately hit home , heres the mow down ; - Both Melbourne and Sydney will have their frequency reduced , both could go back to x2 daily each ( minimum ) or still retain the 3rd daily on selected days - Brisbane will get its frequency cut or could be totally axed , it is said this route has been loss making for years - Darwin could be axed totally or just reduced frequency - Perth and Adelaide will remain relatively unchanged * Not official just what I think might happen : MEL , SYD , BNE and DRW have been stated to get reduced frequency or be axed by MH . That 's understandable . But if KUL / LHR vv is operated by anything other than the A380 or an aircraft with a similar hard product , I see a lot of traffic going to BA . Very clever of BA to restart KUL services . It will be very interesting to see if domestic MH loyalist will stick around , particularly at the pointy end . Difficult decision whether to invest money in product or just try and battle through . They already have a pretty poor premium product and replacing A380 routes with old 777s isnt going to help . Agree there isnt going to be much of a market for used A380s considering demand for new ones has slown to almost a halt . I could see QF picking up 1 for SYD - HKG but doubt they would buy more to upguage 747 LAX routes while the AUD is in such a poor position against the USD - those US flights are getting harder to fill . QF has 8 more A380s on the order books . Those 8 are intended to replace the 9 refit 744s post 2018 . Why not get some cheap , near new , A380s and bring forward some 747 retirements - at least the 3 remaining non refit 744s , or even all 6 of the non ERs . If QF is to spend money on capital this year , personally I 'd prefer it be spent on exercising the 787 options . Assuming QF does want to buy these A380 , there are only two available now with the other four being available from sometime next year . If the MY A380 's are the newer model which would allow fully loaded A380 operations to DFW , they might be a good pickup . Whilst passengers may like the A380 ( Inc me ) is switching BNE - LAX to an A380 the best thing for QF ? What about onward flights to JFK ? IS BNE better served by a 787 to LAX - JFK with another 787 opening up BNE - DFW flights ? Is SYD - HKG best served by an A380 or double daily flights in a smaller aircraft ? The A380 , whilst a pleasant flying experience is not the right plane for every route . Maybe , just maybe QF should consider the following : - purchasing / leasing all of MAS A380 and start a BNE - DXB - LHR service , upgrade DFW to a daily service , SYD - HKG to daily A380 and change BNE - LAX to an A380 . With the B777 - 200 ER , I could see QF agin either purchaing / leasing all of them and resume a SYD - SFO daily and SYD - BJS daily . Would really be nice to see QF take some steeps in the right way ;-) And maybe also having another destination in Europe ! QF has been moving towards reducing fleet types . Whilst picking up A380 's is a possibility , it would be extremely unlikely that they pick up 4 x 777-200 . More fleet types ( particulary only 4 ) would be added cost . That would be the plan ... they removed the 767's and retired the 737 - 4 . Picking up 777's would make that 5 though and potentially 6 if there is a period of 737>747 > A330>777>787 > A380 operating at the same time . When I said \" ( particulary only four ) \" I should have inserted the words ' planes ' after four . Qantas wo n't be taking the options on those 8 aircraft ordered . These Malaysian aircraft would be great to have 3 more aircraft to operate all the Longhaul routes . They could put to pasture the last 3 747 that have the old product on them . Why is it that Malaysian do n't just codeshare on QF metal and reduce their services to help with the losses . Seems that Qantas put many passengers onto other metal , why ca n't Malaysian do the same . Customers booking Malaysian would be happier on QF aircraft and flight numbers . Could be a possibility although I think airlines like BA and EK would n't spare a thought on buying them . PLEASE QANTAS BUY THEM DONT LET EK BUY THEM !!!!!!!!!!! If EK does decide to purchase the MAS A380 , do you think they might upgrade DXB-BKK-SYD - CHC service to an A380 and the same with DXB - KUL & SIN - MEL serivce ? If BA does purchase them , they should upgrade BA15/16 service to the A380 and start a new serivce LHR - SIN - MEL . If BA did buy them , why would they fly them to SYD ? 777 is a good sized plane for that route and has good cargo cap . Using the A380 would tie up the eqv of around 2.5 planes on an ultra long haul tag when they could get better use of them on single stop premium routes across the Atlantic to the USA . Melbourne ? There is a reason why BA is the remaining European airline flying to Australia , shortage of A380s is not one of them . Yeah I personally wish they come to Melbourne but there are cities like Mumbai , Delhi , Mexico , Shanghai which generate more point to point traffic . Will be hard to trade A380s to existing operators without MH providing incentives . The big operators all want Airbus to run an A380neo program . I wonder if the political classes in Kuala Lumpur would \" strongly advise \" Herr Mueller to \" reconsider \" the decision to sell / lease a couple of A380s and ensure the KUL / LHR flagship service remains in place .

Hi David , Just to confirm - are MAS talking about a sale and leaseback , i.e. sell the aircraft to get a cash injection but still operate A380s , or are they saying they will no longer fly A380s ? Cheers , Zac I agree with you , Zac . I think MH will need the A380 to cover at least one LHR flight and one CDG . So a sale and leaseback would sound logical rather than give up entirely . No one would want to fly on the 777- 200ERs to London cos they 're so old . How this shambles of an airline holds a coveted Skytrax 5 Star rating is beyond me . No ... I am not talking about MH370 or MH17 . MH was poor before these tragedies . EK , EY , CX , SQ , QF any day before MH .

Malaysia Airlines is said to be open to outright sale or lease , reports respected aviation industry site Leeham News . Also on the block are six MAS freight aircraft \u2013 two Boeing 747-400s and four Airbus A330 - 200s \u2013 which Leeham News ' Scott Hamilton says ' wipes out MASCargo ' . Malaysia Airlines took delivery of its first A380 just less than three years ago , in May 2012 , and currently flies the superjumbos from its home hub in Kuala Lumpur to London and Paris . The A380 's list price in 2012 was US$ 389.9 , although it 's speculated that airlines typically pay barely half the sticker . Each Malaysia Airlines A380 contains eight first class suites , which MAS boasted at the time were the world 's widest first class beds , along with 66 lie-flat business class seats and 420 economy seats . The airline was nationalised in late 2014 by Malaysia 's government - owned investment arm Khazanah Nasional , after years of mounting debt . The airline has racked up debts approaching $ 1.5 billion since 2011 and last year analysts predicted Malaysia Airlines would not break even until at least 2016 . Under KN 's watch , MAS was to receive a A $ 2 billion injection from 2014 to 2016 to fund a dramatic restructure \u2013 including a 30 % cut to its workforce \u2013 in a drive to return the airline to profitability by 2017 . \" Malaysia Airlines refers to the speculation on its fleet . It is currently still working to finalise the Business Plan . Exploring fleet options to enhance viability of long haul sectors is one area being looked into Approached for comment by Australian Business Traveller , Malaysia Airlines issued a statement saying the airline \" is currently still working to finalise the Business Plan . Exploring fleet options to enhance viability of long haul sectors is one area being looked into . \" However , the airline refused to confirm or deny that it plans to sell or lease any Airbus A380s . Incoming Malaysia Airlines CEO Christoph Mueller has added that \" recent speculations on the airline offering some of its fleet for sale or lease is too premature when nothing concrete has been achieved . \" \u201c MAS needs to operate and utilize its fleet at an optimum level besides maximizing revenue on the route it flies . The market needs to give Malaysia Airlines room to explore various options in determining the most viable strategy . \" Read more : Malaysia Airlines fleet restructuring Follow Australian Business Traveller on Twitter : we 're @ AusBT I feel for you . Suspect that Malaysia Airlines will have a hard time . Universal demand for A380 is pretty low , aside from Emirates - but I doubt they 'll be interested in 2nd hand aircraft anyway . The A380 is too big for Virgin Australia . Qantas - Qantas Frequent Flyer 09 Feb 2015 Total posts 344 Could be an opportunity for Qantas to pick up a great deal on near new aircraft , but I doubt it will happen though !! WHATTTT ??? not surprised if Emirates want to buy their A380 to top up the gazillion number they already have . Etihad and Qatar could take advantage since they only ordered a small amount and might want to bring in more luxury travel . I am curious what their new CEO Christoph Mueller has in store for the airline in the next few months and years . Route cuts , capacity reductions , customer service changes , frequent flyer programs , new fleet ? , etc. Their B777-200ER seems pretty old . Not sure who would want them . Did n't Christoph Mueller oversee the exit of Aer Lingus from Oneworld ? Maybe it 's time to poke around and look for a new partner in SEA ? BA also do n't have many they would like them . Maybe carriers like LAN can maybe pick them up . So what will MH use to fly to LHR and CDG ? Clapped - out 772 ??? Goodness ! Unfortunately MH needs to cut its losses and the next round of cuts will definately hit home , heres the mow down ; - Both Melbourne and Sydney will have their frequency reduced , both could go back to x2 daily each ( minimum ) or still retain the 3rd daily on selected days - Brisbane will get its frequency cut or could be totally axed , it is said this route has been loss making for years - Darwin could be axed totally or just reduced frequency - Perth and Adelaide will remain relatively unchanged * Not official just what I think might happen : MEL , SYD , BNE and DRW have been stated to get reduced frequency or be axed by MH . That 's understandable . But if KUL / LHR vv is operated by anything other than the A380 or an aircraft with a similar hard product , I see a lot of traffic going to BA . Very clever of BA to restart KUL services . It will be very interesting to see if domestic MH loyalist will stick around , particularly at the pointy end . Difficult decision whether to invest money in product or just try and battle through . They already have a pretty poor premium product and replacing A380 routes with old 777s isnt going to help . Agree there isnt going to be much of a market for used A380s considering demand for new ones has slown to almost a halt . I could see QF picking up 1 for SYD - HKG but doubt they would buy more to upguage 747 LAX routes while the AUD is in such a poor position against the USD - those US flights are getting harder to fill . QF has 8 more A380s on the order books . Those 8 are intended to replace the 9 refit 744s post 2018 . Why not get some cheap , near new , A380s and bring forward some 747 retirements - at least the 3 remaining non refit 744s , or even all 6 of the non ERs . If QF is to spend money on capital this year , personally I 'd prefer it be spent on exercising the 787 options . Assuming QF does want to buy these A380 , there are only two available now with the other four being available from sometime next year . If the MY A380 's are the newer model which would allow fully loaded A380 operations to DFW , they might be a good pickup . Whilst passengers may like the A380 ( Inc me ) is switching BNE - LAX to an A380 the best thing for QF ? What about onward flights to JFK ? IS BNE better served by a 787 to LAX - JFK with another 787 opening up BNE - DFW flights ? Is SYD - HKG best served by an A380 or double daily flights in a smaller aircraft ? The A380 , whilst a pleasant flying experience is not the right plane for every route . Maybe , just maybe QF should consider the following : - purchasing / leasing all of MAS A380 and start a BNE - DXB - LHR service , upgrade DFW to a daily service , SYD - HKG to daily A380 and change BNE - LAX to an A380 . With the B777 - 200 ER , I could see QF agin either purchaing / leasing all of them and resume a SYD - SFO daily and SYD - BJS daily . Would really be nice to see QF take some steeps in the right way ;-) And maybe also having another destination in Europe ! QF has been moving towards reducing fleet types . Whilst picking up A380 's is a possibility , it would be extremely unlikely that they pick up 4 x 777-200 . More fleet types ( particulary only 4 ) would be added cost . That would be the plan ... they removed the 767's and retired the 737 - 4 . Picking up 777's would make that 5 though and potentially 6 if there is a period of 737>747 > A330>777>787 > A380 operating at the same time . When I said \" ( particulary only four ) \" I should have inserted the words ' planes ' after four . Qantas wo n't be taking the options on those 8 aircraft ordered . These Malaysian aircraft would be great to have 3 more aircraft to operate all the Longhaul routes . They could put to pasture the last 3 747 that have the old product on them . Why is it that Malaysian do n't just codeshare on QF metal and reduce their services to help with the losses . Seems that Qantas put many passengers onto other metal , why ca n't Malaysian do the same . Customers booking Malaysian would be happier on QF aircraft and flight numbers . Could be a possibility although I think airlines like BA and EK would n't spare a thought on buying them . PLEASE QANTAS BUY THEM DONT LET EK BUY THEM !!!!!!!!!!! If EK does decide to purchase the MAS A380 , do you think they might upgrade DXB-BKK-SYD - CHC service to an A380 and the same with DXB - KUL & SIN - MEL serivce ? If BA does purchase them , they should upgrade BA15/16 service to the A380 and start a new serivce LHR - SIN - MEL . If BA did buy them , why would they fly them to SYD ? 777 is a good sized plane for that route and has good cargo cap . Using the A380 would tie up the eqv of around 2.5 planes on an ultra long haul tag when they could get better use of them on single stop premium routes across the Atlantic to the USA . Melbourne ? There is a reason why BA is the remaining European airline flying to Australia , shortage of A380s is not one of them . Yeah I personally wish they come to Melbourne but there are cities like Mumbai , Delhi , Mexico , Shanghai which generate more point to point traffic . Will be hard to trade A380s to existing operators without MH providing incentives . The big operators all want Airbus to run an A380neo program . I wonder if the political classes in Kuala Lumpur would \" strongly advise \" Herr Mueller to \" reconsider \" the decision to sell / lease a couple of A380s and ensure the KUL / LHR flagship service remains in place . The sense of entitlement of the Kuala Lumpur elite is palpable . Of course the language will be couched in populist terms as saving national pride and ego .

See Al - Qaeda seeks a new alliance ATol , May 21 , 2009 . ) NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE , Pakistan - An al - Qaeda - linked cell led by veteran Kashmiri guerrilla commander Ilyas Kashmiri had completed all plans for the assassination of Pakistan 's chief of army staff , General Ashfaq Parvez Kiani , in 2008 , but when the matter was sent to the top al - Qaeda hierarchy for approval , it immediately ordered the plan to be shelved . Al - Qaeda , the ideologue said , felt at the time that had the assassination attempt been carried out , Pakistan would have been turned into a battle ground between the Pakistani security forces and militants - and the chief beneficiary would have been India and the United States . Al - Qaeda cells were therefore advised to work on a much broader strategy to defeat the Western forces in Afghanistan . They were told that any al - Qaeda action against Pakistan , India and Iran was not aimed at destabilizing these countries , but to deter them from supporting the US - led \" war on terror \" in an effort to create a balance in favor of the anti-Western resistance . As it has turned out , the Pakistani military , largely as a result of US pressure , is conducting a massive military operation against militants in the Swat area of NWFP . Pakistan has deployed tens of thousands of troops backed by air power to fight about 4,000 militants in Swat and neighboring districts . They are accused of not honoring a peace accord signed in February and last month they advanced toward the capital Islamabad . On Friday , Bloomberg reported that Pakistani officials had claimed that fighters from Uzbekistan and Chechnya were among foreign forces helping the Taliban . The fighting over the past 10 days has forced nearly 2 million people to flee the area , this in addition to about 500,000 refugees who fled earlier fighting . Sights on Kiani Kiani 's daily visits to a gym in 2008 were tracked by an al - Qaeda cell , which noted a security breach that left him vulnerable to a suicide bomber as he stepped out of his car . A plan was drawn up to take him out , and a team , picked from Brigade 313's Junudul Fida group , was selected . But that is as far as it went after al - Qaeda leaders had had their say . \" There is a shariat [ Islamic law ] under which his murder could have been justified . But then there is a hikmat [ strategy ] under which his murder could have been a serious blunder , \" said the ideologue . \" The Pakistan army could then have launched an all - out war in the tribal areas , and we could have retaliated with equal strength . In that process , Pakistan would have become a battleground and enemies like India and the US would have received the chance to intervene . Although in our files Pakistan does not exist , we of course do n't want enemies of Islam to take advantage of any situation . \" Al - Qaeda 's main priority is to use natural landmarks as boundaries against the security forces . The first success has been in securing an area all along the Hindu Kush mountains from Terah Valley in Khyber Agency up to the Turban district of Pakistan 's Balochistan province bordering Iran . The second target is to push Pakistani forces back beyond the Indus River . The source of the Indus is in Tibet ; it begins at the confluence of the Sengge and Gar rivers that drain the Nganglong Kangri and Gangdise Shan mountain ranges . The Indus then flows northwest through Ladakh and Baltistan into Gilgit , just south of the Karakoram range . The Shyok River , Shigar and Gilgit streams carry glacial waters into the main river . It gradually bends to the south , coming out of the hills between Peshawar and Rawalpindi in Pakistan . It essentially means that militants would allow the writ of the state up to Punjab and Sindh provinces , but they want complete control in parts of NWFP and parts of Balochistan . The ideologue stressed that al - Qaeda does n't mean any hostility against the state of Pakistan or its state institutions . This message was passed on by al - Qaeda leaders when they met a top Taliban delegation in the North Waziristan tribal agency on the border with Afghanistan a few weeks ago . The delegation was headed by Mullah Bradar and he conveyed Taliban leader Mullah Omar 's message that al - Qaeda hostilities against the Pakistani security forces should be avoided . The delegation even warned al - Qaeda in a muffled way that if hostilities against Pakistan and the Pakistani security forces were not stopped , it would be seen as damaging the cause of Islam . Al - Qaeda repeated that its goal was to make the Pakistani security forces neutral in the \" war on terror \" . The overall object is to win the war in Afghanistan . To this end , al - Qaeda will continue to engage the security forces in the Swat area . The simple reason is that al - Qaeda fears that the military , under US pressure , has plans in place to move into North and South Waziristan , where al - Qaeda and the Taliban have key resources vital to their struggle in Afghanistan . So it is better to keep the military pinned down in Swat . Syed Saleem Shahzad is Asia Times Online 's Pakistan Bureau Chief .

See Al - Qaeda seeks a new alliance ATol , May 21 , 2009 . ) NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE , Pakistan - An al - Qaeda - linked cell led by veteran Kashmiri guerrilla commander Ilyas Kashmiri had completed all plans for the assassination of Pakistan 's chief of army staff , General Ashfaq Parvez Kiani , in 2008 , but when the matter was sent to the top al - Qaeda hierarchy for approval , it immediately ordered the plan to be shelved . Al - Qaeda , the ideologue said , felt at the time that had the assassination attempt been carried out , Pakistan would have been turned into a battle ground between the Pakistani security forces and militants - and the chief beneficiary would have been India and the United States . Al - Qaeda cells were therefore advised to work on a much broader strategy to defeat the Western forces in Afghanistan . They were told that any al - Qaeda action against Pakistan , India and Iran was not aimed at destabilizing these countries , but to deter them from supporting the US - led \" war on terror \" in an effort to create a balance in favor of the anti-Western resistance . As it has turned out , the Pakistani military , largely as a result of US pressure , is conducting a massive military operation against militants in the Swat area of NWFP . Pakistan has deployed tens of thousands of troops backed by air power to fight about 4,000 militants in Swat and neighboring districts . They are accused of not honoring a peace accord signed in February and last month they advanced toward the capital Islamabad . On Friday , Bloomberg reported that Pakistani officials had claimed that fighters from Uzbekistan and Chechnya were among foreign forces helping the Taliban . The fighting over the past 10 days has forced nearly 2 million people to flee the area , this in addition to about 500,000 refugees who fled earlier fighting . Sights on Kiani Kiani 's daily visits to a gym in 2008 were tracked by an al - Qaeda cell , which noted a security breach that left him vulnerable to a suicide bomber as he stepped out of his car . A plan was drawn up to take him out , and a team , picked from Brigade 313's Junudul Fida group , was selected . But that is as far as it went after al - Qaeda leaders had had their say . \" There is a shariat [ Islamic law ] under which his murder could have been justified . But then there is a hikmat [ strategy ] under which his murder could have been a serious blunder , \" said the ideologue . \" The Pakistan army could then have launched an all - out war in the tribal areas , and we could have retaliated with equal strength . In that process , Pakistan would have become a battleground and enemies like India and the US would have received the chance to intervene . Although in our files Pakistan does not exist , we of course do n't want enemies of Islam to take advantage of any situation . \" Al - Qaeda 's main priority is to use natural landmarks as boundaries against the security forces . The first success has been in securing an area all along the Hindu Kush mountains from Terah Valley in Khyber Agency up to the Turban district of Pakistan 's Balochistan province bordering Iran . The second target is to push Pakistani forces back beyond the Indus River . The source of the Indus is in Tibet ; it begins at the confluence of the Sengge and Gar rivers that drain the Nganglong Kangri and Gangdise Shan mountain ranges . The Indus then flows northwest through Ladakh and Baltistan into Gilgit , just south of the Karakoram range . The Shyok River , Shigar and Gilgit streams carry glacial waters into the main river . It gradually bends to the south , coming out of the hills between Peshawar and Rawalpindi in Pakistan . It essentially means that militants would allow the writ of the state up to Punjab and Sindh provinces , but they want complete control in parts of NWFP and parts of Balochistan . The ideologue stressed that al - Qaeda does n't mean any hostility against the state of Pakistan or its state institutions . This message was passed on by al - Qaeda leaders when they met a top Taliban delegation in the North Waziristan tribal agency on the border with Afghanistan a few weeks ago . The delegation was headed by Mullah Bradar and he conveyed Taliban leader Mullah Omar 's message that al - Qaeda hostilities against the Pakistani security forces should be avoided . The delegation even warned al - Qaeda in a muffled way that if hostilities against Pakistan and the Pakistani security forces were not stopped , it would be seen as damaging the cause of Islam . Al - Qaeda repeated that its goal was to make the Pakistani security forces neutral in the \" war on terror \" . The overall object is to win the war in Afghanistan . To this end , al - Qaeda will continue to engage the security forces in the Swat area . The simple reason is that al - Qaeda fears that the military , under US pressure , has plans in place to move into North and South Waziristan , where al - Qaeda and the Taliban have key resources vital to their struggle in Afghanistan . So it is better to keep the military pinned down in Swat . Syed Saleem Shahzad is Asia Times Online 's Pakistan Bureau Chief .

Known as humanity 's final frontier , it calls out to those bold explorers willing to tackle its awesome beauty and journey into the unknown . Edward Higgins White II was born in San Antonio , Texas on Nov. 14 , 1930 . Coming from a family of pilots , White became fascinated with aviation . White 's father , Edward H. White , Sr. was a major general in the Air Force and helped nurture his son 's interest . White 's family moved to Washington , D.C. where he attended Western High School . He excelled in track as the second best hurdler in the area . Upon his high school graduation in 1948 , White received an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy . Again , White proved his skill and ability as a runner when he set a 400 - meter hurdles college record and nearly made the 1952 Olympic team . Although an accomplished athlete , White made sure to remain focused on academics . In the spring of 1952 , he graduated with a bachelor 's degree and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force . During his time at West Point , White met Patricia Finegan , who would become his wife in 1953 . The first step to becoming a pilot after graduating from the world 's most prestigious military school is to enter flight training . After 13 rigorous months of instruction in Florida and Texas , White received his pilot wings . Beginning in April 1954 , he was assigned to the 22nd Fighter Day Squadron at Bitburg Air Base , Germany . White spent three and a half years in Germany flying the F -86 and F - 100 fighter aircraft . White returned to the United States in 1958 and entered the University of Michigan under the Air Force Institute of Technology Program . A year later , he graduated with a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering . In July 1959 , White attended the Air Force Test Pilot Program at Edwards Air Force Base , Calif . for advanced aviation training . After this intense program , the young pilot was then transferred to Wright - Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton , Ohio as a weightlessness and extended flight training captain within the Aeronautical Systems Division . The aviation experience White gained proved to lay the foundation for the skill sets he would later use as an astronaut . His timing proved to be fortuitous . The launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 not only ushered in humanity 's entrance to space , but also created a race between the United States and the U.S.S.R. that would carry on for more than a decade . In response to this launching by the U.S.S.R. , President Eisenhower signed into law the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) . This new agency would research and develop mankind 's ability to travel in outer space . The first organized program at NASA began as Project Mercury in 1958 . The goal was simple : to determine if humans could survive in space . After several test flights , the answer to this question was immediate \u2013 humans had the physical and mental capacity to endure a zero gravity environment . NASA then set the stage for another intrepid endeavor , this time in the form of Project Gemini in 1963 , a mere five years after Mercury . Now that scientists knew humans could venture into outer space , their aim was to develop techniques for advanced space travel through low earth orbit flights . In September 1962 , before Project Gemini was announced , White was named as a member of the astronaut team selected by NASA . He was selected as one of nine , from a pool of 200 candidates , to become an astronaut . Soon after , White became heavily involved in the Gemini program . White 's first time to space was as a pilot for the Gemini 4 flight , a four - day mission from June 3 - 7 , 1965 . During this flight , he made his way into the history books as the first American to make a spacewalk while outside the spacecraft for 21 minutes . Other highlights of the mission included the study of cabin depressurization , the opening of cabin doors and 12 scientific and medical experiments . On Gemini 4 's return to Earth , President Johnson promoted White to the rank of lieutenant colonel and presented him with the NASA Exceptional Service Medal and the U.S. Air Force Senior Astronaut Wings . Despite an extremely short period of time between the Mercury and Gemini programs , technology and research at NASA progressed rapidly . Mankind was now on course to land on the moon by the end of the 1960s hoping to emerge victorious against rival U.S.S.R . To embark on this new objective , NASA unveiled its Apollo program to transport America 's heroes . Project Apollo was the next step after Gemini to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth . Based on the job White did on the Gemini 4 mission , he was selected as senior pilot for the first Apollo mission on March 21 , 1966 . Joining him on the mission would be command pilot Virgil \u201c Gus \u201d Grissom and pilot Roger Chaffee . The very first Apollo spacecraft , the AS - 204 , was built for spaceflight but never intended for a trip to the moon , as it lacked the necessary docking equipment . On January 27 , 1967 , the three astronauts entered the command module for a practice session while on the launch pad at Cape Kennedy , Fla . While inside the craft , something went wrong and a fire soon engulfed the cockpit . Immediately prior to the accident , the crew members were running through a checklist of things they would do in space . Suddenly , Chaffee 's voice could be heard saying , \u201c We 've got a fire in the cockpit . \u201d White attempted to open the hatch , however the two - piece hatch was a design which required the crew to undo several bolts to remove the inner section . The hot gases produced by the fire held the hatch shut , and within a few seconds , the air pressure had risen enough to prevent the crew from escaping , killing them . The tragic fire that captured the lives of these three brave men was the first casualties of America 's space program . NASA halted all operations and immediately launched a comprehensive inquiry into its rules and procedures .

From a Punjab National Bank employee to mountaineer \u2014 take us briefly through the journey \u2026 I started mountaineering after I started working with the PNB . I always loved travelling . In 1987 as I started travelling to various places like Mount Abu and north Bengal , I realised I was attracted to the mountains . In the same year , a friend told me about the Mountaineers ' Association of Krishnagar . I found they were organising a five - day rock-climbing course in Susunia ( Purulia ) . I decided to go for it and really enjoyed those five days of camp life . That 's how it all began . Later , I used to go for small treks in the Himalayas . But it was in 1989 that I took my Basic Mountaineering Course ( BMC ) from the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering ( NIM ) , Uttarkashi . And in 1990 I did my Advance Mountaineering Course ( AMC ) from NIM . So I started climbing the Himalayas from 1990 after my course was over . And from 1991 , I started leading my Krishnagar team . And finally in 2010 we climbed Mount Everest ( 8,850 m ) and then Kanchenjunga ( 8,586 m ) in 2011 . Initially , how did your family react ? Initially my family meant my parents . They did n't stop me because they did n't quite understand the risk factor in this field . When people started telling them I was doing well and even short articles started appearing in the newspapers , they started understanding more . When I got married , my wife Shriti already knew I was a mountaineer . But she always supported me , and I never had to worry about anything else . I am lucky to get their support and wonder if anybody else gets this kind of a support from their family , in this field . You are still an employee at PNB . How do you balance work and your passion ? Every year there is about a month 's holiday allotted for the employees . That is when I go on these expeditions . My colleagues feel proud of me and they are very supportive . What kind of challenges do you face on these expeditions ? The first and main challenge is completing the expedition successfully . Planning the entire expedition is tough . Unless the plan is right , you ca n't be successful . Arranging for funds is extremely difficult for small mountaineering clubs like ours . Especially when you are climbing peaks like Mount Everest , around Rs 40 lakh is required ... What were your biggest challenges while climbing Everest ? My first challenge was collecting funds for the expedition . Next , to keep myself fit at that high altitude , more because I was leading my group of men and I am ageing [ Basanta is 50 ] . The climb was n't so difficult . I was more worried about bringing my group back to the base camp safely . As a leader that was my challenge . What about Kanchenjunga ? Kanchenjunga still has a higher death ratio compared to Everest , mainly because of its unpredictable weather and difficult terrain . There are many long stretches for vertical climbing , which become risky . The distance between the last camp and the peak is a lot more ( than Everest ) . What was the first thing you did when you reached the top ? The first thing was to take a look around and see Everest . We were on top of the world ! When it came to Kanchenjunga , I had seen the peak in 2010 from Mount Everest . And within a year , we were on Kanchenjunga ! It 's more than a dream come true ! I had never dreamt that I would be able to climb both peaks within a year ... but my immediate concern was about returning to base camp . How do you keep fit ? In the morning I run at least 20 laps of a football field . That helps me increase my stamina . Otherwise , I just do freehand exercise regularly and eat on time . What are your future expeditions ? Now that I have got the taste of climbing more than 8,000 m , only that height tempts me . I had planned to climb Mount Godwin -Austen , 8,611 m ( K2 ) . I tried seeking permission from the government of Pakistan but they denied , saying they do n't allow Indians to climb K2 .

From a Punjab National Bank employee to mountaineer \u2014 take us briefly through the journey \u2026 I started mountaineering after I started working with the PNB . I always loved travelling . In 1987 as I started travelling to various places like Mount Abu and north Bengal , I realised I was attracted to the mountains . In the same year , a friend told me about the Mountaineers ' Association of Krishnagar . I found they were organising a five - day rock-climbing course in Susunia ( Purulia ) . I decided to go for it and really enjoyed those five days of camp life . That 's how it all began . Later , I used to go for small treks in the Himalayas . But it was in 1989 that I took my Basic Mountaineering Course ( BMC ) from the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering ( NIM ) , Uttarkashi . And in 1990 I did my Advance Mountaineering Course ( AMC ) from NIM . So I started climbing the Himalayas from 1990 after my course was over . And from 1991 , I started leading my Krishnagar team . And finally in 2010 we climbed Mount Everest ( 8,850 m ) and then Kanchenjunga ( 8,586 m ) in 2011 . Initially , how did your family react ? Initially my family meant my parents . They did n't stop me because they did n't quite understand the risk factor in this field . When people started telling them I was doing well and even short articles started appearing in the newspapers , they started understanding more . When I got married , my wife Shriti already knew I was a mountaineer . But she always supported me , and I never had to worry about anything else . I am lucky to get their support and wonder if anybody else gets this kind of a support from their family , in this field . You are still an employee at PNB . How do you balance work and your passion ? Every year there is about a month 's holiday allotted for the employees . That is when I go on these expeditions . My colleagues feel proud of me and they are very supportive . What kind of challenges do you face on these expeditions ? The first and main challenge is completing the expedition successfully . Planning the entire expedition is tough . Unless the plan is right , you ca n't be successful . Arranging for funds is extremely difficult for small mountaineering clubs like ours . Especially when you are climbing peaks like Mount Everest , around Rs 40 lakh is required ... What were your biggest challenges while climbing Everest ? My first challenge was collecting funds for the expedition . Next , to keep myself fit at that high altitude , more because I was leading my group of men and I am ageing [ Basanta is 50 ] . The climb was n't so difficult . I was more worried about bringing my group back to the base camp safely . As a leader that was my challenge . What about Kanchenjunga ? Kanchenjunga still has a higher death ratio compared to Everest , mainly because of its unpredictable weather and difficult terrain . There are many long stretches for vertical climbing , which become risky . The distance between the last camp and the peak is a lot more ( than Everest ) . What was the first thing you did when you reached the top ? The first thing was to take a look around and see Everest . We were on top of the world ! When it came to Kanchenjunga , I had seen the peak in 2010 from Mount Everest . And within a year , we were on Kanchenjunga ! It 's more than a dream come true ! I had never dreamt that I would be able to climb both peaks within a year ... but my immediate concern was about returning to base camp . How do you keep fit ? In the morning I run at least 20 laps of a football field . That helps me increase my stamina . Otherwise , I just do freehand exercise regularly and eat on time . What are your future expeditions ? Now that I have got the taste of climbing more than 8,000 m , only that height tempts me . I had planned to climb Mount Godwin -Austen , 8,611 m ( K2 ) . I tried seeking permission from the government of Pakistan but they denied , saying they do n't allow Indians to climb K2 . So , I plan to try Annapurna - I , 8,091 m ( Nepal ) in April , from the Mountaineers ' Association of Krishnagar . I want to stick to the Himalayas .

Mr. Cherubini , who taught high school English in the 1,200 - student district for 22 years , says he is doing the right thing . And federal civil-rights officials whom he invited to visit the district say that some of the practices he is ending are not only unfair , but also illegal . But reactions to his reforms have reached emotional extremes in this rural farming area , where white residents particularly resent his invitation to the civil-rights investigators and the media attention that followed them to Calhoun County . \u201c I do n't think anyone is more disliked here than Dr. Cherubini , \u201d said Richard West , a white businessman and a former member of the local school board . \u201c At the rate we 're going , we 'll be back to the 60's with whites in private schools . \u201d A current school board member , Julian Holder , who is black , countered : \u201c Something had to be done , and [ Mr. Cherubini ] took action . \u201d Mr. Holder said the tracking system consigned black students to less challenging classes and low expectations . Black and white residents do agree on one thing : The recent developments have strained relations between the groups , which had been largely genteel but distant . Mr. Cherubini 's enemies have made threatening phone calls to his home and office , and tried unsuccessfully to recall him . In September , upon learning that \u201c white clustering \u201d of kindergarten students had ended , some white parents began sending their young children to nearby private schools . Since this fall , 39 students , almost all of them white , have left the school system . Anonymous fliers with racially antagonistic messages and a fabricated riot scare that brought more than 100 parents racing to Calhoun County High School prompted still - unresolved police investigations . And the turmoil has seeped into the hallways of Calhoun High . \u201c I hear Dr. Cherubini is trying to cater to blacks , but that 's the American way . You know who 's on your side , \u201d said Rodney Kendrick , 17 , who is black and the president of the county National Association for the Advancement of Colored People youth chapter . But Mr. Kendrick , a senior , said he is not totally opposed to ability grouping , as it can provide greater challenges for students who work hard . Other blacks say it is hard to get out of low-level groups once they are tracked . White students feel somewhat besieged . \u201c It 's hard to laugh around here , \u201d said Preston Rish , a white senior . \u201c It looks like whites are against blacks and catered to , and blacks are helpless and Dr. Cherubini is going to save them . \u201d \u201c It has been a tough fall , \u201d Mr. Cherubini said in a recent interview , shaking his head at the understatement . Still , he pledges not to abandon what he has started . He feels vindicated by initial reports from federal officials , who said the school system , if formally reviewed , would be cited for civil-rights violations . The Calhoun County district \u201c appeared to be far away \u201d from showing that its system of grouping could be justified as an effort to improve opportunity and achievement , said Barbara Shannon , the chief attorney in the Atlanta regional office of the U.S. Education Department 's office for civil rights . Racial ' Comfort ' Calhoun County is in the heart of southwest Georgia 's peanut and cotton country , where fields border glimmering ponds and stands of oak , cypress , and pine trees . It is the kind of place where a longtime resident like Mr. Cherubini , who did not grow up in the South , still hears himself called an outsider because he does not socialize more with locals . Of the county 's roughly 5,000 residents , about 60 percent are black and 40 percent are white . Most people live in the towns of Edison , Morgan , Arlington , and Leary . In a region of the country often linked to racial strife , many white Calhoun County residents say there are no racial problems here . That widespread perception is why many locals say they were surprised by the intense feelings that emerged on both sides of the school issue . Like many Southern districts , Calhoun County was faced with integrating separate , segregated school systems after the U.S. Supreme Court declared such systems unconstitutional in 1954 . Integration came to this district in 1970 , but white students in kindergarten , 1st grade , and 2nd grade have been \u201c clustered \u201d to maintain white - majority classrooms , even though blacks make up about 75 percent of the system 's students . In the 1993 - 94 school year , for example , there were two all - black classes with 26 students each and two classes with whites outnumbering blacks by 14 to 11 and 12 to 8 . Andy Sanders , the principal of Calhoun County Elementary School , said clustering eased youngsters ' transition to school by keeping friends together . He said parents from both races felt \u201c more comfortable \u201d with such grouping . Grouping by skills level , or tracking , begins in 3rd grade , based on students ' reading ability . Using teacher recommendations and test scores , students are put in one of four ability groups for grades 3 - 8 , even though students move to the high school building when they reach 6th grade . Mr. Sanders said students are routinely evaluated and move up or down depending on their performance . \u201c I thought we had good flow between our groups , \u201d he said . \u201c I did n't see any need to make changes , or I would have . \u201d Willie Frost , a member of the county school board who is black , disagreed . \u201c Once they start in these groups , they stick together all the way , \u201d he said . Students choose a college - preparatory or vocational track beginning in 9th grade . This year , 15 blacks and 16 whites are expected to graduate from the college - bound group , while 17 blacks and seven whites will earn the vocational diploma . Civil- Rights Violations Ms. Shannon of the O.C.R. and a desegregation expert who is helping draft new policies for the district agreed that these practices do not pass legal muster . The Civil Rights Act of 1964 , which bars racial discrimination in federally financed education programs , prohibits tracking under some circumstances . \u201c The only time O.C.R. can deal with it is if grouping results in racially identifiable classes , and in this case , it did , \u201d said Nancy Peck , an official with the the Miami Equity Center . It is a branch of the Southeastern Desegregation Center , a federally financed center that provides technical assistance to districts . Ms. Peck added that Calhoun County is far from alone in its grouping practices . She suggested that media attention to this case could help make race - based grouping the \u201c civil - rights issue of the 90's . \u201d Ms. Peck will help Calhoun County develop a plan for change . Alternatives to tracking include randomly picked mixed - race classes , ability grouping for specific subjects , and team teaching . Ms. Shannon explained : \u201c We want to give them the opportunity to change in a way consistent with what they want . This way they can decide . \u201d She said there has been little public resistance to Ms. Peck 's suggestions . But their Nov. 14 presentation to the county school board attracted a record crowd , and the uproar that preceded it suggests the issue is likely to remain controversial . ' White Flight ' Feared Many whites , as well as some blacks , are wary of outside intervention and still resent Mr. Cherubini 's invitation to the federal officials . \u201c Is it like we 're hiding something ? \u201d asked Chuck Cowart , a banker who is the chairman of the school board . \u201c O.C.R. has known what we 're doing for 25 years . \u201d Some critics also say that the uproar could have been minimized if Mr. Cherubini had communicated more effectively with parents and implemented changes more gradually . Mr. Cowart worries about further \u201c white flight \u201d and freely suggests that Mr. Cherubini lacks the leadership and public-relations skills to guide the county through the changes that must be made . \u201c If Dr. Cherubini had gone to the board and said he had a problem with tracking and equity , these people would have found some way to disagree with him , \u201d countered James Gibson , the vice president of the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter . The district 's demographics may prevent his critics from altering either Mr. Cherubini 's desegregation policies or his job prospects . Blacks hold a 4 - to - 3 majority on the school board , which will name the superintendent beginning next year , when all districts in Georgia will have appointed , rather than elected , superintendents . While blacks may have been quiet about the district 's grouping practices , that does not mean they were unconcerned , Mr. Frost , the board member , said . He said Mr. Cherubini has been a catalyst for activism in the black community . Change Comes Slowly While heterogeneous kindergarten classes are the most dramatic result of Mr. Cherubini 's campaign , other changes are already occurring in the district . This winter , two white girls will participate on the basketball cheerleading squad , which has been all black for as long as anyone can remember . And the football cheerleading squad , which has been all white for several years , may be merged with the basketball squad next year . Mr. Cowart said football cheerleaders are chosen by a panel that includes both black and white judges . Few black girls try out for the squad , he said , and they simply fail to impress the judges . \u201c I want to know what 's the difference between an all - black basketball team picked with tryouts and the cheerleaders , \u201d he said . Ms. Shannon said officials would have to conduct interviews to determine if the school has precluded integrated squads by \u201c pattern and practice . \u201d A practice that may be even less amenable to change is that of holding separate senior proms for black and white students . This is not an official policy . White students simply do not attend the school - sponsored prom , and instead organize a separate party privately . \u201c I want to hear black music , not country , \u201d quipped Rodney Kendrick , the black senior at Calhoun High , who wants to be a journalist . His white friend , Preston Rish , who wants to study agriculture , agreed that differing cultural tastes are the root of the tradition . He said it makes him mad that adults think \u201c whites do n't want a formal with blacks . \u201d A version of this article appeared in the December 14 , 1994 edition of Education Week as Effort To Do the Right Thing Upsets Ga.

Mr. Cherubini , who taught high school English in the 1,200 - student district for 22 years , says he is doing the right thing . And federal civil-rights officials whom he invited to visit the district say that some of the practices he is ending are not only unfair , but also illegal . But reactions to his reforms have reached emotional extremes in this rural farming area , where white residents particularly resent his invitation to the civil-rights investigators and the media attention that followed them to Calhoun County . \u201c I do n't think anyone is more disliked here than Dr. Cherubini , \u201d said Richard West , a white businessman and a former member of the local school board . \u201c At the rate we 're going , we 'll be back to the 60's with whites in private schools . \u201d A current school board member , Julian Holder , who is black , countered : \u201c Something had to be done , and [ Mr. Cherubini ] took action . \u201d Mr. Holder said the tracking system consigned black students to less challenging classes and low expectations . Black and white residents do agree on one thing : The recent developments have strained relations between the groups , which had been largely genteel but distant . Mr. Cherubini 's enemies have made threatening phone calls to his home and office , and tried unsuccessfully to recall him . In September , upon learning that \u201c white clustering \u201d of kindergarten students had ended , some white parents began sending their young children to nearby private schools . Since this fall , 39 students , almost all of them white , have left the school system . Anonymous fliers with racially antagonistic messages and a fabricated riot scare that brought more than 100 parents racing to Calhoun County High School prompted still - unresolved police investigations . And the turmoil has seeped into the hallways of Calhoun High . \u201c I hear Dr. Cherubini is trying to cater to blacks , but that 's the American way . You know who 's on your side , \u201d said Rodney Kendrick , 17 , who is black and the president of the county National Association for the Advancement of Colored People youth chapter . But Mr. Kendrick , a senior , said he is not totally opposed to ability grouping , as it can provide greater challenges for students who work hard . Other blacks say it is hard to get out of low-level groups once they are tracked . White students feel somewhat besieged . \u201c It 's hard to laugh around here , \u201d said Preston Rish , a white senior . \u201c It looks like whites are against blacks and catered to , and blacks are helpless and Dr. Cherubini is going to save them . \u201d \u201c It has been a tough fall , \u201d Mr. Cherubini said in a recent interview , shaking his head at the understatement . Still , he pledges not to abandon what he has started . He feels vindicated by initial reports from federal officials , who said the school system , if formally reviewed , would be cited for civil-rights violations . The Calhoun County district \u201c appeared to be far away \u201d from showing that its system of grouping could be justified as an effort to improve opportunity and achievement , said Barbara Shannon , the chief attorney in the Atlanta regional office of the U.S. Education Department 's office for civil rights . Racial ' Comfort ' Calhoun County is in the heart of southwest Georgia 's peanut and cotton country , where fields border glimmering ponds and stands of oak , cypress , and pine trees . It is the kind of place where a longtime resident like Mr. Cherubini , who did not grow up in the South , still hears himself called an outsider because he does not socialize more with locals . Of the county 's roughly 5,000 residents , about 60 percent are black and 40 percent are white . Most people live in the towns of Edison , Morgan , Arlington , and Leary . In a region of the country often linked to racial strife , many white Calhoun County residents say there are no racial problems here . That widespread perception is why many locals say they were surprised by the intense feelings that emerged on both sides of the school issue . Like many Southern districts , Calhoun County was faced with integrating separate , segregated school systems after the U.S. Supreme Court declared such systems unconstitutional in 1954 . Integration came to this district in 1970 , but white students in kindergarten , 1st grade , and 2nd grade have been \u201c clustered \u201d to maintain white - majority classrooms , even though blacks make up about 75 percent of the system 's students . In the 1993 - 94 school year , for example , there were two all - black classes with 26 students each and two classes with whites outnumbering blacks by 14 to 11 and 12 to 8 . Andy Sanders , the principal of Calhoun County Elementary School , said clustering eased youngsters ' transition to school by keeping friends together . He said parents from both races felt \u201c more comfortable \u201d with such grouping . Grouping by skills level , or tracking , begins in 3rd grade , based on students ' reading ability . Using teacher recommendations and test scores , students are put in one of four ability groups for grades 3 - 8 , even though students move to the high school building when they reach 6th grade . Mr. Sanders said students are routinely evaluated and move up or down depending on their performance . \u201c I thought we had good flow between our groups , \u201d he said . \u201c I did n't see any need to make changes , or I would have . \u201d Willie Frost , a member of the county school board who is black , disagreed . \u201c Once they start in these groups , they stick together all the way , \u201d he said . Students choose a college - preparatory or vocational track beginning in 9th grade . This year , 15 blacks and 16 whites are expected to graduate from the college - bound group , while 17 blacks and seven whites will earn the vocational diploma . Civil- Rights Violations Ms. Shannon of the O.C.R. and a desegregation expert who is helping draft new policies for the district agreed that these practices do not pass legal muster . The Civil Rights Act of 1964 , which bars racial discrimination in federally financed education programs , prohibits tracking under some circumstances . \u201c The only time O.C.R. can deal with it is if grouping results in racially identifiable classes , and in this case , it did , \u201d said Nancy Peck , an official with the the Miami Equity Center . It is a branch of the Southeastern Desegregation Center , a federally financed center that provides technical assistance to districts . Ms. Peck added that Calhoun County is far from alone in its grouping practices . She suggested that media attention to this case could help make race - based grouping the \u201c civil - rights issue of the 90's . \u201d Ms. Peck will help Calhoun County develop a plan for change . Alternatives to tracking include randomly picked mixed - race classes , ability grouping for specific subjects , and team teaching . Ms. Shannon explained : \u201c We want to give them the opportunity to change in a way consistent with what they want . This way they can decide . \u201d She said there has been little public resistance to Ms. Peck 's suggestions . But their Nov. 14 presentation to the county school board attracted a record crowd , and the uproar that preceded it suggests the issue is likely to remain controversial . ' White Flight ' Feared Many whites , as well as some blacks , are wary of outside intervention and still resent Mr. Cherubini 's invitation to the federal officials . \u201c Is it like we 're hiding something ? \u201d asked Chuck Cowart , a banker who is the chairman of the school board . \u201c O.C.R. has known what we 're doing for 25 years . \u201d Some critics also say that the uproar could have been minimized if Mr. Cherubini had communicated more effectively with parents and implemented changes more gradually .

He was beheaded on January 30 , 1649 , in front of a crowd at the Palace of Whitehall , where his severed head was then exhibited for all to see . The following day it was sewn back onto his body , and he was then embalmed and buried inside a sealed lead coffin in a vault at Windsor Castle . More than 150 years later , Charles ' final resting place had all but been forgotten \u2013 until workmen at St George 's Chapel broke through a wall and accidentally discovered the tomb . On April 1 , 1813 the Prince Regent organized an inspection of the coffins inside , two of which contained the bodies of King Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour . He led a party into the vault , accompanied by King George III 's doctor Sir Henry Halford , and together they opened Charles ' lead coffin to examine his corpse . Halford later wrote in slightly disturbing detail about the discovery of Charles body : \u201c When the head had been entirely disengaged from the attachments which confined it , it was found to be loose , and , without any difficulty , was taken up and held to view . It was quite wet and gave a greenish red tinge to paper and to linen , which touched it . \u201c The hair was thick at the back part of the head and , in appearance , nearly black . A portion of it , which has since been cleaned and dried , is of a beautiful dark brown colour . That of the beard was a redder brown .

ELEONORA ROSTAS SAT ON A BENCH in her front yard in the Romanian village of Hadareni , clutching a blue folder stuffed with legal documents . The papers included a settlement from the European Court of Human Rights that Rostas had mixed feelings about having signed . She pointed toward an area just past her chain - link fence and recalled the night of September 20 , 1993 . \" Do n't kill me , I have kids , \" Rostas said she heard a man begging in the house next door . Dozens of villagersincluding the local police commander and one of his officerswere gathering outside . Some began throwing stones , pieces of wood , and clumps of dirt at the house . \" Let them burn like rats ! \" members of the mob shouted , according to Rostas 's documents . Hours earlier , three men who , like Rostas , were Gypsies ( or Roma , as many prefer to be called ) and two Romanian men had gotten into a scuffle in town . By the end of it , one of the Roma had stabbed and killed a Romanian . The three Roma had run and taken shelter in the house next to Rostas 's . Two of them tried to flee but were caught and beaten to death by the mob ; another was prevented from leaving and was burned alive . The crowd moved on to the homes of other Roma in the village , burning 13 houses and trashing several more . As her house was torched , Rostas , then 37 , took her teenage daughter and fled into the surrounding cornfields . When Rostas and her neighbors returned a few weeks later , they took refuge in henhouses , pigsties , and windowless cellars as the winter set in . \" We had no water to wash ourselves , \" Rostas said . \" We did n't have clothes , food . No one would help . \" AFTER THE INCIDENT , Rostas and many other of the village 's 150 Roma spoke with the local prosecutor , accusing some 18 members of the mob of looting , arson , and murder . Three police officers , including the local chief , were investigated by military prosecutors , but charges were dropped in 1995 , even though earlier testimony indicated that two had been present during the attacks and the other implicated in trying to cover up the episode . It took until 1998 the prosecutor filed charges in 1997 , four years after the crimesfor the local Romanian court to deliver a criminal judgment in the case , convicting five men of murder and seven others of destroying property and disturbing public order . ( None of the convicts served more than three and a half years in prison . In 1999 , the Romanian Supreme Court acquitted two of the accused murderers and reduced the charges against the other three due to mitigating circumstances , including the stabbing that sparked the incident . The next year , the president of Romania pardoned two of the remaining three convicts . ) The local judge had earlier made excuses for the initial lenient sentences , saying that the convicted men should not be punished severely because they were not the only ones involved in the attack . She also castigated the Roma for \" their rejection of the moral values accepted by the rest of the population , \" adding that the Roma community had \" marginalized itself , shown aggressive behavior , and deliberately denied and violated the legal norms acknowledged by society . \" THE ROMA HAVE RARELY FOUND A WARM WELCOME in Europe , where they have lived at the margins of society since their migration from northern India more than 10 centuries ago . There are seven to nine million Roma on the continent today , and these traditionally nomadic people maintain a separate culture , due in part to their belief that mixing with gadje , or outsiders , is polluting : The Roma , for example , maintain strict codes of sexual chastity and personal hygiene . In Romania , where the Roma were enslaved as field hands and artisans for 500 years until 1856 , they tend to be particularly insular . They follow their own legal system administered by the kris , a community tribunal that settles disputes between Roma over matters like theft , violence , and divorce , with penalties ranging from fines to excommunication from the group . With their traditional trades such as blacksmithing and metalworking no longer much required , many Roma now survive by working as day laborers or selling cheap goods . Their separateness has made them especially vulnerable to changes that have swept through Romania in the past two decades . In 1989 , a group of military officers , emboldened by a civil uprising in the streets of Bucharest , tried and executed the Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu , who had ruled the country for 24 years . The Roma were seen to have benefited under Communism : They were given plots of land to farm under collectivization and their connections to Roma in neighboring countries gave them special access to a thriving black market . From their view , however , they felt forced to assimilate and abandon their traditional jobs in favor of factory work . As economic woes beset Romania in the 1980s and the tough times later fueled a belligerent nationalism , the Roma became scapegoats . The Hadareni attack was one of an estimated 30 similar acts of violence against the Roma in the 1990s . In 2000 , the four-year - old European Roma Rights Center , based in Budapest , Hungary , filed a complaint on behalf of Rostas and 24 other victims of the attack with the European Court of Human Rights . Staffed largely by non-Roma , the organization works to improve the plight of the Roma , primarily through litigation and advocacy . The center often brings cases to the human rights court , which was established after World War II to enforce the European Convention on Human Rights . Individuals or governments that have exhausted domestic legal remedies can file complaints against a government , accusing it of failing to uphold the convention . The court has the power to levy fines and award compensation , and can reject any settlement reached by parties involved in a case . In the Hadereni case , the center charged Romania with violating the human rights of Rostas and the other Roma in its treatment of them in the aftermath of the attack . Last summer , the court called Romania to account for those abuses . The government was found to have violated four articles of the European Convention on Human Rights , including the right to be free of inhuman treatment , the right to be free of discrimination , and the right to a fair hearing . In its judgment , the court described the comments by the local Romanian court as \" purely discriminatory . \" The decision of the human rights court came a week after the court affirmed a settlement between Romania and 18 of the 25 plaintiffs in the case , including Rostas , who followed the center 's advice and chose not to remain in the group that pressed for and received the final judgment . In the settlement , the Romanian government apologized for its ill treatment of the Hadareni Roma and agreed to adopt measures to reduce discrimination . The plaintiffs were awarded a total of 500,000 Euros , or $ 600,000 , of which Rostas received 24,000 Euros ( $ 28,800 ) . According to Constantin Cojocariu , who has managed the case at the Roma rights center , the ruling \" was very good from our point of view . \" He said that the expansive finding of discrimination is helping his organization push for settlements in three similar cases against Romania . While they feel vindicated by Romania 's apology , the clients of the center object to other aspects of the settlement . At issue in particular is a clause requiring Romania to increase \" Roma participation \" in the community through \" mutual assistance and community development projects . \" Rostas and her neighbors do n't want to participate , especially with locals who have harassed and threatened them . More fundamentally , however , the Roma are suspicious of integration , which many believe threatens their cultural identity much as the forced assimilation policies of the Communist era did . Rostas and the other Roma worry that money earmarked for community development , expected to be as much as 300,000 euros , will benefit their persecutors , who are back in the community . \" Romanians consider Gypsies like rats . They show more mercy to a dog , \" Rostas said . \" Now they are laughing at us . They say we can kill you and burn your houses and nothing will happen to us . \" When he was told of the comments by Roma in the village , Cojocariu was taken aback . He sees community development and programs to reduce ethnic tensions as the only way forward for the Roma . \" It is not our responsibility to press for justice at any price , \" he said . Rostas , however , said she fears that the people who committed the attack 12 years ago may try to burn the Roma 's homes again , as relations in the village remain bitter . She insisted the Roma would continue to press their civil case in the local courts , because they want the perpetrators to pay additional compensation for their crimes . \" The case in the European Court of Human Rights was between Europe and the government of Romania , \" she said . Between her people and the attackers in the village , it settled nothing .","annotations":[{"text":"the Romanian village of Hadareni","span":[439,470],"token_span":[74,78],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the event takes place."},{"text":"the night of September 20 , 1993","span":[728,759],"token_span":[124,130],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time when the event occurs."},{"text":"Dozens of villagersincluding the local police commander and one of his officerswere","span":[859,941],"token_span":[156,167],"role":"Kindler","label":"Kindler","role_definition":"The Kindler is the person performing the intentional act."},{"text":"house","span":[1414,1418],"token_span":[270,270],"role":"Flammables","label":"Flammables","role_definition":"The Flamables is the the object that is set on fire by the Kindler."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"As the Roma refused to come out of the house , the Romanian and Hungarian villagers , including the local police commander and one of his officers , gathered outside , sprayed the house with gasoline and set it on fire .

Dr Rowan Williams said Thomas Valpy French , who died in a date grove in Muscat in 1891 , was a prime example of a Christian disciple . Dr Williams was speaking at the London conference of Fulcrum , the open evangelical Anglican group , on the theme of \u201c Being disciples \u201d . French was someone who showed \u201c the utter worthwhileness of discipleship \u201d , even if his ' success ' was n't obvious to the world . Born in 1825 in Burton\u2013on \u2013 Trent , the son of a long\u2013serving clergyman , French first felt called to mission in India while at Oxford University . He made a pact with a fellow student that they would serve together . He later watched that friend die after a railway accident before they even left England . In his first seven years in Agra , he only made one convert , although two of his pupils later came to faith . French 's lack of success in numbers did n't daunt him , said the archbishop . French simply understood discipleship as , in the archbishop 's phrase , \u201c going to be where Jesus is \u201d . Dr Williams developed his theme , saying that \u201c going to be where Jesus is \u201d meant \u201c you 'll find yourself in the same kind of company as Jesus \u201d \u2014 the poor , the despised , those without a voice , \u201c without purchase in society \u201d . \u201c Where are the people without a voice ? Without the leverage ? \u201d Dr Williams asked . These were the people with whom Christian disciples would look to be . For French , such people were ultimately found among the Muslims of the Persian Gulf . \u201c Naming the elephant in the room , \u201d Dr Williams suggested that for Christians in countries like Jamaica and Nigeria , such discipleship today might meant standing alongside homosexual people . French 's journey , however , took him to Agra in 1851 , where he set up the Christian school , St John 's College . In the anti\u2013British uprising of 1857 , amid the general panic , he calmly continued teaching . His wife , however , came near to death when giving birth to their fourth child and returned to England for good . Some 10 years later , when he was leaving England to become the first Bishop of the new Diocese of Lahore , he made mention of the sacrifice of his wife and , by then , 8 children in sparing him to leave . His wife 's comments are not recorded . He would soon be known as \u201c the seven\u2013tongued clergyman of Lahore \u201d for his dedication to studying languages . He studied for three or four hours a day and mastered Urdu , Hindustani , Punjabi , Persian , Arabic and other tongues . French founded Lahore Divinity School and made visits to Kashmir and Iran . But by 1887 , after 10 years as bishop , he felt his health failing and resigned . However , he still could n't give up being a pioneering missionary . Though he had returned to England , in late 1890 he set sail for Muscat in Oman . In February 1891 , at the age of 66 , he became the first missionary there .

Dr Rowan Williams said Thomas Valpy French , who died in a date grove in Muscat in 1891 , was a prime example of a Christian disciple . Dr Williams was speaking at the London conference of Fulcrum , the open evangelical Anglican group , on the theme of \u201c Being disciples \u201d . French was someone who showed \u201c the utter worthwhileness of discipleship \u201d , even if his ' success ' was n't obvious to the world . Born in 1825 in Burton\u2013on \u2013 Trent , the son of a long\u2013serving clergyman , French first felt called to mission in India while at Oxford University . He made a pact with a fellow student that they would serve together . He later watched that friend die after a railway accident before they even left England . In his first seven years in Agra , he only made one convert , although two of his pupils later came to faith . French 's lack of success in numbers did n't daunt him , said the archbishop . French simply understood discipleship as , in the archbishop 's phrase , \u201c going to be where Jesus is \u201d . Dr Williams developed his theme , saying that \u201c going to be where Jesus is \u201d meant \u201c you 'll find yourself in the same kind of company as Jesus \u201d \u2014 the poor , the despised , those without a voice , \u201c without purchase in society \u201d . \u201c Where are the people without a voice ? Without the leverage ? \u201d Dr Williams asked . These were the people with whom Christian disciples would look to be . For French , such people were ultimately found among the Muslims of the Persian Gulf . \u201c Naming the elephant in the room , \u201d Dr Williams suggested that for Christians in countries like Jamaica and Nigeria , such discipleship today might meant standing alongside homosexual people . French 's journey , however , took him to Agra in 1851 , where he set up the Christian school , St John 's College . In the anti\u2013British uprising of 1857 , amid the general panic , he calmly continued teaching . His wife , however , came near to death when giving birth to their fourth child and returned to England for good . Some 10 years later , when he was leaving England to become the first Bishop of the new Diocese of Lahore , he made mention of the sacrifice of his wife and , by then , 8 children in sparing him to leave . His wife 's comments are not recorded . He would soon be known as \u201c the seven\u2013tongued clergyman of Lahore \u201d for his dedication to studying languages . He studied for three or four hours a day and mastered Urdu , Hindustani , Punjabi , Persian , Arabic and other tongues . French founded Lahore Divinity School and made visits to Kashmir and Iran . But by 1887 , after 10 years as bishop , he felt his health failing and resigned . However , he still could n't give up being a pioneering missionary . Though he had returned to England , in late 1890 he set sail for Muscat in Oman . In February 1891 , at the age of 66 , he became the first missionary there . As in Agra , where he had taken part in vigorous public debates with Muslim scholars , he met imams , to whom he would introduce himself with the words , \u201c I love all lovers of God . \u201d After a few months he set off up the coast on an evangelistic journey , but collapsed unconscious in a date grove in the village of Sib . \u201c If he attempted to labour above measure for his Lord , \u201d wrote his companion in Muscat , the Rev AC Maitland , \u201c God grant us more of the Spirit which inspired him . \u201d Information on Thomas French adapted from Thomas Valpy French , First Bishop of Lahore , by Vivienne Stacey .","annotations":[{"text":"Thomas Valpy French","span":[101,119],"token_span":[18,20],"role":"Self_mover","label":"Self_mover","role_definition":"This is the entity which moves under its own power."},{"text":"1851","span":[1810,1813],"token_span":[353,353],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the motion takes place."},{"text":"India","span":[598,602],"token_span":[116,116],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place is where the motion (which is specified by a Source, Path or Goal) is located."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-0441-979-frame-Shoot_projectiles","frame":"Shoot_projectiles","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Agent causes a Firearm to discharge which induces the rapid motion of the Projectile.","frame_ancestors":["Cause_motion","Transitive_action","Objective_influence","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"In May 2016 Spain 's Civil Guard Police force vessel Rio Cedena twice tried to cut across the path of the submarine in Gibraltar territorial waters .

While Euronymous ' Inner Circle was busy raising havoc up north , a smoldering , darkened impetus was building up near the Mediterranean shores which would eventually prove to be one of the most productive and yet perhaps the most underrated of European scenes . Maybe because it was overshadowed by the incidents in Norway , or more importantly because most of the bands themselves involved in those years have long since silenced , the early Hellenic black metal scene has remained largely ignored even by genre devotees . Nonetheless , ask any self - respecting metalhead about the aforementioned scene and he 'll be quick to quote you the infamous three : Rotting Christ , Necromantia and Varathron . Of course , although history has primarily saved these three names , the scene itself has offered a considerably larger number of gems from bands which still dwell in obscurity even nowadays , more than ten years after the great boom of the early ' 90s . Since it is nigh impossible to decisively pin-point the exact quality that gave Hellenic black metal its uniqueness , first a small presentation of the three most influential bands is in order to provide a more generalized idea of the genre . The most famous and almost synonymous with the genre , Rotting Christ first took form as a threesome back in 1987 , then comprising Sakis on vocals and guitars , Jim on bass and Sakis ' brother Themis on drums . Their first forage into the annals of extreme metal by the then sixteen year old Sakis and his fellow band - members would see them mostly fidgeting around grindcore . It was n't until the _ Passage to Arcturo_ EP was released that the band would show its most promising direction -- a release that was good or ' bad ' enough to convince the notorious Euronymous to sign them to his Deathlike Silence Productions label , a decision that never actually saw fruition . There are still fans who think that the aforementioned EP is the definitive of the RC sound and arguably the best from all subsequent RC releases . However , a more objective observer might beg to differ ; their highly regarded debut , _ Thy Mighty Contract_ , was released in 1993 through Osmose Records and it was this album that launched the Christs into global attention . ( It seems that 1993 was a landmark year for Hellenic black metal , since along RC 's _ Thy Mighty Contract_ , both Necromantia 's and Varathron 's debut albums were also released . ) When it first hit the media , music journalists found themselves befuddled by the unique approach the Greeksters were employing in their compositions . Consequently the ' Hellenic black metal ' dub was bestowed upon them , which would also grace any release of a similar origin and audial character . A year later , the might I say o-r- g - a-s - m - i-c _ Non Serviam_ , and also unfortunately their most poorly promoted album , was released through Unisound Records . Following some legal issues with the label , the album would never enjoy the promotion that it rightfully deserved . Strangely , it seems that the band does n't really mention it in interviews or otherwise written media , again due to the legal issues that preceded . As a consequence , the original pressing ( there is at least one bootleg I 'm aware of ) is their most sought - after album , since at the time of its release it went by largely unnoticed . Of course , their later discography is more than considerable , but I shall restrain myself from delving into their later albums since the primal focus of this essay should be the main events that occurred in the early to mid ' 90s . Necromantia are perhaps the most distinct of the three for their infamous idiosyncrasies : complete absence of guitars from their recordings ( its place taken by an 8- string bass guitar ) , abstaining from live appearances , and the relatively low-profile of their members ( Magus Wampyr Doaloth and Baron Blood ) . Their first official release , in which Baudelaire 's \" Les Litanies de Satan \" probably enjoyed its first black metal adaptation , saw the light of day in 1993 . Ritualistic atmospheres , maniacal laughter , evil - boding chants , thick and completely unusual compositions , smothered the two tracks that comprised the demo in an ominous , menacing feeling . Their following two albums , _ Crossing the Fiery Path_ and _ Scarlet Evil , Witching Black_ are yet another two landmarks added to the Hellenic black metal annals which are considerably harsher in their delivery than their scene counterparts . As of late , the ever-present Lethe , who amongst others has taken part in Naer Mataron , Septic Flesh and Horrified , has taken over drum duties . Finally , no such article would be complete without including the Greek ' swamp lords ' . Just by mentioning the monumental _ His Majesty at the Swamp_ is enough for their fans to raise an eyebrow . Varathron seem to have taken the smallest piece from the popularity pie , but that certainly does n't minimize their merit as an outfit which helped define the Hellenic black metal sound . More ' Mediterranean ' in a sense and less of an offshoot from the typical black metal framework of the time , mainly because of their conspicuous heavy metal influences , Varathron built a very solid foundation with their first few releases , which still find themselves untainted by hackneyed plagiarisms . Fronted by one very avid underground aficionado 's unique vocal delivery , Stefan \" Necroabyssious \" , the band made a name for itself in the black metal circles . Varathron 's compositions were overly guitar driven , distinctively boarding with classic heavy metal at times ; primarily characterized by melodic , spine-tingling riffage mostly crawling on mid-tempo rhythms whilst occasionally being bolstered by keyboards and synths which only added to the commanding , epic atmosphere of their albums . Consequently _ His Majesty at the Swamp_ and _ Walpurgisnacht_ are two of the most defining releases in the Hellenic black / heavy sub-genre . Akin to Necromantia 's low-profile status , Varathron are rarely seen on stage , although they have played a number of shows . All three so disparate in terms of musical delivery , but still under the same aesthetic umbrella , the ' unholy triad ' of Hellenic black was nothing less than the musical powerhouse that spawned a number of ambitious outfits thereof . The Greek underground was then teeming with a large number of uprising groups , all carrying , through their own personal touch , that typical sound that made the genre so distinct . Following is a concise listing of some of the most highly regarded bands that sprouted from this extremely fertile scene . Deviser : One of the older groups , they formed in 1989 . Like many a ' true ' Hellenic black metal release , there are keyboards aplenty on each of their albums , and they were actually one of the first bands to incorporate them in their sound . Still going strong with _ Running Sore_ , Deviser make use of violins and female vocals to enhance their music . Magnum opus ? _ Unspeakable Acts_ , without a shred of a doubt . Majestic atmospheres , intricately woven with that unmistakable aura of black metal Greekness , it is truly one of the better releases that the scene had to offer . Agatus : Formed in 1992 by Eskarth ( The Dark One ) and Archon Vorskaath . Although laconic in terms of productivity , their _ Dawn of Martyrdom_ debut album undeniably showcases Hellenic black metal at its finest . More influenced by Varathron 's mid-tempo deluges , there are a lot of heavy metal influences in their slower parts , yet Agatus are a few notches more aggressive . Zemial : Agatus ' brother band , Zemial was formed one year prior to Agatus by the same aforementioned members . Their sole full - length effort _ The Glory of UR_ , which was released in 1999 , is pretty much textbook Hellenic black metal , but nonetheless musically weaker than Agatus . Fiendish Nymph : Shrouded in obscurity , this outfit borrowed heavily from Ancient Greek tradition both lyrically and even musically , making use of instruments supposedly from Greek antiquity . They switched from folk - tinged black to all out folk ritualistic ambient as Daimonia Nymphe , which is the actual Greek translation of their previous moniker . Their _ Sibyl of Elikona_ LP is indeed one interesting piece of black metal , easily identifiable by its entrancing , ritualistic atmosphere . Kawir : Their initial line - up saw the infamous Necroabyssious as their vocalist before Archemoros jumped on the Kawir wagon . They released a split with Sigh back in 1994 ( one of the rarest releases from the Greek underground ) before releasing their debut _ To Cavirs_ . Like Fiendish Nymph , Kawir made extensive use of their antediluvian heritage in their attire , with their debut 's lyrics being entirely in Greek . _ To Cavirs_ was a pleasingly attention - grabbing album , heavily influenced by Rotting Christ 's dark compositions and especially Varathron 's epic feeling of their early albums with some heavy metal overtones and of course the occasional flute and female chanting . Their latest , _ Arai_ , sees them increasing their tempos and decreasing in melody , while switching to Archemoros ' interesting ( minus pleasing ... ) vocal delivery , although not weakening in energy by any means . Vorphalack : Formed by the then Funeral ( now Lord Alatoth and only remaining member ) , Rotting Soul , Than and Alex in the early ' 90s . Released the _ Under the Sight of Dragon_ LP soon after . Although not pertaining to an exactly lucrative career , their contribution is nonetheless considerable . Nergal : Yet another band doomed to wallow in anonymity . Mostly mid-tempo , claustrophobic songs threaded with discordant keyboard passages made their singular _ Wizard of Nerath_ release perhaps one of the aesthetically darkest to come out from the Greek underground . Legion of Doom : Affiliated with the infamous NSBM movement , once again ancestor worship is the order of the day . Although incorporating a more aggressive approach akin to more Northern musical forms , their origin is instantly recognizable in the melodic song structures that abound especially in _ For Those of the Blood_ and _ Kingdom of Endless Darkness_ . Thou Art Lord : Initially comprised of Rotting Christ 's Sakis \" Necromayhem \" , Necromantia 's Magus Wampyr Doaloth , Gothmog and one Lord Daemon on drums , Thou Art Lord can be regarded as an all - star assemblage . Unsurprisingly , their first two releases simply reek of Rotting Christ influenced passages , which in unison with more belligerent , pummeling thrash - isms on the rhythm section still managed to give this unusual outfit its own personal character -- although it was _ Eosforos_ that would prove to be their strongest effort from that era . So what is the status quo of today 's Hellenic black metal ? With both Necromantia and Varathron ( their latest album not being exactly on par with their previous releases ) currently dawdling in a lengthened state of hiatus and Rotting Christ far from their incipient musical outburst , it seems that the archetypal Hellenic sound of the early ' 90s has finally succumbed to temporal pressures . Nonetheless , the evolutionary continuation persists ; the scene itself has all but silenced , with bands such as Nocternity , Ravencult , Darkthule , Macabre Omen , Enshadowed , Order of the Ebon Hand and Naer Mataron , which although vaguely reminiscent of their predecessors , are still proving that the Greek scene is as active as ever . For the rest of us , the legacy of those early bands remains in their records ; staying far from lurid pretentiousness , which the embellished Norwegian scene so fervently indulged in at the time , they managed to give black metal a fresh outlook , which perhaps was not altogether genre-defining ( or generally influential for that matter ) but certainly interesting and innovative .","annotations":[{"text":"Euronymous","span":[163,172],"token_span":[30,30],"role":"Signatory","label":"Signatory","role_definition":"The signatory of the Agreement."},{"text":"European","span":[402,409],"token_span":[71,71],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The place where the signing occurs."},{"text":"A year later","span":[2901,2912],"token_span":[519,521],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time at which signature is given."},{"text":"album , was released through Unisound Records","span":[3022,3066],"token_span":[546,552],"role":"Agreement","label":"Agreement","role_definition":"The document which encodes the commitment of the Signatory."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"During this concert , some audience members had engaged in cutting and self-mutilation that resulted in hospitalization .

A year later , the might I say o-r- g - a-s - m - i-c _ Non Serviam_ , and also unfortunately their most poorly promoted album , was released through Unisound Records . Following some legal issues with the label , the album would never enjoy the promotion that it rightfully deserved . Strangely , it seems that the band does n't really mention it in interviews or otherwise written media , again due to the legal issues that preceded . As a consequence , the original pressing ( there is at least one bootleg I 'm aware of ) is their most sought - after album , since at the time of its release it went by largely unnoticed . Of course , their later discography is more than considerable , but I shall restrain myself from delving into their later albums since the primal focus of this essay should be the main events that occurred in the early to mid ' 90s . Necromantia are perhaps the most distinct of the three for their infamous idiosyncrasies : complete absence of guitars from their recordings ( its place taken by an 8- string bass guitar ) , abstaining from live appearances , and the relatively low-profile of their members ( Magus Wampyr Doaloth and Baron Blood ) . Their first official release , in which Baudelaire 's \" Les Litanies de Satan \" probably enjoyed its first black metal adaptation , saw the light of day in 1993 . Ritualistic atmospheres , maniacal laughter , evil - boding chants , thick and completely unusual compositions , smothered the two tracks that comprised the demo in an ominous , menacing feeling . Their following two albums , _ Crossing the Fiery Path_ and _ Scarlet Evil , Witching Black_ are yet another two landmarks added to the Hellenic black metal annals which are considerably harsher in their delivery than their scene counterparts . As of late , the ever-present Lethe , who amongst others has taken part in Naer Mataron , Septic Flesh and Horrified , has taken over drum duties . Finally , no such article would be complete without including the Greek ' swamp lords ' . Just by mentioning the monumental _ His Majesty at the Swamp_ is enough for their fans to raise an eyebrow . Varathron seem to have taken the smallest piece from the popularity pie , but that certainly does n't minimize their merit as an outfit which helped define the Hellenic black metal sound . More ' Mediterranean ' in a sense and less of an offshoot from the typical black metal framework of the time , mainly because of their conspicuous heavy metal influences , Varathron built a very solid foundation with their first few releases , which still find themselves untainted by hackneyed plagiarisms . Fronted by one very avid underground aficionado 's unique vocal delivery , Stefan \" Necroabyssious \" , the band made a name for itself in the black metal circles . Varathron 's compositions were overly guitar driven , distinctively boarding with classic heavy metal at times ; primarily characterized by melodic , spine-tingling riffage mostly crawling on mid-tempo rhythms whilst occasionally being bolstered by keyboards and synths which only added to the commanding , epic atmosphere of their albums . Consequently _ His Majesty at the Swamp_ and _ Walpurgisnacht_ are two of the most defining releases in the Hellenic black / heavy sub-genre . Akin to Necromantia 's low-profile status , Varathron are rarely seen on stage , although they have played a number of shows . All three so disparate in terms of musical delivery , but still under the same aesthetic umbrella , the ' unholy triad ' of Hellenic black was nothing less than the musical powerhouse that spawned a number of ambitious outfits thereof . The Greek underground was then teeming with a large number of uprising groups , all carrying , through their own personal touch , that typical sound that made the genre so distinct . Following is a concise listing of some of the most highly regarded bands that sprouted from this extremely fertile scene . Deviser : One of the older groups , they formed in 1989 . Like many a ' true ' Hellenic black metal release , there are keyboards aplenty on each of their albums , and they were actually one of the first bands to incorporate them in their sound . Still going strong with _ Running Sore_ , Deviser make use of violins and female vocals to enhance their music . Magnum opus ? _ Unspeakable Acts_ , without a shred of a doubt . Majestic atmospheres , intricately woven with that unmistakable aura of black metal Greekness , it is truly one of the better releases that the scene had to offer . Agatus : Formed in 1992 by Eskarth ( The Dark One ) and Archon Vorskaath . Although laconic in terms of productivity , their _ Dawn of Martyrdom_ debut album undeniably showcases Hellenic black metal at its finest . More influenced by Varathron 's mid-tempo deluges , there are a lot of heavy metal influences in their slower parts , yet Agatus are a few notches more aggressive . Zemial : Agatus ' brother band , Zemial was formed one year prior to Agatus by the same aforementioned members . Their sole full - length effort _ The Glory of UR_ , which was released in 1999 , is pretty much textbook Hellenic black metal , but nonetheless musically weaker than Agatus . Fiendish Nymph : Shrouded in obscurity , this outfit borrowed heavily from Ancient Greek tradition both lyrically and even musically , making use of instruments supposedly from Greek antiquity . They switched from folk - tinged black to all out folk ritualistic ambient as Daimonia Nymphe , which is the actual Greek translation of their previous moniker . Their _ Sibyl of Elikona_ LP is indeed one interesting piece of black metal , easily identifiable by its entrancing , ritualistic atmosphere . Kawir : Their initial line - up saw the infamous Necroabyssious as their vocalist before Archemoros jumped on the Kawir wagon . They released a split with Sigh back in 1994 ( one of the rarest releases from the Greek underground ) before releasing their debut _ To Cavirs_ . Like Fiendish Nymph , Kawir made extensive use of their antediluvian heritage in their attire , with their debut 's lyrics being entirely in Greek . _ To Cavirs_ was a pleasingly attention - grabbing album , heavily influenced by Rotting Christ 's dark compositions and especially Varathron 's epic feeling of their early albums with some heavy metal overtones and of course the occasional flute and female chanting . Their latest , _ Arai_ , sees them increasing their tempos and decreasing in melody , while switching to Archemoros ' interesting ( minus pleasing ... ) vocal delivery , although not weakening in energy by any means . Vorphalack : Formed by the then Funeral ( now Lord Alatoth and only remaining member ) , Rotting Soul , Than and Alex in the early ' 90s . Released the _ Under the Sight of Dragon_ LP soon after . Although not pertaining to an exactly lucrative career , their contribution is nonetheless considerable . Nergal : Yet another band doomed to wallow in anonymity . Mostly mid-tempo , claustrophobic songs threaded with discordant keyboard passages made their singular _ Wizard of Nerath_ release perhaps one of the aesthetically darkest to come out from the Greek underground . Legion of Doom : Affiliated with the infamous NSBM movement , once again ancestor worship is the order of the day . Although incorporating a more aggressive approach akin to more Northern musical forms , their origin is instantly recognizable in the melodic song structures that abound especially in _ For Those of the Blood_ and _ Kingdom of Endless Darkness_ . Thou Art Lord : Initially comprised of Rotting Christ 's Sakis \" Necromayhem \" , Necromantia 's Magus Wampyr Doaloth , Gothmog and one Lord Daemon on drums , Thou Art Lord can be regarded as an all - star assemblage . Unsurprisingly , their first two releases simply reek of Rotting Christ influenced passages , which in unison with more belligerent , pummeling thrash - isms on the rhythm section still managed to give this unusual outfit its own personal character -- although it was _ Eosforos_ that would prove to be their strongest effort from that era . So what is the status quo of today 's Hellenic black metal ? With both Necromantia and Varathron ( their latest album not being exactly on par with their previous releases ) currently dawdling in a lengthened state of hiatus and Rotting Christ far from their incipient musical outburst , it seems that the archetypal Hellenic sound of the early ' 90s has finally succumbed to temporal pressures . Nonetheless , the evolutionary continuation persists ; the scene itself has all but silenced , with bands such as Nocternity , Ravencult , Darkthule , Macabre Omen , Enshadowed , Order of the Ebon Hand and Naer Mataron , which although vaguely reminiscent of their predecessors , are still proving that the Greek scene is as active as ever . For the rest of us , the legacy of those early bands remains in their records ; staying far from lurid pretentiousness , which the embellished Norwegian scene so fervently indulged in at the time , they managed to give black metal a fresh outlook , which perhaps was not altogether genre-defining ( or generally influential for that matter ) but certainly interesting and innovative .","annotations":[{"text":"Euronymous","span":[163,172],"token_span":[30,30],"role":"Signatory","label":"Signatory","role_definition":"The signatory of the Agreement."},{"text":"album , was released through Unisound Records","span":[3022,3066],"token_span":[546,552],"role":"Agreement","label":"Agreement","role_definition":"The document which encodes the commitment of the Signatory."},{"text":"A year later","span":[2901,2912],"token_span":[519,521],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time at which signature is given."},{"text":"European","span":[402,409],"token_span":[71,71],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The place where the signing occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-2781-305-frame-Sign_agreement","frame":"Sign_agreement","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Signatory signs an Agreement document, thereby taking on a commitment encoded in the Agreement.","frame_ancestors":["Text_creation","Intentionally_create","Creating","Transitive_action","Objective_influence","Event","Intentionally_act"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"After making a rather average start to the 2009\u201310 season , the Reds made their final signing in promising young Bulleen Lions winger , Mathew Leckie prior to the Round 5 clash against Wellington Phoenix .","annotations":[{"text":"2009\u201310 season","span":[43,56],"token_span":[8,9],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time at which signature is given."},{"text":"the Reds","span":[60,67],"token_span":[11,12],"role":"Signatory","label":"Signatory","role_definition":"The signatory of the Agreement."},{"text":"promising young Bulleen Lions winger , Mathew Leckie","span":[97,148],"token_span":[18,25],"role":"Signatory","label":"Signatory","role_definition":"The signatory of the Agreement."}],"trigger":{"text":"signing","start_char":86,"end_char":92,"start_token":16,"end_token":16,"frame":"Sign_agreement"}},"source":{"text":"Adelaide United FC has finalised its squad for the Hyundai A-League 2009/10 Season after signing 18 year old midfielder Mathew Leckie .

The good news : Terry Duckworth 's buggered off . The bad news : it was with all the money son Tommy borrowed so that Terry could pay off Rick , the Pablo Escobar of the north west who had also driven the father of Tommy 's girlfriend Tina to suicide . Still with me ? There 's worse : Rick still holds Tommy liable for the debt and to clear it , he must drive a bagful of drugs to Amsterdam . Tina , as is Tina 's way , is having none of it . In the middle of helping Rita prepare for her wedding to Dennis Tanner , bridesmaid Tina grabs the drugs and dashes for the canal . Rick arrives , only to be told that the bag will be chucked into the canal unless he leaves Tommy alone . At this point Rick produces hostage Rita \u2013 resplendent in bridal pink chiffon but in dire need of a canalside cardie \u2013 from his car and threatens to do likewise . He probably expected Rita to quail . He does not know Rita . She has survived three husbands , innumerable other ne'er-do - wells \u2013 one of whom she watched being bisected by a Blackpool tram \u2013 a career as a cabaret singer , and over a decade 's close confinement in the Kabin with Norris Cole . Quailing she does not do . \" GERROFF ME FROCK ! \" snarls Rita before urging Tina to throw the drugs into the water . \" He has n't got the guts ! \" she assures her trembling bridesmaid . But Tina makes the trade . As Rick makes off with the drugs , the police she secretly called earlier arrive . \" GERRIM ! \" shouts Rita . They do . In other news , Sunita and Karl have started Doing It . Only a woman married to Dev Alahan could see Karl , eight parts dickhead to two parts gambling addict , as a seductive prospect . But alas , Sunita is that woman and so we must endure his throaty endearments and Sunita lovingly decanting her savings into his pockets for a while yet . If only poker losses could be paid in phlegm , how many of life 's problems could be solved . Since leaving David , Kylie has been dancing at the local strip club . This despite the fact that one look from madam could shrivel a man 's genitals at 50 paces .

When Rachel McGee was offered a cheap flight to the Caribbean island of Cuba she jumped at the chance . Two years later , the 24- year - old Londoner weighed just six stones and had worms . She had been convicted of smuggling drugs and sentenced to 15 years in a Cuban jail . She had no drugs on her when she was arrested and her trial was conducted solely in Spanish . After a campaign by supporters she was released in September 2000 as a \" goodwill gesture \" , the Cuban authorities said . But the months in appalling conditions in Occidente women 's prison had taken their toll and she emerged with a kidney infection , stomach problems and bleeding gums . The health-shattering conditions in Thai jails were described by 21 - year - old Judith Payne .

These kingpins are known mostly from grainy old photos and ballads about their \u00e2heroic\u00e2 exploits . But they are alleged to have made billions of dollars from moving cocaine , heroin , marijuana and crystal meth to the United States , and they have armies of hitmen under their commands . Four key kingpins stand out for their power and notoriety . Read more about increased drug use in Mexico . Joaquin Guzman ( Joaquin \" Shorty \" Guzman is seen in Almoloya , Mexico 's high security jail in this June 10 , 2000 photo . Reuters ) Alias : El Chapo ( Shorty ) Cartel : Sinaloa Born : La Tuna , Sinaloa , 1957 Rewards : $ 5 million ( FBI ) , $ 2 million ( Mexican PGR ) Bio : Hunted from city mansions to mountain caves but always disappearing in a puff of smoke , the 5 - foot - 6 - inch king of kingpins is indisputably the most high - profile drug trafficker in Mexico today . Growing up in a ramshackle village in the wild Sierra Madre mountains , Guzman is said to have apprenticed in the drug world under the legendary smuggler Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo , alias \u00e2 The Godfather . \u00e2 Following Felix\u00e2s 1989 imprisonment for ordering the murder of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent , Guzman emerged as one of the top trafficking powers , waging a bloody war against the Tijuana Cartel for control of smuggling routes into California and Arizona . In 1993 , Tijuana Cartel gunmen shot dead Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo in Guadalajara airport . Prosecutors then said the killers had been after Guzman but got the wrong man . Later that year , Guzman was arrested in Guatemala and extradited to Mexico , where he was incarcerated in a so-called maximum security prison . But in 2001 , he escaped by driving out in a laundry truck . He is accused of using intricate smuggling tunnels to move his drugs , such as one discovered leading into Douglas , Ariz . He also is alleged to be behind one 7 - ton shipment of cocaine hidden in cans of chili peppers . In cities and towns across the country , he is reported to turn up at restaurants with his entourage and pay for everyone\u00e2s meals . But dozens of raids and special operations to net him have always come up short . He reportedly married his third wife , a village beauty queen , on her 18th birthday in 2007 . In May 2008 , gunmen killed his son , university student Edgar Guzman , in a murder that is said to have sparked a violent war with the Beltran Leyva Organization . In 2009 , Forbes included Guzman on its billionaire list with a net worth of $ 1 billion , a feature that was widely criticized in Mexico . \u00c2 Ismael Zambada Aliases : The Mayo Indian , El Rey ( The King ) , The MZ Cartel : Sinaloa Born : Sinaloa , 1948 Rewards : $ 5 million ( FBI ) , $ 2 million ( Mexican PGR ) Bio : Zambada stars less in the media than his ally Chapo but many on the streets of Sinaloa consider him to be the most powerful trafficker in Mexico . Born to a ranching family , he is said to be a keen agriculturalist with good knowledge of plants and animals . However , he reportedly worked in his youth as a furniture removal man in the Sinaloan state capital Culiacan before stepping into the drug business in the 1970s . Zambada reportedly moved drugs for many years through the border city of Ciudad Juarez , working closely with Amado Carrillo Fuentes , who was known as the Lord of the Skies because of his fleet of 727 jet airliners used to smuggle cocaine . But after Carrillo\u00e2s 1997 death while having plastic surgery to change his appearance , Zambada is alleged to have set up his own operation moving drugs into Arizona . In 2003 , the so-called Operation Trifecta by U.S. agents netted 240 people allegedly working for Zambada . The U.S. then indicted him for importing 3 tons of cocaine . Anthony Coulson , the DEA agent in charge of the sting , said , \u00e2 Zambada is an extremely dangerous criminal whose narcotic trafficking activities are legendary . For more than three decades , he has skillfully aligned with almost every known drug trafficking organization in Mexico . \u00e2 Zambada is said to have had plastic surgery several times to successfully avoid arrest . In March 2009 , police arrested his son Vicente Zambada in a plush Mexico City mansion . ( Suspected Mexican drug trafficker Vicente Zambada , son of Ismael Zambada , is presented to the media in Mexico City , March 19 , 2009 .

Do n't go hungry any longer . \" The photo was taken in the border city of Nuevo Laredo , April 14 , 2008 . Stringer / Reuters ) Aliases : The Executioner , El Lazca , Z-3 Cartel : Los Zetas ( Cartel del Golfo ) Born : Veracruz , circa 1976 Reward : $ 2 million ( Mexican PGR ) Bio : Little is known about Lazcano himself , but his bloody band of enforcers \u00e2 Los Zetas \u00c2 \u00e2 are feared across Mexico as one of the most violent groups in the whole drug war . Born near the Gulf of Mexico , Lazcano enlisted in the military as a young man and was selected to join the prestigious and highly trained Airborne Special Forces Group . The unit was sent north to battle drug gangs trafficking over the border into Texas . But Lazcano and 30 other special force soldiers went for the gold , and defected to work with the Gulf Cartel . The new drug army was christened the Zetas after the radio signal the special forces had used . Lazcano was Z-3 , or the third in command . However , when the two commanders above him were killed and captured , he took the reins of the merciless paramilitary force . Under Lazcano , the Zetas recruited and trained large numbers of other traffickers , turning the Zetas into a fearsome force that stretched its tentacles throughout the east and south of Mexico . Lazcano is said to be protected by a cadre of extremely loyal bodyguards . He reportedly keeps constantly on the move to avoid arrest . \u00c2 Arturo Beltran Leyva Alias : El Barbas ( The Beard ) Cartel : Beltran Leyva Organization Born : Sinaloa , circa 1960 Reward : $ 2 million ( Mexican PGR ) Bio : Another son of Sinaloa , Beltran Leyva shot to fame in 2008 for allegedly bribing and killing top officials and running fierce groups of paramilitary gunmen . Growing up in the Sinaloan countryside , Beltran Leyva is reported to have worked closely with \u00e2 Chapo\u00e2 Guzman during decades of smuggling . In 2004 and 2005 , he allegedly led powerful groups of assassins , including members of the notorious Mara Salvatrucha street gang , to fight for trade routes in northeastern Mexico . In January 2008 , Beltran Leyva\u00e2s brother Alfredo \u00e2 The Giant Ant\u00e2 Beltran Leyva was arrested in the Sinaloan state capital Culiacan . In apparent revenge for the detention , he sent gangs of assassins to go after top federal officials in the Mexican capital . One group of these hitmen was captured in a Mexico City house with dozens of automatic rifles , pistols , M4 grenade launchers , 30 grenades , and bullet - proof jackets bearing the legend FEDA \u00e2 the Spanish acronym for Special Forces of Arturo . In May 2008 , an assassin allegedly paid by Beltran Leyva killed acting federal police chief Edgar Millan inside his own home in Mexico City . Later in 2008 , several high - ranking federal officials were accused of taking bribes from Beltran Leyva of up to $ 450,000 per month . Beltran Leyva is believed to have broken with his old ally Guzman in 2008 and fought a violent turf war against him that led to hundreds of deaths on the streets of Sinaloa . In January 2009 , there were reports the two sides agreed to a truce . ( Soldiers escort drug kingpin Hector Huerta Rios of the Beltran Leyva Organization , March 24 , 2009 .

These kingpins are known mostly from grainy old photos and ballads about their \u00e2heroic\u00e2 exploits . But they are alleged to have made billions of dollars from moving cocaine , heroin , marijuana and crystal meth to the United States , and they have armies of hitmen under their commands . Four key kingpins stand out for their power and notoriety . Read more about increased drug use in Mexico . Joaquin Guzman ( Joaquin \" Shorty \" Guzman is seen in Almoloya , Mexico 's high security jail in this June 10 , 2000 photo . Reuters ) Alias : El Chapo ( Shorty ) Cartel : Sinaloa Born : La Tuna , Sinaloa , 1957 Rewards : $ 5 million ( FBI ) , $ 2 million ( Mexican PGR ) Bio : Hunted from city mansions to mountain caves but always disappearing in a puff of smoke , the 5 - foot - 6 - inch king of kingpins is indisputably the most high - profile drug trafficker in Mexico today . Growing up in a ramshackle village in the wild Sierra Madre mountains , Guzman is said to have apprenticed in the drug world under the legendary smuggler Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo , alias \u00e2 The Godfather . \u00e2 Following Felix\u00e2s 1989 imprisonment for ordering the murder of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent , Guzman emerged as one of the top trafficking powers , waging a bloody war against the Tijuana Cartel for control of smuggling routes into California and Arizona . In 1993 , Tijuana Cartel gunmen shot dead Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo in Guadalajara airport . Prosecutors then said the killers had been after Guzman but got the wrong man . Later that year , Guzman was arrested in Guatemala and extradited to Mexico , where he was incarcerated in a so-called maximum security prison . But in 2001 , he escaped by driving out in a laundry truck . He is accused of using intricate smuggling tunnels to move his drugs , such as one discovered leading into Douglas , Ariz . He also is alleged to be behind one 7 - ton shipment of cocaine hidden in cans of chili peppers . In cities and towns across the country , he is reported to turn up at restaurants with his entourage and pay for everyone\u00e2s meals . But dozens of raids and special operations to net him have always come up short . He reportedly married his third wife , a village beauty queen , on her 18th birthday in 2007 . In May 2008 , gunmen killed his son , university student Edgar Guzman , in a murder that is said to have sparked a violent war with the Beltran Leyva Organization . In 2009 , Forbes included Guzman on its billionaire list with a net worth of $ 1 billion , a feature that was widely criticized in Mexico . \u00c2 Ismael Zambada Aliases : The Mayo Indian , El Rey ( The King ) , The MZ Cartel : Sinaloa Born : Sinaloa , 1948 Rewards : $ 5 million ( FBI ) , $ 2 million ( Mexican PGR ) Bio : Zambada stars less in the media than his ally Chapo but many on the streets of Sinaloa consider him to be the most powerful trafficker in Mexico . Born to a ranching family , he is said to be a keen agriculturalist with good knowledge of plants and animals . However , he reportedly worked in his youth as a furniture removal man in the Sinaloan state capital Culiacan before stepping into the drug business in the 1970s . Zambada reportedly moved drugs for many years through the border city of Ciudad Juarez , working closely with Amado Carrillo Fuentes , who was known as the Lord of the Skies because of his fleet of 727 jet airliners used to smuggle cocaine . But after Carrillo\u00e2s 1997 death while having plastic surgery to change his appearance , Zambada is alleged to have set up his own operation moving drugs into Arizona . In 2003 , the so-called Operation Trifecta by U.S. agents netted 240 people allegedly working for Zambada . The U.S. then indicted him for importing 3 tons of cocaine . Anthony Coulson , the DEA agent in charge of the sting , said , \u00e2 Zambada is an extremely dangerous criminal whose narcotic trafficking activities are legendary . For more than three decades , he has skillfully aligned with almost every known drug trafficking organization in Mexico . \u00e2 Zambada is said to have had plastic surgery several times to successfully avoid arrest . In March 2009 , police arrested his son Vicente Zambada in a plush Mexico City mansion .

Do n't go hungry any longer . \" The photo was taken in the border city of Nuevo Laredo , April 14 , 2008 . Stringer / Reuters ) Aliases : The Executioner , El Lazca , Z-3 Cartel : Los Zetas ( Cartel del Golfo ) Born : Veracruz , circa 1976 Reward : $ 2 million ( Mexican PGR ) Bio : Little is known about Lazcano himself , but his bloody band of enforcers \u00e2 Los Zetas \u00c2 \u00e2 are feared across Mexico as one of the most violent groups in the whole drug war . Born near the Gulf of Mexico , Lazcano enlisted in the military as a young man and was selected to join the prestigious and highly trained Airborne Special Forces Group . The unit was sent north to battle drug gangs trafficking over the border into Texas . But Lazcano and 30 other special force soldiers went for the gold , and defected to work with the Gulf Cartel . The new drug army was christened the Zetas after the radio signal the special forces had used . Lazcano was Z-3 , or the third in command . However , when the two commanders above him were killed and captured , he took the reins of the merciless paramilitary force . Under Lazcano , the Zetas recruited and trained large numbers of other traffickers , turning the Zetas into a fearsome force that stretched its tentacles throughout the east and south of Mexico . Lazcano is said to be protected by a cadre of extremely loyal bodyguards . He reportedly keeps constantly on the move to avoid arrest . \u00c2 Arturo Beltran Leyva Alias : El Barbas ( The Beard ) Cartel : Beltran Leyva Organization Born : Sinaloa , circa 1960 Reward : $ 2 million ( Mexican PGR ) Bio : Another son of Sinaloa , Beltran Leyva shot to fame in 2008 for allegedly bribing and killing top officials and running fierce groups of paramilitary gunmen . Growing up in the Sinaloan countryside , Beltran Leyva is reported to have worked closely with \u00e2 Chapo\u00e2 Guzman during decades of smuggling . In 2004 and 2005 , he allegedly led powerful groups of assassins , including members of the notorious Mara Salvatrucha street gang , to fight for trade routes in northeastern Mexico . In January 2008 , Beltran Leyva\u00e2s brother Alfredo \u00e2 The Giant Ant\u00e2 Beltran Leyva was arrested in the Sinaloan state capital Culiacan . In apparent revenge for the detention , he sent gangs of assassins to go after top federal officials in the Mexican capital . One group of these hitmen was captured in a Mexico City house with dozens of automatic rifles , pistols , M4 grenade launchers , 30 grenades , and bullet - proof jackets bearing the legend FEDA \u00e2 the Spanish acronym for Special Forces of Arturo . In May 2008 , an assassin allegedly paid by Beltran Leyva killed acting federal police chief Edgar Millan inside his own home in Mexico City . Later in 2008 , several high - ranking federal officials were accused of taking bribes from Beltran Leyva of up to $ 450,000 per month . Beltran Leyva is believed to have broken with his old ally Guzman in 2008 and fought a violent turf war against him that led to hundreds of deaths on the streets of Sinaloa . In January 2009 , there were reports the two sides agreed to a truce . ( Soldiers escort drug kingpin Hector Huerta Rios of the Beltran Leyva Organization , March 24 , 2009 .

Throughout my service in my unit I did and encountered things that seemed irrelevant from a security standpoint , and I did not have a clear conscience participating in such activities . Contrary to my expectations , our database included not only security - related intelligence but also personal and political information . That is to say , on a personal level , there is no respect for Palestinian privacy . From a political standpoint , information is collected that can serve to manipulate Israeli , Palestinian and international politics . Although ours is not actual field work , it has serious impact on the lives of many people , and this is something that I think soldiers in the unit forget when everyone just does their part . Since we 're so focused on not missing any important developments , we always prefer to assume the worst . For example , if anyone is suspected , even very faintly , it is possible that the stain will never fade , and that person will suffer sanctions as a result . Our daily service dulls everyone 's sensitivity and this is reflected , for example , in running jokes about very personal things that come up in our intelligence material . Or , for instance , in the expression \u201c blood on the headset \u201d , or X 's marked on our headsets after assassinations . ' I realised the job I had done was that of the oppressor ' After my discharge from the Intelligence Corps , I had a moment of shock while watching the film The Lives of Others , about the secret police in East Germany . On the one hand , I felt solidarity with the victims , with the oppressed people who were denied such basic rights as I take for granted to be mine . On the other hand , I realised that the job I had done during my military service was that of the oppressor . My first reaction as a discharged soldier was that we do the same things , only much more efficiently . ' The attitude was \u201c Why not ? We can , so let 's do it . \u201d ' I knew people in the unit and I heard good things about it , but I did n't do anything special to enlist in this particular unit . I knew it was a good job with high - quality people , bearing a lot of responsibility , and it sounded good . From the first day of the course one is made to feel really important , and that you 're going to be exposed to interesting classified things , and to have a lot of responsibility . I assumed a role in which people are called \u201c targets \u201d , and those people who really interest us are in no sense terrorists , but rather generally normative people \u2013 who interest us because of their roles , so that we can obtain more intelligence and achieve greater access . We take advantage of the capabilities that we have over these people in order to put ourselves at ease . We take advantage of the impact that we have on their lives . Sometimes it involves truly harming a person 's life , or their soul . I mean extortion whereby they must hide things from people around them . It can really screw up their lives . It made me feel omnipotent . When I began this job I was surprised by the extent of my responsibility . I felt I had a say about important things . I could initiate things that would impact the lives of Palestinians \u2013 I could urge my unit to take all kinds of measures . The attitude was \u201c Why not ? We can , so let 's do it . \u201d I thought that what I was able to do was crazy . We were the bosses . They really relied on our judgment calls . I had access to many systems and capabilities , and I felt it was too much . No boundaries were set for us , for both passive activities such as gathering intelligence , and for active initiatives that had an impact on people 's lives . If anyone interests us , we 'd collect information on his or her economic situation and mental state . Then we would plan how we can perform an operation around this individual , in order to turn them into a collaborator or something of the sort . But I was uncomfortable with this , so I chose to disconnect from it . To clock in my hours , and check out . There are always two unit representatives in the field , one at the West Bank division HQ and one in Gaza . We would take turns , and what I recall most about this are the assassination missions . We would collect intelligence for the operation , incriminate the person , and pass on the information to the Israeli Air Force . Once when I was the unit representative , there was someone suspicious next to a weapons warehouse in Gaza and we thought he was our target . It had taken us a long time to find him . Judging by his location , the time and similar data , we concluded it was him . After we assassinated him it turned out that he was a kid . My job there was supposedly technical . The atmosphere was that of an office job . In real time you can see maps and images from the helicopter , but you 're sitting in an office so it 's very easy to feel detached and distance yourself . Nor was it my job to ask questions . I was told what was needed and that 's what I did . I remember an image on the screen of him in an orchard , and the explosion on the screen , the smoke clearing and his mother running to him , at which point we could see he was a child . The body was small . We realised we had screwed up . It got quiet and uncomfortable . Then we needed to carry on as there were other things to do , though the mood was grim . I do n't know of any investigation of what had happened , or if it was reviewed at a later date . ' We knew the medical conditions of our targets ' When I enlisted into the intelligence unit , I thought I would deal with prevention of terrorism and do whatever was necessary to protect national security . Throughout my service , I discovered that many Israeli initiatives within the Palestinian arena are directed at things that are not related to intelligence . I worked a lot on gathering information on political issues . Some could be seen as related to objectives that serve security needs , such as the suppression of Hamas institutions , while others could not . Some were political objectives that did not even fall within the Israeli consensus , such as strengthening Israel 's stance at the expense of the Palestinian position . Such objectives do not serve the security system but rather agendas of certain politicians . I had a really hard time with some of the things we did , as did the people who were with me in my section . Regarding one project in particular , many of us were shocked as we were exposed to it . Clearly it was not something we as soldiers were supposed to do . The information was almost directly transferred to political players and not to other sections of the security system . This made it clear to me that we were dealing with information that was hardly connected to security needs . We knew the detailed medical conditions of some of our targets , and our goals developed around them . I 'm not sure what was done with this information . I felt bad knowing each of their precise problems , and that we would talk and laugh about this information freely . Or , for instance , that we knew exactly who was cheating on their wife , with whom , and how often . ' I collected information on people who were completely innocent ' As a soldier in Unit 8200 , I collected information on people accused of either attacking Israelis , trying to attack Israelis , desiring to harm Israelis , and considering attacking Israelis . I also collected information on people who were completely innocent , and whose only crime was that they interested the Israeli security system for various reasons . For reasons they had absolutely no way of knowing . All Palestinians are exposed to non-stop monitoring without any legal protection . Junior soldiers can decide when someone is a target for the collection of information . There is no procedure in place to determine whether the violation of the individual 's rights is necessarily justifiable . The notion of rights for Palestinians does not exist at all . Not even as an idea to be disregarded . Any Palestinian may be targeted and may suffer from sanctions such as the denial of permits , harassment , extortion , or even direct physical injury . Such instances might occur if the individual is of any interest to the system for any reason . Be it indirect relations with hostile individuals , physical proximity to intelligence targets , or connections to topics that interest 8200 as a technological unit . Any information that might enable extortion of an individual is considered relevant information . Whether said individual is of a certain sexual orientation , cheating on his wife , or in need of treatment in Israel or the West Bank \u2013 he is a target for blackmail . Throughout the duration of my service no one in my unit ever asked , at least not out loud , if there is anything wrong with this well - oiled system \u2013 whether the transformation of any individual into a target is a legitimate act . When I joined Unit 8200 I was highly motivated . I passed a course and became an Arabic translator . There were things that I felt uncomfortable with in the work framework , though the importance of my role and our missions within the unit in which I served overshadowed these feelings . One of those moments in which things began to change occurred during the first war in Gaza , Operation Cast Lead . I was then at the peak of my service , as an experienced translator in a base which was responsible for the Palestinian arena . Upon the start of the operation something seemed wrong to me . Instead of attacking rocket and weapons caches in the Gaza Strip , as a preparatory defence measure for the campaign against Hamas , the Israeli Air Force attacked a parade of police officers . The assault killed 89 policemen . I was a simple soldier , but I wanted to pass my opinion up the chain of command that this action was morally unsound and problematic . Not only as regards the attack on the police officers . Those were precious hours in which we should have been doing our jobs preventing the launching of rockets against Israeli civilians , and this did not serve that purpose . The home front was exposed to volleys of rockets without taking care of them in advance , as should have been done , and as we were told that should happen . The officer in charge agreed to pass on my remarks , but I never received an answer . Throughout the operation I accompanied different teams engaged in collecting and translating intelligence on targets in the Gaza Strip \u2013 on both weapons and humans . I remember the overwhelming silence in the rooms from which we worked , seconds after the air force bombed those targets . A tense silence , hopeful of causing harm . When an attack was identified or executed , cheering and applause filled the room . X 's were marked on headsets . X 's were marked on the facial composite sketches that adorned the walls of the rooms . No one asked about \u201c collateral damage \u201d . I felt bad \u2013 it was very difficult to realise that no one was interested in who else had been hit . Throughout the campaign , hundreds of civilians were killed \u2013 men , women , and children , collateral damage . No one stopped to ask whether the targets we collect for the air force justify the destruction of the lives of about one and a half million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip . On 1 January , the air force attacked the home of Nizar Rayan , a Hamas leader in Gaza . Eighteen civilians were killed in the assault on his home , most of whom were members of his family . The following day senior leaders of Hamas ' military wing were targeted . When the air force reported the people harmed , tension filled the room in anticipation of finding out whether the people injured were the targeted objectives of the attack . When it became clear that they were other unrelated persons , cries of disappointment were heard . Not because people had been killed arbitrarily , but because they were n't the people we were looking for . It 's hard for me to imagine what my base would have looked like during the recent Operation Protective Edge . Probably just as it had in the past , only much more pronounced . That was the peak of my service within the Israeli army . The period during which I collected information on people who were accused of attacking Israelis , trying to attack Israelis , the desire to harm Israelis , thinking of attacking Israelis , in addition to collecting information on completely innocent people , whose only crime was that they interested the Israeli defence establishment for various reasons . Reasons they have no way of knowing . If you 're homosexual and know someone who knows a wanted person \u2013 and we need to know about it \u2013 Israel will make your life miserable . If you need emergency medical treatment in Israel , the West Bank or abroad \u2013 we searched for you . The state of Israel will allow you to die before we let you leave for treatment without giving information on your wanted cousin . If you interest Unit 8200 as a technological unit , and do n't have anything to do with any hostile activity , you 're an objective . Any such case , in which you \u201c fish out \u201d an innocent person from whom information might be squeezed , or who could be recruited as a collaborator , was like striking gold for us and for Israel 's entire intelligence community . As such , Palestinians who are not related to or involved in fighting Israel are objectives . Thus , in terms of intelligence ( aside from the physical blockade of the Gaza Strip ) , Gazan citizens are no different from their brethren in the West Bank \u2013 despite the \u201c disengagement \u201d , so to speak . During my training course in preparation for my service in this assigned role , we actually learned to memorise and filter different words for \u201c gay \u201d , in Arabic . Any Palestinian is exposed to non-stop monitoring by the Israeli Big Brother , without legal protection , and with no way of knowing when they too would become an objective \u2013 targeted for harassment , extortion , or physical injury . Junior soldiers can decide anyone is a target for the collection of information . There is no procedure in place to determine whether the violation of the individual 's rights is necessarily justifiable . The notion of rights for Palestinians does not exist at all . Throughout the duration of my service no one in my unit ever asked , at least not out loud , if there is anything wrong with this well - oiled system \u2013 whether the transformation of any individual into a target is a legitimate act . At the conclusion of my service in the army I was a commander and instructor for several months , teaching youth who had graduated from high school and were being prepared to serve as translators for the Intelligence Corps . I repeatedly tried to raise these questions with them : is it legitimate to deem as a target any person who interests the Israeli security system , for whatever reason ? The answer I received , time and again , was yes . Today I believe the answer is no . ' The fact people were innocent was not at all relevant ' I was a course instructor for soldiers assigned to the Palestinian arena . As the course was being organised we would go to some storeroom full of \u201c booty \u201d and receive uniforms , weapon parts , exploded grenades , flags of Palestine , Fatah and Hamas . Personal family items like photos of children , watches , family photos , medals , football trophies , books , Qur'ans , jewellery \u2013 Palestinian \u201c memorabilia \u201d . I do n't know for sure , but I realised that all these things came from arrest missions , either from people 's homes or from people who were killed . It is all just piled up . We were taken to this storeroom and told to take whatever we pleased , signing the stuff out afterwards . I took some flags and uniforms . At the end of the course we did n't even return them . I still have them signed out . We took all the stuff to the classrooms and hung it up on the walls for display . The idea was to \u201c poison \u201d the students . At the beginning of the course they have no idea to which arena they 'll be assigned . So on the morning when they receive their assignments they enter the class and we motivate them with the items hanging on the walls , among other things . We did n't exactly explain what they were ; we just said \u201c booty \u201d . There is not much talk about it . It arouses their curiosity and amuses them . Towards the end of the course one of the participants dressed as a Hamas fighter , in uniform , to entertain everyone . There is also something called a \u201c demonstration \u201d . Everyone puts on those uniforms and headbands , takes up the flags and stages a demonstration . It 's done in the auditorium for all the other course participants . It 's the entertainment event of the entire course . Everyone is seated and the class gets on stage and begins to shout all sorts of stuff . The highlight of the Palestinian - arena track was to put on a demonstration . When I was a course participant we yelled : \u201c Enough with Palestine , we want to relocate to Australia ! \u201d When I was an instructor a talk show was staged , with characters , I do n't recall exactly . Along with the weekly quiz there is something called \u201c bonus \u201d \u2013 all sorts of funny stuff . Sometimes funny conversations are played that we heard by mistake and kept . These are unimportant things , useless intelligence - wise , but they are kept because they are funny , and held on to for years . For example \u201c women talk \u201d . These are women 's conversations , 99 % private nonsense . Or all sorts of conversations about very private matters , including yelling , crying , fighting and cursing . As an instructor I gave a class called Morality and Intelligence , which I had also participated in as a student . The Lieutenant A affair was a major part of this class . As an instructor I had access to the army 's inquiry into this affair . In hindsight I discovered that it had been a fake inquiry . The report said the objective of that operation was to demolish a building empty of people , and that Lieutenant A 's job was to make sure the building was indeed empty \u2013 when in fact the contrary was true . The objective was to bomb a building containing innocent people , and the lieutenant was supposed to inform the unit when they were inside . We discussed this affair in class . Everyone said what they would have done in A 's stead . The conclusion was that he meant well but did not do the right thing . He should have clearly stated his fears . Now I know what really went on , and that in hindsight this whole discussion was ridiculous . Anyway , the only conclusion reached was that in this unit there is no such thing as an illegal order . It is not we who decide what is moral and what is n't . Nowadays I realise that this is what the bombing pilot says too : \u201c It 's not for me to say what is moral and what is n't . \u201d Everyone passes the responsibility on to others . After deliberating a bit , as that was the method of the class , the final message was : \u201c Do what you 're told . \u201d We also talked about what is done with information on a target 's sexual preferences . Here , too , there was some would - be deliberation , but the message was that there is no problem with this issue . As an instructor I said that one should apply one 's own judgment and not always pass on such information . I did not feel I could express a stronger message . Anyway , class consensus was that this did not pose a problem . I was once made to listen to a talk that an Israeli security officer had with a Palestinian who he tried to recruit . It 's an excellent talk for instruction and learning . It was used by the unit for some years . There 's a point where he says , \u201c Your wife 's brother has cancer . \u201d The Palestinian answers , \u201c So ? \u201d And he says , \u201c Well , you know \u2026 \u201d and they go on to speak about something else , and the Israeli keeps going back to the cancer issue . He said something like \u201c Our hospitals are good \u201d and he was clearly offering something to the Palestinian , or threatening him . Palestinians ' sex talks were always a hot item to pass on from one person in the unit to the other , for a good laugh . One person would call over another to come listen . Or some other entertaining talks . For example , \u201c funny \u201d medical conditions like haemorrhoids . It 's part of the unit 's morale . You also pass on photos for laughs that belong to targets , or just to Palestinians . Just photos , family photos , and the guys have a laugh when the children are ugly . There are also private photos , for example , that couples took for one another . At some point I distanced myself from this stuff . I told my friends this was wrong , but they all said it would n't hurt anyone . Our superiors knew about it , no question about that . I would not even say they looked away , because it was obvious that it was OK and that there was no problem . If there was a problem it would only be for wasting work time , focusing on nonsense . The Israeli public thinks that intelligence work is only against terrorism , but a significant part of our objectives are innocent people , not at all connected to any military activity . They interest the unit for other reasons , usually without having the slightest idea that they 're intelligence targets . They cannot begin to guess for what reasons they interest the unit . We did not treat those targets any differently than we did terrorists . The fact that they were innocent was not at all relevant as far as we were concerned with regard to how we treated them . Something I had a really hard time with was that all kinds of personal data was stored in the unit , such that could be used to extort / blackmail the person and turn them into a collaborator . At the base we were told that if we find out some \u201c juicy \u201d detail about them , that it 's important to document it . Examples of this were a difficult financial situation , sexual preferences , a person 's chronic illness or that of a relative , and necessary medical treatment .","annotations":[{"text":"anyone","span":[3894,3899],"token_span":[765,765],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The entity whose State is specified and/or evaluated."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"Reports stated that Israeli intelligence pries into Palestinians ' internet activity and phone calls so as to identify and blackmail LGBT people and turn them into informants against other Palestinians .

Throughout my service in my unit I did and encountered things that seemed irrelevant from a security standpoint , and I did not have a clear conscience participating in such activities . Contrary to my expectations , our database included not only security - related intelligence but also personal and political information . That is to say , on a personal level , there is no respect for Palestinian privacy . From a political standpoint , information is collected that can serve to manipulate Israeli , Palestinian and international politics . Although ours is not actual field work , it has serious impact on the lives of many people , and this is something that I think soldiers in the unit forget when everyone just does their part . Since we 're so focused on not missing any important developments , we always prefer to assume the worst . For example , if anyone is suspected , even very faintly , it is possible that the stain will never fade , and that person will suffer sanctions as a result . Our daily service dulls everyone 's sensitivity and this is reflected , for example , in running jokes about very personal things that come up in our intelligence material . Or , for instance , in the expression \u201c blood on the headset \u201d , or X 's marked on our headsets after assassinations . ' I realised the job I had done was that of the oppressor ' After my discharge from the Intelligence Corps , I had a moment of shock while watching the film The Lives of Others , about the secret police in East Germany . On the one hand , I felt solidarity with the victims , with the oppressed people who were denied such basic rights as I take for granted to be mine . On the other hand , I realised that the job I had done during my military service was that of the oppressor . My first reaction as a discharged soldier was that we do the same things , only much more efficiently . ' The attitude was \u201c Why not ? We can , so let 's do it . \u201d ' I knew people in the unit and I heard good things about it , but I did n't do anything special to enlist in this particular unit . I knew it was a good job with high - quality people , bearing a lot of responsibility , and it sounded good . From the first day of the course one is made to feel really important , and that you 're going to be exposed to interesting classified things , and to have a lot of responsibility . I assumed a role in which people are called \u201c targets \u201d , and those people who really interest us are in no sense terrorists , but rather generally normative people \u2013 who interest us because of their roles , so that we can obtain more intelligence and achieve greater access . We take advantage of the capabilities that we have over these people in order to put ourselves at ease . We take advantage of the impact that we have on their lives . Sometimes it involves truly harming a person 's life , or their soul . I mean extortion whereby they must hide things from people around them . It can really screw up their lives . It made me feel omnipotent . When I began this job I was surprised by the extent of my responsibility . I felt I had a say about important things . I could initiate things that would impact the lives of Palestinians \u2013 I could urge my unit to take all kinds of measures . The attitude was \u201c Why not ? We can , so let 's do it . \u201d I thought that what I was able to do was crazy . We were the bosses . They really relied on our judgment calls . I had access to many systems and capabilities , and I felt it was too much . No boundaries were set for us , for both passive activities such as gathering intelligence , and for active initiatives that had an impact on people 's lives . If anyone interests us , we 'd collect information on his or her economic situation and mental state . Then we would plan how we can perform an operation around this individual , in order to turn them into a collaborator or something of the sort . But I was uncomfortable with this , so I chose to disconnect from it . To clock in my hours , and check out . There are always two unit representatives in the field , one at the West Bank division HQ and one in Gaza . We would take turns , and what I recall most about this are the assassination missions . We would collect intelligence for the operation , incriminate the person , and pass on the information to the Israeli Air Force . Once when I was the unit representative , there was someone suspicious next to a weapons warehouse in Gaza and we thought he was our target . It had taken us a long time to find him . Judging by his location , the time and similar data , we concluded it was him . After we assassinated him it turned out that he was a kid . My job there was supposedly technical . The atmosphere was that of an office job . In real time you can see maps and images from the helicopter , but you 're sitting in an office so it 's very easy to feel detached and distance yourself . Nor was it my job to ask questions . I was told what was needed and that 's what I did . I remember an image on the screen of him in an orchard , and the explosion on the screen , the smoke clearing and his mother running to him , at which point we could see he was a child . The body was small . We realised we had screwed up . It got quiet and uncomfortable . Then we needed to carry on as there were other things to do , though the mood was grim . I do n't know of any investigation of what had happened , or if it was reviewed at a later date . ' We knew the medical conditions of our targets ' When I enlisted into the intelligence unit , I thought I would deal with prevention of terrorism and do whatever was necessary to protect national security . Throughout my service , I discovered that many Israeli initiatives within the Palestinian arena are directed at things that are not related to intelligence . I worked a lot on gathering information on political issues . Some could be seen as related to objectives that serve security needs , such as the suppression of Hamas institutions , while others could not . Some were political objectives that did not even fall within the Israeli consensus , such as strengthening Israel 's stance at the expense of the Palestinian position . Such objectives do not serve the security system but rather agendas of certain politicians . I had a really hard time with some of the things we did , as did the people who were with me in my section . Regarding one project in particular , many of us were shocked as we were exposed to it . Clearly it was not something we as soldiers were supposed to do . The information was almost directly transferred to political players and not to other sections of the security system . This made it clear to me that we were dealing with information that was hardly connected to security needs . We knew the detailed medical conditions of some of our targets , and our goals developed around them . I 'm not sure what was done with this information . I felt bad knowing each of their precise problems , and that we would talk and laugh about this information freely . Or , for instance , that we knew exactly who was cheating on their wife , with whom , and how often . ' I collected information on people who were completely innocent ' As a soldier in Unit 8200 , I collected information on people accused of either attacking Israelis , trying to attack Israelis , desiring to harm Israelis , and considering attacking Israelis . I also collected information on people who were completely innocent , and whose only crime was that they interested the Israeli security system for various reasons . For reasons they had absolutely no way of knowing . All Palestinians are exposed to non-stop monitoring without any legal protection . Junior soldiers can decide when someone is a target for the collection of information . There is no procedure in place to determine whether the violation of the individual 's rights is necessarily justifiable . The notion of rights for Palestinians does not exist at all . Not even as an idea to be disregarded . Any Palestinian may be targeted and may suffer from sanctions such as the denial of permits , harassment , extortion , or even direct physical injury . Such instances might occur if the individual is of any interest to the system for any reason . Be it indirect relations with hostile individuals , physical proximity to intelligence targets , or connections to topics that interest 8200 as a technological unit . Any information that might enable extortion of an individual is considered relevant information . Whether said individual is of a certain sexual orientation , cheating on his wife , or in need of treatment in Israel or the West Bank \u2013 he is a target for blackmail . Throughout the duration of my service no one in my unit ever asked , at least not out loud , if there is anything wrong with this well - oiled system \u2013 whether the transformation of any individual into a target is a legitimate act . When I joined Unit 8200 I was highly motivated . I passed a course and became an Arabic translator . There were things that I felt uncomfortable with in the work framework , though the importance of my role and our missions within the unit in which I served overshadowed these feelings . One of those moments in which things began to change occurred during the first war in Gaza , Operation Cast Lead . I was then at the peak of my service , as an experienced translator in a base which was responsible for the Palestinian arena . Upon the start of the operation something seemed wrong to me . Instead of attacking rocket and weapons caches in the Gaza Strip , as a preparatory defence measure for the campaign against Hamas , the Israeli Air Force attacked a parade of police officers . The assault killed 89 policemen . I was a simple soldier , but I wanted to pass my opinion up the chain of command that this action was morally unsound and problematic . Not only as regards the attack on the police officers . Those were precious hours in which we should have been doing our jobs preventing the launching of rockets against Israeli civilians , and this did not serve that purpose . The home front was exposed to volleys of rockets without taking care of them in advance , as should have been done , and as we were told that should happen . The officer in charge agreed to pass on my remarks , but I never received an answer . Throughout the operation I accompanied different teams engaged in collecting and translating intelligence on targets in the Gaza Strip \u2013 on both weapons and humans . I remember the overwhelming silence in the rooms from which we worked , seconds after the air force bombed those targets . A tense silence , hopeful of causing harm . When an attack was identified or executed , cheering and applause filled the room . X 's were marked on headsets . X 's were marked on the facial composite sketches that adorned the walls of the rooms . No one asked about \u201c collateral damage \u201d . I felt bad \u2013 it was very difficult to realise that no one was interested in who else had been hit . Throughout the campaign , hundreds of civilians were killed \u2013 men , women , and children , collateral damage . No one stopped to ask whether the targets we collect for the air force justify the destruction of the lives of about one and a half million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip . On 1 January , the air force attacked the home of Nizar Rayan , a Hamas leader in Gaza . Eighteen civilians were killed in the assault on his home , most of whom were members of his family . The following day senior leaders of Hamas ' military wing were targeted . When the air force reported the people harmed , tension filled the room in anticipation of finding out whether the people injured were the targeted objectives of the attack . When it became clear that they were other unrelated persons , cries of disappointment were heard . Not because people had been killed arbitrarily , but because they were n't the people we were looking for . It 's hard for me to imagine what my base would have looked like during the recent Operation Protective Edge . Probably just as it had in the past , only much more pronounced . That was the peak of my service within the Israeli army . The period during which I collected information on people who were accused of attacking Israelis , trying to attack Israelis , the desire to harm Israelis , thinking of attacking Israelis , in addition to collecting information on completely innocent people , whose only crime was that they interested the Israeli defence establishment for various reasons . Reasons they have no way of knowing . If you 're homosexual and know someone who knows a wanted person \u2013 and we need to know about it \u2013 Israel will make your life miserable . If you need emergency medical treatment in Israel , the West Bank or abroad \u2013 we searched for you . The state of Israel will allow you to die before we let you leave for treatment without giving information on your wanted cousin . If you interest Unit 8200 as a technological unit , and do n't have anything to do with any hostile activity , you 're an objective . Any such case , in which you \u201c fish out \u201d an innocent person from whom information might be squeezed , or who could be recruited as a collaborator , was like striking gold for us and for Israel 's entire intelligence community . As such , Palestinians who are not related to or involved in fighting Israel are objectives . Thus , in terms of intelligence ( aside from the physical blockade of the Gaza Strip ) , Gazan citizens are no different from their brethren in the West Bank \u2013 despite the \u201c disengagement \u201d , so to speak . During my training course in preparation for my service in this assigned role , we actually learned to memorise and filter different words for \u201c gay \u201d , in Arabic . Any Palestinian is exposed to non-stop monitoring by the Israeli Big Brother , without legal protection , and with no way of knowing when they too would become an objective \u2013 targeted for harassment , extortion , or physical injury . Junior soldiers can decide anyone is a target for the collection of information . There is no procedure in place to determine whether the violation of the individual 's rights is necessarily justifiable . The notion of rights for Palestinians does not exist at all . Throughout the duration of my service no one in my unit ever asked , at least not out loud , if there is anything wrong with this well - oiled system \u2013 whether the transformation of any individual into a target is a legitimate act . At the conclusion of my service in the army I was a commander and instructor for several months , teaching youth who had graduated from high school and were being prepared to serve as translators for the Intelligence Corps . I repeatedly tried to raise these questions with them : is it legitimate to deem as a target any person who interests the Israeli security system , for whatever reason ? The answer I received , time and again , was yes . Today I believe the answer is no . ' The fact people were innocent was not at all relevant ' I was a course instructor for soldiers assigned to the Palestinian arena . As the course was being organised we would go to some storeroom full of \u201c booty \u201d and receive uniforms , weapon parts , exploded grenades , flags of Palestine , Fatah and Hamas . Personal family items like photos of children , watches , family photos , medals , football trophies , books , Qur'ans , jewellery \u2013 Palestinian \u201c memorabilia \u201d . I do n't know for sure , but I realised that all these things came from arrest missions , either from people 's homes or from people who were killed . It is all just piled up . We were taken to this storeroom and told to take whatever we pleased , signing the stuff out afterwards . I took some flags and uniforms . At the end of the course we did n't even return them . I still have them signed out . We took all the stuff to the classrooms and hung it up on the walls for display . The idea was to \u201c poison \u201d the students . At the beginning of the course they have no idea to which arena they 'll be assigned . So on the morning when they receive their assignments they enter the class and we motivate them with the items hanging on the walls , among other things . We did n't exactly explain what they were ; we just said \u201c booty \u201d . There is not much talk about it . It arouses their curiosity and amuses them . Towards the end of the course one of the participants dressed as a Hamas fighter , in uniform , to entertain everyone . There is also something called a \u201c demonstration \u201d . Everyone puts on those uniforms and headbands , takes up the flags and stages a demonstration . It 's done in the auditorium for all the other course participants . It 's the entertainment event of the entire course . Everyone is seated and the class gets on stage and begins to shout all sorts of stuff . The highlight of the Palestinian - arena track was to put on a demonstration . When I was a course participant we yelled : \u201c Enough with Palestine , we want to relocate to Australia ! \u201d When I was an instructor a talk show was staged , with characters , I do n't recall exactly . Along with the weekly quiz there is something called \u201c bonus \u201d \u2013 all sorts of funny stuff . Sometimes funny conversations are played that we heard by mistake and kept . These are unimportant things , useless intelligence - wise , but they are kept because they are funny , and held on to for years . For example \u201c women talk \u201d . These are women 's conversations , 99 % private nonsense . Or all sorts of conversations about very private matters , including yelling , crying , fighting and cursing . As an instructor I gave a class called Morality and Intelligence , which I had also participated in as a student . The Lieutenant A affair was a major part of this class . As an instructor I had access to the army 's inquiry into this affair . In hindsight I discovered that it had been a fake inquiry . The report said the objective of that operation was to demolish a building empty of people , and that Lieutenant A 's job was to make sure the building was indeed empty \u2013 when in fact the contrary was true . The objective was to bomb a building containing innocent people , and the lieutenant was supposed to inform the unit when they were inside . We discussed this affair in class . Everyone said what they would have done in A 's stead . The conclusion was that he meant well but did not do the right thing . He should have clearly stated his fears . Now I know what really went on , and that in hindsight this whole discussion was ridiculous . Anyway , the only conclusion reached was that in this unit there is no such thing as an illegal order . It is not we who decide what is moral and what is n't . Nowadays I realise that this is what the bombing pilot says too : \u201c It 's not for me to say what is moral and what is n't . \u201d Everyone passes the responsibility on to others . After deliberating a bit , as that was the method of the class , the final message was : \u201c Do what you 're told . \u201d We also talked about what is done with information on a target 's sexual preferences . Here , too , there was some would - be deliberation , but the message was that there is no problem with this issue . As an instructor I said that one should apply one 's own judgment and not always pass on such information . I did not feel I could express a stronger message . Anyway , class consensus was that this did not pose a problem . I was once made to listen to a talk that an Israeli security officer had with a Palestinian who he tried to recruit . It 's an excellent talk for instruction and learning . It was used by the unit for some years . There 's a point where he says , \u201c Your wife 's brother has cancer . \u201d The Palestinian answers , \u201c So ? \u201d And he says , \u201c Well , you know \u2026 \u201d and they go on to speak about something else , and the Israeli keeps going back to the cancer issue . He said something like \u201c Our hospitals are good \u201d and he was clearly offering something to the Palestinian , or threatening him . Palestinians ' sex talks were always a hot item to pass on from one person in the unit to the other , for a good laugh . One person would call over another to come listen . Or some other entertaining talks . For example , \u201c funny \u201d medical conditions like haemorrhoids . It 's part of the unit 's morale . You also pass on photos for laughs that belong to targets , or just to Palestinians . Just photos , family photos , and the guys have a laugh when the children are ugly . There are also private photos , for example , that couples took for one another . At some point I distanced myself from this stuff . I told my friends this was wrong , but they all said it would n't hurt anyone . Our superiors knew about it , no question about that . I would not even say they looked away , because it was obvious that it was OK and that there was no problem . If there was a problem it would only be for wasting work time , focusing on nonsense . The Israeli public thinks that intelligence work is only against terrorism , but a significant part of our objectives are innocent people , not at all connected to any military activity . They interest the unit for other reasons , usually without having the slightest idea that they 're intelligence targets . They cannot begin to guess for what reasons they interest the unit . We did not treat those targets any differently than we did terrorists . The fact that they were innocent was not at all relevant as far as we were concerned with regard to how we treated them . Something I had a really hard time with was that all kinds of personal data was stored in the unit , such that could be used to extort / blackmail the person and turn them into a collaborator . At the base we were told that if we find out some \u201c juicy \u201d detail about them , that it 's important to document it . Examples of this were a difficult financial situation , sexual preferences , a person 's chronic illness or that of a relative , and necessary medical treatment .","annotations":[{"text":"anyone","span":[3894,3899],"token_span":[765,765],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The entity whose State is specified and/or evaluated."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-0169-826-frame-State_of_entity","frame":"State_of_entity","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Entity is in a specified State.","frame_ancestors":["State"],"frame_descendants":["Predicament"],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"He was reportedly released in the early hours of March 13 .

For each Red List update , IUCN provides summaries of the numbers of species in each category , by taxonomic group and by country . To view and download the Summary Statistics Tables , click here . The number of species listed in each IUCN Red List Category changes over time because : - species are constantly being assessed and added to The IUCN Red List for the first time ; - other species are being reassessed resulting in some moving into different Red List Categories ; and - taxonomic revisions result in the total number of recognised species within a group changing . All of the statistics presented in the summary tables are for species only ( i.e. , they do not include subspecies , varieties or geographically isolated subpopulations or stocks ) . More detailed analyses of specific taxonomic groups and the results of regional assessment projects can be found in the Resources & Publications section or in the regional pages for Europe , the Mediterranean , the Gulf of Mexico , and the Persian Gulf . A dynamic Red List : reasons for changing status In order to monitor the changing status of biodiversity , it is essential to reassess species periodically . This reassessment may result in species moving into a different Red List Category for non-genuine or genuine reasons : Non-genuine reasons - New information has become available since the last assessment ( e.g. , more recent data are available on population sizes , threatening processes , rates of decline or recovery , etc. ) . - There has been a taxonomic revision resulting in the species no longer being the same concept as it was before ( e.g. , it is now split into several species each with smaller ranges , population sizes , etc. ; or it has been merged with other species so the range , population size , etc. are now larger than they were previously ) . - An error has been discovered in the previous assessment ( e.g. , the wrong information was used ; the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria were applied incorrectly ; etc. ) . - The previous assessment used an older version of the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria and the reassessment uses the current criteria which have slightly different thresholds . Genuine reasons - The main threats are no longer present , or conservation measures ( e.g. , reintroduction , habitat protection or restoration , legal protection , harvest management , etc. ) have successfully improved the status of the species enough to move it into a lower category of threat . - The main threats have continued unabated , have increased , or new threats have developed causing the status of the species to deteriorate enough to move it into a higher category of threat . IUCN relies on research by scientists working around the world to make new and better species information available to allow Red List assessments to be updated and refined . All reassessments on The IUCN Red List include a record of the reasons for any change in Red List Category , and this allows us to identify which species are genuinely improving or deteriorating in status . Data for species that are genuinely changing status are used to calculate the Red List Index ( RLI ) . Table 7 shows the list of species that have changed category , along with the reasons for these changes . An expanding Red List : knowledge gaps and fully assessed groups In addition to species changing status , The IUCN Red List grows larger with each update as newly described species and species from the less well - known groups are assessed for the first time ( Figure 1 ) . IUCN and its partners are working to expand the number of taxonomic groups that have full and complete Red List assessments in order to improve our knowledge of the status of the world 's biodiversity ; see the Barometer of Life page for more information about this work . Figure 1 . Increase in the number of species assessed for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species \u2122 ( 2000 \u2013 2021 ; version 2021 - 3 ) . Not all taxonomic groups have been completely assessed ( see Table 1 and Figure 2 ) . It is very important to consider this when looking at the numbers of species in each Red List Category and the proportions of threatened species within each group ; although The IUCN Red List gives a good snapshot of the current status of species , it should not be interpreted as a full and complete assessment of the world 's biodiversity . For more information the work underway to expand taxonomic coverage on The IUCN Red List , see the Barometer of Life page . How many species are threatened ? Species assessed as Critically Endangered ( CR ) , Endangered ( EN ) , or Vulnerable ( VU ) are referred to as \" threatened \" species . Reporting the proportion of threatened species on The IUCN Red List is complicated because : - not all species groups have been fully evaluated , and - some species have so little information available that they can only be assessed as Data Deficient ( DD ) . For many of the incompletely evaluated groups , assessment efforts have focused on those species that are likely to be threatened ; therefore any percentage of threatened species reported for these groups would be heavily biased ( i.e. , the % threatened species would likely be an overestimate ) . For those groups that have been comprehensively evaluated , the proportion of threatened species can be calculated , but the number of threatened species is often uncertain because it is not known whether DD species are actually threatened or not . Some taxonomic groups are much better known that others ( i.e. , they will have fewer DD species ) , and therefore a more accurate figure for proportion of threatened species can be calculated . Other , less well known groups have a large proportion of DD species , which brings uncertainty into the estimate for proportion of threatened species . To account for the issues raised above , proportion of threatened species is only reported for the more completely evaluated groups ( i.e. , > 80 % of species have been evaluated ) . Also , the reported percentage of threatened species for each group is presented as a best estimate within a range of possible values bounded by lower and upper estimates : - Lower estimate = % threatened extant species if all DD species are not threatened , i.e. , ( CR + EN + VU ) / ( total assessed - EX ) - Best estimate = % threatened extant species if DD species are equally threatened as data sufficient species , i.e. , ( CR + EN + VU ) / ( total assessed - EX - DD ) - Upper estimate = % threatened extant species if all DD species are threatened , i.e. , ( CR + EN + VU + DD ) / ( total assessed - EX ) Note that since extinction risk has been evaluated for less than 5 % of the world 's described species ( see Table 1 ) , IUCN cannot provide a precise estimate for how many of the planet 's species are threatened . However , overall figures for numbers of species currently assessed in each Red List Category , along with an indication of which groups have been more comprehensively evaluated , can be found in the Summary Statistics Tables . An overview of proportions of threatened species within each of the more comprehensively assessed groups is shown in Figure 2 . Note that this bar chart groups comprehensively assessed groups of species into classes , with the exception of reef-forming corals ( which is an ecosystem - based group that includes species from two separate classes : Anthozoa and Hydrozoa ) . The intention of this Figure is to present a summary of assessments for groups that have been comprehensively evaluated through the various projects carried out by IUCN , IUCN SSC Specialist Groups , and IUCN Red List Partners . Only groups containing at least 150 species are shown in Figure 2 . Figure 2 . The proportion of extant ( i.e. , excluding Extinct ) species in The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species . Version 2021 - 3 assessed in each category for the more comprehensively assessed ( i.e. , at least 80 % of the group has been assessed ) groups containing \u2265 150 species . Species are grouped into classes ( with the exception of reef-forming corals , which includes species from classes Hydrozoa and Anthozoa ) , and are ordered according to the vertical red lines , which indicate the best estimate for proportion of extant species considered threatened ( CR , EN , or VU ) . Best estimates of percentage threatened species ( with lower and upper estimates ) for each group are : cycads 63 % ( 63 - 64 % ) ; amphibians 41 % ( 34 - 51 % ) ; selected dicots ( birches ; cacti ; magnolias ; maples ; oaks ; protea family ; southern beeches ; teas ) 39 % ( 34 - 45 % ) ; sharks , rays & chimeras 37 % ( 32 - 46 % ) ; conifers 34 % ( 34 - 35 % ) ; reef-forming corals 33 % ( 27 - 44 % ) ; selected crustaceans ( lobsters ; freshwater crabs ; freshwater crayfishes ; freshwater shrimps ) 28 % ( 17 - 56 % ) ; mammals 26 % ( 23 - 37 % ) ; reptiles 21 % ( 18 - 33 % ) ; selected insects ( dragonflies & damselflies ) 16 % ( 11 - 40 % ) ; birds 13 % ( 13 - 14 % ) ; selected gastropods ( abalones , cone snails ) 10 % ( 8 - 23 % ) ; selected bony fishes ( anchovies , herrings , sardines & relatives ; angelfishes ; billfishes ; blennies ; bonefishes ; butterflyfishes ; cornetfishes ; croakers & drums ; dragonfishes , lightfishes & relatives ; filefishes ; ghost pipefishes ; groupers ; gulpers , snipe eels & relatives ; jacks , pompanos & relatives ; ladyfishes ; lanternfishes ; lizardfishes & allies ; pufferfishes ; seabreams , porgies & picarels ; seahorses , pipefishes & relatives ; shrimpfishes ; sturgeons ; surgeonfishes , tangs & unicornfishes ; swordfish ; tarpons ; trumpetfishes ; tunas ; wrasses ) 6 % ( 5 - 22 % ) ; cephalopods ( nautiluses ; octopuses ; squids ) 1.5 % ( 1 - 57 % ) .

For each Red List update , IUCN provides summaries of the numbers of species in each category , by taxonomic group and by country . To view and download the Summary Statistics Tables , click here . The number of species listed in each IUCN Red List Category changes over time because : - species are constantly being assessed and added to The IUCN Red List for the first time ; - other species are being reassessed resulting in some moving into different Red List Categories ; and - taxonomic revisions result in the total number of recognised species within a group changing . All of the statistics presented in the summary tables are for species only ( i.e. , they do not include subspecies , varieties or geographically isolated subpopulations or stocks ) . More detailed analyses of specific taxonomic groups and the results of regional assessment projects can be found in the Resources & Publications section or in the regional pages for Europe , the Mediterranean , the Gulf of Mexico , and the Persian Gulf . A dynamic Red List : reasons for changing status In order to monitor the changing status of biodiversity , it is essential to reassess species periodically . This reassessment may result in species moving into a different Red List Category for non-genuine or genuine reasons : Non-genuine reasons - New information has become available since the last assessment ( e.g. , more recent data are available on population sizes , threatening processes , rates of decline or recovery , etc. ) . - There has been a taxonomic revision resulting in the species no longer being the same concept as it was before ( e.g. , it is now split into several species each with smaller ranges , population sizes , etc. ; or it has been merged with other species so the range , population size , etc. are now larger than they were previously ) . - An error has been discovered in the previous assessment ( e.g. , the wrong information was used ; the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria were applied incorrectly ; etc. ) . - The previous assessment used an older version of the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria and the reassessment uses the current criteria which have slightly different thresholds . Genuine reasons - The main threats are no longer present , or conservation measures ( e.g. , reintroduction , habitat protection or restoration , legal protection , harvest management , etc. ) have successfully improved the status of the species enough to move it into a lower category of threat . - The main threats have continued unabated , have increased , or new threats have developed causing the status of the species to deteriorate enough to move it into a higher category of threat . IUCN relies on research by scientists working around the world to make new and better species information available to allow Red List assessments to be updated and refined . All reassessments on The IUCN Red List include a record of the reasons for any change in Red List Category , and this allows us to identify which species are genuinely improving or deteriorating in status . Data for species that are genuinely changing status are used to calculate the Red List Index ( RLI ) . Table 7 shows the list of species that have changed category , along with the reasons for these changes . An expanding Red List : knowledge gaps and fully assessed groups In addition to species changing status , The IUCN Red List grows larger with each update as newly described species and species from the less well - known groups are assessed for the first time ( Figure 1 ) . IUCN and its partners are working to expand the number of taxonomic groups that have full and complete Red List assessments in order to improve our knowledge of the status of the world 's biodiversity ; see the Barometer of Life page for more information about this work . Figure 1 . Increase in the number of species assessed for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species \u2122 ( 2000 \u2013 2021 ; version 2021 - 3 ) . Not all taxonomic groups have been completely assessed ( see Table 1 and Figure 2 ) . It is very important to consider this when looking at the numbers of species in each Red List Category and the proportions of threatened species within each group ; although The IUCN Red List gives a good snapshot of the current status of species , it should not be interpreted as a full and complete assessment of the world 's biodiversity . For more information the work underway to expand taxonomic coverage on The IUCN Red List , see the Barometer of Life page . How many species are threatened ? Species assessed as Critically Endangered ( CR ) , Endangered ( EN ) , or Vulnerable ( VU ) are referred to as \" threatened \" species . Reporting the proportion of threatened species on The IUCN Red List is complicated because : - not all species groups have been fully evaluated , and - some species have so little information available that they can only be assessed as Data Deficient ( DD ) . For many of the incompletely evaluated groups , assessment efforts have focused on those species that are likely to be threatened ; therefore any percentage of threatened species reported for these groups would be heavily biased ( i.e. , the % threatened species would likely be an overestimate ) . For those groups that have been comprehensively evaluated , the proportion of threatened species can be calculated , but the number of threatened species is often uncertain because it is not known whether DD species are actually threatened or not . Some taxonomic groups are much better known that others ( i.e. , they will have fewer DD species ) , and therefore a more accurate figure for proportion of threatened species can be calculated . Other , less well known groups have a large proportion of DD species , which brings uncertainty into the estimate for proportion of threatened species . To account for the issues raised above , proportion of threatened species is only reported for the more completely evaluated groups ( i.e. , > 80 % of species have been evaluated ) . Also , the reported percentage of threatened species for each group is presented as a best estimate within a range of possible values bounded by lower and upper estimates : - Lower estimate = % threatened extant species if all DD species are not threatened , i.e. , ( CR + EN + VU ) / ( total assessed - EX ) - Best estimate = % threatened extant species if DD species are equally threatened as data sufficient species , i.e. , ( CR + EN + VU ) / ( total assessed - EX - DD ) - Upper estimate = % threatened extant species if all DD species are threatened , i.e. , ( CR + EN + VU + DD ) / ( total assessed - EX ) Note that since extinction risk has been evaluated for less than 5 % of the world 's described species ( see Table 1 ) , IUCN cannot provide a precise estimate for how many of the planet 's species are threatened . However , overall figures for numbers of species currently assessed in each Red List Category , along with an indication of which groups have been more comprehensively evaluated , can be found in the Summary Statistics Tables . An overview of proportions of threatened species within each of the more comprehensively assessed groups is shown in Figure 2 .

You love them much when delicate ; Nor is it left for me to hate . As to the scope of Aesop 's plan , [ 3 ] I fail as little as I can . If this my rhymed and measured speech Avails not to please or teach , I own it not a fault of mine ; Some unknown reason I assign . With little strength endued For battles rough and rude , Or with Herculean arm to smite , I show to vice its foolish plight . In this my talent wholly lies ; Not that it does at all suffice . My fable sometimes brings to view The face of vanity purblind With that of restless envy joined ; And life now turns on these pivots two . Such is the silly little frog That aped the ox on her bog . A double image sometimes shows How vice and folly do oppose The ways of virtue and good sense ; As lambs with wolves so grim and gaunt , The silly fly and frugal ant . Thus swells my work \u2013 a comedy immense \u2013 Its acts unnumbered and diverse , Its scene the boundless universe . Gods , men , and brutes , all play their part In fields of nature or of art , And Jupiter among the rest . Here comes the god who 's wont to bear Jove 's frequent errands to the fair , With winged heels and haste ; But other work 's in hand today . A man that laboured in the wood Had lost his honest livelihood ; That is to say , His axe was gone astray . He had no tools to spare ; This wholly earned his fare . Without a hope beside , He sat him down and cried , \" Alas , my axe ! where can it be ? O Jove ! but send it back to me , And it shall strike good blows for you . \" His prayer in high Olympus heard , Swift Mercury started at the word . \" Your axe must not be lost , \" said he : \" Now , will you know it when you see ? An axe I found on the road . \" With that an axe of gold he showed . \" Is it this ? \" The woodman answered , \" Nay . \" An axe of silver , bright and gay , Refused the honest woodman too . At last the finder brought to view An axe of iron , steel , and wood . \" That 's mine , \" he said , in joyful mood ; \" With that I 'll quite contented be . \" The god replied , \" I give the three , As due reward of honesty . \" This luck when neighbouring choppers knew , They lost their axes , not a few , And sent their prayers to Jupiter So fast , he knew not which to hear . His winged son , however , sent With gold and silver axes , went . Each would have thought himself a fool Not to have owned the richest tool . But Mercury promptly gave , instead Of it , a blow on the head . With simple truth to be contented , Is surest not to be repented ; But still there are who would With evil trap the good , \u2013 Whose cunning is but stupid , For Jove is never duped . [ 1 ] Aesop . There is also a version of the story in Rabelais , Book IV , Prologue . [ 2 ] La Fontaine 's dedication is in initials thus : \" A. M. L. C. D. B. \" which are interpreted by some as meaning , \" To M. the Chevalier de Bouillon \" ( as above ) , and by others as meaning , \" To Monseigneur le Cardinal de Bouillon . \" [ 3 ] Aesop 's plan . \u2013 Here , as in the dedication of Book 7 , Fable 2 , Book 1 , Fable 1 , Book 3 , Fable 1 , Book 6 , Fable 4 . , Book 8 , and Fable 1 , Book 9 , the poet treats of the nature and uses of Fable . An iron pot proposed To an earthen pot a journey . The latter was opposed , Expressing the concern he Had felt about the danger Of going out a ranger . He thought the kitchen hearth The safest place on earth For one so very brittle . \" For you , who art a kettle , And have a tougher skin , There 's nothing to keep you in . \" \" I'll be your body - guard , \" Replied the iron pot ; \" If anything that 's hard Should threaten you a jot , Between you I will go , And save you from the blow . \" This offer him persuaded . The iron pot paraded Himself as guard and guide Close at his cousin 's side . Now , in their tripod way , They hobble as they may ; And eke together bolt At every little jolt , \u2013 Which gives the crockery pain ; But presently his comrade hits So hard , he dashes him to bits , Before he can complain . Take care that you associate With equals only , lest your fate Between these pots should find its mate . [ 4 ] Aesop . A little fish will grow , If life be spared , a great ; But yet to let him go , And for his growing wait , May not be very wise , As It 's not sure your bait Will catch him when of size . On a river bank , a fisher took A tiny troutling from his hook . Said he , \" ' Twill serve to count , at least , As the beginning of my feast ; And so I 'll put it with the rest . \" This little fish , thus caught , His clemency besought . \" What will your honour do with me ? I 'm not a mouthful , as you see . Pray let me grow to be a trout , And then come here and fish me out . Some alderman , who likes things nice , Will buy me then at any price . But now , a hundred such you 'll have to fish , To make a single good - for-nothing dish . \" \" Well , well , be it so , \" replied the fisher , \" My little fish , who play the preacher , The frying - pan must be your lot , Although , no doubt , you like it not : I fry the fry that can be got . \" In some things , men of sense Prefer the present to the future tense . [ 5 ] Aesop . Some beast with horns did gore The lion ; and that sovereign dread , Resolved to suffer so no more , Straight banished from his realm , it 's said , All sorts of beasts with horns \u2013 Rams , bulls , goats , stags , and unicorns . Such brutes all promptly fled . A hare , the shadow of his ears perceiving , Could hardly help believing That some vile spy for horns would take them , And food for accusation make them . \" Adieu , \" said he , \" my neighbour cricket ; I take my foreign ticket . My ears , should I stay here , Will turn to horns , I fear ; And were they shorter than a bird 's , I fear the effect of words . \" \" These horns ! \" the cricket answered ; \" why , God made them ears who can deny ? \" \" Yes , \" said the coward , \" still they 'll make them horns , And horns , perhaps of unicorns ! In vain shall I protest , With all the learning of the schools : My reasons they will send to rest In the Hospital of Fools . ' [ 7 ] [ 6 ] Faerno . [ 7 ] Hospital of Fools , i.e. , madhouse . A cunning old fox , of plundering habits , Great crauncher of fowls , great catcher of rabbits , Whom none of his sort had caught in a nap , Was finally caught in somebody 's trap . By luck he escaped , not wholly and hale , For the price of his luck was the loss of his tail . Escaped in this way , to save his disgrace , He thought to get others in similar case . One day that the foxes in council were met , \" Why wear we , \" said he , \" this cumbering weight , Which sweeps in the dirt wherever it goes ? Pray tell me its use , if any one knows . If the council will take my advice , We shall dock off our tails in a trice . \" \" Your advice may be good , \" said one on the ground ; \" But , before I reply , pray turn yourself round . \" Whereat such a shout from the council was heard , Poor bob-tail , confounded , could say not a word . To urge the reform would have wasted his breath . Long tails were the mode till the day of his death . [ 8 ] Aesop ; Faerno . A beldam kept two spinning maids , Who plied so handily their trades , Those spinning sisters down below Were bunglers when compared with these . No care did this old woman know But giving tasks as she might please . No sooner did the god of day His glorious locks enkindle , Than both the wheels began to play , And from each whirling spindle Forth danced the thread right merrily , And back was coiled unceasingly . Soon as the dawn , I say , its tresses showed , A graceless cock most punctual crowed . The beldam roused , more graceless yet , In greasy petticoat bedight , Struck up her farthing light , And then forthwith the bed beset , Where deeply , blessedly did snore Those two maid - servants tired and poor . One oped an eye , an arm one stretched , And both their breath most sadly fetched , This threat concealing in the sigh \u2013 \" That cursed cock shall surely die ! \" And so he did : they cut his throat , And put to sleep his rousing note . And yet this murder mended not The cruel hardship of their lot ; For now the twain were scarce in bed Before they heard the summons dread . The beldam , full of apprehension Lest oversleep should cause detention , Ran like a goblin through her mansion . Thus often , when one thinks To clear himself from ill , His effort only sinks Him in the deeper still . The beldam , acting for the cock , Was Scylla for Charybdis \" rock . [ 9 ] Aesop . Within a savage forest grot A satyr and his chips Were taking down their porridge hot ; Their cups were at their lips . You might have seen in mossy den , Himself , his wife , and brood ; They had not tailor - clothes , like men , But appetites as good . In came a traveller , benighted , All hungry , cold , and wet , Who heard himself to eat invited With nothing like regret . He did not give his host the pain His asking to repeat ; But first he blew with might and main To give his fingers heat . Then in his steaming porridge dish He delicately blew . The wondering satyr said , \" I wish The use of both I knew . \" \" Why , first , my blowing warms my hand , And then it cools my porridge . \" \" Ah ! \" said his host , \" then understand I cannot give you storage . \" To sleep beneath one roof with you , I may not be so bold . Far be from me that mouth untrue Which blows both hot and cold . \" [ 10 ] Aesop . A wolf , what time the thawing breeze Renews the life of plants and trees , And beasts go forth from winter lair To seek abroad their various fare , \u2013 A wolf , I say , about those days , In sharp look - out for means and ways , Espied a horse turned out to graze . His joy the reader may opine . \" Once got , \" said he , \" this game were fine ; But if a sheep , it were sooner mine . I ca n't proceed my usual way ; Some trick must now be put in play . \" This said , He came with measured tread , As if a healer of disease , \u2013 Some pupil of Hippocrates , \u2013 And told the horse , with learned verbs , He knew the power of roots and herbs , \u2013 Whatever grew about those borders , \u2013 And not at all to flatter Himself in such a matter , Could cure of all disorders . If he , Sir Horse , would not conceal The symptoms of his case , He , Doctor Wolf , would gratis heal ; For that to feed in such a place , And run about untied , Was proof itself of some disease , As all the books decide . \" I have , good doctor , if you please , \" Replied the horse , \" as I presume , Beneath my foot , an aposthume . \" \" My son , \" replied the learned leech , \" That part , as all our authors teach , Is strikingly susceptible Of ills which make acceptable What you may also have from me \u2013 The aid of skilful surgery ; Which noble art , the fact is , For horses of the blood I practise . \" The fellow , with this talk sublime , Watched for a snap the fitting time . Meanwhile , suspicious of some trick , The wary patient nearer draws , And gives his doctor such a kick , As makes a chowder of his jaws . Exclaimed the wolf , in sorry plight , \" I own those heels have served me right . I erred to quit my trade , As I will not in future ; Me nature surely made For nothing but a butcher . \" [ 11 ] Aesop ; also in Faerno . The farmer 's patient care and toil Are oftener wanting than the soil . A wealthy ploughman drawing near his end , Called in his sons apart from every friend , And said , \" When of your sire bereft , The heritage our fathers left Guard well , nor sell a single field . A treasure in it is concealed : The place , precisely , I do n't know , But industry will serve to show . The harvest past , Time 's forelock take , And search with plough , and spade , and rake ; Turn over every inch of sod , Nor leave unsearched a single clod . \" The father died . The sons \u2013 and not in vain \u2013 Turned over the soil , and over again ; That year their acres bore More grain than ever before . Though hidden money found they none , Yet had their father wisely done , To show by such a measure , That toil itself is treasure . [ 12 ] Aesop . A mountain was in travail pang ; The country with her clamour rang . Out ran the people all , to see , Supposing that the birth would be A city , or at least a house . It was a mouse ! In thinking of this fable , Of story feigned and false , But meaning veritable , My mind the image calls Of one who writes , \" The war I sing Which Titans waged against the Thunder -king . \" [ 14 ] As on the sounding verses ring , What will be brought to birth ? Why , dearth . [ 13 ] Phaedrus , 4. 22 . [ 14 ] The War , etc . \u2013 The war of the Gods and Titans ( sons of Heaven and Earth ) ; vide Hesiod , Theogony , 1. 1083 , Bohn 's ed . Beside a well , uncurbed and deep , A schoolboy laid him down to sleep : ( Such rogues can do so anywhere . ) If some kind man had seen him there , He would have leaped as if distracted ; But Fortune much more wisely acted ; For , passing by , she softly waked the child , Thus whispering in accents mild : \" I save your life , my little dear , And beg you not to venture here Again , for had you fallen in , I should have had to bear the sin ; But I demand , in reason 's name , If for your rashness I 'm to blame ? \" With this the goddess went her way . I like her logic , I must say . There takes place nothing on this planet , But Fortune ends , whoever began it . In all adventures good or ill , We look to her to foot the bill . Has one a stupid , empty pate , That serves him never till too late , He clears himself by blaming Fate ! [ 15 ] Aesop . The selfsame patient put to test Two doctors , Fear-the - worst and Hope-the - best . The latter hoped ; the former did maintain The man would take all medicine in vain . By different cures the patient was beset , But erelong cancelled nature 's debt , While nursed As was prescribed by Fear-the - worst . But over the disease both triumphed still . Said one , \" I well foresaw his death . \" \" Yes , \" said the other , \" but my pill Would certainly have saved his breath . \" [ 16 ] Aesop , and others . How avarice loses all , By striving all to gain , I need no witness call But him whose thrifty hen , As by the fable we are told , Laid every day an egg of gold . \" She has a treasure in her body , \" Bethinks the avaricious noddy . He kills and opens \u2013 vexed to find All things like hens of common kind . Thus spoiled the source of all his riches , To misers he a lesson teaches . In these last changes of the moon , How often does one see Men made as poor as he By force of getting rich too soon ! [ 17 ] Aesop . An ass , with relics for his load , Supposed the worship on the road Meant for himself alone , And took on lofty airs , Receiving as his own The incense and the prayers . Some one , who saw his great mistake , Cried , \" Master Donkey , do not make Yourself so big a fool . Not you they worship , but your pack ; They praise the idols on your back , And count yourself a paltry tool . \" It 's thus a brainless magistrate Is honoured for his robe of state . [ 18 ] Aesop ; also Faerno . A stag , by favour of a vine , Which grew where suns most genial shine , And formed a thick and matted bower Which might have turned a summer shower , Was saved from ruinous assault . The hunters thought their dogs at fault , And called them off . In danger now no more The stag , a thankless wretch and vile , Began to browse his benefactress over . The hunters , listening the while , The rustling heard , came back , With all their yelping pack , And seized him in that very place . \" This is , \" said he , \" but justice , in my case . Let every black ingrate Henceforward profit by my fate . \" The dogs fell to \u2013 ' twere wasting breath To pray those hunters at the death . They left , and we will not revile \" em , A warning for profaners of asylum . [ 19 ] Aesop . A serpent , neighbour to a smith , ( A neighbour bad to meddle with , ) Went through his shop , in search of food , But nothing found , it 's understood , To eat , except a file of steel , Of which he tried to make a meal . The file , without a spark of passion , Addressed him in the following fashion : \" Poor simpleton ! you surely bite With less of sense than appetite ; For before from me you gain One quarter of a grain , You 'll break your teeth from ear to ear . Time 's are the only teeth I fear . \" This tale concerns those men of letters , Who , good for nothing , bite their betters . Their biting so is quite unwise . Think you , you literary sharks , Your teeth will leave their marks On the deathless works you criticise ? Fie ! fie! fie! men! To you they 're brass \u2013 they 're steel \u2013 they 're diamond ! [ 20 ] Phaedrus , Book 4 , 8 ; also Aesop . Beware how you deride The exiles from life 's sunny side : To you is little known How soon their case may be your own . On this , sage Aesop gives a tale or two , As in my verses I propose to do . A field in common share A partridge and a hare , And live in peaceful state , Till , woeful to relate ! The hunters ' mingled cry Compels the hare to fly . He hurries to his fort , And spoils almost the sport By faulting every hound That yelps on the ground . At last his reeking heat Betrays his snug retreat . Old Tray , with philosophic nose , Snuffs carefully , and grows So certain , that he cries , \" The hare is here ; bow wow ! \" And veteran Ranger now , \u2013 The dog that never lies , \u2013 \" The hare is gone , \" replies . Alas ! poor , wretched hare , Back comes he to his lair , To meet destruction there ! The partridge , void of fear , Begins her friend to jeer : \" You bragged of being fleet ; How serve you , now , your feet ? \" Scarce has she ceased to speak , \u2013 The laugh yet in her beak , \u2013 When comes her turn to die , From which she could not fly . She thought her wings , indeed , Enough for every need ; But in her laugh and talk , Forgot the cruel hawk ! The eagle and the owl , resolved to cease Their war , embraced in pledge of peace . On faith of king , on faith of owl , they swore That they would eat each other 's chicks no more . \" But know you mine ? \" said Wisdom 's bird . [ 22 ] \" Not I , indeed , \" the eagle cried . \" The worse for that , \" the owl replied : \" I fear your oath 's a useless word ; I fear that you , as king , will not Consider duly who or what : You kings and gods , of what 's before you , Are apt to make one category . Adieu , my young , if you should meet them ! \" \" Describe them , then , or let me greet them , And , on my life , I will not eat them , \" The eagle said . The owl replied : \" My little ones , I say with pride , For grace of form cannot be matched , \u2013 The prettiest birds that ever were hatched ; By this you cannot fail to know them ; It 's needless , therefore , that I show them . Pray do n't forget , but keep this mark in view , Lest fate should curse my happy nest by you . \" At length God gives the owl a set of heirs , And while at early eve abroad he fares , In quest of birds and mice for food , Our eagle haply spies the brood , As on some craggy rock they sprawl , Or nestle in some ruined wall , ( But which it matters not at all , ) And thinks them ugly little frights , Grim , sad , with voice like shrieking sprites . \" These chicks , \" says he , \" with looks almost infernal , Ca n't be the darlings of our friend nocturnal . I 'll sup of them . \" And so he did , not slightly : He never sups , if he can help it , lightly . The owl returned ; and , sad , he found Nothing left but claws on the ground . He prayed the gods above and gods below To smite the brigand who had caused his woe . Said one , \" On you alone the blame must fall ; Or rather on the law of nature , Which wills that every earthly creature Shall think its like the loveliest of all . You told the eagle of your young ones ' graces ; You gave the picture of their faces : Had it of likeness any traces ? \" [ 21 ] Avianus ; also Verdizotti . [ 22 ] Wisdom 's bird . \u2013 The owl was the bird of Minerva , as the eagle was that of Jupiter . The lion had an enterprise in hand ; Held a war- council , sent his provost - marshal , And gave the animals a call impartial \u2013 Each , in his way , to serve his high command . The elephant should carry on his back The tools of war , the mighty public pack , And fight in elephantine way and form ; The bear should hold himself prepared to storm ; The fox all secret stratagems should fix ; The monkey should amuse the foe by tricks . \" Dismiss , \" said one , \" the blockhead asses , And hares , too cowardly and fleet . \" \" No , \" said the king ; \" I use all classes ; Without their aid my force were incomplete . The ass shall be our trumpeter , to scare Our enemy . And then the nimble hare Our royal bulletins shall homeward bear . \" A monarch provident and wise Will hold his subjects all of consequence , And know in each what talent lies . There 's nothing useless to a man of sense . [ 23 ] Abstemius . Two fellows , needing funds , and bold , A bearskin to a furrier sold , Of which the bear was living still , But which they presently would kill \u2013 At least they said they would . And , if their word was good , It was a king of bears \u2013 an Ursa Major \u2013 The biggest bear beneath the sun . Its skin , the chaps would wager , Was cheap at double cost ; \" Twould make one laugh at frost \u2013 And make two robes as well as one . Old Dindenaut , [ 25 ] in sheep who dealt , Less prized his sheep , than they their pelt \u2013 ( In their account It was theirs , But in his own , the bears . ) By bargain struck on the skin , Two days at most must bring it in . Forth went the two . More easy found than got , The bear came growling at them on the trot . Behold our dealers both confounded , As if by thunderbolt astounded ! Their bargain vanished suddenly in air ; For who could plead his interest with a bear ? One of the friends sprung up a tree ; The other , cold as ice could be , Fell on his face , feigned death , And closely held his breath , \u2013 He having somewhere heard it said The bear never preys on the dead . Sir Bear , sad blockhead , was deceived \u2013 The prostrate man a corpse believed ; But , half suspecting some deceit , He feels and snuffs from head to feet , And in the nostrils blows . The body 's surely dead , he thinks . \" I'll leave it , \" says he , \" for it stinks ; \" And off into the woods he goes . The other dealer , from his tree Descending cautiously , to see His comrade lying in the dirt , Consoling , says , \" It is a wonder That , by the monster forced asunder , We 're , after all , more scared than hurt . But , \" adds he , \" what of the creature 's skin ? He held his muzzle very near ; What did he whisper in your ear ? \" \" He gave this caution , \u2013 \" Never dare Again to sell the skin of bear Its owner has not ceased to wear . \" ' [ 26 ] [ 24 ] Versions will be found in Aesop , Avianus , and Abstemius . [ 25 ] Old Dindenaut . \u2013 Vide Rabelais , Pantagruel , Book 4. chap. 8 . \u2013 Translator . The character in Rabelais is a sheep - stealer as well as a sheep -dealer . [ 26 ] According to Philip de Commines , the Emperor Frederic 3. of Germany used a story conveying the substance of this fable , with its moral of Never sell your bear- skin till the beast is dead , as his sole reply to the ambassadors of the French king when that monarch sent him proposals for dividing between them the provinces of the Duke of Burgundy . The meaning of which was , says de Commines , \" That if the King came according to his promise , they would take the Duke , if they could ; and when he was taken , they would talk of dividing his dominions . \" \u2013 Vide Bohn 's edition of the \" Memoirs of De Commines , \" vol. 1 , p. 246 .

A little fish will grow , If life be spared , a great ; But yet to let him go , And for his growing wait , May not be very wise , As It 's not sure your bait Will catch him when of size . On a river bank , a fisher took A tiny troutling from his hook . Said he , \" ' Twill serve to count , at least , As the beginning of my feast ; And so I 'll put it with the rest . \" This little fish , thus caught , His clemency besought . \" What will your honour do with me ? I 'm not a mouthful , as you see . Pray let me grow to be a trout , And then come here and fish me out . Some alderman , who likes things nice , Will buy me then at any price . But now , a hundred such you 'll have to fish , To make a single good - for-nothing dish . \" \" Well , well , be it so , \" replied the fisher , \" My little fish , who play the preacher , The frying - pan must be your lot , Although , no doubt , you like it not : I fry the fry that can be got . \" In some things , men of sense Prefer the present to the future tense . [ 5 ] Aesop . Some beast with horns did gore The lion ; and that sovereign dread , Resolved to suffer so no more , Straight banished from his realm , it 's said , All sorts of beasts with horns \u2013 Rams , bulls , goats , stags , and unicorns . Such brutes all promptly fled . A hare , the shadow of his ears perceiving , Could hardly help believing That some vile spy for horns would take them , And food for accusation make them . \" Adieu , \" said he , \" my neighbour cricket ; I take my foreign ticket . My ears , should I stay here , Will turn to horns , I fear ; And were they shorter than a bird 's , I fear the effect of words . \" \" These horns ! \" the cricket answered ; \" why , God made them ears who can deny ? \" \" Yes , \" said the coward , \" still they 'll make them horns , And horns , perhaps of unicorns ! In vain shall I protest , With all the learning of the schools : My reasons they will send to rest In the Hospital of Fools . ' [ 7 ] [ 6 ] Faerno . [ 7 ] Hospital of Fools , i.e. , madhouse . A cunning old fox , of plundering habits , Great crauncher of fowls , great catcher of rabbits , Whom none of his sort had caught in a nap , Was finally caught in somebody 's trap . By luck he escaped , not wholly and hale , For the price of his luck was the loss of his tail . Escaped in this way , to save his disgrace , He thought to get others in similar case . One day that the foxes in council were met , \" Why wear we , \" said he , \" this cumbering weight , Which sweeps in the dirt wherever it goes ? Pray tell me its use , if any one knows . If the council will take my advice , We shall dock off our tails in a trice . \" \" Your advice may be good , \" said one on the ground ; \" But , before I reply , pray turn yourself round . \" Whereat such a shout from the council was heard , Poor bob-tail , confounded , could say not a word . To urge the reform would have wasted his breath . Long tails were the mode till the day of his death . [ 8 ] Aesop ; Faerno . A beldam kept two spinning maids , Who plied so handily their trades , Those spinning sisters down below Were bunglers when compared with these . No care did this old woman know But giving tasks as she might please . No sooner did the god of day His glorious locks enkindle , Than both the wheels began to play , And from each whirling spindle Forth danced the thread right merrily , And back was coiled unceasingly . Soon as the dawn , I say , its tresses showed , A graceless cock most punctual crowed . The beldam roused , more graceless yet , In greasy petticoat bedight , Struck up her farthing light , And then forthwith the bed beset , Where deeply , blessedly did snore Those two maid - servants tired and poor . One oped an eye , an arm one stretched , And both their breath most sadly fetched , This threat concealing in the sigh \u2013 \" That cursed cock shall surely die ! \" And so he did : they cut his throat , And put to sleep his rousing note . And yet this murder mended not The cruel hardship of their lot ; For now the twain were scarce in bed Before they heard the summons dread . The beldam , full of apprehension Lest oversleep should cause detention , Ran like a goblin through her mansion . Thus often , when one thinks To clear himself from ill , His effort only sinks Him in the deeper still . The beldam , acting for the cock , Was Scylla for Charybdis \" rock . [ 9 ] Aesop . Within a savage forest grot A satyr and his chips Were taking down their porridge hot ; Their cups were at their lips . You might have seen in mossy den , Himself , his wife , and brood ; They had not tailor - clothes , like men , But appetites as good . In came a traveller , benighted , All hungry , cold , and wet , Who heard himself to eat invited With nothing like regret . He did not give his host the pain His asking to repeat ; But first he blew with might and main To give his fingers heat . Then in his steaming porridge dish He delicately blew . The wondering satyr said , \" I wish The use of both I knew . \" \" Why , first , my blowing warms my hand , And then it cools my porridge . \" \" Ah ! \" said his host , \" then understand I cannot give you storage . \" To sleep beneath one roof with you , I may not be so bold . Far be from me that mouth untrue Which blows both hot and cold . \" [ 10 ] Aesop . A wolf , what time the thawing breeze Renews the life of plants and trees , And beasts go forth from winter lair To seek abroad their various fare , \u2013 A wolf , I say , about those days , In sharp look - out for means and ways , Espied a horse turned out to graze . His joy the reader may opine . \" Once got , \" said he , \" this game were fine ; But if a sheep , it were sooner mine . I ca n't proceed my usual way ; Some trick must now be put in play . \" This said , He came with measured tread , As if a healer of disease , \u2013 Some pupil of Hippocrates , \u2013 And told the horse , with learned verbs , He knew the power of roots and herbs , \u2013 Whatever grew about those borders , \u2013 And not at all to flatter Himself in such a matter , Could cure of all disorders . If he , Sir Horse , would not conceal The symptoms of his case , He , Doctor Wolf , would gratis heal ; For that to feed in such a place , And run about untied , Was proof itself of some disease , As all the books decide . \" I have , good doctor , if you please , \" Replied the horse , \" as I presume , Beneath my foot , an aposthume . \" \" My son , \" replied the learned leech , \" That part , as all our authors teach , Is strikingly susceptible Of ills which make acceptable What you may also have from me \u2013 The aid of skilful surgery ; Which noble art , the fact is , For horses of the blood I practise . \" The fellow , with this talk sublime , Watched for a snap the fitting time . Meanwhile , suspicious of some trick , The wary patient nearer draws , And gives his doctor such a kick , As makes a chowder of his jaws . Exclaimed the wolf , in sorry plight , \" I own those heels have served me right . I erred to quit my trade , As I will not in future ; Me nature surely made For nothing but a butcher . \" [ 11 ] Aesop ; also in Faerno . The farmer 's patient care and toil Are oftener wanting than the soil . A wealthy ploughman drawing near his end , Called in his sons apart from every friend , And said , \" When of your sire bereft , The heritage our fathers left Guard well , nor sell a single field . A treasure in it is concealed : The place , precisely , I do n't know , But industry will serve to show . The harvest past , Time 's forelock take , And search with plough , and spade , and rake ; Turn over every inch of sod , Nor leave unsearched a single clod . \" The father died . The sons \u2013 and not in vain \u2013 Turned over the soil , and over again ; That year their acres bore More grain than ever before . Though hidden money found they none , Yet had their father wisely done , To show by such a measure , That toil itself is treasure . [ 12 ] Aesop . A mountain was in travail pang ; The country with her clamour rang . Out ran the people all , to see , Supposing that the birth would be A city , or at least a house . It was a mouse ! In thinking of this fable , Of story feigned and false , But meaning veritable , My mind the image calls Of one who writes , \" The war I sing Which Titans waged against the Thunder -king . \" [ 14 ] As on the sounding verses ring , What will be brought to birth ? Why , dearth . [ 13 ] Phaedrus , 4. 22 . [ 14 ] The War , etc . \u2013 The war of the Gods and Titans ( sons of Heaven and Earth ) ; vide Hesiod , Theogony , 1. 1083 , Bohn 's ed . Beside a well , uncurbed and deep , A schoolboy laid him down to sleep : ( Such rogues can do so anywhere . ) If some kind man had seen him there , He would have leaped as if distracted ; But Fortune much more wisely acted ; For , passing by , she softly waked the child , Thus whispering in accents mild : \" I save your life , my little dear , And beg you not to venture here Again , for had you fallen in , I should have had to bear the sin ; But I demand , in reason 's name , If for your rashness I 'm to blame ? \" With this the goddess went her way . I like her logic , I must say . There takes place nothing on this planet , But Fortune ends , whoever began it . In all adventures good or ill , We look to her to foot the bill . Has one a stupid , empty pate , That serves him never till too late , He clears himself by blaming Fate ! [ 15 ] Aesop . The selfsame patient put to test Two doctors , Fear-the - worst and Hope-the - best . The latter hoped ; the former did maintain The man would take all medicine in vain . By different cures the patient was beset , But erelong cancelled nature 's debt , While nursed As was prescribed by Fear-the - worst . But over the disease both triumphed still . Said one , \" I well foresaw his death . \" \" Yes , \" said the other , \" but my pill Would certainly have saved his breath . \" [ 16 ] Aesop , and others . How avarice loses all , By striving all to gain , I need no witness call But him whose thrifty hen , As by the fable we are told , Laid every day an egg of gold . \" She has a treasure in her body , \" Bethinks the avaricious noddy . He kills and opens \u2013 vexed to find All things like hens of common kind . Thus spoiled the source of all his riches , To misers he a lesson teaches . In these last changes of the moon , How often does one see Men made as poor as he By force of getting rich too soon ! [ 17 ] Aesop . An ass , with relics for his load , Supposed the worship on the road Meant for himself alone , And took on lofty airs , Receiving as his own The incense and the prayers . Some one , who saw his great mistake , Cried , \" Master Donkey , do not make Yourself so big a fool . Not you they worship , but your pack ; They praise the idols on your back , And count yourself a paltry tool . \" It 's thus a brainless magistrate Is honoured for his robe of state . [ 18 ] Aesop ; also Faerno . A stag , by favour of a vine , Which grew where suns most genial shine , And formed a thick and matted bower Which might have turned a summer shower , Was saved from ruinous assault . The hunters thought their dogs at fault , And called them off . In danger now no more The stag , a thankless wretch and vile , Began to browse his benefactress over . The hunters , listening the while , The rustling heard , came back , With all their yelping pack , And seized him in that very place . \" This is , \" said he , \" but justice , in my case . Let every black ingrate Henceforward profit by my fate . \" The dogs fell to \u2013 ' twere wasting breath To pray those hunters at the death . They left , and we will not revile \" em , A warning for profaners of asylum . [ 19 ] Aesop . A serpent , neighbour to a smith , ( A neighbour bad to meddle with , ) Went through his shop , in search of food , But nothing found , it 's understood , To eat , except a file of steel , Of which he tried to make a meal . The file , without a spark of passion , Addressed him in the following fashion : \" Poor simpleton ! you surely bite With less of sense than appetite ; For before from me you gain One quarter of a grain , You 'll break your teeth from ear to ear . Time 's are the only teeth I fear . \" This tale concerns those men of letters , Who , good for nothing , bite their betters . Their biting so is quite unwise . Think you , you literary sharks , Your teeth will leave their marks On the deathless works you criticise ? Fie ! fie! fie! men! To you they 're brass \u2013 they 're steel \u2013 they 're diamond ! [ 20 ] Phaedrus , Book 4 , 8 ; also Aesop . Beware how you deride The exiles from life 's sunny side : To you is little known How soon their case may be your own . On this , sage Aesop gives a tale or two , As in my verses I propose to do . A field in common share A partridge and a hare , And live in peaceful state , Till , woeful to relate ! The hunters ' mingled cry Compels the hare to fly . He hurries to his fort , And spoils almost the sport By faulting every hound That yelps on the ground . At last his reeking heat Betrays his snug retreat . Old Tray , with philosophic nose , Snuffs carefully , and grows So certain , that he cries , \" The hare is here ; bow wow ! \" And veteran Ranger now , \u2013 The dog that never lies , \u2013 \" The hare is gone , \" replies . Alas ! poor , wretched hare , Back comes he to his lair , To meet destruction there ! The partridge , void of fear , Begins her friend to jeer : \" You bragged of being fleet ; How serve you , now , your feet ? \" Scarce has she ceased to speak , \u2013 The laugh yet in her beak , \u2013 When comes her turn to die , From which she could not fly . She thought her wings , indeed , Enough for every need ; But in her laugh and talk , Forgot the cruel hawk ! The eagle and the owl , resolved to cease Their war , embraced in pledge of peace . On faith of king , on faith of owl , they swore That they would eat each other 's chicks no more . \" But know you mine ? \" said Wisdom 's bird . [ 22 ] \" Not I , indeed , \" the eagle cried . \" The worse for that , \" the owl replied : \" I fear your oath 's a useless word ; I fear that you , as king , will not Consider duly who or what : You kings and gods , of what 's before you , Are apt to make one category . Adieu , my young , if you should meet them ! \" \" Describe them , then , or let me greet them , And , on my life , I will not eat them , \" The eagle said . The owl replied : \" My little ones , I say with pride , For grace of form cannot be matched , \u2013 The prettiest birds that ever were hatched ; By this you cannot fail to know them ; It 's needless , therefore , that I show them . Pray do n't forget , but keep this mark in view , Lest fate should curse my happy nest by you . \" At length God gives the owl a set of heirs , And while at early eve abroad he fares , In quest of birds and mice for food , Our eagle haply spies the brood , As on some craggy rock they sprawl , Or nestle in some ruined wall , ( But which it matters not at all , ) And thinks them ugly little frights , Grim , sad , with voice like shrieking sprites . \" These chicks , \" says he , \" with looks almost infernal , Ca n't be the darlings of our friend nocturnal . I 'll sup of them . \" And so he did , not slightly : He never sups , if he can help it , lightly . The owl returned ; and , sad , he found Nothing left but claws on the ground . He prayed the gods above and gods below To smite the brigand who had caused his woe . Said one , \" On you alone the blame must fall ; Or rather on the law of nature , Which wills that every earthly creature Shall think its like the loveliest of all . You told the eagle of your young ones ' graces ; You gave the picture of their faces : Had it of likeness any traces ? \" [ 21 ] Avianus ; also Verdizotti . [ 22 ] Wisdom 's bird . \u2013 The owl was the bird of Minerva , as the eagle was that of Jupiter . The lion had an enterprise in hand ; Held a war- council , sent his provost - marshal , And gave the animals a call impartial \u2013 Each , in his way , to serve his high command . The elephant should carry on his back The tools of war , the mighty public pack , And fight in elephantine way and form ; The bear should hold himself prepared to storm ; The fox all secret stratagems should fix ; The monkey should amuse the foe by tricks . \" Dismiss , \" said one , \" the blockhead asses , And hares , too cowardly and fleet . \" \" No , \" said the king ; \" I use all classes ; Without their aid my force were incomplete . The ass shall be our trumpeter , to scare Our enemy . And then the nimble hare Our royal bulletins shall homeward bear . \" A monarch provident and wise Will hold his subjects all of consequence , And know in each what talent lies . There 's nothing useless to a man of sense . [ 23 ] Abstemius . Two fellows , needing funds , and bold , A bearskin to a furrier sold , Of which the bear was living still , But which they presently would kill \u2013 At least they said they would . And , if their word was good , It was a king of bears \u2013 an Ursa Major \u2013 The biggest bear beneath the sun . Its skin , the chaps would wager , Was cheap at double cost ; \" Twould make one laugh at frost \u2013 And make two robes as well as one . Old Dindenaut , [ 25 ] in sheep who dealt , Less prized his sheep , than they their pelt \u2013 ( In their account It was theirs , But in his own , the bears . ) By bargain struck on the skin , Two days at most must bring it in . Forth went the two . More easy found than got , The bear came growling at them on the trot . Behold our dealers both confounded , As if by thunderbolt astounded ! Their bargain vanished suddenly in air ; For who could plead his interest with a bear ? One of the friends sprung up a tree ; The other , cold as ice could be , Fell on his face , feigned death , And closely held his breath , \u2013 He having somewhere heard it said The bear never preys on the dead . Sir Bear , sad blockhead , was deceived \u2013 The prostrate man a corpse believed ; But , half suspecting some deceit , He feels and snuffs from head to feet , And in the nostrils blows . The body 's surely dead , he thinks . \" I'll leave it , \" says he , \" for it stinks ; \" And off into the woods he goes . The other dealer , from his tree Descending cautiously , to see His comrade lying in the dirt , Consoling , says , \" It is a wonder That , by the monster forced asunder , We 're , after all , more scared than hurt . But , \" adds he , \" what of the creature 's skin ? He held his muzzle very near ; What did he whisper in your ear ? \" \" He gave this caution , \u2013 \" Never dare Again to sell the skin of bear Its owner has not ceased to wear . \" ' [ 26 ] [ 24 ] Versions will be found in Aesop , Avianus , and Abstemius . [ 25 ] Old Dindenaut . \u2013 Vide Rabelais , Pantagruel , Book 4. chap. 8 . \u2013 Translator . The character in Rabelais is a sheep - stealer as well as a sheep -dealer . [ 26 ] According to Philip de Commines , the Emperor Frederic 3. of Germany used a story conveying the substance of this fable , with its moral of Never sell your bear- skin till the beast is dead , as his sole reply to the ambassadors of the French king when that monarch sent him proposals for dividing between them the provinces of the Duke of Burgundy . The meaning of which was , says de Commines , \" That if the King came according to his promise , they would take the Duke , if they could ; and when he was taken , they would talk of dividing his dominions . \" \u2013 Vide Bohn 's edition of the \" Memoirs of De Commines , \" vol. 1 , p. 246 . Clad in a lion 's shaggy hide , An ass spread terror far and wide , And , though himself a coward brute , Put all the world to scampering rout : But , by a piece of evil luck , A portion of an ear outstuck , Which soon revealed the error Of all the panic-terror . Old Martin did his office quick . Surprised were all who did not know the trick , To see that Martin , [ 28 ] at his will , Was driving lions to the mill !

Security Council Resolution 2231 is clearly a part \u2014 and the arms embargo specifically . \u201d Enforcement is also important to prevent Russia from using the airbase again in the future , the senators said . \u201c Even if the current round of Russian airstrikes from an Iranian air base has come to a halt , we have no reason to believe they would not happen again , especially if there are no consequences for Russia 's prior use of Iranian territory from which to launch attacks in Syria , \u201d they wrote .

I was cautious about crying wolf . I am always cautious about crying wolf . I think conservationists have to be careful in saying things are catastrophic when , in fact , they are less than catastrophic . I have seen my job at the BBC as a presenter to produce programmes about natural history , just as the Natural History Museum would be interested in showing a range of birds of paradise - that 's the sort of thing I 've been doing . And in almost every big series I 've made , the most recent one being Planet Earth , I 've ended up by talking about the future , and possible dangers . But , with climate change , I was sceptical . That is true . Also , I 'm not a chemist or a climatologist or a meteorologist ; it is n't for me to suddenly stand up and say I have decided the climate is changing . That 's not my expertise . The television gives you an unfair and unjustified prominence but just because your face is on the telly does n't mean you 're an expert on meteorology . But I 'm no longer sceptical . Now I do not have any doubt at all . I think climate change is the major challenge facing the world . I have waited until the proof was conclusive that it was humanity changing the climate . The thing that really convinced me was the graphs connecting the increase of carbon dioxide in the environment and the rise in temperature , with the growth of human population and industrialisation . The coincidence of the curves made it perfectly clear we have left the period of natural climatic oscillation behind and have begun on a steep curve , in terms of temperature rise , beyond anything in terms of increases that we have seen over many thousands of years . People say , everything will be all right in the end . But it 's not the case . We may be facing major disasters on a global scale . I have seen the ice melting . I have been to parts of Patagonia and heard people say : \" That 's where the glacier was 10 years ago - and that 's where it is today . \" The most dramatic evidence I have seen was New Orleans , after Hurricane Katrina . Was that climate - change induced , out of the ordinary ? Certainly so . Everyone who does any cooking knows that if you want to increase a chemical reaction , you put it on the stove and heat it up . If you increase the temperature of the oceans , above which there are swirling currents of air , you will increase the energy in the air currents . It 's not a mystery . So it 's true to say these programmes about climate change are different , in that previously I have made programmes about natural history , and now you could say I have an engaged stance . The first is about the fact that there is climate change and that it is human-induced . I 'm well aware that people say it 's all a fuss about nothing , and even if it is getting warmer , it 's nothing to do with us . So I 'm glad that the BBC wanted some clear statement of the evidence as to why these two things are the case . The second programme says , these are some of the changes that are now almost inevitable , these are the sorts of things that the nations of the world have to do , to forestall the worst . Will they do it ? Who knows ? And many people feel helpless . Yet the fact of the matter is , I was brought up as boy during the war and , during the war , we actually regarded it as immoral , wrong , to leave food on your plate , you needed to eat what was on your plate because we did n't have enough . I feel in the same way that it is wrong to waste energy now , and if that sort of sea change in moral attitude were to spread amongst the world 's population , it would make a difference . During the past 50 years , I have been lucky enough to spend my time travelling around the world looking at its wonders and its splendours . I have seen many changes , some good many bad . But it 's only in the past decade that I have come to think about the question of whether or not what I , or anybody else , has been doing , could have contributed to the change in the climate of the planet that is undoubtedly taking place . When I was a boy in the 1930s , the carbon dioxide level was still below 300 parts per million . This year , it reached 382 , the highest figure for hundreds of thousands of years . I 'm 80 now . It 's not that I think , like any old man , that change is wrong . I recognise that the world has always changed . I know that . But the point is , it 's changing more extremely and swiftly than at any time in the past several million years .

Since June 2006 , Glasgow 2014 have visited every corner of the world to find out first- hand what the voters want . We visited a total of 67 countries , from Montserrat to Vanuatu . It was a mammoth task , but well worth it . We have shared our vision , and raised awareness of everything our great city has to offer our international friends . March 2007 : The bid train on the tracks for the first time We launched our unique Bid Train , a specially branded train produced by First Scotrail , one of our major supporters . The train will travel all over Scotland spreading our bid message and urging even more Scots to do their bit and pledge their support . February 2007 : More partners join the project February 2007 saw us confirm BBC Scotland as our 5th major supporter . One of the most respected brands in the world , the BBC brings with them an unrivalled knowledge of the Commonwealth Games . As a major supporter , the BBC is committed to producing all of our publicity films until decision day on November 9 2007 .

Her voice on the phone is quiet , cautious , self-deprecating . A mainstay among anti-poverty activists in Vancouver who has spent 38 years sparring with property developers , SRO - managers and politicians , Swanson tells me that she 's reluctant to be interviewed . \" I 'm getting older and the folks that are doing the great work are younger , \" she says . \" It would be neat if you would profile them instead of me . \" She offers me a few phone numbers . Since the mid-1970s , Swanson has organized and advocated in the defence of Canada 's least defended -- all the while eschewing cultivation of her own celebrity . \" She 's very quiet , very focused on results , \" says Emily Mayne , who first met Swanson at a Raise the Rates meeting in the early 2000s before going on to work with her for the next eight years . As much disposition as principle , she says , Swanson has always preferred to \" step aside and let others take the limelight . \" Last fall , Swanson was one of five reader - nominated British Columbians to receive the People 's Order of B.C. , voted by Tyee readers . Mayne cast her vote for Swanson . She calls the choice a \" no brainer . \" \" People need to know what a valuable resource she is , \" says Mayne . \" You try to thank her and tell her how important she is , but she does n't want to hear it . It 's never been about her . She 's always working . Jean is out there everyday . \" ' Good work ' As Swanson recounts it , she fell into the world of activism and community organization over the course of an evening in 1974 . She was waitressing at the Patricia Hotel at the time , \" slinging beer \" to the regulars in the dingy ground floor pub of the East Hastings SRO . This was n't work she was particularly proud of . Her boss was constantly pressuring her to \" load up \" the tables -- aggressively topping up the customers to keep them plastered in their seats and running up a tab until last call . But pride in one 's job was n't something Swanson felt entitled to . The 31-year - old was just scraping by . Born in New York state , Swanson spent most of her childhood bumping around America 's West Coast . Her father , a mining prospector , was constantly shuffling his family around in search of work and Swanson recalls a lonely childhood . There were years , she says , when she was attending upwards of three schools per year . By the time she 'd moved to Canada and years later ended up working at the Patricia , Swanson was the mother of two daughters . One was born with a heart defect and Swanson knew she could n't afford the necessary medical coverage back in the U.S. She had no plans grander than meeting next month 's rent . Then one evening during Swanson 's shift , Bruce Eriksen and Libby Davies walked into the hotel bar . Swanson knew about Eriksen ; she 'd seen him on television , protesting safety conditions at hotels around the neighbourhood -- a neighbourhood that most everyone but he and his colleagues at the recently formed Downtown Eastside Residents ' Association ( DERA ) still called Skid Row . But Swanson had also received plenty of warning from her boss about DERA and its mercurial president . Loading up tables was a violation of provincial liquor law and Eriksen was known to report offenders . Swanson approached the couple to check Davies ' ID and the three got to talking . \" It seemed like he was doing good work , \" Swanson says now . \" I did n't know that that kind of work existed . I just knew that I had a rotten life and that it would be nice to do something that made sense . \" A few weeks later , Swanson spotted Eriksen eating lunch at the nearby Ovaltine Caf\u00e9 . In an act of brashness that she now calls \" one of the smartest things I ever did , \" she walked up to Eriksen 's table and asked for a job . A few weeks later , Swanson , who 'd been the editor of her high school newspaper over a decade earlier , started work at DERA 's monthly paper , the Downtown East . With , not for Swanson downplays her role at DERA . Putting together the paper now seems so antiquated . \" We were gluing down the columns with hot wax , \" she says , laughing . By all other accounts , Swanson was doing much more than operating a glue gun during the organization 's foundational years . As the best writer of the three , she assumed the role of DERA 's secretary , with Davies managing the funds and Eriksen soldiering on as front man and street organizer . On its face , the trio 's project seemed an unlikely one . In a neighbourhood that the rest of the city had written off , the mission of the residents ' association was to get the community politically engaged and advocating on its own behalf . Working with , rather than on behalf of the members of a community is an approach to activism that Blair Redlin says he recognized when working with Swanson in the late 1980s . \" She is n't just talking about poverty and she is n't dealing with these issues as a matter of charity , \" says Redlin , who now works as a researcher for CUPE . \" She has always worked with lower income people . \" Speaking over the phone from Vernon , Emily Mayne agrees . Mayne , who often crossed paths with Swanson while working at the Kettle Friendship Society throughout the 2000s , says she was struck by the bond between Swanson and the residents of the neighbourhood . \" If you go out onto the street in the Downtown Eastside , you can ask : everyone will know her , \" says Mayne . \" She works with the people in the community who are most affected . So who cares if people in Kits do n't know about her ? \" Living room of the Downtown Eastside During Swanson 's tenure at DERA , the ranks of the organization swelled to some three thousand residents across the Downtown Eastside in 1980 . During that same period DERA campaigned for and won a community centre built in the Downtown Eastside . Up until that point , says Swanson , \" the beer parlors were the community centres \" of the Downtown Eastside . By design , the single room hotels did not provide communal space to tenants . Especially in inclement weather , she says , there were few places where neighbour could meet neighbour without the temptation or obligation to drink or fix . It was a seven- year fight to secure what many have since called the living room of the Downtown Eastside . Swanson helped stave off commercial developers , wrangle politicians and design a workable solution . Finally , on Jan. 20 , 1980 , the once defunct and disregarded public library at the corner of Main and Hastings was reopened . The building was renamed the Carnegie Community Centre . Political action , not charity Swanson split with DERA in 1981 , after the association lost its funding to keep its Secretary on the payroll . While Eriksen went on to win a seat on City Council at the beginning of the decade , followed two years later by Davies ( Davies is now Swanson 's MP as well as one of her close friends ) , Swanson spent the first half of the 1980s working \" a few odd jobs , \" with a longer stint at the Hospital Employees ' Union . When Swanson finally returned to anti-poverty activism in 1985 , it was with a more ambitious goal in mind . Spurred on by then premier Bill Bennett 's \" Restraint \" reforms , British Columbia 's rendition of the economic liberalization policies being introduced in Ottawa , Washington and London at the time , Swanson co-founded End Legislated Poverty ( ELP ) . As implied by the name , ELP was an effort to fight social injustice at what Swanson considered to be social injustice 's point of origin \u2013- the halls of provincial assemblies and national parliaments . \" Jean 's perspective is that we need to get at the root causes of poverty , which are the public policy decisions that favour people of high income and that favour corporations at the expense of the rest of us , \" says Redlin . In practice , \" getting at the root causes of poverty \" meant campaigning for higher welfare rates , higher minimum wages , and protesting the drawing down of trade barriers with the United States . Redlin says he first worked with Swanson when the two were helping to organize the Coalition Against Free - Trade . \" Jean helped me understand the connection between issues like that and poverty , \" he says . \" That the solution to poverty is n't charity . The solution is political action and policy change . \" Swanson 's own political action campaigning continued to expand in scope throughout the decade . In 1988 , Swanson ran for mayor of Vancouver on a coalition left-of - centre ticket . She lost to Gordon Campbell . Off the campaign trail , she spent those years continuing to work with the ELP , joining the National Anti-Poverty Organization ( now called Canada Without Poverty ) and served as co-chair of Action Canada Network , another anti-free trade organization . Swanson would go on to join the NAPO board of directors and to serve as the organization 's national president for two years . A 25 - year partnership It was also in 1985 , the same year she formed the ELP , that Swanson met Sandy Cameron , a warm-natured teacher and seasonal prospector from Toronto . Despite his upper-middle class upbringing , Cameron had a strong affinity for the underdog and a sense of social justice to rival Swanson's . Before moving to Vancouver , he had been a teacher , working in prisons and in remote Reserve schools and spending his summers bushwhacking , logging and prospecting in Northern Ontario and the B.C. interior . After settling in Vancouver with Swanson , Cameron made himself the de facto historian and poet of the Downtown Eastside . On a website Swanson created in memory of Cameron after his death , she describes their relationship as a \" 25 - year partnership in life and social justice work . \" \" He came to all the demonstrations , edited every word I wrote , always talked to me about different strategies , \" says Swanson . \" But he also slowed me down , helped me to lead a more balanced life . \" Cameron died of pneumonia in October of 2010 . Against poor- bashing In 1996 , Swanson started writing a book against widespread assumptions about poverty and the poor that makes it morally permissible to engage in \" poor -bashing . \" Poor-bashing , as Swanson defines it , is both cultural and institutional . To believe that poverty is a matter of personal deficiency or that welfare only coddles the lazy is a kind of poor-bashing . But so too are the policies -- the cuts to financial assistance and social services -- that are justified by that belief . Too much media media coverage , says Swanson , presents the the poor only as helpless and inept , as \" sufferers and victims . \" \" You never portray the poor as intelligent human beings who might have answers to the situations that they find themselves in , \" she says . If society were given a less slanted view of who the poor are and what it means to be poor , she says , good policy would follow . \" When stereotypes can be challenged -- for example , when people understand how low the ( welfare ) rates are and that you ca n't live on that -- then reasonable people will come to reasonable conclusions . \" She adds , \" I guess I would just plea for people to actually consider ending poverty . We have the resources . We could do it . \" Swanson published Poor-Bashing : The Politics of Exclusion in 2001 , the same year she retired from ELP . ' The soul of Vancouver ' After a five - year hiatus , Swanson once again returned to social justice campaigning in 2006 when she took on the role of Co-ordinator of the Carnegie Community Action Project . Today , CCAP is considered one of the city 's most vocal ( and by its detractors , fanatical ) advocacy organizations on housing and income issues in the Downtown Eastside . Ivan Drury is a researcher and organizer at CCAP . Prior to going to work with Swanson two years ago , Drury says he knew of the veteran activist as \" the Godmother of the neighbourhood . \" \" Sandy Cameron wrote a poem that called the Downtown Eastside ' the soul of Vancouver , ' \" says Drury . \" I think that Jean exemplifies that because she carries that soul through the wisdom of her experience , having known so many people who have been involved in the struggle here for decades . \" Wendy Pedersen is , like Drury , a CCAP researcher and organizer . And like Drury , Pedersen , who has worked at CCAP for the last six years \" day and night , \" says she 's found a \" mentor \" and an \" elder \" in Swanson . \" She 's always encouraging us to remember to spend time with our families , to not burn out , \" says Pedersen . \" Everyone might not agree with her , but everyone that she comes in contact with does respect her and what she does and how she does it . \" Certainly , there are many that do not agree with Swanson . Particularly in trying to hold back the tide of private development , Swanson and CCAP 's position that gentrification should be sharply curtailed , or made contingent on the expansion of supportive housing , has engendered some bad blood between the group and the city 's political and economic leaders . But speaking to Philip Owen , one of Swanson 's erstwhile political adversaries from city hall , Pedersen 's claim is born out . As mayor between 1993 and 2002 , Owen , a political moderate and a former businessman with a market - oriented view of the world ( \" we 've got more social housing units in Vancouver than in the whole bloody country , \" he laments ) , he extends to the soft-spoken activist a degree of respect denied to most of her current and former colleagues . \" She was n't an off - the - wall nutbar , \" he says . \" She did n't yell and scream and shout . She did n't give it to you that way . She gave it to you in a way so that you 'd sit and listen . She did a good job . \" Bad as it ever was Looking at the Downtown Eastside today , Swanson 's outlook is grim . Since she joined DERA in 1974 , overall conditions in the neighbourhood have only deteriorated , she says . \" The housing situation in the SROs was bad ( back then ) , but at least there was a vacancy rate and you could get in , \" she says . \" Now you have all these gentrification pressures which are pushing people out . \" Pressures , she says , like a shrinking of the affordable rental stock with each renovation , higher rents and negligible vacancy rates in the hotels . As a result , unlike in the 1970s , homelessness must now be counted among the many problems afflicting the neighbourhood . Meanwhile , while the cost of living continues to rise , provincial welfare rates have not kept apace , falling in real terms from an inflation - adjusted $ 970 per month in 1981 to $ 610 today . \" People are literally starving , \" she says . \" It 's bad to have to resort to middle income people to tell your story about poverty , but when Jagrup Brar was living on $ 610 , he lost 26 pounds . \" Last winter , Raise the Rates , a coalition of anti-poverty groups also directed by Swanson , organized the \" MLA Welfare Challenge . \" Brar , the provincial legislator from Surrey , survived for one month solely on the B.C. welfare allowance to illustrate its insufficiency . Yet Swanson is able to summon some hope for the future of her neighbourhood , and for that she credits her colleagues . Colleagues like Wendy Pederson and Ivan Drury , but also Diane Wood , Robert Bonner and Fraser Stewart . These are the people she first proposed I interview in her place . \" Seeing that there are younger people coming up who can do the work now -- that 's the best part for me , \" Swanson says . Ivan Drury laughed as he predicted Swanson \" will hate \" to learn she 'd been voted an accolade by Tyee readers , even one as grassroots driven as the People 's Order of B.C. Recognition distracts from what Swanson thinks is more important and runs counter to her personality , he says . \" She hates to be recognized as important or significant . \" But Drury offers his own perspective . \" Jean is a hero in the Downtown Eastside , \" he explains . \" Jean is a hero now and she will be a hero no matter what it says in any media outlet . So it 's not so much that you can declare her a hero . But you can recognize what 's already common knowledge on the streets here . \"","annotations":[{"text":"lower income people","span":[5102,5120],"token_span":[1011,1013],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The living organism which requires the Support to survive."},{"text":"welfare","span":[7999,8005],"token_span":[1554,1554],"role":"Support","label":"Support","role_definition":"The resource that the Entity relies on to survive through a situation."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"Advocates for low- income DTES residents say this amount , which has not increased since 2007 , is not enough to live on .

Her voice on the phone is quiet , cautious , self-deprecating . A mainstay among anti-poverty activists in Vancouver who has spent 38 years sparring with property developers , SRO - managers and politicians , Swanson tells me that she 's reluctant to be interviewed . \" I 'm getting older and the folks that are doing the great work are younger , \" she says . \" It would be neat if you would profile them instead of me . \" She offers me a few phone numbers . Since the mid-1970s , Swanson has organized and advocated in the defence of Canada 's least defended -- all the while eschewing cultivation of her own celebrity . \" She 's very quiet , very focused on results , \" says Emily Mayne , who first met Swanson at a Raise the Rates meeting in the early 2000s before going on to work with her for the next eight years . As much disposition as principle , she says , Swanson has always preferred to \" step aside and let others take the limelight . \" Last fall , Swanson was one of five reader - nominated British Columbians to receive the People 's Order of B.C. , voted by Tyee readers . Mayne cast her vote for Swanson . She calls the choice a \" no brainer . \" \" People need to know what a valuable resource she is , \" says Mayne . \" You try to thank her and tell her how important she is , but she does n't want to hear it . It 's never been about her . She 's always working . Jean is out there everyday . \" ' Good work ' As Swanson recounts it , she fell into the world of activism and community organization over the course of an evening in 1974 . She was waitressing at the Patricia Hotel at the time , \" slinging beer \" to the regulars in the dingy ground floor pub of the East Hastings SRO . This was n't work she was particularly proud of . Her boss was constantly pressuring her to \" load up \" the tables -- aggressively topping up the customers to keep them plastered in their seats and running up a tab until last call . But pride in one 's job was n't something Swanson felt entitled to . The 31-year - old was just scraping by . Born in New York state , Swanson spent most of her childhood bumping around America 's West Coast . Her father , a mining prospector , was constantly shuffling his family around in search of work and Swanson recalls a lonely childhood . There were years , she says , when she was attending upwards of three schools per year . By the time she 'd moved to Canada and years later ended up working at the Patricia , Swanson was the mother of two daughters . One was born with a heart defect and Swanson knew she could n't afford the necessary medical coverage back in the U.S. She had no plans grander than meeting next month 's rent . Then one evening during Swanson 's shift , Bruce Eriksen and Libby Davies walked into the hotel bar . Swanson knew about Eriksen ; she 'd seen him on television , protesting safety conditions at hotels around the neighbourhood -- a neighbourhood that most everyone but he and his colleagues at the recently formed Downtown Eastside Residents ' Association ( DERA ) still called Skid Row . But Swanson had also received plenty of warning from her boss about DERA and its mercurial president . Loading up tables was a violation of provincial liquor law and Eriksen was known to report offenders . Swanson approached the couple to check Davies ' ID and the three got to talking . \" It seemed like he was doing good work , \" Swanson says now . \" I did n't know that that kind of work existed . I just knew that I had a rotten life and that it would be nice to do something that made sense . \" A few weeks later , Swanson spotted Eriksen eating lunch at the nearby Ovaltine Caf\u00e9 . In an act of brashness that she now calls \" one of the smartest things I ever did , \" she walked up to Eriksen 's table and asked for a job . A few weeks later , Swanson , who 'd been the editor of her high school newspaper over a decade earlier , started work at DERA 's monthly paper , the Downtown East . With , not for Swanson downplays her role at DERA . Putting together the paper now seems so antiquated . \" We were gluing down the columns with hot wax , \" she says , laughing . By all other accounts , Swanson was doing much more than operating a glue gun during the organization 's foundational years . As the best writer of the three , she assumed the role of DERA 's secretary , with Davies managing the funds and Eriksen soldiering on as front man and street organizer . On its face , the trio 's project seemed an unlikely one . In a neighbourhood that the rest of the city had written off , the mission of the residents ' association was to get the community politically engaged and advocating on its own behalf .

Its 463,000 square kilometres of land area , a sea area of 3.12 million square kilometres and 600 separate islands make up one of the most diverse repositories of geographic , biological , linguistic and cultural wealth on earth . PNG has more than 5 % of the world 's biodiversity in less than 1 % of the world 's total land area . Population PNG 's population in 2009 is estimated at 6.6 million and is growing by an annual average rate of 2.7 % ( 2000 Census ) . About 40 % of PNG 's total population is under 15 years old ( 2000 Census ) . Most of the population lives in rural communities based on the traditional village structure and dependent on subsistence farming supplemented by cash cropping . Around 13 % of the Papua New Guinea population lives in urban areas Economy PNG has a relatively small dual economy , made up of a formal and informal economy . The formal economy is dominated by large - scale resource projects , particularly in mining and petroleum , and provides a large proportion of government revenue . The informal economy supports 85 % of the people through semi-subsistence agriculture . The formal sector employs around 15 % of the workforce . PNG has an abundance of natural resources including : Despite the potential of these resources , PNG 's economic performance has fallen short of expectations . Following a relatively stable macroeconomic performance in the first decade after independence , PNG experienced a series of macroeconomic crises in the 1990s . PNG is currently experiencing an economic recovery , with improvements in several macroeconomic indicators . The PNG economy returned to growth in 2003 after several years of decline , with economic growth of 6.5 per cent in 2007 and 6.6 per cent in 2008 . Inflation , after increasing to over 10 % in 2008 , is expected to decline to 6.2 % in 2009 . Interest rates are also expected to reduce in 2009 . Foreign reserves are at comfortable levels . The improvement in macroeconomic performance has not , however , translated into improved service delivery . PNG continues to face considerable medium- term economic challenges . Concerns include degraded infrastructure , law and order problems and a weakly performing public service . Social indicators PNG struggles to translate strong economic growth and political stability into improved development outcomes , and it remains unlikely that PNG will achieve any of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 . PNG 's population suffered significant declines in living standards during the years of poor economic performance . Although the country does not exhibit the widespread abject poverty present in some developing countries , poor health and social indicators show that poverty is a serious problem . While PNG 's main social indicators , such as life expectancy and maternal and child mortality rates , have improved since 1975 , they are still well below the averages for lower middle income countries . Primary health care provision is limited . Infectious diseases claim many lives ; there are serious public health risks from endemic diseases such as malaria , and an emerging HIV / AIDS epidemic . An estimated 2.56 % of adults in PNG carry the HIV / AIDS virus . In education , the rate of participation in primary schooling is improving , but it remains low and below that of most other countries in the region .

Its 463,000 square kilometres of land area , a sea area of 3.12 million square kilometres and 600 separate islands make up one of the most diverse repositories of geographic , biological , linguistic and cultural wealth on earth . PNG has more than 5 % of the world 's biodiversity in less than 1 % of the world 's total land area . Population PNG 's population in 2009 is estimated at 6.6 million and is growing by an annual average rate of 2.7 % ( 2000 Census ) . About 40 % of PNG 's total population is under 15 years old ( 2000 Census ) . Most of the population lives in rural communities based on the traditional village structure and dependent on subsistence farming supplemented by cash cropping . Around 13 % of the Papua New Guinea population lives in urban areas Economy PNG has a relatively small dual economy , made up of a formal and informal economy . The formal economy is dominated by large - scale resource projects , particularly in mining and petroleum , and provides a large proportion of government revenue . The informal economy supports 85 % of the people through semi-subsistence agriculture . The formal sector employs around 15 % of the workforce . PNG has an abundance of natural resources including : Despite the potential of these resources , PNG 's economic performance has fallen short of expectations . Following a relatively stable macroeconomic performance in the first decade after independence , PNG experienced a series of macroeconomic crises in the 1990s . PNG is currently experiencing an economic recovery , with improvements in several macroeconomic indicators . The PNG economy returned to growth in 2003 after several years of decline , with economic growth of 6.5 per cent in 2007 and 6.6 per cent in 2008 . Inflation , after increasing to over 10 % in 2008 , is expected to decline to 6.2 % in 2009 . Interest rates are also expected to reduce in 2009 . Foreign reserves are at comfortable levels . The improvement in macroeconomic performance has not , however , translated into improved service delivery . PNG continues to face considerable medium- term economic challenges . Concerns include degraded infrastructure , law and order problems and a weakly performing public service . Social indicators PNG struggles to translate strong economic growth and political stability into improved development outcomes , and it remains unlikely that PNG will achieve any of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 . PNG 's population suffered significant declines in living standards during the years of poor economic performance . Although the country does not exhibit the widespread abject poverty present in some developing countries , poor health and social indicators show that poverty is a serious problem . While PNG 's main social indicators , such as life expectancy and maternal and child mortality rates , have improved since 1975 , they are still well below the averages for lower middle income countries . Primary health care provision is limited . Infectious diseases claim many lives ; there are serious public health risks from endemic diseases such as malaria , and an emerging HIV / AIDS epidemic . An estimated 2.56 % of adults in PNG carry the HIV / AIDS virus . In education , the rate of participation in primary schooling is improving , but it remains low and below that of most other countries in the region .

Officials wondered whether Trump should record a dramatic video message congratulating the Iranian people on their new year . The twist ? Trump would appear alongside an Iranian royal who lives quietly in the Washington area : Reza Pahlavi , the exiled son of the country 's late shah , the U.S. - allied leader toppled during Iran 's 1979 Islamic revolution . The NSC officials decided against the idea , which was described by two people familiar with the episode , and Trump instead issued a traditional statement of goodwill for the Iranian holiday , known as Now - Ruz . At the time , pairing Trump with Pahlavi might have struck many Iran - watchers in the U.S. as an absurd idea . Pahlavi 's father was a deeply unpopular figure in Iran when he was overthrown , and his close ties to Washington was a particular source of anger at the time . Two years later , however , Iran analysts say Pahlavi 's credibility within the country has grown as Trump has imposed harsh sanctions which some believe are meant to bring down its clerical government \u2014 begging the question of who would lead Iran if that happens . In a sign that he welcomes the higher visibility , Pahlavi made a rare public appearance on Friday , giving a talk at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy . He called for non-military actions in support of Iranians trying to replace the Islamist regime with a secular democracy . \u201c Democratic countries today , America perhaps the most important one of them , can decide whose side they 're on , \u201d Pahlavi said , urging these countries to \u201c talk to the people who are your natural allies . \u201d Pahlavi 's family is enjoying something of a comeback in Iran nearly 40 years after they were forced out . Iranian protesters are chanting apologies to the royal clan , who ruled for 54 years . Satellite TV stations that manage to evade Iran 's censors are celebrating the monarchy 's pre-revolutionary heyday , which many Iranians are too young to remember . Some Iranians are even treating the possible discovery of Pahlavi 's grandfather 's body earlier this year as an omen of his family 's return to power . \u201c There 's a nostalgia for the monarchy because people view it as a better time , \u201d said Alireza Nader , founder of the New Iran Foundation , a research group . \u201c There are signs of genuine support for Pahlavi , and he can capitalize on it . \u201d The Iranian regime and its supporters essentially dismiss him as a corrupt wannabe with little support in Iran , while spreading allegations that he is funded by Saudi and Israeli money . Pahlavi denies those allegations . Pahlavi , who is 58 , is not openly calling for the restoration of the Peacock Throne to Iran . His official biography describes him instead as \u201c a leader and advocate of the principles of freedom , democracy and human rights for his countrymen . \u201d He casts himself more as a symbol than a politician , but has called himself \u201c ready to serve my country . \u201d He appears to have become a rallying point for a still - emerging movement within the Iranian opposition that is trying to go beyond the traditional divides . This movement dismisses both the hard - line and reformist factions in Iran as part of the same oppressive theocratic machinery . It also appears distinct from monarchist , communist and other groups that have sought the mantle of the opposition 's leadership over the years \u2014 including the once- militant Mujahedin-e- Khalq , or MEK . One newly established network representing this movement is Farashgard , or Iran Revival . In an open letter , the group says its goal is \u201c to overthrow the Islamic Republic and to establish in its place a secular democracy that safeguards each Iranian 's human rights . \u201d The group recognizes \u201c the key role that Prince Reza Pahlavi plays in connecting all segments of the Iranian society . \u201d It adds : \u201c In replacing the current regime with a democratic and secular state , his leadership and influence can facilitate a smooth transition and ensure peace , order , national unity and the territorial integrity of Iran . \u201d Pahlavi 's office did not respond to a question about the exact nature of his ties , if any , to Farashgard . The group did not reply to a request for comment sent to its main email account , but a member said Pahlavi is supportive of their effort . While a number of Trump 's advisers have well - paid links to the MEK \u2014 whose complicated history includes having been previously designated by the United States as a terrorist group \u2014 the extent of the administration 's ties to Pahlavi is not clear . A State Department official said only that top U.S. officials have \u201c met with many members of the Iranian diaspora . \u201d On Friday , Pahlavi said he had yet to meet with Trump officials \u2014 though he has previously spoken of reaching out Trump , including in a letter urging the U.S. president to \u201c bear in mind the aspiration of the Iranian people . \u201d Luckily for Pahlavi and his popularity , Trump appears intent on isolating , if not outright overthrowing , the regime in Iran . The Republican administration has pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal , imposed sanctions on Tehran and is pushing an information campaign against the country , calling out its clerical rulers for corruption and incompetence . It has made 12 demands of Iran that are so far - reaching that some experts say they are a disguised call for regime change . On Friday , Pahlavi was in sync with Trump administration talking points on Iran \u2014 denouncing the Islamist regime 's funding of proxy militias elsewhere in the Middle East , its role in the Syrian civil war , and its threats to Israel . \u201c Envision an Iran that works closely with its Arab neighbors to stamp out terrorism and extremism in the region , that welcomes Israeli scientists to help with its water crisis , that embraces American and European investment in the boundless potential of its economy , \u201d he said . But he expressed impatience that at the Trump administration 's insistence that it only wants to change Iran 's behavior , not its government . \u201c You cannot come and say we support the Iranian people but we do n't want regime change , \u201d he said . \u201c How the hell do you want us to get to democracy while this regime is still in place ? \u201d Unrest inside Iran has galvanized people in both the Trump administration and the pro-Pahlavi crowd . The dissension has taken several forms , including labor protests that some opposition activists hope can morph into something more coherent over time . Many of the protests took place in December 2017 and January 2018 , but there are still reports of occasional demonstrations . Some protesters have approvingly shouted the one - time crown prince 's name , while some have invoked the defunct monarchy while yelling , \u201c We are sorry . \u201d In one video , demonstrators shouted : \u201c Iran without a shah has no accountability ! \u201d Some protesters also praised Pahlavi 's grandfather , Reza Shah , who remains a respected figure in Iran for many of the modernizing reforms he introduced . Earlier this year , a well - preserved body possibly belonging to Reza Shah was discovered near the mausoleum where he had been buried . The tomb was destroyed after the revolution as Islamists tried to erase Iran 's monarchical history . The body 's discovery had some Iranians thinking it was a sign . \u201c We Iranians are superstitious , and I personally believe his return is a message , \u201d an Iranian merchant told The New York Times . Some of the royal nostalgia in Iran is driven by satellite channels beamed into the country and popular among many of its 80 million people . One in particular , named Manoto ( \u201c me and you \u201d ) has a distinctive pro-Pahlavi bent . The London - based channel , launched in 2010 , produces programming that often casts the era of the shah as a glorious , freer time . Thanks to its use of archival Iranian footage , the programs show an Iran where women went unveiled and the country was more accepted by the international community . The pro-Pahlavi crowd often avoids discussion of the unsavory aspects of the monarchy : the terror perpetuated by the shah 's secret police , the frustration of the poor as they watched the royals flaunt their wealth , the anger of devout Muslims at a leader they deemed intoxicated by the West . \u201c If Reza Pahlavi wants to be a leader on the basis of his family ties , he first needs to address the dark sides and the repression of his father and grandfather 's era , \u201d said Negar Mortazavi , an Iranian - American journalist and political commentator . Other Iran observers note that the Middle East has not always been well - served by its exiles , with Ahmed Chalabi , the Iraqi who pressed the U.S. to invade Iraq , often cited as the prime example . ( Pahlavi is not advocating for such an approach . ) The Iranian opposition , meanwhile , remains notoriously fragmented . Still , \u201c if you 're an Iranian who believes that meaningful reform of the Islamic Republic has proven an exercise in futility over the last 40 years , then you naturally begin to look for leaders outside the system , \u201d said Karim Sadjadpour , an Iran specialist with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . Anecdotes aside , it 's impossible to gauge how widespread support for the royals truly is inside Iran , where the government stifles freedom of speech and opinion polls are not reliable . Much of the pro-Pahlavi conversation is driven by Iranians who left the country in recent years utterly disillusioned with the reformist versus hard - liner dichotomy that has long characterized the framing of Iranian politics . The timing for Pahlavi is also fortuitous given Trump 's hostility toward Iran 's government . \u201c He is just kind of the man of the moment , and the moment suits for an ambiguous figure who might have appeal across various political strata , \u201d said Suzanne Maloney , an Iran analyst with the Brookings Institution . Pahlavi was in the United States for jet-fighter training in the late 1970s when a popular movement of many strains threatened the rule of his father , Mohammad Reza Shah . The shah was dying of cancer when President Jimmy Carter admitted him into the U.S. for medical treatment , further inflaming anti-U.S. sentiment among Iranian revolutionaries . The shah died in 1980 in Egypt , where he is buried , and the young prince declared himself Iran 's new ruler : Reza Shah II . It was not to be . In the 40 years since , Reza Pahlavi has lived mainly in the United States , his profile waxing and waning depending on a variety of factors , including his own willingness to speak out and the position of the U.S. government toward Iran . In a 1989 profile , The Washington Post cast Pahlavi as a young man with vague notions about the role he should play , an ambiguity that still has n't fully receded . He has \u201c lived in a suspended animation of the kind that pretenders to thrones must feel even while much of the world considers their pretensions laughable , \u201d the Post wrote . \u201c I 'm not in this for monarchy . I 'm in this for the freedom of my countrymen and for popular sovereignty , \u201d he told the Post . Pahlavi , who earned a degree in political science from the University of Southern California , has studied and supports nonviolent civil disobedience movements , viewing leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi as role models . He is thought to live mainly on what 's left of his family wealth , his only full - time job being speaking out about Iran . Pahlavi 's wife , Yasmine , recently went public about her battle with breast cancer , drawing many messages of support but also questions about whether she was trying to aid her husband politically . The couple has three daughters . Over the past four decades , Pahlavi has never fully faded from the public eye , writing books and keeping in touch with foreign officials across the world . He kept a relatively low profile during President Barack Obama 's nuclear talks with Iran , and offered guarded support for the deal Obama struck with Tehran lifting sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran 's nuclear program . Shortly after Trump was inaugurated , Pahlavi gave an interview to Breitbart News , a conservative news outlet linked to one of Trump 's advisers . It signaled that Pahlavi would be more outspoken . Pahlavi stressed to Breitbart that the fate of Iran must rest in the hands of its people . \u201c The day that we have free elections will be the day I will consider my political mission in life accomplished , \u201d he said . \u201c From that day on , I cannot tell you now what the circumstances will be . I 've always said that I 'm ready to serve my country , in whatever capacity that my constituents choose . \u201d Asked Friday , if he would run for office in a democratic Iran if the opportunity arose , he insisted he 's not even thinking about the possibility . His focus , he said , is on \u201c the liberation of Iran at the hand of the Iranian people . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"Reza Pahlavi","span":[10613,10624],"token_span":[1942,1943],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The living organism which requires the Support to survive."},{"text":"on what 's left of his family wealth","span":[11579,11614],"token_span":[2123,2130],"role":"Support","label":"Support","role_definition":"The resource that the Entity relies on to survive through a situation."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"In 2017 , he told the Associated Press that since 1979 he had had no \" side occupation \" ( with regard to political activities ) , adding that his money came from his family and \" many Iranians who have supported the cause \" .

The young lad with a bomb strapped around his waist waited while the Israeli army brought in a bomb disposal robot ; he waited while a phalanx of photographers assembled ; for an Israeli major from the public relations department and for some sharp scissors . Frightened out of the few wits he had to start with , the boy struggled to turn the suicide bomber 's belt around and to cut himself out - all the while complaining that he did not want to die , he did not want to set the bomb off . Freed of the deadly device , he was whisked away , interrogated for four hours , allowed to call his mother and brought back to the assembled photographers dressed in an outsized Israeli army jacket . ' I wanted to be a hero , ' he told an Israeli radio station . The incident has already gone down as one of the iconic moments of the al - Aqsa intifada . Husam 's televised saga now joins the infamous death of Mohammed al - Dura , whose last moment during a gun battle between Palestinians and Israelis in Gaza was filmed on 30 September , 2000 , day three of the Palestinian uprising , and the equally widely televised lynching of two Israeli soldiers in Ramallah a few weeks later , as one of the most replayed moments of conflict . But whereas the killing of Mohammed and the lynching of the soldiers had a tragic logic which reflected the white heat of rage of the early days of the uprising , Husam 's story was merely tragicomic , its absurdity a reflection of the horrific hall of mirrors that life has become for Palestinians and Israelis . Husam , the Israeli army claimed , was 12 , not 14 . In the end he turned out to have been born on 5 December , 1987 . He is 16 but is small . In fact , his extended family is badly affected by dwarfism . Neighbours gathered around their flat on a hillside in Nablus were doing their best to be polite , but ' some members of the family are not , er , shall we say , not very good at learning ' , as one friend put it . Husam 's brother Hosni , 20 , tall and good - looking , was blunt . ' Husam 's got problems at school , he 's a bit backward and very disobedient . His head was bashed in a car accident when he was six and that has affected him . ' So much so that the muscular Husam attacked his headmaster a couple of weeks ago and was locked up in a police station to cool off . When he emerged , he was withdrawn for several days . ' He did n't spend much time in his father 's shop any more . He seemed a bit depressed and went into himself . For two days we saw very little of him , he came and went mysteriously , ' said Moyad Arysha , 23 , who lived near by . Husam and his family had been the butt of jokes about dwarves . At school he was teased and called the village idiot . Under an Israeli occupation in which dignity for any Palestinian is hard to come by , Husam had none . He was easy prey for whoever persuaded him to become a suicide bomber with a belt allegedly packed with 8kg of explosive and nails . He was not devout . He was not the relative of a ' martyr ' slain by the Israelis . Husam had not been recruited because of his conviction . He was a bit of a loser , a messed - up adolescent in search of respect and fame among his peers . The day after his arrest , Taysir Nasrallah , the Nablus head of Fatah , Yasser Arafat 's party , was sitting in his office fielding calls from the Palestinian Authority 's intelligence officers . ' We 're trying to find out who gave this boy the bomb , ' he said . ' When we do , they will be killed . They are collaborators with the Israelis . Only a collaborator would do such a thing . Giving children bombs makes us look like barbarians , it destroys our cause in the outside world . I 've been in touch with our brigades [ fighting units behind attacks on Israeli troops and suicide bombings of civilians ] , who say they know nothing about this boy . I think it 's the Israelis . ' It stretches fantasy to believe Husam could have been the victim of an Israeli ' dirty tricks ' operation . Israeli agents might have planted a non-bomb on the boy to make the Palestinians look bad , but on the West Bank and in Gaza children have been abused by both sides . Israeli soldiers have shown no hesitation in killing demonstrators as young as eight . I have seen children shot in the head , neck and testicles . But a Palestinian extremist group could have taken Husam aside and offered him a once - in- a- lifetime opportunity to make something of his miserable life . Israeli security forces have stopped dozens of teenagers on suicide operations . One 16-year- old from Bethlehem was bullied into turning himself into a human bomb two years ago - the teenage girl he was with refused to blow herself up and described how he had been browbeaten into killing himself and others . That operation was run by the al - Aqsa Martyrs - Fatah 's armed wing . Yesterday six-year- old Khaled Walwil was shot in the neck and killed in the Balata refugee camp about a mile from the checkpoint where Husam was caught . Israel says a Palestinian killed him . The child 's family say that he was hit by sniper fire from an Israeli position . Few conspiracy theories are incredible , few depths unplumbed . Children on both sides have borne the brunt of a conflict which has mutilated their unformed minds . Two days before he went to what he believed would be his death , Husam was in need of affection . ' He kept asking us if we loved him and if we would miss him if he went travelling . He said he wanted to go away , ' said Moyad . His mother , Tamam , said he had kissed her hands and told her she would be very proud of him . ' He was always babbling and talking , so I did n't think much of it . But I want whoever gave this boy a bomb to be arrested . They 're sick . ' The malaise that sent a troubled teenager who clearly did not want to die a shaheed ( martyr ) to kill a handful of Israelis seems to have infected the body politic on both sides of the Green Line . Earlier in the week the spiritual leader of Hamas , Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , was blown to pieces by a US - built Hellfire anti-tank missile fired from a US - built Israeli helicopter as he was being pushed the short distance home from his mosque . The ' targeted killing ' was the latest in scores of extra-judicial assassinations carried out by Israel 's armed forces over the past two years . But this one was different . The decision to kill Yassin had been taken at cabinet level . Ariel Sharon , the Israeli Prime Minister , launched a policy of ' decapitating ' organisations behind terror attacks against Israel . Although Yassin was almost blind , a quadriplegic , and barely able to breathe or speak , he was deemed to be the evil mastermind of the hundreds of Hamas attacks against Israelis . About 200,000 mourners marched through Gaza , pledging revenge . The gates of hell , said his successor , Abdel Aziz Rantisi , had been opened . As the leadership of Hamas warned Sharon himself would be killed , the Israelis insisted Rantisi was a marked man living on borrowed time and that Sharon might decide to knock off Arafat , if he felt like it . Ordinary Israelis were terrified . Even if about 60 per cent thought Yassin had it coming , they stayed off the streets and buses and out of restaurants last week waiting for what is seen as an inevitable Hamas response . The only controversy among the Israelis is whether it was wise to kill Yassin because of the danger of a counter -attack . The military brass believe he should have been only one of a slew of killings of Hamas leaders to break the back of the organisation , which has been growing in strength in Gaza . Rantisi and other militant leaders have gained an upper hand throughout the intifada as the influence of , and respect for , Arafat has waned on the street . In Nablus , Nasrallah said support for Arafat 's Palestinian Authority , would 'only improve if Arafat is gone ' . Another Fatah official said he wanted Arafat not to die at the hands of the Israelis , because that would make him a hero : ' He should waste away from diarrhoea . ' Now that Yassin is dead , there are few , if any , Palestinians who appear capable of embodying their struggle against the Israelis . On the other side of the Green Line , the situation is much the same and a bloodied people take refuge in the absolutes of extremism . If body - piercing is any guide to political allegiance , you might expect the patrons of the Dragon tattoo parlour in Tel Aviv 's Sheinkin Street to affect support for Israel 's moderate ' Left ' - for the idea that a negotiated peace can , and should , be achieved . ' It 's hopeless , utterly hopeless . The Arabs want to drive us into the sea [ Hamas 's stated policy ] and they want us dead , ' said Lori Halevy , who was waiting to have a metal pin inserted through her genitals . ' We 're not going anywhere . It 's a fight to the death . We all used to believe in peace around here , this is our little San Francisco , but we 've all become hardliners , real hardliners - or we 're leaving . ' Sharon is being investigated for fraud and allegedly taking bribes . The death toll of Israelis is close to 1,000 since September 2000 when he sparked the intifada by touring the al - Aqsa Mosque site revered by Jews as the Temple Mount . And he is vague about strategy . So much so that the right - wing Jerusalem Post newspaper in its Friday editorial said Yassin 's killing ' having come as an isolated shot followed by nothing more than deep entrenchment in expectation of retaliatory response , only intensified an already strong suspicion that Sharon 's moves are not part of a broad - based and long - term plan , but a series of shots from the hip . The situation , not to mention history , demands a lot more than that , ' the paper thundered . If Sharon is shooting from the hip , Israel 's Left is simply floundering . Efforts led by Yossi Beilin , a former Labour Party Justice Minister , to renew the peace process begun in Oslo a decade ago have failed to catch fire . The 18-30 crowd , who were the party 's natural constituency , voted for Labour in such small numbers in elections last year that they were recorded at zero . Other old - school left-wingers , feeling the walls of a dark and hopeless tunnel , have revived the idea that Israel / Palestine could become a bi-national state , a democracy for all groups inside one border . But that would end the definition of Israel as a Jewish state and shift the conflict from the battlefield to the bedroom - Arabs are outbreeding Jews so fast that west of the Jordan river they will be in a majority within a couple of decades . ' We have gangsters in government and vendetta is the name of the game - we 're just stuck in the middle of this whole mess , ' said Professor Amiram Goldblum , a founder of Israel 's peace movement . ' Israel is looking at another 10 or 20 years of right - wing government and that is that . Sharon will double - cross the bridge when he gets there . ' The Israeli Prime Minister has refused to negotiate with Arafat . He had plans to meet Ahmed Qureia , the Palestinian Prime Minister , but a double suicide attack by Hamas , which killed 11 in Ashdod two weeks ago , blew away any chance of diplomatic movement . But if Sharon 's strategy is opaque , the former major-general 's tactics are little clearer . He has said that he would pull his troops out of the Gaza Strip , where they protect about 6,000 Jews living on 40 per cent of the land surrounded by about 1.1 million Palestinians . The killing of Yassin has been seen as a sign he wants to conduct the pullout from a position of strength . Last week he sent Dov Weisglass , his cabinet enforcer , to Washington to try to secure US backing for a withdrawal from Gaza in return for US recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the illegal West Bank Jewish settlement towns of Maale Adumim , Gush Etzion ( both now suburbs of Jerusalem ) and Ariel . The mission failed , but provides some clues to Sharon 's agenda . Combined with the continued construction of the internationally condemned ' security wall ' separating the West Bank from Israel , Sharon 's critics believe they can see him carving what he wants for Israel out of the West Bank and leaving the Palestinians with the messy remains , blotched with heavily guarded Jewish settlements controlling the roads and the water . But Sharon is not immune to the self - destructive logic which drove Husam to think he could enjoy the benefits of fame while dead . The Israeli Prime Minister , who is driving unilateral withdrawal from Gaza forward , also introduced a Bill in the Knesset which would , if passed , have made this vision very hard to achieve . He voted in favour of the Bill requiring the Israeli legislature to approve the dismantling of any settlement - all are illegal under international law . The Bill failed , leaving Sharon free to carry on with his policies . \u00b7 Sam Kiley is a reporter for Channel 4's Dispatches programme .","annotations":[{"text":"the al - Aqsa intifada","span":[1055,1076],"token_span":[209,213],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the Assailant attacks the Victim."},{"text":"in Gaza","span":[1229,1235],"token_span":[241,242],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the place where the Assailant makes an assault on the Victim."},{"text":"Israelis","span":[1764,1771],"token_span":[340,340],"role":"Victim","label":"Victim","role_definition":"This Victim is the being or entity that is injured by the Assailant's suicide attack."},{"text":"children","span":[3838,3845],"token_span":[782,782],"role":"Assailant","label":"Assailant","role_definition":"The person (or other self-directed entity) that is attempting physical harm to the Victim."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"According to the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group , in the al - Aqsa Intifada , children were used as \" messengers and couriers , and in some cases as fighters and suicide bombers in attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians \" during the al - Aqsa Intifada .","annotations":[{"text":"Israeli soldiers and civilians","span":[203,232],"token_span":[37,40],"role":"Victim","label":"Victim","role_definition":"This Victim is the being or entity that is injured by the Assailant's suicide attack."},{"text":"children","span":[89,96],"token_span":[16,16],"role":"Assailant","label":"Assailant","role_definition":"The person (or other self-directed entity) that is attempting physical harm to the Victim."},{"text":"during the al - Aqsa Intifada","span":[236,264],"token_span":[42,47],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the Assailant attacks the Victim."}],"trigger":{"text":"suicide bombers","start_char":173,"end_char":187,"start_token":32,"end_token":33,"frame":"Suicide_attack"}},"source":{"text":"Husam Abdo stood alone in the middle of the road with half - a- dozen Israeli paratroopers staring down the sights of their assault rifles at him , shouting orders to keep still , put his hands on his head and , above all , wait .

January 31 , 2013 , marks the date for compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act ( \u201c ADA \u201d ) 2010 Standards for Accessible Design related to installing fixed pool lifts for swimming pools , wading pools and spas . Though the Department of Justice ( \u201c DOJ \u201d ) previously changed its hard deadline for compliance with the installation requirements from March 15 , 2012 , to January 31 , 2013 , entities covered by Title III of the ADA should not rely on any more extensions . If complying with the new ADA requirements fell off the to -do list , it 's time for businesses to start planning . Here are a few questions to ask when understanding how these rules could affect your business : Is your business a Title III entity ? Whether your business even has to worry about the fixed pool lift requirements depends on whether you are a Title III entity . Title III prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by places of public accommodation , including many private businesses , and the rules place accessibility requirements on such businesses . Title III entities are businesses such as a hotel and motel , health club , recreation center , public country club or other businesses that have swimming pools , wading pools and spas . If your business falls under that category , the 2010 Standards apply . What is this pool lift requirement ? The 2010 Standards require that newly constructed or altered swimming pools , wading pools , and spas have an accessible means of entrance and exit to pools for those people with disabilities , as defined by the ADA . However , providing accessibility is conditioned on whether providing access through a fixed lift is \u201c readily achievable . \u201d The technical specifications for when a means of entry is accessible are available on the DOJ website . Other requirements are based on pool size and include providing a certain number of accessible means of entry and exit , which are outlined in Section 242 of the Standards . However , businesses should consider the differences in application of the rules depending on whether the pool is new or altered , or whether the swimming pool was in existence before the effective date of the new rule . Full compliance may not be required for existing facilities ; Sections 242 and 1009 of the 2010 Standards outline such rules and exceptions . What exactly is a \u201c fixed pool lift \u201d ? A fixed lift is one that is affixed to the pool deck or apron in some fashion . Conversely , a non- fixed lift is not affixed in any way . Many businesses with pools have purchased or own portable ( i.e. non - fixed ) pool lifts . If that portable lift is affixed to the pool deck , then it could be considered a fixed lift and compliant under the rules . Thus , owners of a portable lift may be able to comply with the ADA requirements by affixing lifts to the pool deck or apron . Moreover , owners of such portable lifts will be required to affix the lifts as a means of compliance if it is readily achievable . This exception for certain non-fixed lifts stemmed from confusion over the new regulations , spurring the DOJ to grant exceptions to certain entities that purchased an otherwise compliant non- fixed lift before March 15 , 2012 . Those exceptions may apply only if non- fixed lifts comply with the 2010 Standards and if the owners keep the portable lifts in position for use at the pool and operational during all times that the pool is open to guests . What is the \u201c readily achievable \u201d standard ? The ADA does not require providing access to existing pools through a fixed lift if it is not \u201c readily achievable \u201d , meaning that providing access is easily accomplishable without much difficulty or expense . The DOJ has specified that this standard is a flexible , case by case analysis , so that the ADA requirements are not unduly burdensome . However , businesses cannot simply claim that installing a fixed pool lift is not readily achievable . Rather , factors such as the nature and cost , the overall financial resources of the business and the effect on expenses and resources are all considered and evaluated when determining the application of the standard . For some businesses immediate compliance may seem impossible because of , for example , the backorder on pool lifts . Nonetheless , businesses are still obligated to comply with the requirements of the 2010 Standards through other means , as specified in the Standards . Should your business shut the pool down if you have n't complied ? If accessibility is not readily achievable , businesses should develop plans for providing access into the pool when it becomes readily achievable in the future . Businesses that are worried about their current status of compliance should consult with legal counsel or call the ADA Information Line to speak with an ADA Specialist regarding any compliance questions .

January 31 , 2013 , marks the date for compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act ( \u201c ADA \u201d ) 2010 Standards for Accessible Design related to installing fixed pool lifts for swimming pools , wading pools and spas . Though the Department of Justice ( \u201c DOJ \u201d ) previously changed its hard deadline for compliance with the installation requirements from March 15 , 2012 , to January 31 , 2013 , entities covered by Title III of the ADA should not rely on any more extensions . If complying with the new ADA requirements fell off the to -do list , it 's time for businesses to start planning . Here are a few questions to ask when understanding how these rules could affect your business : Is your business a Title III entity ? Whether your business even has to worry about the fixed pool lift requirements depends on whether you are a Title III entity . Title III prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by places of public accommodation , including many private businesses , and the rules place accessibility requirements on such businesses . Title III entities are businesses such as a hotel and motel , health club , recreation center , public country club or other businesses that have swimming pools , wading pools and spas . If your business falls under that category , the 2010 Standards apply . What is this pool lift requirement ? The 2010 Standards require that newly constructed or altered swimming pools , wading pools , and spas have an accessible means of entrance and exit to pools for those people with disabilities , as defined by the ADA . However , providing accessibility is conditioned on whether providing access through a fixed lift is \u201c readily achievable . \u201d The technical specifications for when a means of entry is accessible are available on the DOJ website . Other requirements are based on pool size and include providing a certain number of accessible means of entry and exit , which are outlined in Section 242 of the Standards . However , businesses should consider the differences in application of the rules depending on whether the pool is new or altered , or whether the swimming pool was in existence before the effective date of the new rule . Full compliance may not be required for existing facilities ; Sections 242 and 1009 of the 2010 Standards outline such rules and exceptions . What exactly is a \u201c fixed pool lift \u201d ? A fixed lift is one that is affixed to the pool deck or apron in some fashion . Conversely , a non- fixed lift is not affixed in any way . Many businesses with pools have purchased or own portable ( i.e. non - fixed ) pool lifts . If that portable lift is affixed to the pool deck , then it could be considered a fixed lift and compliant under the rules . Thus , owners of a portable lift may be able to comply with the ADA requirements by affixing lifts to the pool deck or apron . Moreover , owners of such portable lifts will be required to affix the lifts as a means of compliance if it is readily achievable . This exception for certain non-fixed lifts stemmed from confusion over the new regulations , spurring the DOJ to grant exceptions to certain entities that purchased an otherwise compliant non- fixed lift before March 15 , 2012 . Those exceptions may apply only if non- fixed lifts comply with the 2010 Standards and if the owners keep the portable lifts in position for use at the pool and operational during all times that the pool is open to guests . What is the \u201c readily achievable \u201d standard ? The ADA does not require providing access to existing pools through a fixed lift if it is not \u201c readily achievable \u201d , meaning that providing access is easily accomplishable without much difficulty or expense . The DOJ has specified that this standard is a flexible , case by case analysis , so that the ADA requirements are not unduly burdensome . However , businesses cannot simply claim that installing a fixed pool lift is not readily achievable . Rather , factors such as the nature and cost , the overall financial resources of the business and the effect on expenses and resources are all considered and evaluated when determining the application of the standard . For some businesses immediate compliance may seem impossible because of , for example , the backorder on pool lifts . Nonetheless , businesses are still obligated to comply with the requirements of the 2010 Standards through other means , as specified in the Standards . Should your business shut the pool down if you have n't complied ? If accessibility is not readily achievable , businesses should develop plans for providing access into the pool when it becomes readily achievable in the future . Businesses that are worried about their current status of compliance should consult with legal counsel or call the ADA Information Line to speak with an ADA Specialist regarding any compliance questions . Though compliance with the pool lift requirements may seem onerous , it is necessary to prevent legal and financial liability on the part of a Title III covered business . These requirements also potentially produce tax benefits under the IRS Code , insurance premiums , ongoing maintenance and accessibility costs and obligations and staff training requirements , all of which are reasons to take compliance seriously .

A strong push on Letters of Intent ( 222 ) and options pushed the total number to 1,364 , a number that has n't been surpassed since the Paris 2013 show . As the chart below indicates , the trend of oil price and airshow orders broadly continues . However the mix within the different sectors is disordered . According to Dr Stuart Hatcher , COO at IBA , one of the first visible changes that the firm continues to see is that the number of actual firm orders only , continues to remain very low . \u201c This has been a constant trend over the previous four years , whilst commitments continue to grow . It may not be surprising when we consider the overall backlog has been steadily growing and we had tipped 15,600 for firm orders back at the start of June . Book - to - bill ratios have been so high in general that orders have generally been surpassing deliveries on average by 1,126 units since 2012 \u201d . Hatcher continues \u201c This mid-term correlation to oil seems uncanny , but we must avoid falling into the trap of a potential coincidental relationship . Low oil generally means better profits for the airlines . This in turn has tended to push airlines into buying aircraft , but ultimately traffic demand is what drives airlines to order in a sustained way . Of course , replacement technology is fuelled by efficiency but consumer demand must be there . \u201d As IBA explores this further it notes that another key aspect of the airshows every year is the release of the OEM forecasts . Looking back 15 - 20 years , these have been fairly conservative on narrow - body market growth . Unsurprisingly this year more conservative estimates were announced on the annual traffic growth rate for the industry , which still does not appear to be coming down from the +6 % levels that have been witnessed since early 2013 . Mike Yeomans , head of valuations at IBA , says , \u201c Both Boeing and Airbus have gone for a level ~ 2 % lower than the current rate at 4.7 % and 4.4 % , respectively . We appreciate that this factors in the potential for at least two recession periods . To account for the higher Boeing forecast , there is a larger expectation on the delivery forecast with 42,730 aircraft , whilst Airbus predicts 37,390 . The strength of the economy , the propensity to fly , increasing private consumption , replacement need in the face of rising fuel costs , burgeoning middle classes , and globalization all considered to be the driving forces . \u201d In terms of orders Boeing surpassed Airbus by a narrow margin . The result for Boeing would have been higher if IBA counted the orders already previously announced \u2013 such as jet Airways ' 75 or Jackson Square 's 30 . The orderbook for Boeing was filled with MAX commitments with a few 787s and 777-300ERs as predicted . A welcome appearance of freighter orders shows that Boeing remains the leader in the widebody freighter sector . From Airbus , A320neos , A330neos and A350s ( including some 1000s ) comprised the airshow order book and around 30 % of the narrowbody sector was taken by the A321neo , whilst the MAX 10 only garnered < 19 % of the MAX backlog from the identifiable ones . Yeomans found the lessors were keeping purse strings tight . \u201c In contrast to last year , only 23.9 % of the firm / MoU order book was taken by lessors compared to the 47.2 % last year , and half of the long - term rolling average . This did surprise IBA somewhat given that the sale leaseback market margins remain so tight , and we were expecting some across - the - board top - up for most of the largest lessors . Despite this result , the lessor backlog does continue to hold well at ~ 3,000 units still , which is close to 19 % of the overall backlog . ALC led the way with 78 firm / MoUs for MAXs and 787s , there were two orders from Goshawk for 20 Airbus A320neos and 20 Boeing 737 MAXs , and similarly a 20 Airbus A320 neo order for Macquarie and a 20 Boeing 737 MAX order for ACG . \u201d In terms of order spread amongst the sectors , there were n't many surprises this year , with narrow - bodies taking 814 firm / MoU orders ( 81.7 % ) at the show , and widebodies getting a small uptick at 134 ( 13.5 % ) . When IBA looks specifically at narrowbody order performance at the 2018 Farnborough show , the neos and MAXs dominate with 330 and 424 respectively , with the added bonus of the newly branded A220 - 300 . On the widebody side , a surprise appearance this year was a small order for some 747 Fs , signalling the growth in the heavy freight market . The 777 freighter orders highlight that too . \u201c The widebody is understandably tracking closer to oil price as fuel economics play a key role in this sector \u201d , says Hatcher . \u201c But the market is still reticent to make too many inroads into the larger widebody space just yet . It was encouraging to see a few A350 - 1000s enter the fray early on in Farnborough week . It is five years since the A380 was ordered at one of the summer airshows . This was a 20 aircraft MoU by Doric , which was taken on by Amedeo . However , even as traffic increases , and slot and pilot shortages play their part in driving the need for larger and larger aircraft , the market still shies away from the largest passenger plane . \u201d According to IBA the regional market has taken a positive shift with a total of 217 regional aircraft commitments received , comprising firm orders , MoUs and LoIs . If Options are included , this number rises to 342 aircraft . Of these total commitments , the vast majority are for regional jets , which accounted for around 17 % of the total firm orders , MoUs and LoIs received during the four days of the show . New regional aircraft demand has been at a low point over the past three years and a number of factors have contributed to this , says Yeomans . \u201c As oil costs have fallen , so has demand for turboprops . Over-ordering by lessors , over- production by OEMs , secondary market oversupply , low fuel and airline failures have all driven weakness in the turboprop market , and we have seen few orders for aircraft in this market segment since 2015 . However ATR released its market forecast earlier in July , indicating that a further 3,000 turboprop deliveries will occur over the next 20 years , 80 % of which will be serviced by the 61 - 80 seat category aircraft . \u201d IBA considers there has been pent - up demand for regional aircraft , particularly over the past 12 months , as potential customers have waited to see how Airbus and the CSeries , and a Boeing / Embraer connection would play out . The recent announcement that Boeing will take control of Embraer 's commercial aircraft division has been met with a wave of demand for new Embraer aircraft at Farnborough 2018 . The following IBA .iQ chart shows the recent trend in regional aircraft orders against oil price , which has been adjusted to include LoIs . Of the few turboprop orders placed , MoUs were signed for seven aircraft by two customers : Hokkaido Air System ( Japan ) and EasyFly ( Columbia ) . A number of commitments were made on the previous Friday ( 13th July ) . These totalled 10 aircraft , all of which were ATRs . No Bombardier DHC8 turboprop aircraft were ordered during or around the Airshow . None of these are recorded as firm orders . \u201c In contrast , regional jets accounted for 41 firm orders ( + 10 options ) and 169 LoIs ( + 114 options ) at the show this year . No MoUs were signed for regional jet aircraft \u201d , states Hatcher . \u201c Leading up to the show , much of the news focused on the regional market . In sharp succession we have seen Airbus enter the regional aircraft space with its acquisition of a majority share in what was the Bombardier CSeries program . Embraer has now announced a tie - up which would give Boeing control over its commercial aircraft business . Embraer 's commercial aircraft programs will be rolled into a joint venture , in which Boeing would have an 80 % stake . The deal is expected to close late next year , subsequent to the necessary regulatory approvals . \u201c For the CSeries , the obvious change has been the re-branding of the CS100 and CS300 to the Airbus A220 \u2011 100 and Airbus A220 - 300 , respectively . This was announced prior to Farnborough week , alongside a new commitment from US LCC , JetBlue , for 60 units of the larger A220 - 300 model . However IBA only considers the A220 - 100 as a regional jet . \u201d Bombardier retains a foothold in the regional space and a firm order was received from Uganda Airlines for four CRJ900s . No examples of the smaller Airbus A220 - 100 aircraft were ordered during Farnborough . IBA.iQ records that Embraer took the lion 's share of commitments at the show . Firm Orders totalled 37 aircraft . When LoIs are included , Embraer 's commitments rise to 176 aircraft . Embraer took options totalling 124 aircraft . \u201c The distribution of Embraer 's FAS orders covers a range of products and features a number of airline and lessor customers \u201d , comments Yeomans . \u201c Due to US major airline pilot scope clauses , with which the new E175 E2 model is not compatible , the E175 E1 received some strong demand . United Airlines , Republic Airlines , Mauritania Airlines , NAC , Helvetic Airways , Wataniya and Azul all placed orders . \u201d Although Embraer dominated the regional market , IBA . iQ records that an LoI was signed by Peruvian Airlines for 10 Sukhoi SuperJet SSJ100 - 95 aircraft . Meanwhile , Chinese carrier Urumqi Airlines signed an LoI with Chinese OEM , COMAC , for 20 ARJ - 21 regional aircraft . So , what do the regional OEM backlogs look like ? IBA 's analysis indicates that Embraer finishes Farnborough week in a strong position , with a current backlog of almost 500 aircraft to deliver across all of its aircraft models . COMAC has the second - largest current backlog , although its order book is concentrated almost exclusively in its home market , China . Despite a relatively small number of commitments compared to previous years , ATR maintains a healthy backlog of over 250 aircraft , or around three years ' production at the current rate . Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation ( MITAC ) showcased its MRJ 90 regional aircraft at the show , and despite some delays to the program , the Japanese OEM still holds the fourth - largest regional aircraft backlog . In summary of the show itself , whilst some analysts were indicating that this would be ~ 500 firm order / MoU year , IBA correctly identified that this would be a strong show , with close estimations of widebody and narrow - body performance \u2013 and the year has a long way to go . Based on trends in recent years , December will also likely be a strong month for orders as both large OEMs hunt for 2018 sales . \u201c This is especially important if other aircraft types are to be included in the numbers , as we have seen with the CSeries rebrand \u201d , concludes Hatcher . \u201c Once the summer is over , I expect to see further movement on the A220 in particular , with the weight of Airbus behind it , but the focus is likely to shift to the middle - market if the NMA discussion takes the next step . \u201d About IBA IBA was established in 1988 to provide independent expert business analysis to the aviation industry .

A strong push on Letters of Intent ( 222 ) and options pushed the total number to 1,364 , a number that has n't been surpassed since the Paris 2013 show . As the chart below indicates , the trend of oil price and airshow orders broadly continues . However the mix within the different sectors is disordered . According to Dr Stuart Hatcher , COO at IBA , one of the first visible changes that the firm continues to see is that the number of actual firm orders only , continues to remain very low . \u201c This has been a constant trend over the previous four years , whilst commitments continue to grow . It may not be surprising when we consider the overall backlog has been steadily growing and we had tipped 15,600 for firm orders back at the start of June . Book - to - bill ratios have been so high in general that orders have generally been surpassing deliveries on average by 1,126 units since 2012 \u201d . Hatcher continues \u201c This mid-term correlation to oil seems uncanny , but we must avoid falling into the trap of a potential coincidental relationship . Low oil generally means better profits for the airlines . This in turn has tended to push airlines into buying aircraft , but ultimately traffic demand is what drives airlines to order in a sustained way . Of course , replacement technology is fuelled by efficiency but consumer demand must be there . \u201d As IBA explores this further it notes that another key aspect of the airshows every year is the release of the OEM forecasts . Looking back 15 - 20 years , these have been fairly conservative on narrow - body market growth . Unsurprisingly this year more conservative estimates were announced on the annual traffic growth rate for the industry , which still does not appear to be coming down from the +6 % levels that have been witnessed since early 2013 . Mike Yeomans , head of valuations at IBA , says , \u201c Both Boeing and Airbus have gone for a level ~ 2 % lower than the current rate at 4.7 % and 4.4 % , respectively . We appreciate that this factors in the potential for at least two recession periods . To account for the higher Boeing forecast , there is a larger expectation on the delivery forecast with 42,730 aircraft , whilst Airbus predicts 37,390 . The strength of the economy , the propensity to fly , increasing private consumption , replacement need in the face of rising fuel costs , burgeoning middle classes , and globalization all considered to be the driving forces . \u201d In terms of orders Boeing surpassed Airbus by a narrow margin . The result for Boeing would have been higher if IBA counted the orders already previously announced \u2013 such as jet Airways ' 75 or Jackson Square 's 30 . The orderbook for Boeing was filled with MAX commitments with a few 787s and 777-300ERs as predicted . A welcome appearance of freighter orders shows that Boeing remains the leader in the widebody freighter sector . From Airbus , A320neos , A330neos and A350s ( including some 1000s ) comprised the airshow order book and around 30 % of the narrowbody sector was taken by the A321neo , whilst the MAX 10 only garnered < 19 % of the MAX backlog from the identifiable ones . Yeomans found the lessors were keeping purse strings tight . \u201c In contrast to last year , only 23.9 % of the firm / MoU order book was taken by lessors compared to the 47.2 % last year , and half of the long - term rolling average . This did surprise IBA somewhat given that the sale leaseback market margins remain so tight , and we were expecting some across - the - board top - up for most of the largest lessors . Despite this result , the lessor backlog does continue to hold well at ~ 3,000 units still , which is close to 19 % of the overall backlog . ALC led the way with 78 firm / MoUs for MAXs and 787s , there were two orders from Goshawk for 20 Airbus A320neos and 20 Boeing 737 MAXs , and similarly a 20 Airbus A320 neo order for Macquarie and a 20 Boeing 737 MAX order for ACG . \u201d In terms of order spread amongst the sectors , there were n't many surprises this year , with narrow - bodies taking 814 firm / MoU orders ( 81.7 % ) at the show , and widebodies getting a small uptick at 134 ( 13.5 % ) . When IBA looks specifically at narrowbody order performance at the 2018 Farnborough show , the neos and MAXs dominate with 330 and 424 respectively , with the added bonus of the newly branded A220 - 300 . On the widebody side , a surprise appearance this year was a small order for some 747 Fs , signalling the growth in the heavy freight market . The 777 freighter orders highlight that too . \u201c The widebody is understandably tracking closer to oil price as fuel economics play a key role in this sector \u201d , says Hatcher . \u201c But the market is still reticent to make too many inroads into the larger widebody space just yet . It was encouraging to see a few A350 - 1000s enter the fray early on in Farnborough week . It is five years since the A380 was ordered at one of the summer airshows . This was a 20 aircraft MoU by Doric , which was taken on by Amedeo . However , even as traffic increases , and slot and pilot shortages play their part in driving the need for larger and larger aircraft , the market still shies away from the largest passenger plane . \u201d According to IBA the regional market has taken a positive shift with a total of 217 regional aircraft commitments received , comprising firm orders , MoUs and LoIs . If Options are included , this number rises to 342 aircraft . Of these total commitments , the vast majority are for regional jets , which accounted for around 17 % of the total firm orders , MoUs and LoIs received during the four days of the show . New regional aircraft demand has been at a low point over the past three years and a number of factors have contributed to this , says Yeomans . \u201c As oil costs have fallen , so has demand for turboprops . Over-ordering by lessors , over- production by OEMs , secondary market oversupply , low fuel and airline failures have all driven weakness in the turboprop market , and we have seen few orders for aircraft in this market segment since 2015 . However ATR released its market forecast earlier in July , indicating that a further 3,000 turboprop deliveries will occur over the next 20 years , 80 % of which will be serviced by the 61 - 80 seat category aircraft . \u201d IBA considers there has been pent - up demand for regional aircraft , particularly over the past 12 months , as potential customers have waited to see how Airbus and the CSeries , and a Boeing / Embraer connection would play out . The recent announcement that Boeing will take control of Embraer 's commercial aircraft division has been met with a wave of demand for new Embraer aircraft at Farnborough 2018 . The following IBA .iQ chart shows the recent trend in regional aircraft orders against oil price , which has been adjusted to include LoIs . Of the few turboprop orders placed , MoUs were signed for seven aircraft by two customers : Hokkaido Air System ( Japan ) and EasyFly ( Columbia ) . A number of commitments were made on the previous Friday ( 13th July ) . These totalled 10 aircraft , all of which were ATRs . No Bombardier DHC8 turboprop aircraft were ordered during or around the Airshow . None of these are recorded as firm orders . \u201c In contrast , regional jets accounted for 41 firm orders ( + 10 options ) and 169 LoIs ( + 114 options ) at the show this year . No MoUs were signed for regional jet aircraft \u201d , states Hatcher . \u201c Leading up to the show , much of the news focused on the regional market . In sharp succession we have seen Airbus enter the regional aircraft space with its acquisition of a majority share in what was the Bombardier CSeries program . Embraer has now announced a tie - up which would give Boeing control over its commercial aircraft business . Embraer 's commercial aircraft programs will be rolled into a joint venture , in which Boeing would have an 80 % stake . The deal is expected to close late next year , subsequent to the necessary regulatory approvals . \u201c For the CSeries , the obvious change has been the re-branding of the CS100 and CS300 to the Airbus A220 \u2011 100 and Airbus A220 - 300 , respectively . This was announced prior to Farnborough week , alongside a new commitment from US LCC , JetBlue , for 60 units of the larger A220 - 300 model . However IBA only considers the A220 - 100 as a regional jet . \u201d Bombardier retains a foothold in the regional space and a firm order was received from Uganda Airlines for four CRJ900s . No examples of the smaller Airbus A220 - 100 aircraft were ordered during Farnborough . IBA.iQ records that Embraer took the lion 's share of commitments at the show . Firm Orders totalled 37 aircraft . When LoIs are included , Embraer 's commitments rise to 176 aircraft . Embraer took options totalling 124 aircraft . \u201c The distribution of Embraer 's FAS orders covers a range of products and features a number of airline and lessor customers \u201d , comments Yeomans . \u201c Due to US major airline pilot scope clauses , with which the new E175 E2 model is not compatible , the E175 E1 received some strong demand . United Airlines , Republic Airlines , Mauritania Airlines , NAC , Helvetic Airways , Wataniya and Azul all placed orders . \u201d Although Embraer dominated the regional market , IBA . iQ records that an LoI was signed by Peruvian Airlines for 10 Sukhoi SuperJet SSJ100 - 95 aircraft . Meanwhile , Chinese carrier Urumqi Airlines signed an LoI with Chinese OEM , COMAC , for 20 ARJ - 21 regional aircraft . So , what do the regional OEM backlogs look like ? IBA 's analysis indicates that Embraer finishes Farnborough week in a strong position , with a current backlog of almost 500 aircraft to deliver across all of its aircraft models . COMAC has the second - largest current backlog , although its order book is concentrated almost exclusively in its home market , China . Despite a relatively small number of commitments compared to previous years , ATR maintains a healthy backlog of over 250 aircraft , or around three years ' production at the current rate . Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation ( MITAC ) showcased its MRJ 90 regional aircraft at the show , and despite some delays to the program , the Japanese OEM still holds the fourth - largest regional aircraft backlog . In summary of the show itself , whilst some analysts were indicating that this would be ~ 500 firm order / MoU year , IBA correctly identified that this would be a strong show , with close estimations of widebody and narrow - body performance \u2013 and the year has a long way to go .

Although many factors play a role in a woman 's ability to breastfeed , experiences during the childbirth hospitalization are critical for establishing breastfeeding ( 3 ) . To analyze whether the implementation by maternity facilities of practices that support breastfeeding varied depending on the racial composition of the area surrounding the facility , CDC linked data from its 2011 Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care ( m PINC ) survey to U.S. Census data on the percentage of blacks living within the zip code area of each facility . The results of that analysis indicated that facilities in zip code areas where the percentage of black residents was > 12.2 % ( the national average during 2007\u2013 2011 ) were less likely than facilities in zip code areas where the percentage was \u2264 12.2 % to meet five of 10 mPINC indicators for recommended practices supportive of breastfeeding and more likely to implement one practice ; differences for the other four practices were not statistically significant . Comparing facilities in areas with > 12.2 % black residents with facilities in areas with \u2264 12.2 % black residents , the largest differences were in the percentage of facilities that implemented recommended practices related to early initiation of breastfeeding ( 46.0 % compared with 59.9 % ) , limited use of breastfeeding supplements ( 13.1 % compared with 25.8 % ) , and rooming - in ( 27.7 % compared with 39.4 % ) . These findings suggest there are racial disparities in access to maternity care practices known to support breastfeeding . The mPINC survey is a biennial census of maternity facilities ( hospitals and free -standing birth centers ) in the United States and its territories ( 4 ) . The survey is sent to the person at each facility most knowledgeable about the facility 's maternity care practices and policies . A total of 2,727 facilities participated in the 2011 m PINC survey ( response rate = 83 % ) . These data were analyzed for 10 mPINC indicators for recommended maternity care practices * from the World Health Organization / United Nations Children 's Fund 's Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding ( 5 ) . The Ten Steps are evidence - based practices shown to increase breastfeeding exclusivity and duration , and are the basis for the Baby- Friendly Hospital Initiative . \u2020 To estimate the prevalence of facilities with recommended maternity care practices by the percentage of black residents in their area , zip code level data for the category \" non - Hispanic black or African American alone \" were obtained for the period 2007\u20132011 from the U.S. Census Bureau 's American Community Survey ( ACS ) . ACS is a continuous nationwide survey that collects detailed information on demographic , social , economic , and housing characteristics ; these data are only available by zip code as 5 - year estimates ( 6 ) . ACS and mPINC data were linked by zip codes ; of the 2,727 facilities that participated in the 2011 m PINC survey , 84 ( 3 % ) facilities were missing zip code level racial data in ACS , resulting in a final analytic sample of 2,643 facilities . Facilities were divided into two categories : 1 ) those in zip code areas where the percentage of black residents was > 12.2 % ( the national average during 2007 \u2013 2011 ) ( 6 ) and 2 ) those in zip code areas where the percentage was \u2264 12.2 % . The z-test was used to compare data from the two categories and determine whether differences in implementation of recommended maternity care practices were statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) . No other racial or ethnic groups were examined . In 2011 , three of the 10 mPINC indicators for recommended practices were met by > 75 % of the 2,643 facilities surveyed . The three were providing prenatal breastfeeding education ( 92.7 % ) , teaching breastfeeding techniques ( 90.7 % ) , and teaching mothers how to recognize and respond to infant feeding cues ( 84.7 % ) ( Table ) . Facilities in zip code areas with > 12.2 % black residents were significantly more likely to assess staff competency than facilities in zip code areas with \u2264 12.2 % black residents ( 59.4 % compared with 53.2 % ) ( Table ) . However , facilities in zip code areas with > 12.2 % black residents were significantly less likely than facilities in zip code areas with \u2264 12.2 % black residents to meet five of the nine other mPINC indicators for recommended practices : early initiation of breastfeeding ( 46.0 % compared with 59.9 % ) , limited use of breastfeeding supplements ( 13.1 % compared with 25.8 % ) , rooming - in ( 27.7 % compared with 39.4 % ) , limited use of pacifiers , ( 30.5 % compared with 37.9 % ) , and post-discharge support ( 23.9 % compared with 29.9 % ) ( Table ) . Discussion In 2011 , implementation of 10 recommended maternity care practices supportive of breastfeeding among 2,643 maternity facilities varied widely , ranging from 18.9 % to 92.7 % , and was < 50 % for five practices . For half of the 10 practices , implementation was significantly lower among facilities in zip code areas with a higher percentage of black residents . These findings are important because research has shown that U.S. residents usually are admitted to hospitals within a relatively short distance of where they live , although persons living in rural areas might travel farther than those in cities ( 7 ) . Therefore , women living in zip code areas with a higher percentage of blacks might have less access to facilities implementing recommended maternity care practices , which might contribute to lower breastfeeding rates among blacks compared with other racial groups . The reasons for the differences in maternity care practices by racial composition of the areas are not clear . Further research is needed on barriers to implementing recommended practices in these areas , on whether poorer maternity care practices are linked to lower breastfeeding rates in these areas , and on evaluating other factors that might be contributing to these disparities . This is the first report based on national data showing that practices at maternity facilities vary with the racial composition of the zip code area in which the facility is located . However , similar findings were observed in a previous study in North Carolina that assessed whether there were differences in breastfeeding support services available through the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women , Infants , and Children ( WIC ) program based on the county level racial / ethnic composition of the WIC sites . It was found not only that breastfeeding initiation by WIC site was negatively associated with the percentage of black clients , but also that WIC sites with higher percentages of black clients were less likely to offer clinic- based breastfeeding support services ( 8 ) . In a review of U.S. - based randomized trials evaluating breastfeeding interventions targeting minorities , interventions to change hospital or WIC policies , including enhanced practices and services , were among the public health approaches found to successfully improve breastfeeding outcomes among minority women ( 9 ) . CDC currently is funding a project that addresses the need for quality improvement in maternity care practices . In June 2012 , CDC awarded a 3 - year cooperative agreement to the National Initiative for Children 's Healthcare Quality to assist 89 hospitals , mostly located in states that have lower breastfeeding rates and that serve low- income and minority women , with improving maternity care practices to support breastfeeding and to move toward the Baby- Friendly designation . Detailed descriptions of the cooperative agreement program have been published ( 2,10 ) . The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations . First , one mPINC indicator for each of the Ten Steps was selected ; these indicators are consistent with the Ten Steps , \u00a7 but might not encompass all aspects of each step . Second , although the mPINC survey was sent to the person identified as the most knowledgeable about the facility 's policies and practices and facilities were encouraged to get input from key staff members as needed , responses might not accurately reflect actual practices . Third , the racial composition of the patients served at each facility is not collected in the mPINC survey . However , because most U.S. residents are admitted to hospitals close to where they live and most hospital service areas have only one local hospital , the data in this report for zip code areas are likely reasonable estimates for the racial composition of hospital patients , assuming overall hospital admission patterns ( 7 ) apply to births . Finally , only facilities with zip code level race data were included in this analysis . Excluded facilities might have had different percentages of blacks and maternity care practices . However , only 3 % of facilities were excluded , which is not likely to have affected results . The findings suggest that the implementation of maternity care practices supportive of breastfeeding vary based on the racial composition of the area , which means women living in areas with higher percentages of blacks might have less access to these services . Although the reasons for these disparities are unclear , the results might provide some insight into why there has been a persistent gap in breastfeeding initiation and duration rates between black and white infants in the United States . All facilities , regardless of the racial / ethnic composition of the populations they serve , can support the breastfeeding decisions of their patients by implementing evidence - based policies and practices shown to be critical for establishing breastfeeding , so that more infants are able to reap the numerous health benefits of breastfeeding . 1 Epidemic Intelligence Service , CDC ; 2 Division of Nutrition , Physical Activity , and Obesity , National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion , CDC ( Corresponding author : Jennifer N.

What is already known on this topic ? Breastfeeding has many health benefits for infants , yet there are persistent gaps in breastfeeding rates between black and white infants in the United States . Maternity care practices experienced during the hospital stay have a major impact on the establishment of breastfeeding . What is added by this report ? Facilities located in zip code areas with higher percentages of blacks were less likely to meet five indicators for recommended maternity care practices supportive of breastfeeding and more likely to meet one indicator , than facilities in areas with a lower percentage of blacks . The largest differences were for indicators related to early initiation of breastfeeding , limited use of breastfeeding supplements , and rooming - in . What are the implications for public health practice ? Interventions are needed to ensure that all maternity care facilities are implementing the recommended policies and practices known to be important for the establishment of breastfeeding . Facilities located in areas with higher percentages of blacks might need additional support . TABLE .

Although many factors play a role in a woman 's ability to breastfeed , experiences during the childbirth hospitalization are critical for establishing breastfeeding ( 3 ) . To analyze whether the implementation by maternity facilities of practices that support breastfeeding varied depending on the racial composition of the area surrounding the facility , CDC linked data from its 2011 Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care ( m PINC ) survey to U.S. Census data on the percentage of blacks living within the zip code area of each facility . The results of that analysis indicated that facilities in zip code areas where the percentage of black residents was > 12.2 % ( the national average during 2007\u2013 2011 ) were less likely than facilities in zip code areas where the percentage was \u2264 12.2 % to meet five of 10 mPINC indicators for recommended practices supportive of breastfeeding and more likely to implement one practice ; differences for the other four practices were not statistically significant . Comparing facilities in areas with > 12.2 % black residents with facilities in areas with \u2264 12.2 % black residents , the largest differences were in the percentage of facilities that implemented recommended practices related to early initiation of breastfeeding ( 46.0 % compared with 59.9 % ) , limited use of breastfeeding supplements ( 13.1 % compared with 25.8 % ) , and rooming - in ( 27.7 % compared with 39.4 % ) . These findings suggest there are racial disparities in access to maternity care practices known to support breastfeeding . The mPINC survey is a biennial census of maternity facilities ( hospitals and free -standing birth centers ) in the United States and its territories ( 4 ) . The survey is sent to the person at each facility most knowledgeable about the facility 's maternity care practices and policies . A total of 2,727 facilities participated in the 2011 m PINC survey ( response rate = 83 % ) . These data were analyzed for 10 mPINC indicators for recommended maternity care practices * from the World Health Organization / United Nations Children 's Fund 's Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding ( 5 ) . The Ten Steps are evidence - based practices shown to increase breastfeeding exclusivity and duration , and are the basis for the Baby- Friendly Hospital Initiative . \u2020 To estimate the prevalence of facilities with recommended maternity care practices by the percentage of black residents in their area , zip code level data for the category \" non - Hispanic black or African American alone \" were obtained for the period 2007\u20132011 from the U.S. Census Bureau 's American Community Survey ( ACS ) . ACS is a continuous nationwide survey that collects detailed information on demographic , social , economic , and housing characteristics ; these data are only available by zip code as 5 - year estimates ( 6 ) . ACS and mPINC data were linked by zip codes ; of the 2,727 facilities that participated in the 2011 m PINC survey , 84 ( 3 % ) facilities were missing zip code level racial data in ACS , resulting in a final analytic sample of 2,643 facilities . Facilities were divided into two categories : 1 ) those in zip code areas where the percentage of black residents was > 12.2 % ( the national average during 2007 \u2013 2011 ) ( 6 ) and 2 ) those in zip code areas where the percentage was \u2264 12.2 % . The z-test was used to compare data from the two categories and determine whether differences in implementation of recommended maternity care practices were statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) . No other racial or ethnic groups were examined . In 2011 , three of the 10 mPINC indicators for recommended practices were met by > 75 % of the 2,643 facilities surveyed . The three were providing prenatal breastfeeding education ( 92.7 % ) , teaching breastfeeding techniques ( 90.7 % ) , and teaching mothers how to recognize and respond to infant feeding cues ( 84.7 % ) ( Table ) . Facilities in zip code areas with > 12.2 % black residents were significantly more likely to assess staff competency than facilities in zip code areas with \u2264 12.2 % black residents ( 59.4 % compared with 53.2 % ) ( Table ) . However , facilities in zip code areas with > 12.2 % black residents were significantly less likely than facilities in zip code areas with \u2264 12.2 % black residents to meet five of the nine other mPINC indicators for recommended practices : early initiation of breastfeeding ( 46.0 % compared with 59.9 % ) , limited use of breastfeeding supplements ( 13.1 % compared with 25.8 % ) , rooming - in ( 27.7 % compared with 39.4 % ) , limited use of pacifiers , ( 30.5 % compared with 37.9 % ) , and post-discharge support ( 23.9 % compared with 29.9 % ) ( Table ) . Discussion In 2011 , implementation of 10 recommended maternity care practices supportive of breastfeeding among 2,643 maternity facilities varied widely , ranging from 18.9 % to 92.7 % , and was < 50 % for five practices . For half of the 10 practices , implementation was significantly lower among facilities in zip code areas with a higher percentage of black residents . These findings are important because research has shown that U.S. residents usually are admitted to hospitals within a relatively short distance of where they live , although persons living in rural areas might travel farther than those in cities ( 7 ) . Therefore , women living in zip code areas with a higher percentage of blacks might have less access to facilities implementing recommended maternity care practices , which might contribute to lower breastfeeding rates among blacks compared with other racial groups . The reasons for the differences in maternity care practices by racial composition of the areas are not clear . Further research is needed on barriers to implementing recommended practices in these areas , on whether poorer maternity care practices are linked to lower breastfeeding rates in these areas , and on evaluating other factors that might be contributing to these disparities . This is the first report based on national data showing that practices at maternity facilities vary with the racial composition of the zip code area in which the facility is located . However , similar findings were observed in a previous study in North Carolina that assessed whether there were differences in breastfeeding support services available through the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women , Infants , and Children ( WIC ) program based on the county level racial / ethnic composition of the WIC sites . It was found not only that breastfeeding initiation by WIC site was negatively associated with the percentage of black clients , but also that WIC sites with higher percentages of black clients were less likely to offer clinic- based breastfeeding support services ( 8 ) . In a review of U.S. - based randomized trials evaluating breastfeeding interventions targeting minorities , interventions to change hospital or WIC policies , including enhanced practices and services , were among the public health approaches found to successfully improve breastfeeding outcomes among minority women ( 9 ) . CDC currently is funding a project that addresses the need for quality improvement in maternity care practices . In June 2012 , CDC awarded a 3 - year cooperative agreement to the National Initiative for Children 's Healthcare Quality to assist 89 hospitals , mostly located in states that have lower breastfeeding rates and that serve low- income and minority women , with improving maternity care practices to support breastfeeding and to move toward the Baby- Friendly designation . Detailed descriptions of the cooperative agreement program have been published ( 2,10 ) . The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations . First , one mPINC indicator for each of the Ten Steps was selected ; these indicators are consistent with the Ten Steps , \u00a7 but might not encompass all aspects of each step . Second , although the mPINC survey was sent to the person identified as the most knowledgeable about the facility 's policies and practices and facilities were encouraged to get input from key staff members as needed , responses might not accurately reflect actual practices . Third , the racial composition of the patients served at each facility is not collected in the mPINC survey . However , because most U.S. residents are admitted to hospitals close to where they live and most hospital service areas have only one local hospital , the data in this report for zip code areas are likely reasonable estimates for the racial composition of hospital patients , assuming overall hospital admission patterns ( 7 ) apply to births . Finally , only facilities with zip code level race data were included in this analysis . Excluded facilities might have had different percentages of blacks and maternity care practices . However , only 3 % of facilities were excluded , which is not likely to have affected results . The findings suggest that the implementation of maternity care practices supportive of breastfeeding vary based on the racial composition of the area , which means women living in areas with higher percentages of blacks might have less access to these services . Although the reasons for these disparities are unclear , the results might provide some insight into why there has been a persistent gap in breastfeeding initiation and duration rates between black and white infants in the United States . All facilities , regardless of the racial / ethnic composition of the populations they serve , can support the breastfeeding decisions of their patients by implementing evidence - based policies and practices shown to be critical for establishing breastfeeding , so that more infants are able to reap the numerous health benefits of breastfeeding . 1 Epidemic Intelligence Service , CDC ; 2 Division of Nutrition , Physical Activity , and Obesity , National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion , CDC ( Corresponding author : Jennifer N.

What is already known on this topic ? Breastfeeding has many health benefits for infants , yet there are persistent gaps in breastfeeding rates between black and white infants in the United States . Maternity care practices experienced during the hospital stay have a major impact on the establishment of breastfeeding . What is added by this report ? Facilities located in zip code areas with higher percentages of blacks were less likely to meet five indicators for recommended maternity care practices supportive of breastfeeding and more likely to meet one indicator , than facilities in areas with a lower percentage of blacks . The largest differences were for indicators related to early initiation of breastfeeding , limited use of breastfeeding supplements , and rooming - in . What are the implications for public health practice ? Interventions are needed to ensure that all maternity care facilities are implementing the recommended policies and practices known to be important for the establishment of breastfeeding . Facilities located in areas with higher percentages of blacks might need additional support . TABLE .

From right to left , the belt depicts the territory of the Mohawk , Oneida , Onondaga , Cayuga and Seneca . The Tuscarora became the Confederacy 's sixth nation in 1722 . The community is occasionally represented by a flag depicting the Ayenwahtha wampum belt . The belt documents the establishment of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy by the Peacemaker . The first five nations to join the Confederacy are depicted in white , a colour of peace , over a background of purple , a colour of war . This acknowledges the conflict that predated their confederation . It also articulates how the concept of kanikonhri:yo ( a good mind ) can lead to peace and healing . This belt also serves as a map of the Haudenosaunee homelands , which are now part of upstate New York . From right to left , the map depicts the territory of the Mohawk , Oneida , Onondaga , Cayuga and Seneca . The central heart acknowledges the important role of the Onondaga in kindling the Haudenosaunee Confederacy Council Fire . The Tuscarora sought refuge with the Haudenosaunee Confederacy in 1722 , as a result of British colonial expansion into their homelands in the Carolinas . Later that year , they were accepted as the Confederacy 's sixth nation . History The territory that now forms the Six Nations reserve was formerly Haudenosaunee hunting grounds . This land was also formerly occupied by the Attiwonderonk ( Neutral ) nation . As a result of the American Revolution , the Haudenosaunee Confederacy relocated to this area in 1784 . Much of the Confederacy aligned with the British during this conflict in order to fulfill treaty obligations , such as those in the Covenant Chain . They also wanted to defend their homelands from the encroachment of Americans . The British promised that after the revolution Haudenosaunee homelands would be secure . However , the 1783 Treaty of Paris , which ended the American Revolution , ceded Haudenosaunee territory to the United States . ( courtesy Native Land Digital / Native-Land.ca ) As compensation for the loss of their homelands , Joseph Brant ( Thayendanegea ) was able to secure a tract of land for the Haudenosaunee Confederacy from Sir Frederick Haldimand , the Governor of the Province of Quebec . The land consisted of six miles on either side of the Grand River from Lake Erie to the river 's head ( north of present - day Elora ) . When surveyed in 1821 , the land grant was about 2,740 k m 2 . Subsequent representatives of the Crown , such as John Graves Simcoe , the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada , reinterpreted the grant as land that was reserved for the Confederacy , but not legally owned by them . This shift in policy later benefited non-Indigenous squatters and prospectors when they claimed portions of the land grant to develop homesteads or communities . The territory under Six Nations jurisdiction shrunk over the next century . This occurred as a result of long - term leases facilitated through the Confederacy Council , sales negotiated by individuals such as Joseph Brant , or as a result of agreements made by representatives of the Crown . The final reduction of territory occurred in 1847 , leaving only 5 per cent of the original Haldimand Proclamation lands , representing the current reserve boundaries . That same year , the Credit River Band of the Mississaugas approached the Six Nations Confederacy Council . The Mississaugas needed a place to live after ceding nearly all of their territory near Lake Ontario . They were granted primary use of 19 km2 in the southeastern portion of the Six Nations reserve , now legally known as New Credit Indian Reserve No. 40A . Governance Six Nations of the Grand River retained their Confederacy Council governance system into the early 20th century . In this system , women assigned the role of chief to selected men , who then governed through a consensus decision - making model . Federal government officials such as Duncan Campbell Scott , the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs , were unhappy with Six Nations ' method of governance . They wanted Six Nations to transition to an elected governance system that mirrored Canadian municipalities . Scott and the federal government were often in conflict with the Confederacy Council , as the federal government thought that they were in control of the territory , while the Six Nations viewed themselves as a sovereign nation . Throughout the 1920s , the Confederacy Council presented their case for sovereignty to the House of Commons and the Supreme Court of Canada . These claims were based on the fact that the Haudenosaunee had never agreed to be subjects of the Crown . When these arguments were not heard by the Government of Canada , the Confederacy delegated Deskaheh ( Levi General ) to take their argument directly to the Crown and League of Nations . Deskaheh was a council speaker and Cayuga Bear Clan chief . Deskaheh 's tactics made Duncan Campbell Scott angry . In 1924 , he had an order - in- council approved allowing the RCMP to officially remove the Confederacy Council from the Council House on the Six Nations reserve . Shortly after , Scott and the local Indian Agent , Colonel C.E. Morgan , facilitated the election of the reserve 's first elected council . While the elected council is now recognized by the Government of Canada under the Indian Act , both councils remain in place today . Mohawk Institute Residential School The Mohawk Institute opened in 1828 and closed in 1970 , making it the longest running residential school in Canada . Children from Six Nations , as well as other First Nation communities , attended the school . The Mohawk Institute Indian Residential School , located in Brantford , Ontario , was the longest running residential school in Canada . Founded in 1828 as the Mechanics ' Institute , a day school for boys from Six Nations of the Grand River , the institute began accepting girls in 1834 . The school was operated by the Anglican Church of Canada until 1969 , when the federal government took over . This school also had students from as far as Sarnia , Ontario and Kahnawake , Quebec . Students of the Mohawk Institute attended the nearby Her Majesty 's Chapel of the Mohawks , built in 1785 . Today , the chapel is the oldest surviving church in Ontario . In 1972 , the Woodland Cultural Centre was established at the site of the former residential school , under the direction of the Association of Iroquois and Allied Indians . The cultural centre is now supported by the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte , Six Nations of the Grand River , and the Wahta Mohawks . Among other activities , the Woodland Cultural Centre is working to restore the Mohawk Institute so that the school might serve as a physical reminder of the Government of Canada 's assimilative initiatives . Culture Six Nations hosts the Grand River Champion of Champions Powwow every July . Six Nations has been home to many well - known figures . These include poet Tekahionwake ( E. Pauline Johnson ) , Boston Marathon winner Tom Longboat , actor Jay Silverheels ( The Lone Ranger ) and Academy Award nominee Graham Greene ( Dances with Wolves ) .

From right to left , the belt depicts the territory of the Mohawk , Oneida , Onondaga , Cayuga and Seneca . The Tuscarora became the Confederacy 's sixth nation in 1722 . The community is occasionally represented by a flag depicting the Ayenwahtha wampum belt . The belt documents the establishment of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy by the Peacemaker . The first five nations to join the Confederacy are depicted in white , a colour of peace , over a background of purple , a colour of war . This acknowledges the conflict that predated their confederation . It also articulates how the concept of kanikonhri:yo ( a good mind ) can lead to peace and healing . This belt also serves as a map of the Haudenosaunee homelands , which are now part of upstate New York . From right to left , the map depicts the territory of the Mohawk , Oneida , Onondaga , Cayuga and Seneca . The central heart acknowledges the important role of the Onondaga in kindling the Haudenosaunee Confederacy Council Fire . The Tuscarora sought refuge with the Haudenosaunee Confederacy in 1722 , as a result of British colonial expansion into their homelands in the Carolinas . Later that year , they were accepted as the Confederacy 's sixth nation . History The territory that now forms the Six Nations reserve was formerly Haudenosaunee hunting grounds . This land was also formerly occupied by the Attiwonderonk ( Neutral ) nation . As a result of the American Revolution , the Haudenosaunee Confederacy relocated to this area in 1784 . Much of the Confederacy aligned with the British during this conflict in order to fulfill treaty obligations , such as those in the Covenant Chain . They also wanted to defend their homelands from the encroachment of Americans . The British promised that after the revolution Haudenosaunee homelands would be secure . However , the 1783 Treaty of Paris , which ended the American Revolution , ceded Haudenosaunee territory to the United States . ( courtesy Native Land Digital / Native-Land.ca ) As compensation for the loss of their homelands , Joseph Brant ( Thayendanegea ) was able to secure a tract of land for the Haudenosaunee Confederacy from Sir Frederick Haldimand , the Governor of the Province of Quebec . The land consisted of six miles on either side of the Grand River from Lake Erie to the river 's head ( north of present - day Elora ) . When surveyed in 1821 , the land grant was about 2,740 k m 2 . Subsequent representatives of the Crown , such as John Graves Simcoe , the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada , reinterpreted the grant as land that was reserved for the Confederacy , but not legally owned by them . This shift in policy later benefited non-Indigenous squatters and prospectors when they claimed portions of the land grant to develop homesteads or communities . The territory under Six Nations jurisdiction shrunk over the next century . This occurred as a result of long - term leases facilitated through the Confederacy Council , sales negotiated by individuals such as Joseph Brant , or as a result of agreements made by representatives of the Crown . The final reduction of territory occurred in 1847 , leaving only 5 per cent of the original Haldimand Proclamation lands , representing the current reserve boundaries . That same year , the Credit River Band of the Mississaugas approached the Six Nations Confederacy Council . The Mississaugas needed a place to live after ceding nearly all of their territory near Lake Ontario . They were granted primary use of 19 km2 in the southeastern portion of the Six Nations reserve , now legally known as New Credit Indian Reserve No. 40A . Governance Six Nations of the Grand River retained their Confederacy Council governance system into the early 20th century . In this system , women assigned the role of chief to selected men , who then governed through a consensus decision - making model . Federal government officials such as Duncan Campbell Scott , the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs , were unhappy with Six Nations ' method of governance . They wanted Six Nations to transition to an elected governance system that mirrored Canadian municipalities . Scott and the federal government were often in conflict with the Confederacy Council , as the federal government thought that they were in control of the territory , while the Six Nations viewed themselves as a sovereign nation . Throughout the 1920s , the Confederacy Council presented their case for sovereignty to the House of Commons and the Supreme Court of Canada . These claims were based on the fact that the Haudenosaunee had never agreed to be subjects of the Crown . When these arguments were not heard by the Government of Canada , the Confederacy delegated Deskaheh ( Levi General ) to take their argument directly to the Crown and League of Nations . Deskaheh was a council speaker and Cayuga Bear Clan chief . Deskaheh 's tactics made Duncan Campbell Scott angry . In 1924 , he had an order - in- council approved allowing the RCMP to officially remove the Confederacy Council from the Council House on the Six Nations reserve . Shortly after , Scott and the local Indian Agent , Colonel C.E. Morgan , facilitated the election of the reserve 's first elected council . While the elected council is now recognized by the Government of Canada under the Indian Act , both councils remain in place today . Mohawk Institute Residential School The Mohawk Institute opened in 1828 and closed in 1970 , making it the longest running residential school in Canada . Children from Six Nations , as well as other First Nation communities , attended the school . The Mohawk Institute Indian Residential School , located in Brantford , Ontario , was the longest running residential school in Canada . Founded in 1828 as the Mechanics ' Institute , a day school for boys from Six Nations of the Grand River , the institute began accepting girls in 1834 . The school was operated by the Anglican Church of Canada until 1969 , when the federal government took over . This school also had students from as far as Sarnia , Ontario and Kahnawake , Quebec . Students of the Mohawk Institute attended the nearby Her Majesty 's Chapel of the Mohawks , built in 1785 . Today , the chapel is the oldest surviving church in Ontario . In 1972 , the Woodland Cultural Centre was established at the site of the former residential school , under the direction of the Association of Iroquois and Allied Indians . The cultural centre is now supported by the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte , Six Nations of the Grand River , and the Wahta Mohawks . Among other activities , the Woodland Cultural Centre is working to restore the Mohawk Institute so that the school might serve as a physical reminder of the Government of Canada 's assimilative initiatives . Culture Six Nations hosts the Grand River Champion of Champions Powwow every July . Six Nations has been home to many well - known figures . These include poet Tekahionwake ( E. Pauline Johnson ) , Boston Marathon winner Tom Longboat , actor Jay Silverheels ( The Lone Ranger ) and Academy Award nominee Graham Greene ( Dances with Wolves ) .
