Tony Barrell discovers the phenomenon of ' sleevefacing ' THE SUNDAY TIMES , 2008 Wales has given the world some very strange things . There are love spoons , the sport of bog-snorkelling , Bonnie Tyler , the Sinclair C5 , and the Mosquito Teen Repeller \u2013 a machine that emits a frightening noise to keep young hoodies away . And now Cardiff has become the official cradle for one of the oddest and most comical art forms ever devised . At sleeveface parties , revellers bring a new dimension to familiar photographs of Madonna 's head , Bruce Springsteen 's bottom or Tina Turner 's legs Even if you have n't heard the word \u201c sleeveface \u201d , you may know what it signifies . You may have caught adverts in the press and on TV in which people are having fun with the covers of LP records , using them as modern-day masks to impersonate Elton John , Edith Piaf or the Righteous Brothers . You may have seen websites devoted to sleevefaces , or glimpsed people larking about with covers in a record shop while the staff are n't looking . You may even be one of the thousands of Britons who have attended a sleeveface party , in which revellers bring a new dimension to familiar 12 - inch - square photographs of Madonna 's head , Bruce Springsteen 's bottom or Tina Turner 's legs . And now you can buy a book packed with choice examples of the sleeveface genre from all over the world . Strictly speaking , a small minority have probably been messing around with LP covers in this way , in private , ever since the dawn of the gramophone . Folks do get up to all sorts behind closed doors . But not until 2007 did the activity acquire a universal name and start to spread like wildfire . The phenomenon began at the Buffalo Bar in central Cardiff . It is hard to imagine this inconspicuous drinking hole as the seedbed for a side- splitting international craze , plonked as it is in a sober street dominated by a grey gothic church and the red-brick offices of surveyors , solicitors , planning consultants and estate agents . But it was at the Buffalo that , one spring evening , a locally based Englishman called Carl Morris was fatefully spinning records as a DJ . \u201c I was playing this eclectic mix of tunes , \u201d remembers Morris , 27 , as he sits in the bar a year and a half later . It may have been the hand of destiny that decreed he was limited to playing old vinyl records , as there was no facility here for playing CDs . One of the discs he had with him was Paul McCartney 's third solo album , McCartney II , whose cover has a particularly quizzical head - and - shoulders shot of the ex-Beatle . \u201c I was just goofing around with the sleeve , pretending to be Paul McCartney . I probably attempted a Liverpudlian accent . People tell me I 'd done things like that before \u2013 only this time , I had a picture taken of me with the sleeve . Later I started experimenting , to see what other sleeves worked . \u201d Like pornography and Mr Bean , sleevefacing speaks a visual language and is thus instantly international Beside Morris today is his friend and fellow Cardiff - based Englishman John Rostron , 36 , who recalls how he quickly caught on to the new trend , bringing piles of album sleeves to the Buffalo for further fun photography . Rostron co-founded the My Kung Fu record label with Morris ; he also runs a music promotions company called Plug Two , and like Morris has the sort of formidable record collection that comes in handy for such antics . \u201c To start with , we put the pictures up on a web page for the record label , \u201d says Rostron . \u201c But then we started putting them on Facebook , and that 's when it really took off . It was Carl who came up with the name ' sleeveface ' . \u201d \u201c I remember trying to think of a name before I went to sleep one night , \u201d says Morris . It ca n't be long before it enters the OED : Google \u201c sleeveface \u201d and you 'll get around a quarter of a million matches . By the time Morris and Rostron had set up a dedicated Sleeveface website , they had Uncle Tom Cobleigh and all fishing through their vinyl , setting up their own illusions and sharing them on the net . It helps that , like pornography and Mr Bean , sleevefacing speaks a visual language and is thus instantly international . And people have been quick to grasp the concept , says Morris . \u201c It 's interesting when people from another country get into it . We had a spike of South American people doing things with all these covers that were totally new to us . \u201d Rostron describes a visit to France when he met , by chance , a group of \u201c pochette de disque \u201d enthusiasts who held sleeveface parties . \u201c And they treated me like a famous person . \u201d We like the way it 's become an activity for whole families . Rather than going to Center Parcs , they sleeveface For those who are still confused by the mechanics of the phenomenon , Morris and Rostron have laboured to produce a careful verbal definition . So sleevefacing is officially \u201c one or more persons obscuring or augmenting any part of their body with record sleeve ( s ) causing an illusion \u201d . But in fact , the rules of the game have grown empirically and consensually rather than being laid down from the start . Dressing up and using props and unusual locations are allowed \u2013 even encouraged . \u201c Now and again someone would use image manipulation , and it just did n't feel right , \u201d says Morris . \u201c It just seemed natural to have a rule that you should n't Photoshop . \u201d The \u201c one or more persons \u201d stipulation has already been widely broken , with family pets entering into the sleeveface spirit \u2013 one of the best examples being Barbra Streisand 's fluffy head , courtesy of her Greatest Hits Volume 2 , grafted on a black labrador . \u201c Somebody did a Leonard Cohen one using a cat 's body , \u201d says Morris . \u201c But I find it quite odd when people use babies .

Tony Barrell discovers the phenomenon of ' sleevefacing ' THE SUNDAY TIMES , 2008 Wales has given the world some very strange things . There are love spoons , the sport of bog-snorkelling , Bonnie Tyler , the Sinclair C5 , and the Mosquito Teen Repeller \u2013 a machine that emits a frightening noise to keep young hoodies away . And now Cardiff has become the official cradle for one of the oddest and most comical art forms ever devised . At sleeveface parties , revellers bring a new dimension to familiar photographs of Madonna 's head , Bruce Springsteen 's bottom or Tina Turner 's legs Even if you have n't heard the word \u201c sleeveface \u201d , you may know what it signifies . You may have caught adverts in the press and on TV in which people are having fun with the covers of LP records , using them as modern-day masks to impersonate Elton John , Edith Piaf or the Righteous Brothers . You may have seen websites devoted to sleevefaces , or glimpsed people larking about with covers in a record shop while the staff are n't looking . You may even be one of the thousands of Britons who have attended a sleeveface party , in which revellers bring a new dimension to familiar 12 - inch - square photographs of Madonna 's head , Bruce Springsteen 's bottom or Tina Turner 's legs . And now you can buy a book packed with choice examples of the sleeveface genre from all over the world . Strictly speaking , a small minority have probably been messing around with LP covers in this way , in private , ever since the dawn of the gramophone . Folks do get up to all sorts behind closed doors . But not until 2007 did the activity acquire a universal name and start to spread like wildfire . The phenomenon began at the Buffalo Bar in central Cardiff . It is hard to imagine this inconspicuous drinking hole as the seedbed for a side- splitting international craze , plonked as it is in a sober street dominated by a grey gothic church and the red-brick offices of surveyors , solicitors , planning consultants and estate agents . But it was at the Buffalo that , one spring evening , a locally based Englishman called Carl Morris was fatefully spinning records as a DJ . \u201c I was playing this eclectic mix of tunes , \u201d remembers Morris , 27 , as he sits in the bar a year and a half later . It may have been the hand of destiny that decreed he was limited to playing old vinyl records , as there was no facility here for playing CDs . One of the discs he had with him was Paul McCartney 's third solo album , McCartney II , whose cover has a particularly quizzical head - and - shoulders shot of the ex-Beatle . \u201c I was just goofing around with the sleeve , pretending to be Paul McCartney . I probably attempted a Liverpudlian accent . People tell me I 'd done things like that before \u2013 only this time , I had a picture taken of me with the sleeve . Later I started experimenting , to see what other sleeves worked . \u201d Like pornography and Mr Bean , sleevefacing speaks a visual language and is thus instantly international Beside Morris today is his friend and fellow Cardiff - based Englishman John Rostron , 36 , who recalls how he quickly caught on to the new trend , bringing piles of album sleeves to the Buffalo for further fun photography . Rostron co-founded the My Kung Fu record label with Morris ; he also runs a music promotions company called Plug Two , and like Morris has the sort of formidable record collection that comes in handy for such antics . \u201c To start with , we put the pictures up on a web page for the record label , \u201d says Rostron . \u201c But then we started putting them on Facebook , and that 's when it really took off . It was Carl who came up with the name ' sleeveface ' . \u201d \u201c I remember trying to think of a name before I went to sleep one night , \u201d says Morris . It ca n't be long before it enters the OED : Google \u201c sleeveface \u201d and you 'll get around a quarter of a million matches . By the time Morris and Rostron had set up a dedicated Sleeveface website , they had Uncle Tom Cobleigh and all fishing through their vinyl , setting up their own illusions and sharing them on the net . It helps that , like pornography and Mr Bean , sleevefacing speaks a visual language and is thus instantly international . And people have been quick to grasp the concept , says Morris . \u201c It 's interesting when people from another country get into it . We had a spike of South American people doing things with all these covers that were totally new to us . \u201d Rostron describes a visit to France when he met , by chance , a group of \u201c pochette de disque \u201d enthusiasts who held sleeveface parties . \u201c And they treated me like a famous person . \u201d We like the way it 's become an activity for whole families . Rather than going to Center Parcs , they sleeveface For those who are still confused by the mechanics of the phenomenon , Morris and Rostron have laboured to produce a careful verbal definition . So sleevefacing is officially \u201c one or more persons obscuring or augmenting any part of their body with record sleeve ( s ) causing an illusion \u201d . But in fact , the rules of the game have grown empirically and consensually rather than being laid down from the start . Dressing up and using props and unusual locations are allowed \u2013 even encouraged . \u201c Now and again someone would use image manipulation , and it just did n't feel right , \u201d says Morris . \u201c It just seemed natural to have a rule that you should n't Photoshop . \u201d The \u201c one or more persons \u201d stipulation has already been widely broken , with family pets entering into the sleeveface spirit \u2013 one of the best examples being Barbra Streisand 's fluffy head , courtesy of her Greatest Hits Volume 2 , grafted on a black labrador . \u201c Somebody did a Leonard Cohen one using a cat 's body , \u201d says Morris . \u201c But I find it quite odd when people use babies . There 's a Johnny Mathis one with a child 's body , and because Johnny Mathis looks a bit childlike in the picture , it 's a little bit disturbing . \u201d \u201c But we like the way it 's become an activity for whole families , \u201d adds Rostron . \u201c Rather than saying ' Let 's go to Center Parcs , ' they sleeveface . \u201d \u201c There 's one guy who has done a whole set of pictures on the theme of ' Barry Manilow goes on vacation ' , \u201d says Morris , \u201c and he 's had his whole family sleevefacing with several identical sleeves , in all these different locations . \u201d Apart from anything else , sleevefacing is a new way to meet people , say its inventors . \u201c We know this woman who 's got into it , \u201d says Rostron , \u201c and she used to do flash - mobbing . But she says you 'd just turn up , do something funny and leave , so she did n't get to meet anybody . But sleevefacing is more social . \u201d John Travolta probably never imagined that people would one day be laughing at his head and shoulders positioned on a woman 's body If these pictures were n't so funny , you could call them \u201c conceptual art \u201d , sell them to Charles Saatchi and enter them for the Turner prize .

Given modern methods of transportation and distribution , Montrealers can enjoy Kosher foods manufactured in the farthest parts of the world . Such a cornucopia notwithstanding , certain basic foodstuffs must still be produced locally . Fresh dairy products and breadstuffs form underpinnings of a thriving community , and Montreal is blessed with a number of local manufacturers satisfying the needs of the community with a bounty of fresh dairy and bakery products .

An inside look at recent efforts by the to certify several large , national bakery chains should afford us with a better understanding of the efforts and standards of the , and highlight the important Kashrus concerns that are addressed . References to bread as the symbol of human sustenance can be found in the earliest sources . When Hashem sought to punish Adam for his first transgression , He chose to use bread as the vehicle , and the appellation as The Staff of Life is actually based upon a phrase in Isaiah ( 3:1 ) . Chazal recognized bread as the central part of a meal , and hence regarded all food eaten in a meal with bread as being Tafel \ufffd secondary \ufffd to it and included in the Bracha of Hamotzei Lechem Min Ha\ufffdAretz . Although we may tend to eat less bread than our forefathers , it nonetheless maintains a central place in Halacha and , as we shall see , its importance as a symbol of civilization was also of great significance to Chazal . Although the variety of bread is virtually limitless , we generally consider bread to be dough made from flour , water , and yeast , which is then baked . The Kashrus concerns with bread can be divided into the following categories : Ingredients , equipment , and several special rules that are unique to bread ( see below ) . Of the basic ingredients used to make bread , the flour used for Canadian bread is predominantly wheat . While wheat is inherently Kosher , a Kashrus issue called Yoshon should be noted . In the times of the Bais Hamikdash , a special offering called the Omer was brought on the second day of Pesach , and one was not permitted to eat from the new crop of grain until this sacrifice was brought . The new crop was called Chodosh ( \ufffdnew\ufffd ) , while the grain from the previous year was called Yoshon ( \ufffdold\ufffd ) , and one could only eat Yoshon until after the Omer was brought . The Gemorah tells us , however , that when the Bais Hamikdash is not standing , all Chodosh becomes permitted as soon as the second day of Pesach passes ( the day of the Omer ) , even if the Korban Omer is not brought . The status of grain grown today depends on when it is planted . For example , winter wheat is planted and begins to grow before the winter . Although it is not harvested until the middle of the summer ( well after Pesach ) , it is nonetheless permitted after the second day of Pesach since it had already begun to grow . Spring wheat , however , as well as many types of oats , are planted after Pesach has begun , and thus do not enjoy the benefit of the day of the Omer . As such , spring wheat may pose a Kashrus concern . Halachik authorities , however , differ as to whether this prohibition applies to grain outside of Eretz Yisroel , and the prevailing custom among most Jews living outside of Israel is to be lenient . As such , the MK ( as well as most other Kashrus organizations ) certifies bread and other products that contain Chodosh grain . There is , however , a significant segment in the community that wishes to be Machmir and avoid the use of Chodosh , and for that reason many of our local bakeries make a great effort to use only Yoshon flour all year long . Such bakeries and products are clearly marked as Yoshon , and the MK takes a leading role in ensuring that such products are available . In order to cause bread to attain its classical form \ufffd and not turn into Matzah \ufffd it must be leavened . Leavening is the process where yeast spores ferment the grain , causing the sugars found in the dough to be converted into carbon dioxide , causing the bread to rise . In the olden days , leavening was made by allowing dough to ferment naturally , and then using small amounts of heavily fermented dough to leaven new batches of bread . This material is called Se\ufffdor ( in English it is called \ufffd sour\ufffd ) , and is the ingredient that gives certain types of bread ( e.g. rye bread ) their tangy taste . Most bread today , however , uses commercially processed pure yeast , which is grown on molasses . Large bakeries will use fresh active yeast , while the yeast often purchased for home use comes as a dried product that does not require refrigeration . Both require a reliable Kosher certification , since the food used to feed the yeasts may contain non- Kosher ingredients . Another Kashrus concern specific to dried yeast stems from the use of certain fats and oils to protect the yeast spores during the drying process . It is therefore imperative that the consumer insists on a reliable Kosher certification for this product . Although many types of bread use no fats or oils , many modern types of bread do contain them . In addition , they can be used to grease the pans in which the bread is baked , ensuring that it will not stick . Oils and shortenings may be of animal origin , or may be processed in equipment that is also used for animal fats . Such ingredients clearly require a reliable Kosher certification , and for this reason one should be concerned with the Kosher status of oils and fats for all types of bread . Aside from ingredient issues , the equipment used to bake bread poses serious Kosher concerns . When establishing a new Hashgacha in a bakery , one must Kasher the equipment that had been used to make the non-Kosher products . While Kashering equipment may often be accomplished with boiling water ( Hagolah ) , such a process is only effective for pots and pans that were used to cook foods in liquids . Sheet pans , bread pans and oven shelves on which bread is baked directly can only be Kashered with a process called Libun , where the metal is heated until all non- Kosher residue in the metal has been burned out . This requirement poses significant difficulties for factories in their efforts to make Kosher products , but the MK demands full adherence to the Halacha . Sheet pans , which are generally made of aluminum , cannot be Kashered with Libun , and must be replaced . Steel bread pans , as well as steel oven shelves on which bread is baked directly , must be sent to a metalworking facility , where they are placed in a kiln and heated to over 1000 F . While these requirements may seem onerous , they serve to ensure that the Hashgacha of the bread in Montreal meets the highest Kashrus requirements . In addition to ingredient and equipment issues , two special rules governing bread must be addressed in order to be granted an MK Hashgacha . First , Chazal were concerned that bread not be a source of mixing meat and dairy products , especially since it was the mainstay of the meal . Chazal therefore ordained that all bread be Pareve \ufffd contain no meat or dairy ingredients , thereby ensuring that one would not inadvertently eat a dairy bread with a meat meal . From this perspective , bread is unique , for even if all of the ingredients in a loaf of bread are Kosher , the bread would still be considered non-kosher if it contained either Kosher dairy or Kosher meat ingredients . In modern bakeries , however , this creates a significant problem , since one of the basic ingredients in classic \ufffdwhite bread\ufffd is milk . Indeed , a special variety of white bread called \ufffdmilk bread\ufffd must contain 6 % milk by Provincial decree ! In order to resolve this problem , the MK requires that all bread certified as Kosher must be Pareve , as well as all equipment used to bake it . [ It should be noted that this Halacha applies only to regular bread and not to cake , and may not apply if the bread is baked in a particularly irregular shape and in small amounts , thereby making its dairy or meat status obvious . ] Another rule peculiar to bread concerns Pas Yisroel . Chazal instituted a number of rules surrounding the types of food that may be eaten in order to maintain the uniqueness of Jewish culture . Bread was recognized as the most basic food , and throughout history Chazal indicated a preference that Kosher bread be baked by Jews \ufffd Pas Yisroel . Daniel abstained from the king\ufffds bread ( Daniel 1:8 ) , and the Talmud thereby deduces that Daniel was the first to require Pas Yisroel ( Avodah Zarah 36a ) . As we have noted , however , bread is a necessary staple , and recognizing that Pas Yisroel might not always be available , Chazal allowed for the use of bread baked by a non- Jewish baker when necessary ( see Shulchan Aruch Y.D. 112 ) . While the concept for Pas Yisroel was not made obligatory , it is nonetheless deemed especially meritorious to eat only Pas Yisroel whenever possible . [ A common Minhag mentioned in Shulchan Aruch is to require the use of Pas Yisroel during the ten days between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur as a sign of special holiness . Indeed , some authorities are of the opinion that this custom applies equally to Shabbos . ] Pas Yisroel can be effected by having a Jew light a small fire in the oven , thereby creating his involvement in the baking process , and the MK has a policy to ensure that all bread sold under its Hashgacha complies with this stringency . To this end , we ensure that a special heating element or fire in the oven is lit by the Mashgiach and remains on at all times , thereby affording Pas Yisroel to the community . The Talmud ( Berachos 8a ) notes that one who derives benefit from eating from his own labor enjoys a special blessing , as it states \ufffd On the one hand , we eat bread by the sweat of our brow , but the efforts put into ensuring the highest level of Kashrus in the baked products in Montreal shall certainly earn us a part in the blessing , too . | Comments to webmaster@kashrut.com | \u00a9 Copyright 2022 Scharf Associates","annotations":[{"text":"bread","span":[1343,1347],"token_span":[233,233],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The Entity being manipulated often occurs as the direct object of verbs:"}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"Jewish law generally requires that bread be kept parve ( i.e. , not kneaded with meat or dairy products nor made on meat or dairy equipment ) . \" WITH THE SWEAT OF THOU BROW SHALL THOU EAT BREAD \"","annotations":[{"text":"bread","span":[35,39],"token_span":[5,5],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The Entity being manipulated often occurs as the direct object of verbs:"}],"trigger":{"text":"kneaded","start_char":68,"end_char":74,"start_token":13,"end_token":13,"frame":"Manipulation"}},"source":{"text":"The Jewish community of Montreal is blessed with an abundance of Kosher products from which to choose .

Sheet pans , which are generally made of aluminum , cannot be Kashered with Libun , and must be replaced . Steel bread pans , as well as steel oven shelves on which bread is baked directly , must be sent to a metalworking facility , where they are placed in a kiln and heated to over 1000 F . While these requirements may seem onerous , they serve to ensure that the Hashgacha of the bread in Montreal meets the highest Kashrus requirements . In addition to ingredient and equipment issues , two special rules governing bread must be addressed in order to be granted an MK Hashgacha . First , Chazal were concerned that bread not be a source of mixing meat and dairy products , especially since it was the mainstay of the meal . Chazal therefore ordained that all bread be Pareve \ufffd contain no meat or dairy ingredients , thereby ensuring that one would not inadvertently eat a dairy bread with a meat meal . From this perspective , bread is unique , for even if all of the ingredients in a loaf of bread are Kosher , the bread would still be considered non-kosher if it contained either Kosher dairy or Kosher meat ingredients . In modern bakeries , however , this creates a significant problem , since one of the basic ingredients in classic \ufffdwhite bread\ufffd is milk . Indeed , a special variety of white bread called \ufffdmilk bread\ufffd must contain 6 % milk by Provincial decree ! In order to resolve this problem , the MK requires that all bread certified as Kosher must be Pareve , as well as all equipment used to bake it . [ It should be noted that this Halacha applies only to regular bread and not to cake , and may not apply if the bread is baked in a particularly irregular shape and in small amounts , thereby making its dairy or meat status obvious . ] Another rule peculiar to bread concerns Pas Yisroel . Chazal instituted a number of rules surrounding the types of food that may be eaten in order to maintain the uniqueness of Jewish culture . Bread was recognized as the most basic food , and throughout history Chazal indicated a preference that Kosher bread be baked by Jews \ufffd Pas Yisroel . Daniel abstained from the king\ufffds bread ( Daniel 1:8 ) , and the Talmud thereby deduces that Daniel was the first to require Pas Yisroel ( Avodah Zarah 36a ) . As we have noted , however , bread is a necessary staple , and recognizing that Pas Yisroel might not always be available , Chazal allowed for the use of bread baked by a non- Jewish baker when necessary ( see Shulchan Aruch Y.D. 112 ) . While the concept for Pas Yisroel was not made obligatory , it is nonetheless deemed especially meritorious to eat only Pas Yisroel whenever possible . [ A common Minhag mentioned in Shulchan Aruch is to require the use of Pas Yisroel during the ten days between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur as a sign of special holiness . Indeed , some authorities are of the opinion that this custom applies equally to Shabbos . ] Pas Yisroel can be effected by having a Jew light a small fire in the oven , thereby creating his involvement in the baking process , and the MK has a policy to ensure that all bread sold under its Hashgacha complies with this stringency . To this end , we ensure that a special heating element or fire in the oven is lit by the Mashgiach and remains on at all times , thereby affording Pas Yisroel to the community . The Talmud ( Berachos 8a ) notes that one who derives benefit from eating from his own labor enjoys a special blessing , as it states \ufffd On the one hand , we eat bread by the sweat of our brow , but the efforts put into ensuring the highest level of Kashrus in the baked products in Montreal shall certainly earn us a part in the blessing , too . | Comments to webmaster@kashrut.com | \u00a9 Copyright 2022 Scharf Associates","annotations":[{"text":"bread","span":[1343,1347],"token_span":[233,233],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The Entity being manipulated often occurs as the direct object of verbs:"}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-2365-145-frame-Manipulation","frame":"Manipulation","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"The words in this frame describe the manipulation of an Entity by an Agent.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":["Aiming","Ingestion"],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"The adult was grooming the child and building an emotional connection so they could do what they wanted to him \" .

Although most famous for setting a new World absolute air speed record of 727.63mph on 7 September 1953 at the controls of all - red Hawker Hunter WB188 , Duke had an important and long standing connection to the early marks of Gloster Meteor . A Hawker Siddeley Trident - as fitted with Smiths Autoland equipment - at RAF Cosford | CHANGING OWNERSHIP | | The sections of the Dowty Group dealing with aircraft landing gear and hydraulics collaborated with French opposite numbers Messier before the two companies merged to form Messier Dowty , which then split from the original Dowty Group . | The Dowty Group was taken over by the British Tube Investments ( TI ) Group in 1992 , TI also owning a 50 % share of Messier - Dowty , the other 50 % being owned by French engine manufacturer SNECMA . SNECMA took over the TI shares in Messier - Dowty in 1998 and the TI Group merged with Smiths Aerospace in 2000 . Smiths was founded as a clockmaking company in 1851 and made airspeed indicators for aircraft as early as 1917 . It was renamed Smiths Industries in 1966 and gained international recognition for its electrical engineering expertise when a Hawker Siddeley Trident test aircraft , equipped with a Smiths autopilot , became the first civil airliner to land in thick fog under fully automatic control . Smiths Industries acquired BAe Systems ' Marconi actuation systems division in 1999 and became Smiths Aerospace in 2001 . The company employed more than 11 000 staff and had a $ 2.3 billion revenue in North America and Europe but by 2007 - seventy years after its foundation - what had started as Rotol Propellers had become part of the General Electric group .

Smiths Aerospace Dowty Propellers have also made propulsion units for the LCAC ( Landing Craft Air Cushioned ) hovercraft used by the US Navy . Replacement propellers are also being made for the now out - of - production Swedish Saab 340 and Saab 2000 regional feeder aircraft and for the re-engined Chinese Shaanxi Y-8F600 . The MRO side of the business meanwhile has a contract to refurbish the metal propellers of the Royal Air Force 's C -130 K fleet . The CT7 powered Saab- Fairchild 340 was certificated as the World 's first carbon reinforced all - composite bladed turboprop aircraft in 1984 . The Saab- Fairchild 340 used R320 propellers , with each blade comprising a carbon fibre spar with a glass fibre shell filled with polyurethane foam and covered with an anti-erosion polyurethane coating . The shank incorporated an annular wedge trapped between an inner and light alloy sleeve . The R320 reduced drag to below that of a feathered propeller by windmilling at the optimum angle . 1993 meanwhile saw the Saab 2000 certificated with the first full FADEC ( Full Authority Digital Engine Control ) integrated electronic propeller control system . The first electronic constant speed and synchrophase control system was certificated on the Fokker 50 aircraft while the six bladed all - composite propeller system for the Lockheed C -130 J was certificated in 1997 and on the Alenia C-27J Spartan in 2001 . Bombardier 's Dash 8 - Q400 saw certification of the lightweight , single removable blade propeller system in 1999 . In the late 1990s , the future for propeller driven airliners looked bleak as the increasing popularity of regional jets meant few new turboprops were being built . However , in the last few years , the increasing cost of aviation fuel has meant that turboprops are becoming more and more popular and economical - especially on shorter sectors - and now it is the turn of the smaller regional jets ( up to 50 seats ) to suffer a decline in orders . Modern turboprop airliners can also offer reduced noise footprints for near - jet speeds . | Royal Air Force C-130 J Hercules C5 ZH884 of the Lyneham Transport Wing at the 2002 Royal International Air Tattoo at Fairford fitted with R391 pattern Smiths Aerospace Dowty Propellers . | | MAKING THE BLADES | | The three or four layers of carbon composite / fibreglass mixture on each propeller blade take three or four minutes to be assembled on a machine that looks like a cross between a weaving loom and a spiders web . There are different numbers of layers on different parts of the blade , which has a fibreglass trailing edge and a lighning conductor braid through the middle to minimise possible damage from electrical storms . Resin is then added to the composite material in the mould and the whole blade is then cured in an oven before detailed imperfection analysis and possible rejection . | Contrary to popular belief , the outer parts of composite propeller blades can be easily repaired and in any case can have enhanced damage protection designed in to them . For example , each one of the four six- bladed R391 pattern propellers for the Lockheed C -130 J military transport need to be more resistant to damage than the R408 equivalents on Bombardier 's Dash 8 - Q400 civilian passenger aircraft . Similarly , the C -130 J needs ice resistant aluminium central propeller spinners while the Dash 8 can use lighter composite spinners . A typical propeller will last around five years and 7 500 flying hours ( depending on environment ) although the Time Between Overhaul ( TBO ) on the Dash 8 is as much as 10 000 flying hours . In addition to the hundreds of staff employed at Staverton , Smiths Aerospace Dowty Propellers also has highly qualified service engineers permanently based around the World to repair aircraft on the ground at remote locations - thus minimising expensive downtime for the owners . | No less than six of the older versions of the Lockheed C - 130 Hercules represented a variety of air forces at the Royal International Air Tattoo at Fairford in 2002 . Many of them were fitted with Dowty built metal propellers . | | MAINTENANCE , REPAIR AND OVERHAUL | | The one time Smiths Aerospace Dowty Propellers MRO facility handles metal blades and composites and also has a special cell for the care of C - 130 propellers - either four bladed types on the K or six bladed types on the J variant . Each propeller takes around 100 hours - during a ten day period - to dismantle and rebuild . Firstly , all components are cleaned - either with hot water or kerosene - and then analysed for possible faults using non destructive X ray techniques . | Modern propellers may have only seven major \" bits \" - the blades and hub - but older examples can have ten times that number ! Metal blades have large tolerances for balancing purposes that allow them to be skimmed to eliminate surface cracks . Composite propellers however - although able to have damaged material cut out and directly replaced - have such precise balancing tolerances that they have to be balanced in an enclosed and almost totally still - air environment .","annotations":[{"text":"Rotol Airscrews","span":[1537,1551],"token_span":[285,286],"role":"Producer","label":"Producer","role_definition":"The person or company that produces the Product."},{"text":"in 1968","span":[3122,3128],"token_span":[571,572],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This Fe identifies the Time when the product was produced."},{"text":"the first fibreglass propellers for hovercraft","span":[3153,3198],"token_span":[576,581],"role":"Product","label":"Product","role_definition":"The Product is produced by the Producer."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"During 1960 , Dowty Group acquired Rotol Airscrews , giving it a propeller manufacturing capability ; this led to the creation of the Dowty Rotol division .","annotations":[{"text":"Rotol Airscrews","span":[35,49],"token_span":[6,7],"role":"Producer","label":"Producer","role_definition":"The person or company that produces the Product."},{"text":"propeller","span":[65,73],"token_span":[12,12],"role":"Product","label":"Product","role_definition":"The Product is produced by the Producer."},{"text":"During 1960","span":[0,10],"token_span":[0,1],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This Fe identifies the Time when the product was produced."}],"trigger":{"text":"manufacturing","start_char":75,"end_char":87,"start_token":13,"end_token":13,"frame":"Manufacturing"}},"source":{"text":"| Home | GLOUCESTERSHIRE PROPELLERS | Tony Neul 's customised model of EE227 spent the summer of 2007 at Gloucester Folk Museum as part of a display to mark 90 years of the Gloster Aircraft Company and the centenary of the birth of Sir Frank Whittle .

Under the port wing of the Dove is a David Brown tractor also displayed in model form at Gloucester Folk Museum in 2007 . Click on picture for more details . | | Neighbours Rotol and Dowty merged in 1960 to form the Dowty Rotol , later to be known as The Dowty Group and in 1968 Dowty Rotol introduced the first fibreglass propellers for hovercraft . | From 1960 to 1969 and again from 1970 to 1979 the twin engined personal aircraft of Sir George Dowty - a de Havilland Dove and later a Beech King Air - were piloted by Squadron Leader Neville Duke . Although most famous for setting a new World absolute air speed record of 727.63mph on 7 September 1953 at the controls of all - red Hawker Hunter WB188 , Duke had an important and long standing connection to the early marks of Gloster Meteor . A Hawker Siddeley Trident - as fitted with Smiths Autoland equipment - at RAF Cosford | CHANGING OWNERSHIP | | The sections of the Dowty Group dealing with aircraft landing gear and hydraulics collaborated with French opposite numbers Messier before the two companies merged to form Messier Dowty , which then split from the original Dowty Group . | The Dowty Group was taken over by the British Tube Investments ( TI ) Group in 1992 , TI also owning a 50 % share of Messier - Dowty , the other 50 % being owned by French engine manufacturer SNECMA . SNECMA took over the TI shares in Messier - Dowty in 1998 and the TI Group merged with Smiths Aerospace in 2000 . Smiths was founded as a clockmaking company in 1851 and made airspeed indicators for aircraft as early as 1917 . It was renamed Smiths Industries in 1966 and gained international recognition for its electrical engineering expertise when a Hawker Siddeley Trident test aircraft , equipped with a Smiths autopilot , became the first civil airliner to land in thick fog under fully automatic control . Smiths Industries acquired BAe Systems ' Marconi actuation systems division in 1999 and became Smiths Aerospace in 2001 . The company employed more than 11 000 staff and had a $ 2.3 billion revenue in North America and Europe but by 2007 - seventy years after its foundation - what had started as Rotol Propellers had become part of the General Electric group .

Smiths Aerospace Dowty Propellers have also made propulsion units for the LCAC ( Landing Craft Air Cushioned ) hovercraft used by the US Navy . Replacement propellers are also being made for the now out - of - production Swedish Saab 340 and Saab 2000 regional feeder aircraft and for the re-engined Chinese Shaanxi Y-8F600 . The MRO side of the business meanwhile has a contract to refurbish the metal propellers of the Royal Air Force 's C -130 K fleet . The CT7 powered Saab- Fairchild 340 was certificated as the World 's first carbon reinforced all - composite bladed turboprop aircraft in 1984 . The Saab- Fairchild 340 used R320 propellers , with each blade comprising a carbon fibre spar with a glass fibre shell filled with polyurethane foam and covered with an anti-erosion polyurethane coating . The shank incorporated an annular wedge trapped between an inner and light alloy sleeve . The R320 reduced drag to below that of a feathered propeller by windmilling at the optimum angle . 1993 meanwhile saw the Saab 2000 certificated with the first full FADEC ( Full Authority Digital Engine Control ) integrated electronic propeller control system . The first electronic constant speed and synchrophase control system was certificated on the Fokker 50 aircraft while the six bladed all - composite propeller system for the Lockheed C -130 J was certificated in 1997 and on the Alenia C-27J Spartan in 2001 . Bombardier 's Dash 8 - Q400 saw certification of the lightweight , single removable blade propeller system in 1999 . In the late 1990s , the future for propeller driven airliners looked bleak as the increasing popularity of regional jets meant few new turboprops were being built . However , in the last few years , the increasing cost of aviation fuel has meant that turboprops are becoming more and more popular and economical - especially on shorter sectors - and now it is the turn of the smaller regional jets ( up to 50 seats ) to suffer a decline in orders . Modern turboprop airliners can also offer reduced noise footprints for near - jet speeds . | Royal Air Force C-130 J Hercules C5 ZH884 of the Lyneham Transport Wing at the 2002 Royal International Air Tattoo at Fairford fitted with R391 pattern Smiths Aerospace Dowty Propellers . | | MAKING THE BLADES | | The three or four layers of carbon composite / fibreglass mixture on each propeller blade take three or four minutes to be assembled on a machine that looks like a cross between a weaving loom and a spiders web . There are different numbers of layers on different parts of the blade , which has a fibreglass trailing edge and a lighning conductor braid through the middle to minimise possible damage from electrical storms . Resin is then added to the composite material in the mould and the whole blade is then cured in an oven before detailed imperfection analysis and possible rejection . | Contrary to popular belief , the outer parts of composite propeller blades can be easily repaired and in any case can have enhanced damage protection designed in to them . For example , each one of the four six- bladed R391 pattern propellers for the Lockheed C -130 J military transport need to be more resistant to damage than the R408 equivalents on Bombardier 's Dash 8 - Q400 civilian passenger aircraft . Similarly , the C -130 J needs ice resistant aluminium central propeller spinners while the Dash 8 can use lighter composite spinners . A typical propeller will last around five years and 7 500 flying hours ( depending on environment ) although the Time Between Overhaul ( TBO ) on the Dash 8 is as much as 10 000 flying hours . In addition to the hundreds of staff employed at Staverton , Smiths Aerospace Dowty Propellers also has highly qualified service engineers permanently based around the World to repair aircraft on the ground at remote locations - thus minimising expensive downtime for the owners . | No less than six of the older versions of the Lockheed C - 130 Hercules represented a variety of air forces at the Royal International Air Tattoo at Fairford in 2002 . Many of them were fitted with Dowty built metal propellers . | | MAINTENANCE , REPAIR AND OVERHAUL | | The one time Smiths Aerospace Dowty Propellers MRO facility handles metal blades and composites and also has a special cell for the care of C - 130 propellers - either four bladed types on the K or six bladed types on the J variant . Each propeller takes around 100 hours - during a ten day period - to dismantle and rebuild . Firstly , all components are cleaned - either with hot water or kerosene - and then analysed for possible faults using non destructive X ray techniques . | Modern propellers may have only seven major \" bits \" - the blades and hub - but older examples can have ten times that number ! Metal blades have large tolerances for balancing purposes that allow them to be skimmed to eliminate surface cracks . Composite propellers however - although able to have damaged material cut out and directly replaced - have such precise balancing tolerances that they have to be balanced in an enclosed and almost totally still - air environment .","annotations":[{"text":"Rotol Airscrews","span":[1537,1551],"token_span":[285,286],"role":"Producer","label":"Producer","role_definition":"The person or company that produces the Product."},{"text":"the first fibreglass propellers for hovercraft","span":[3153,3198],"token_span":[576,581],"role":"Product","label":"Product","role_definition":"The Product is produced by the Producer."},{"text":"1968","span":[3125,3128],"token_span":[572,572],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This Fe identifies the Time when the product was produced."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-0649-64-frame-Manufacturing","frame":"Manufacturing","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Producer produces a Product from a Resource for commercial purposes.

REST FOR THE WEARY : A pair of elders take a break from a traditional Ainu ceremony honoring the dead . Meeting the First Inhabitants Despite years of prejudice , Japan 's aboriginal Ainu are beginning to reclaim their unique identity By DONALD MACINTYRE Sapporo The ainu of japan have long been almost invisible in a society that likes to consider itself racially homogenous . Often they hide themselves . Yuki Hasegawa , for instance , grew up thinking she was Japanese . Her school textbooks said little about the Ainu , the aboriginal people of Hokkaido , or Japan 's other minorities Koreans , Chinese and Okinawans . She learned Japan was racially pure ; it was something political leaders boasted about . In the mid -' 80s , Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone even declared there was no discrimination against minorities in Japan since there were no minorities . So when Hasegawa 's father told her at the age of 18 that she was Ainu , it turned her world upside down . \" I had grown up thinking there was only one race in Japan , \" says Hasegawa , now 23 , who works in Tokyo at Japan 's only Ainu restaurant . \" I had n't even heard of the Ainu . \" Hasegawa 's parents had feared their daughter would face bullying and discrimination as an Ainu . Physically indistinguishable from Japanese , many Ainuincluding Hasegawa 's eight brothersstill prefer to hide their ethnic identity . But Hasegawa herself is one of a small but growing number of Ainu who are learning about their ethnicity with new pride . Younger Ainu are enrolling in language classes to learn traditional songs and folk tales . Ainu communities are reviving old ceremonies to honor sacred animals like salmon and bear . While all Ainu use Japanese names , some have started adopting traditional Ainu first names . Ainu activists have also begun to make their voices heard . One group is suing the Hokkaido prefectural government in a Sapporo court , accusing it of mismanaging Ainu land for the past century . Hasegawa is part of another group fighting for recognition of the Ainu 's rights as an indigenous people through the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva . The Ainu have started to forge bonds with indigenous groups in the United States and other countries . The steps are small and largely symbolic , but they have contributed to a resurgence in ethnic pride that was unimaginable even a decade ago . \" To be Ainu used to be a shameful thing , \" says Tatsue Sato , chairman of the Ainu rights group Rera no Kai , or Wind Society . \" Now there are young people coming forward who are saying ' I 'm proud to be Ainu . ' \" That has happened none too soon for the Ainu , whose culture has been in decline for more than a century . Traditionally hunters and fishermen , they lived in small communities along the rivers and seashore of much of northern Japan and the Russian far east . But as Japan industrialized in the 19th century , the Ainu were herded onto plots of substandard farmland and forced to adopt Japanese ways . Tokyo barred the Ainu from hunting and fishing and banned Ainu ceremonieseven use of the Ainu language . Smallpox and other diseases brought by Japanese settlers pouring into Hokkaido decimated the population . Today there are as many as 110,000 Ainu , by their own estimates ; Japanese officials put the number at 25,000 but count only people who declare themselves as Ainu . P H O T O E S S A Y From Sapporo to Surabaya A photographic culmination of TIME Asia 's road journey from Japan to Indonesia As a minority in their own land , the Ainu faced discrimination and prejudice . Japanese called them \" dogs \" ( inu means ' dog ' ) and treated them as second - class citizens . Japanese settlers commonly took Ainu women as sexual slaves , according to Dennis Johnson , author of a recent history of the ethnic group . \" The fate of the Ainu women was nothing short of tragic , \" Johnson writes . Forced off their land , Ainu men had to work for Japanese fishing and logging companies . Few Ainu rose to positions of prominence . Kenichi Kawamura , director of Hokkaido 's Ainu Memorial Museum says his father managed to become a railway surveyor but was once almost deliberately buried alive by his crew , who resented having to work under an Ainu . Says Kawamura : \" We were treated as uncivilized barbarians . \" In the postwar years , the ban on speaking Ainu was lifted , but government pressure to assimilate continued . Ainu faced discrimination in marriage and employment , and children endured bullying at school . Ainu remained oddly absent from the Japanese popular imagination as well , even though the two groups had fought on and off for hundreds of years on the main Japanese island of Honshu . When the Ainu registered at all , it was often through a distorted lens of prejudice and stereotype . Japanese tourists who visit Kawamura 's museum are surprised to discover he wears shoes and speaks Japanese . Ironically , it was Nakasone 's remarks about Japan 's racial purity that helped to galvanize the Ainu . They protested the comments and started to look for ways to make their voices heard . In 1992 , an Ainu addressed the U.N. General Assembly for the first time . Shigeru Kayano , an Ainu who had spent years collecting cultural artifacts and recording Ainu oral culture , won a seat in the Upper House of the Diet in 1994 . In his inaugural address he spoke Ainu , a first for Japan 's parliament . Kayano led a court battle against a dam built on Ainu land , and in a landmark 1998 ruling , a judge in Hokkaido recognized the Ainu as an indigenous people for the first time . While Tokyo has yet to follow suit , it no longer claims Japan has no racial minorities . Recognizing the Ainu as an indigenous people would raise land - rights issues the government would rather avoid . But after intense lobbying by Kayano and others , Tokyo officially accorded the Ainu minority status in a law passed in 1997 . Replacing the century - old and widely hated Former Aborigines Act , the main vehicle of Japan 's assimilationist policies , the legislation was a huge step forward . But it was silent on the issue of land rights , to the chagrin of many Ainu . And while the law did mandate the return of money that the Hokkaido prefectural government managed on behalf of the Ainu under the old law , many felt the $ 14,000 the government agreed to pay was far too littleand does n't compensate the Ainu for the land they say was stolen from them . The government should pay out 2,500 times that amount to reflect inflation , or return the land , says the Ainu museum 's Kawamura , who is leading a group of two dozen Ainu plaintiffs . Kawamura 's group also wants the government to explain what exactly happened to Ainu land expropriated by the government . The authorities insist that they have already returned all the land but admit that relevant documents have gone missing . Ainu activists are also demanding the return of remains dug up from village graves by Japanese university departments for research , mostly during the 1930s . Hokkaido University 's medical department , the biggest collector , accumulated more than 1,000 skeletons . Each skull is tagged with the name of the village where the person was buried . But the names of the individuals were n't recorded , so families ca n't identify the remains . A mausoleum on the university grounds in Sapporo still holds the bones of 972 Ainu . For the past several years , a small group of Ainu have performed a traditional memorial rite annually in front of the mausoleum and other sites , dancing and praying and offering sake to calm the spirits of the dead . But some Ainu believe the spirits will never find peace until they are reinterred at their home villages , and they want the university to pay for it . The university says it has done enough by building the mausoleum . None of this will bring back the disappearing Ainu language , one of the most pressing concerns for Ainu activists . Fewer than a dozen people speak it , all of them elderly . When they pass away , it is unlikely Ainu will survive as a living language . The classes that have sprung up in the past decade are important but probably too lateas Hasegawa points out , there is nobody to make up new words for such things as \" mobile phone \" and \" Internet . \" But the use of Ainu in songs , skits and stories , even in everyday conversation , is growing , and that guarantees a future for the language , argues John Maher , an expert on the Ainu language at Tokyo 's International Christian University . \" Paradoxically , that has occurred while the number of native speakers has been dwindling . \" Are the attempts to revive Ainu culture and language too little , too late ? Not if people like Hasegawa have their way . After discovering she was n't an ethnic Japanese , Hasegawa embraced her new identity , meeting other Ainu and learning traditional dance , songs and even cuisine . The restaurant where she works serves traditional Ainu dishes of venison and salmon .

REST FOR THE WEARY : A pair of elders take a break from a traditional Ainu ceremony honoring the dead . Meeting the First Inhabitants Despite years of prejudice , Japan 's aboriginal Ainu are beginning to reclaim their unique identity By DONALD MACINTYRE Sapporo The ainu of japan have long been almost invisible in a society that likes to consider itself racially homogenous . Often they hide themselves . Yuki Hasegawa , for instance , grew up thinking she was Japanese . Her school textbooks said little about the Ainu , the aboriginal people of Hokkaido , or Japan 's other minorities Koreans , Chinese and Okinawans . She learned Japan was racially pure ; it was something political leaders boasted about . In the mid -' 80s , Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone even declared there was no discrimination against minorities in Japan since there were no minorities . So when Hasegawa 's father told her at the age of 18 that she was Ainu , it turned her world upside down . \" I had grown up thinking there was only one race in Japan , \" says Hasegawa , now 23 , who works in Tokyo at Japan 's only Ainu restaurant . \" I had n't even heard of the Ainu . \" Hasegawa 's parents had feared their daughter would face bullying and discrimination as an Ainu . Physically indistinguishable from Japanese , many Ainuincluding Hasegawa 's eight brothersstill prefer to hide their ethnic identity . But Hasegawa herself is one of a small but growing number of Ainu who are learning about their ethnicity with new pride . Younger Ainu are enrolling in language classes to learn traditional songs and folk tales . Ainu communities are reviving old ceremonies to honor sacred animals like salmon and bear . While all Ainu use Japanese names , some have started adopting traditional Ainu first names . Ainu activists have also begun to make their voices heard . One group is suing the Hokkaido prefectural government in a Sapporo court , accusing it of mismanaging Ainu land for the past century . Hasegawa is part of another group fighting for recognition of the Ainu 's rights as an indigenous people through the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva . The Ainu have started to forge bonds with indigenous groups in the United States and other countries . The steps are small and largely symbolic , but they have contributed to a resurgence in ethnic pride that was unimaginable even a decade ago . \" To be Ainu used to be a shameful thing , \" says Tatsue Sato , chairman of the Ainu rights group Rera no Kai , or Wind Society . \" Now there are young people coming forward who are saying ' I 'm proud to be Ainu . ' \" That has happened none too soon for the Ainu , whose culture has been in decline for more than a century . Traditionally hunters and fishermen , they lived in small communities along the rivers and seashore of much of northern Japan and the Russian far east . But as Japan industrialized in the 19th century , the Ainu were herded onto plots of substandard farmland and forced to adopt Japanese ways . Tokyo barred the Ainu from hunting and fishing and banned Ainu ceremonieseven use of the Ainu language . Smallpox and other diseases brought by Japanese settlers pouring into Hokkaido decimated the population . Today there are as many as 110,000 Ainu , by their own estimates ; Japanese officials put the number at 25,000 but count only people who declare themselves as Ainu . P H O T O E S S A Y From Sapporo to Surabaya A photographic culmination of TIME Asia 's road journey from Japan to Indonesia As a minority in their own land , the Ainu faced discrimination and prejudice . Japanese called them \" dogs \" ( inu means ' dog ' ) and treated them as second - class citizens . Japanese settlers commonly took Ainu women as sexual slaves , according to Dennis Johnson , author of a recent history of the ethnic group . \" The fate of the Ainu women was nothing short of tragic , \" Johnson writes . Forced off their land , Ainu men had to work for Japanese fishing and logging companies . Few Ainu rose to positions of prominence . Kenichi Kawamura , director of Hokkaido 's Ainu Memorial Museum says his father managed to become a railway surveyor but was once almost deliberately buried alive by his crew , who resented having to work under an Ainu . Says Kawamura : \" We were treated as uncivilized barbarians . \" In the postwar years , the ban on speaking Ainu was lifted , but government pressure to assimilate continued . Ainu faced discrimination in marriage and employment , and children endured bullying at school . Ainu remained oddly absent from the Japanese popular imagination as well , even though the two groups had fought on and off for hundreds of years on the main Japanese island of Honshu . When the Ainu registered at all , it was often through a distorted lens of prejudice and stereotype . Japanese tourists who visit Kawamura 's museum are surprised to discover he wears shoes and speaks Japanese . Ironically , it was Nakasone 's remarks about Japan 's racial purity that helped to galvanize the Ainu . They protested the comments and started to look for ways to make their voices heard . In 1992 , an Ainu addressed the U.N. General Assembly for the first time . Shigeru Kayano , an Ainu who had spent years collecting cultural artifacts and recording Ainu oral culture , won a seat in the Upper House of the Diet in 1994 . In his inaugural address he spoke Ainu , a first for Japan 's parliament . Kayano led a court battle against a dam built on Ainu land , and in a landmark 1998 ruling , a judge in Hokkaido recognized the Ainu as an indigenous people for the first time . While Tokyo has yet to follow suit , it no longer claims Japan has no racial minorities . Recognizing the Ainu as an indigenous people would raise land - rights issues the government would rather avoid . But after intense lobbying by Kayano and others , Tokyo officially accorded the Ainu minority status in a law passed in 1997 . Replacing the century - old and widely hated Former Aborigines Act , the main vehicle of Japan 's assimilationist policies , the legislation was a huge step forward . But it was silent on the issue of land rights , to the chagrin of many Ainu . And while the law did mandate the return of money that the Hokkaido prefectural government managed on behalf of the Ainu under the old law , many felt the $ 14,000 the government agreed to pay was far too littleand does n't compensate the Ainu for the land they say was stolen from them . The government should pay out 2,500 times that amount to reflect inflation , or return the land , says the Ainu museum 's Kawamura , who is leading a group of two dozen Ainu plaintiffs . Kawamura 's group also wants the government to explain what exactly happened to Ainu land expropriated by the government . The authorities insist that they have already returned all the land but admit that relevant documents have gone missing . Ainu activists are also demanding the return of remains dug up from village graves by Japanese university departments for research , mostly during the 1930s . Hokkaido University 's medical department , the biggest collector , accumulated more than 1,000 skeletons . Each skull is tagged with the name of the village where the person was buried . But the names of the individuals were n't recorded , so families ca n't identify the remains . A mausoleum on the university grounds in Sapporo still holds the bones of 972 Ainu . For the past several years , a small group of Ainu have performed a traditional memorial rite annually in front of the mausoleum and other sites , dancing and praying and offering sake to calm the spirits of the dead . But some Ainu believe the spirits will never find peace until they are reinterred at their home villages , and they want the university to pay for it . The university says it has done enough by building the mausoleum . None of this will bring back the disappearing Ainu language , one of the most pressing concerns for Ainu activists . Fewer than a dozen people speak it , all of them elderly . When they pass away , it is unlikely Ainu will survive as a living language . The classes that have sprung up in the past decade are important but probably too lateas Hasegawa points out , there is nobody to make up new words for such things as \" mobile phone \" and \" Internet . \" But the use of Ainu in songs , skits and stories , even in everyday conversation , is growing , and that guarantees a future for the language , argues John Maher , an expert on the Ainu language at Tokyo 's International Christian University . \" Paradoxically , that has occurred while the number of native speakers has been dwindling . \" Are the attempts to revive Ainu culture and language too little , too late ? Not if people like Hasegawa have their way . After discovering she was n't an ethnic Japanese , Hasegawa embraced her new identity , meeting other Ainu and learning traditional dance , songs and even cuisine . The restaurant where she works serves traditional Ainu dishes of venison and salmon . The important thing , she says , is to build on what has been achieved in recent years : \" We need to create a society where Ainu can live comfortably . We have to increase our pride and transmit that to Japanese and to other Ainu . \" That way , maybe future generations wo n't have to find out who they are the hard way .","annotations":[{"text":"Japanese settlers","span":[3202,3218],"token_span":[583,584],"role":"Mass_theme","label":"Mass_theme","role_definition":"The mass of entities which moves."},{"text":"Hokkaido","span":[3233,3240],"token_span":[587,587],"role":"Goal","label":"Goal","role_definition":"Goal is the location the Mass_theme ends up in."},{"text":"the 19th century","span":[2947,2962],"token_span":[539,541],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the event occurs."},{"text":"northern Japan","span":[2874,2887],"token_span":[526,527],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The spatial setting in which the Mass_motion takes place."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-0605-456-frame-Mass_motion","frame":"Mass_motion","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Mass_theme, generally made up of many individuals, moves from a Source to a Goal with some Path.","frame_ancestors":["Motion","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"In 2020 , during the COVID - 19 pandemic , when many wealthy New York City residents abandoned the city to move to places which were considered to be safer and less affected by the virus , Irvington was one of the places in Westchester County which showed \" a significant increase in sales by New York City residents \" .

Though 13 years may not strike us as terribly significant , only twice before has baseball been able to claim a stretch of 10 or more years without a contest decided by factors outside the play on the field . Forfeits crop up throughout the game 's history . As recently as Aug. 10 , 1995 , the Dodgers held an ill-advised souvenir baseball giveaway . When manager Tommy Lasorda and two players were ejected for arguing balls and strikes in the ninth inning of a game against the Cardinals , fans in the outfield bleachers hurled their balls en masse to protest . AP Photo / Cleveland Press , Paul Tepley On June 4 , 1974 , the Rangers thought it necessary to brandish bats in defense of Jeff Burroughs . The Indians , who played at League Park in later years , left the cushions behind when they relocated to Cleveland Municipal Stadium in 1932 . Their new home , the first sports venue built entirely with public financing , seated 74,400 fans -- making it by far the largest stadium in America at the time -- and sacrificed comfort for quantity . First announced in 1928 , the scale of the building led to rumors that Cleveland might bid for the 1932 Summer Olympics , which eventually went to Los Angeles . Though such a proposal was n't submitted , the fact that Cleveland 's civic leaders would even dream of an Ohio Olympiad suggests that , at the time , this was a city squinting into a bright future . In 1928 , Cleveland supplanted St. Louis as America 's fifth largest metropolis . Just three years later , the city was closing in on fourth - place Detroit . With Cleveland 's shoes growing a full size every decade , civic planners designed a sports stadium roomy enough to accommodate thousands of citizens who had not yet arrived . They did not realize that their city 's growth spurt was over , nor could they have anticipated the decades of sullen adolescence just over the horizon . By May 13 , 1974 , Cleveland 's civic optimism had long since passed . That night , the Indians beat the Boston Red Sox 4 - 1 in front of just 4,234 spectators . In Cleveland , a city in which spring confines itself to the first week of June , the game - time temperature had dropped to 45 degrees . Players wore long sleeves under their uniforms and blew into their hands , working as quickly as they could and perhaps wondering why no one had thought to build the Astrodome in Cleveland instead of Houston . Fans applauded when John Ellis hit a three - run homer in the first inning , but icy winds swept their encouragement out to Lake Erie . By the end of the contest , few remained aside from the beat writers who were taking notes on the slow demise of Cleveland baseball . The '74 Indians were a smorgasbord of mediocre and forgettable talent playing in an open-air mausoleum . That year , in a city that fielded one of the founding professional teams ( the Forest Citys , incorporated there in 1869 ) , 85 percent of the seats at home games went unsold . All those empty seats meant a balance sheet written in red . The team 's executive vice president , Ted Bonda , could put up with losing teams and an ugly stadium ( he had inherited both in 1972 ) , but he would not tolerate insolvency . Bonda called a meeting to discuss options for improving attendance , which must have felt a little like trying to figure out how to get people excited about a trip to the orthodontist . Someone , apparently a team employee likely acting out of desperation , suggested copying the Texas Rangers , who had recently hosted a successful \" 10 - Cent Beer Night . \" We can imagine the grim silence in the boardroom as the group considered this obviously dangerous remedy . How interested would Cleveland be in such a promotion ? AP Photo / Cleveland Press , Paul Tepley Umpire Joe Brinkman restrains an injured fan on 10 - Cent Beer Night . This time , environmentalists used the city for target practice . National outrage led to the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 and the passage of the Clean Water Act of 1977 . Cleveland could be considered the chief impetus behind these two important and beneficial achievements , which in the ' 70s were as close as the city came to a story with a happy ending . In the decade preceding 1974 , more than 600 factories and heavy industrial operations fled Cleveland . The city considered itself lucky when these businesses landed in suburbs near enough for commuter transit . Most companies left the state or shut down permanently . Cleveland would lose 177,000 inhabitants between 1970 and 1980 , bottoming out at three - quarters of its post - WWII high population of 910,000 . The city council met to earnestly discuss the prospect of bankruptcy . No municipality in the nation had landed in default since the Great Depression , but in Cleveland , all options were on the table .

The Rangers took the lead in the top of the second inning on a home run by designated hitter Tom Grieve .

In the seventh inning , radio announcers Joe Tait and Herb Score watched as the baseball fans in the crowd gathered their families and left the stadium like refugees . In the eighth , they noticed Bonda and other members of the Indians front office leaving the ballpark , doing their best to look casual . AP Photo / Cleveland Press / Paul Tepley Indians reliever Tom Hilgendorf is helped from the field after being hit with a chair by an unruly fan . The slope of the diamond made it impossible for Martin to see below the level of an outfielder 's knees from his station in the dugout . The legendary manager , in a moment that does not get large enough print on his long and colorful r\u00e9sum\u00e9 , did not hesitate after Burroughs fell from view . \" Let 's go get 'em , boys , \" he said , arming himself with a fungo bat and sprinting toward right - center field . The Rangers , understandably inspired , followed him . Martin and his team stormed the diamond , infielders filling out their ranks . When they reached the outfield , the Rangers found Burroughs flustered but unharmed . More worrisome was the effect of their charge on the assembly : The jovial , frolicking nudists had disappeared . The mob that replaced them kept its clothes on and brandished an arsenal that made Martin 's Louisville Slugger look like a child 's toy . The Rangers manager spotted people wielding chains , knives and clubs fashioned from pieces of stadium seats . The 25 Texas players quickly found themselves surrounded by 200 angry drunks , and more were tumbling over the wall onto the field . The Texas Rangers had been ambushed . Then the riot began . Indians manager Ken Aspromonte , his own defining moment upon him , realized that the Texas franchise might be on the verge of decimation . He too ordered his players onto the field . The bat racks in the home dugout emptied as the Indians mounted their own rescue . Announcers Tait and Score have the call , as recorded by Akron Beacon - Journal writer Bob Dyer : Tait : Tom Hilgendorf has been hit on the head . Hilgy is in definite pain . He 's bent over , holding his head Aw , this is an absolute tragedy . Absolute tragedy I 've been in this business for over 20 years , and I have never seen anything as disgusting as this . Broadcasters often employ the \" always a few bad apples \" defense in these situations , but when confronted with the sight of an entire stadium of such rotten fruit , Joe Tait finds himself at a loss . Tait : And I 'll be perfectly honest with you : I just do n't know what to say . Score : I do n't think this game will continue , Joe The unbelievable thing is people keep jumping out of the stands after they see what 's going on ! Tait : Well , that shows you the complete lack of brainpower on the parts of some people . There 's no way I 'm going to run out onto the field if I see some baseball player waving a bat out there looking for somebody . This is tragic The whole thing has degenerated now into just -- now we 've got another fight going with fans and ballplayers . Hargrove has got some kid on the ground and he is really administering a beating . Score : Well , that fellow came up and hit him from behind is what happened . Tait : Boy , Hargrove really wants a piece of him -- and I do n't blame him . Score : Look at Duke Sims down there going at it . Tait : Yeah , Duke is in on it . Here we go again . The sight of 50 angry professional athletes slowly killed the buzz , and the tide in the outfield turned . Taking advantage of what might be their only opportunity to escape alive , Martin and Aspromonte led their players out through the dugouts and down the tunnels , assisting their wounded as needed , with bench players forming a rearguard . After the teams departed , the mob found itself alone on the diamond , with many securing souvenirs to mark the occasion . Score : They 've stolen the bases . Here , Score undersold . They stole more than just the bases . Anything not secured or already taken disappeared . The mob swarmed like locusts as the doors to both clubhouses were shut and locked . With no baseball plays or players left to describe , Tait and Score stared down at the melee , which continued for another 20 minutes . Tait : The security people here are just totally incapable of handling this crowd . They just -- well , short of the National Guard , I 'm not sure what would handle this crowd right now . It 's unbelievable . Just unbelievable . Score : People go back into the seats and others jump down to take their place . Tait : The bases are gone . Perhaps attempting to soothe the riotous beast , the organist then played \" Take Me Out to the Ballgame . \" Chylak then had a moment of profundity in which he realized that there will be days when the mail just does not go through . A hunting knife has landed , blade down , in the grass behind his leg . He forfeits the game to the Rangers and runs . The beat reporters worked overtime that night , particularly Dan Coughlin , from the Chronicle - Telegram of Lorain County , Ohio , who was punched in the face twice while interviewing fans . Those reporters smart enough to follow the teams into the safety of their clubhouses got more than stock responses about looking forward to the next contest . Said Martin : \" That was the closest you 're ever going to be to seeing someone get killed in this game of baseball . [ Given the hectic circumstances , Martin can be forgiven for overlooking the death of shortstop Ray Chapman , who was wearing an Indians uniform in 1920 when he was fatally struck by a Carl Mays fastball . ] Burroughs seemed to be surrounded . Maybe it was silly for us to go out there , but we were n't about to leave a man on the field unprotected . It seemed that he might be destroyed . \" For someone who had just escaped destruction , Burroughs kept his calm . He hopefully asked one reporter whether a forfeit would erase his 0 - for - 3 at the plate that night . The writer informed him that it would not . Aspromonte took a wider view of events , wondering whether Cleveland had lost more than a game that night . \" It 's not just baseball , \" he said . \" It 's the society we live in . Nobody seems to care about anything . We complained about their people in Arlington last week when they threw beer on us and taunted us to fight . But look at our people -- they were worse . I do n't know what it was , and I do n't know who 's to blame , but I 'm scared . \" Cleveland did not lose its ballclub , but after the Indians finished the season 77 - 85 , Aspromonte lost his job -- to one of his own players , Frank Robinson . Though Chylak and his crew were criticized for not ending the game sooner , they did not shirk their responsibilities as the night deteriorated . Said the irate and rattled crew chief after the game , as he applied a compress to the back of his bleeding head : \" F ------ animals ! You just ca n't pull back a pack of animals . When uncontrolled beasts are out there , you gotta do something . I saw two guys with knives , and I got hit with a chair . \" He paused , then added an inexplicable and vaguely disturbing coda : \" If the f------ war is on tomorrow , I 'm gonna join the other side to get a shot at them . \" The Cleveland Police Department arrived in force soon after the game was forfeited to the Rangers . It took a half - hour , but the officers dispersed the crowd with the aid of stadium personnel , who helpfully turned off all the lights . Nine fans were arrested . Indians players volunteered to escort their Texas colleagues to the team bus , provided that it was not lying on its side or in flames . Neither was the case . In the wake of the debacle , the Indians announced that drastic measures would be taken to prevent further chaos : At all future promotions offering 10 - cent beer ( three more were planned ) , fans would be restricted to four cups apiece per night , no exceptions . American League president Lee McPhail greeted this mandate with one of his own : All promotional events were canceled , pending league review . The \" war \" did not start the next day , and Chylak did not fire upon any Clevelander whom history is aware of . He was posthumously inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1999 . As they had for most of that decade , the 1974 Indians finished in a forgettable fourth place in the AL East -- in the standings and in attendance . Mike Hargrove would return to Cleveland as Indians manager in 1991 . He kept a picture from 10 - Cent Beer Night on the wall of his office . As of this writing , the missing bases have not been returned . Paul Jackson is a Chicago - based freelance writer .

Though 13 years may not strike us as terribly significant , only twice before has baseball been able to claim a stretch of 10 or more years without a contest decided by factors outside the play on the field . Forfeits crop up throughout the game 's history . As recently as Aug. 10 , 1995 , the Dodgers held an ill-advised souvenir baseball giveaway . When manager Tommy Lasorda and two players were ejected for arguing balls and strikes in the ninth inning of a game against the Cardinals , fans in the outfield bleachers hurled their balls en masse to protest . AP Photo / Cleveland Press , Paul Tepley On June 4 , 1974 , the Rangers thought it necessary to brandish bats in defense of Jeff Burroughs . The Indians , who played at League Park in later years , left the cushions behind when they relocated to Cleveland Municipal Stadium in 1932 . Their new home , the first sports venue built entirely with public financing , seated 74,400 fans -- making it by far the largest stadium in America at the time -- and sacrificed comfort for quantity . First announced in 1928 , the scale of the building led to rumors that Cleveland might bid for the 1932 Summer Olympics , which eventually went to Los Angeles . Though such a proposal was n't submitted , the fact that Cleveland 's civic leaders would even dream of an Ohio Olympiad suggests that , at the time , this was a city squinting into a bright future . In 1928 , Cleveland supplanted St. Louis as America 's fifth largest metropolis . Just three years later , the city was closing in on fourth - place Detroit . With Cleveland 's shoes growing a full size every decade , civic planners designed a sports stadium roomy enough to accommodate thousands of citizens who had not yet arrived . They did not realize that their city 's growth spurt was over , nor could they have anticipated the decades of sullen adolescence just over the horizon . By May 13 , 1974 , Cleveland 's civic optimism had long since passed . That night , the Indians beat the Boston Red Sox 4 - 1 in front of just 4,234 spectators . In Cleveland , a city in which spring confines itself to the first week of June , the game - time temperature had dropped to 45 degrees . Players wore long sleeves under their uniforms and blew into their hands , working as quickly as they could and perhaps wondering why no one had thought to build the Astrodome in Cleveland instead of Houston . Fans applauded when John Ellis hit a three - run homer in the first inning , but icy winds swept their encouragement out to Lake Erie . By the end of the contest , few remained aside from the beat writers who were taking notes on the slow demise of Cleveland baseball . The '74 Indians were a smorgasbord of mediocre and forgettable talent playing in an open-air mausoleum . That year , in a city that fielded one of the founding professional teams ( the Forest Citys , incorporated there in 1869 ) , 85 percent of the seats at home games went unsold . All those empty seats meant a balance sheet written in red . The team 's executive vice president , Ted Bonda , could put up with losing teams and an ugly stadium ( he had inherited both in 1972 ) , but he would not tolerate insolvency . Bonda called a meeting to discuss options for improving attendance , which must have felt a little like trying to figure out how to get people excited about a trip to the orthodontist . Someone , apparently a team employee likely acting out of desperation , suggested copying the Texas Rangers , who had recently hosted a successful \" 10 - Cent Beer Night . \" We can imagine the grim silence in the boardroom as the group considered this obviously dangerous remedy . How interested would Cleveland be in such a promotion ? AP Photo / Cleveland Press , Paul Tepley Umpire Joe Brinkman restrains an injured fan on 10 - Cent Beer Night . This time , environmentalists used the city for target practice . National outrage led to the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 and the passage of the Clean Water Act of 1977 . Cleveland could be considered the chief impetus behind these two important and beneficial achievements , which in the ' 70s were as close as the city came to a story with a happy ending . In the decade preceding 1974 , more than 600 factories and heavy industrial operations fled Cleveland . The city considered itself lucky when these businesses landed in suburbs near enough for commuter transit . Most companies left the state or shut down permanently . Cleveland would lose 177,000 inhabitants between 1970 and 1980 , bottoming out at three - quarters of its post - WWII high population of 910,000 . The city council met to earnestly discuss the prospect of bankruptcy . No municipality in the nation had landed in default since the Great Depression , but in Cleveland , all options were on the table .

Indians manager Ken Aspromonte , his own defining moment upon him , realized that the Texas franchise might be on the verge of decimation . He too ordered his players onto the field . The bat racks in the home dugout emptied as the Indians mounted their own rescue . Announcers Tait and Score have the call , as recorded by Akron Beacon - Journal writer Bob Dyer : Tait : Tom Hilgendorf has been hit on the head . Hilgy is in definite pain . He 's bent over , holding his head Aw , this is an absolute tragedy . Absolute tragedy I 've been in this business for over 20 years , and I have never seen anything as disgusting as this . Broadcasters often employ the \" always a few bad apples \" defense in these situations , but when confronted with the sight of an entire stadium of such rotten fruit , Joe Tait finds himself at a loss . Tait : And I 'll be perfectly honest with you : I just do n't know what to say . Score : I do n't think this game will continue , Joe The unbelievable thing is people keep jumping out of the stands after they see what 's going on ! Tait : Well , that shows you the complete lack of brainpower on the parts of some people . There 's no way I 'm going to run out onto the field if I see some baseball player waving a bat out there looking for somebody . This is tragic The whole thing has degenerated now into just -- now we 've got another fight going with fans and ballplayers . Hargrove has got some kid on the ground and he is really administering a beating . Score : Well , that fellow came up and hit him from behind is what happened . Tait : Boy , Hargrove really wants a piece of him -- and I do n't blame him . Score : Look at Duke Sims down there going at it . Tait : Yeah , Duke is in on it . Here we go again . The sight of 50 angry professional athletes slowly killed the buzz , and the tide in the outfield turned . Taking advantage of what might be their only opportunity to escape alive , Martin and Aspromonte led their players out through the dugouts and down the tunnels , assisting their wounded as needed , with bench players forming a rearguard . After the teams departed , the mob found itself alone on the diamond , with many securing souvenirs to mark the occasion . Score : They 've stolen the bases . Here , Score undersold . They stole more than just the bases . Anything not secured or already taken disappeared . The mob swarmed like locusts as the doors to both clubhouses were shut and locked . With no baseball plays or players left to describe , Tait and Score stared down at the melee , which continued for another 20 minutes . Tait : The security people here are just totally incapable of handling this crowd . They just -- well , short of the National Guard , I 'm not sure what would handle this crowd right now . It 's unbelievable . Just unbelievable . Score : People go back into the seats and others jump down to take their place . Tait : The bases are gone . Perhaps attempting to soothe the riotous beast , the organist then played \" Take Me Out to the Ballgame . \" Chylak then had a moment of profundity in which he realized that there will be days when the mail just does not go through . A hunting knife has landed , blade down , in the grass behind his leg . He forfeits the game to the Rangers and runs . The beat reporters worked overtime that night , particularly Dan Coughlin , from the Chronicle - Telegram of Lorain County , Ohio , who was punched in the face twice while interviewing fans . Those reporters smart enough to follow the teams into the safety of their clubhouses got more than stock responses about looking forward to the next contest . Said Martin : \" That was the closest you 're ever going to be to seeing someone get killed in this game of baseball . [ Given the hectic circumstances , Martin can be forgiven for overlooking the death of shortstop Ray Chapman , who was wearing an Indians uniform in 1920 when he was fatally struck by a Carl Mays fastball . ] Burroughs seemed to be surrounded . Maybe it was silly for us to go out there , but we were n't about to leave a man on the field unprotected . It seemed that he might be destroyed . \" For someone who had just escaped destruction , Burroughs kept his calm . He hopefully asked one reporter whether a forfeit would erase his 0 - for - 3 at the plate that night . The writer informed him that it would not . Aspromonte took a wider view of events , wondering whether Cleveland had lost more than a game that night . \" It 's not just baseball , \" he said . \" It 's the society we live in . Nobody seems to care about anything . We complained about their people in Arlington last week when they threw beer on us and taunted us to fight . But look at our people -- they were worse . I do n't know what it was , and I do n't know who 's to blame , but I 'm scared . \" Cleveland did not lose its ballclub , but after the Indians finished the season 77 - 85 , Aspromonte lost his job -- to one of his own players , Frank Robinson . Though Chylak and his crew were criticized for not ending the game sooner , they did not shirk their responsibilities as the night deteriorated . Said the irate and rattled crew chief after the game , as he applied a compress to the back of his bleeding head : \" F ------ animals ! You just ca n't pull back a pack of animals . When uncontrolled beasts are out there , you gotta do something . I saw two guys with knives , and I got hit with a chair . \" He paused , then added an inexplicable and vaguely disturbing coda : \" If the f------ war is on tomorrow , I 'm gonna join the other side to get a shot at them . \" The Cleveland Police Department arrived in force soon after the game was forfeited to the Rangers . It took a half - hour , but the officers dispersed the crowd with the aid of stadium personnel , who helpfully turned off all the lights . Nine fans were arrested . Indians players volunteered to escort their Texas colleagues to the team bus , provided that it was not lying on its side or in flames . Neither was the case . In the wake of the debacle , the Indians announced that drastic measures would be taken to prevent further chaos : At all future promotions offering 10 - cent beer ( three more were planned ) , fans would be restricted to four cups apiece per night , no exceptions . American League president Lee McPhail greeted this mandate with one of his own : All promotional events were canceled , pending league review . The \" war \" did not start the next day , and Chylak did not fire upon any Clevelander whom history is aware of . He was posthumously inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1999 . As they had for most of that decade , the 1974 Indians finished in a forgettable fourth place in the AL East -- in the standings and in attendance . Mike Hargrove would return to Cleveland as Indians manager in 1991 . He kept a picture from 10 - Cent Beer Night on the wall of his office . As of this writing , the missing bases have not been returned . Paul Jackson is a Chicago - based freelance writer .

Helgeson , a professor of earth and planetary science at the University of California , Berkeley , whose models of geochemical processes deep underground today guide companies exploring for ore , minerals and oil , died on May 28 after a brief battle with lung cancer . ( Joachim Hampel / UC Berkeley photo , 1989 ) A resident of San Francisco , Helgeson died at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley at the age of 75 . Helgeson is widely regarded as the founder and preeminent practitioner of theoretical geochemistry . A thorough researcher , demanding teacher and avid sailor , he transitioned from a field geologist prospecting for minerals and gems in Africa to a theoretician modeling the geochemical processes in rocks that create metallic ore deposits and oil . \" These models apply to any underground situation involving water moving through aquifers , like the migration of groundwater , pollutant migration , and at higher temperatures and pressures the reactions of volcanic and metamorphic waters deep in the earth , \" said Dimitri A. Sverjensky , a professor of geochemistry at The Johns Hopkins University who was a post-doctoral fellow under Helgeson in the 1980s . \" He dealt with the origins of all hydrothermal processes , that is , hot water and metallic ore deposits of scarce elements like gold , silver , lead , zinc , copper and molybdenum . He invented the theory to describe the chemistry of water - rock interactions that everybody now uses . \" According to William McKenzie , a retired consulting geochemist and Helgeson 's long - time friend and collaborator , Helgeson 's data and theoretical models are used by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory scientists to predict the transport of radionuclides under Nevada 's Yucca Mountain , the proposed repository of the nation 's radioactive waste . Known for his detailed - and long - theoretical papers , this past year Helgeson completed a 300 - page paper summarizing 17 years of research that turns the reigning theory of how oil is generated underground on its head . According to Sverjensky , Helgeson and his coauthors argue that the oil extracted today from wells is just the first pressing of more extensive deposits deeper underground . This theory predicts large , untapped oil reserves in the Earth , which may be difficult to extract . \" It is a revolutionary idea about the origin of petroleum , very extensively documented with incredibly detailed calculations backing it up , so , right or wrong , it will stand as a phenomenal effort , \" Sverjensky said . Coauthored by McKenzie ; Denis L. Norton , formerly of the University of Arizona ; Laurent Richard of the University of Nancy , France ; and UC Berkeley geologist Alexandra M. Schmitt ; the paper is to be printed in the journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta later this year . According to Sverjensky , Helgeson was larger than life . He traveled and lectured extensively , his lectures known for their complex diagrams , clarity and the sheer force of their delivery . He enjoyed socializing and discussing science into the early morning hours , Sverjensky said , adding , \" Few hosts could keep up with his schedule , but they never forgot the experience . \" \" He 'd take people sailing on his boat in the bay and be gone for two days , \" McKenzie said . \" When he returned , they 'd all be wiped out , but Helgeson would show up in his class and teach his lecture . \" \" He was the quintessential bon vivant who loved to ski and sail , listen to Jimmy Buffett and cheer the Giants from his season seats . He loved to spend many , many hours in lively scientific or social discourse at long , long lunches , \" said his wife , France Damon Helgeson . \" ' The purpose of life , ' he would always say , ' was to have lunch ! ' \" \" The mark he has left on geochemistry is profound , ranging from significant theoretical advances , to his many excellent students , to the oft - told Helgeson stories , \" wrote Susan L. Brantley , president of the Geochemical Society . Helgeson was born on Nov. 13 , 1931 , in Minneapolis , Minn. , and grew up in St. Paul . After completing his B.S. in geology at Michigan State University in 1953 , he worked for a year as an exploration geologist for Technical Mine Consultants in Canada , prospecting for uranium , then served for two years in the Korean War as a photo-radar intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force and was based in Wiesbaden , Germany . After his military service , he spent four years as a mining and exploration geologist for Anglo - American Corp. in South Africa , first in diamond exploration for the De Beers company 's subsidiary in what is now Namibia , and then as an underground mining geologist at the President Steyn Gold Mine in Welkom , and the Nkana Copper Mine in Kitwe , Zambia . According to Sverjensky , it was while very deep underground in one of these mines that Helgeson suddenly realized he might find a different career appealing . He returned to the United States in 1959 and entered Harvard University as a graduate student , studying under Robert M. Garrels , a pioneer in low-temperature geochemistry who became a close friend . Helgeson received his Ph.D. in 1962 , and his thesis , published as a book in 1964 , laid out the foundations of the field of theoretical high - temperature geochemistry . After a stint as a research chemist for Shell Development Co. in Houston , Texas , where he investigated geothermal fields , Helgeson in 1965 joined Garrels at Northwestern University , where he began his academic career as an assistant professor .

Helgeson , a professor of earth and planetary science at the University of California , Berkeley , whose models of geochemical processes deep underground today guide companies exploring for ore , minerals and oil , died on May 28 after a brief battle with lung cancer . ( Joachim Hampel / UC Berkeley photo , 1989 ) A resident of San Francisco , Helgeson died at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley at the age of 75 . Helgeson is widely regarded as the founder and preeminent practitioner of theoretical geochemistry . A thorough researcher , demanding teacher and avid sailor , he transitioned from a field geologist prospecting for minerals and gems in Africa to a theoretician modeling the geochemical processes in rocks that create metallic ore deposits and oil . \" These models apply to any underground situation involving water moving through aquifers , like the migration of groundwater , pollutant migration , and at higher temperatures and pressures the reactions of volcanic and metamorphic waters deep in the earth , \" said Dimitri A. Sverjensky , a professor of geochemistry at The Johns Hopkins University who was a post-doctoral fellow under Helgeson in the 1980s . \" He dealt with the origins of all hydrothermal processes , that is , hot water and metallic ore deposits of scarce elements like gold , silver , lead , zinc , copper and molybdenum . He invented the theory to describe the chemistry of water - rock interactions that everybody now uses . \" According to William McKenzie , a retired consulting geochemist and Helgeson 's long - time friend and collaborator , Helgeson 's data and theoretical models are used by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory scientists to predict the transport of radionuclides under Nevada 's Yucca Mountain , the proposed repository of the nation 's radioactive waste . Known for his detailed - and long - theoretical papers , this past year Helgeson completed a 300 - page paper summarizing 17 years of research that turns the reigning theory of how oil is generated underground on its head . According to Sverjensky , Helgeson and his coauthors argue that the oil extracted today from wells is just the first pressing of more extensive deposits deeper underground . This theory predicts large , untapped oil reserves in the Earth , which may be difficult to extract . \" It is a revolutionary idea about the origin of petroleum , very extensively documented with incredibly detailed calculations backing it up , so , right or wrong , it will stand as a phenomenal effort , \" Sverjensky said . Coauthored by McKenzie ; Denis L. Norton , formerly of the University of Arizona ; Laurent Richard of the University of Nancy , France ; and UC Berkeley geologist Alexandra M. Schmitt ; the paper is to be printed in the journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta later this year . According to Sverjensky , Helgeson was larger than life . He traveled and lectured extensively , his lectures known for their complex diagrams , clarity and the sheer force of their delivery . He enjoyed socializing and discussing science into the early morning hours , Sverjensky said , adding , \" Few hosts could keep up with his schedule , but they never forgot the experience . \" \" He 'd take people sailing on his boat in the bay and be gone for two days , \" McKenzie said . \" When he returned , they 'd all be wiped out , but Helgeson would show up in his class and teach his lecture . \" \" He was the quintessential bon vivant who loved to ski and sail , listen to Jimmy Buffett and cheer the Giants from his season seats . He loved to spend many , many hours in lively scientific or social discourse at long , long lunches , \" said his wife , France Damon Helgeson . \" ' The purpose of life , ' he would always say , ' was to have lunch ! ' \" \" The mark he has left on geochemistry is profound , ranging from significant theoretical advances , to his many excellent students , to the oft - told Helgeson stories , \" wrote Susan L. Brantley , president of the Geochemical Society . Helgeson was born on Nov. 13 , 1931 , in Minneapolis , Minn. , and grew up in St. Paul . After completing his B.S. in geology at Michigan State University in 1953 , he worked for a year as an exploration geologist for Technical Mine Consultants in Canada , prospecting for uranium , then served for two years in the Korean War as a photo-radar intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force and was based in Wiesbaden , Germany . After his military service , he spent four years as a mining and exploration geologist for Anglo - American Corp. in South Africa , first in diamond exploration for the De Beers company 's subsidiary in what is now Namibia , and then as an underground mining geologist at the President Steyn Gold Mine in Welkom , and the Nkana Copper Mine in Kitwe , Zambia . According to Sverjensky , it was while very deep underground in one of these mines that Helgeson suddenly realized he might find a different career appealing . He returned to the United States in 1959 and entered Harvard University as a graduate student , studying under Robert M. Garrels , a pioneer in low-temperature geochemistry who became a close friend . Helgeson received his Ph.D. in 1962 , and his thesis , published as a book in 1964 , laid out the foundations of the field of theoretical high - temperature geochemistry . After a stint as a research chemist for Shell Development Co. in Houston , Texas , where he investigated geothermal fields , Helgeson in 1965 joined Garrels at Northwestern University , where he began his academic career as an assistant professor . Over the next five years , he , Garrels and Fred T. Mackenzie published a series of definitive papers on the theory of water - rock interactions at low and high temperatures and pressures , and Helgeson published a paper providing the first internally consistent thermodynamic data needed to apply that theory .

Chrysler Corporation , 221 F. Supp. 677 ( S.D. Tex. 1963 ) September 17 , 1963 v. CHRYSLER CORPORATION , Defendant . United States District Court S. D. Texas , Houston Division . Leonard C. Kahn , Houston , Tex. , for plaintiffs . Baker , Botts , Shepherd & Coates , Ralph S. Carrigan , Houston , Tex. , for defendant . INGRAHAM , District Judge . The case is before the court on defendant 's motion for summary judgment . Suit was originally brought against Chrysler Corporation by David Allen Kahn , a minor , acting by and through his father and next friend , Leonard C. Kahn . Jurisdiction is founded on diversity of citizenship , the plaintiff being a citizen and resident of Texas , and the defendant being a foreign corporation licensed to do business in Texas . The facts as follow are undisputed . On September 25 , 1960 , plaintiff , David Kahn , a minor of seven years age , was operating his bicycle on a street in Houston . While so doing , he drove the bike into the rear of a 1957 Dodge vehicle , manufactured and designed by the defendant . The child was thrown upon the vehicle , his right front temple region striking the left rear fin of the vehicle , and causing substantial injury to the minor . It is alleged , and this is the basis of the suit , that those injuries were proximately caused by the negligence of defendant , Chrysler Corporation , in creating and designing the vehicle \" in such a manner that the fins of said vehicle were elongated and protruded past the remainder of the vehicle and made of sharp metal capable of cutting . \" It is * 678 further alleged that the defendant knew , or reasonably should have known , that the fins of the 1957 vehicle would be capable of causing such injuries as those which occurred to the minor plaintiff . Defendant moves for summary judgment under Rule 56 , Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , the relevant parts of which are set out . [ 1 ] It is clear that the court must first determine whether there is a genuine issue as to any material fact . Only after it has been affirmatively established by the movant that no such issue exists is the question reached of whether judgment should be granted as a matter of law . Plaintiff opposes the motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the question of whether or not the defendant was negligent in the manufacture and design of the vehicle is a sufficient disputed fact to defeat the motion . In short , there is no dispute over what occurred , but only over the legal significance of the occurrence . This is a diversity case , and as such the court must look to the substantive law of the state in which it sits . Erie R. R. Co. v. Tompkins , 304 U.S. 64 , 58 S. Ct. 817 , 82 L. Ed. 1188 ( 1938 ) . Almost universally , whether or not certain actions constitute negligence is a fact question for the jury . Once the constituent elements are outlined , the factfinder is left the determination of this ultimate issue . However , it is also elementary law that if an act or omission be negligent it is because there has been some breach of duty , and if there is no duty , there can be no negligence . See , e. g. , Stevens Funeral Home v. Busby , 336 S.W.2d 812 ( Tex.Civ.App.1960 ) ; Toombs v. Wimberley , 320 S.W.2d 881 ( Tex.Civ.App.1959 ) . This threshold question of the existence of a duty is the first problem which must be resolved . However , who is to determine if a duty exists ? Is this a matter of law or a disputed fact question itself ? Certainly there is disagreement in the instant case over whether or not the defendant had a duty to so design his vehicles that an accident like that under consideration could not happen . The very essence of plaintiff 's complaint is that the defendant owed to the plaintiff a duty to manufacture an automobile with which it was safe to collide . But this is not sufficient to constitute a disputed fact issue , for this is a question of law to be determined by the court . Whether or not a legal duty exists on a given state of facts and circumstances so as to give rise to actionable negligence on breach thereof , as well as the nature and extent of the duty , if any , is always essentially a question of law . City of Austin v. Schmedes , 270 S.W.2d 442 ( Tex.Civ.App.1954 ) ; City of Bryan v. Jenkins , 247 S.W.2d 925 ( Tex.Civ. App. 1952 ) . This brings us to the final question was there a duty in the instant case ? If so , then there is the factual dispute over whether or not it was breached . On the other hand , if no duty exists , then the motion for summary judgment should be granted . There is no Texas case dealing explicitly with this problem . Muncy v. General Motors Corp. , 357 S.W.2d 430 ( Tex.Civ.App.1962 ) , is perhaps the closest a Texas court has come to considering a manufacturer 's duty in designing an automobile . That case was a personal injury action arising from an accident occurring when an automobile jumped the curb and pinned the plaintiff against a building while a passenger was attempting to leave the vehicle on the * 679 driver 's side . Suit was filed against General Motors , and one of the grounds urged by plaintiff was that GMC was negligent for designing and constructing an automobile so that its key could be removed from the ignition without stopping the motor and while remaining in drive gear . The court rejected this argument , relying on the statement of manufacturer 's liability in the Restatement of the Law of Torts , Sec. 395 . [ 2 ] The court held that there was no showing that the car in question was dangerous if used properly and in the manner and for the purpose for which it was intended . Unquestionably there are numerous distinctions between the GMC case and the one presently under consideration . The significance is the scope of the duty which is implicit in the court 's holding . That is , the duty of care is apparently felt to be concomitant with normal use and for the ordinary purpose of the vehicle . A case extremely similar factually to the instant case arose in California , and the court dismissed the suit due to the absence of a duty owing to the plaintiff . This dismissal was upheld by the California Court of Appeals in Hatch v. Ford Motor Co. , 163 Cal. App. 2d 393 , 329 P.2d 605 ( 1958 ) . In that case , an automobile manufactured and assembled by Ford Motor Company was parked at the edge of a public street . The automobile had a pointed radiator ornament which protruded beyond the front part of the auto to which it was attached . The plaintiff , a minor of six years age , was proceeding on foot along the street , and collided with the front of the vehicle , with the result that the ornament pierced his left eyeball , causing the loss of that eye . Plaintiffs urged two causes of action , one being based on violation of a state statute , and the other being the same theory of recovery as is expressed in the instant case . The court rejected both theories , and its language as to the latter is particularly relevant here : \" The facts here do not present the question as to whether defendant owed to the public a duty to so design its automobile as to lessen [ the ] severity of injuries that might be caused by it if it were negligently operated on the highways of this State but only the question as to whether it owed to the public , including the plaintiff , the duty above stated , i. e. , to so design the vehicles sold by it as to prevent the type of injury sustained by the plaintiff when said automobile was at rest , properly parked upon the highway . Counsel for the plaintiff have not cited us to any authorities which uphold their contention that the defendant owed any such duty and our own research has not disclosed any . \" This court is in accord with the views of the California court , and feels that the Texas courts would hold likewise . This case would seem almost a fortiori when juxtaposed with the GMC case discussed earlier . Chrysler Corporation should not be required to anticipate all the possible ways in which a person may injure himself by falling against an automobile , nor should they have a duty to protect against such possible injuries . The duty of the automobile manufacturer extends to the ordinary use of the vehicle , and may even be such as to cover certain situations when the automobile is being negligently used . But the manufacturer has no obligation to so design his automobile that it will be safe for a child to ride his bicycle into it while the car is parked . Defendant 's motion for summary judgment will be granted . The clerk will notify counsel to draft and submit judgment accordingly .

After the last contact ( 4th and last one ) with the runway , Carpatair flight AZ1670 would permanently be supported by the fuselage , crawling for approximately 400 m before stopping completely . Throughout the swiping the aircraft 's trajectory was leaning to the right , only to stop on the grass , at about 30 m from the edge of the runway , near the intersection called \u201c DE \u201d . During the course of the sweep , the aircraft was leaning to the right by performing a rotation of about 170\u00b0 on its vertical axis , stopping with the nose oriented at 330\u00b0 magnetic degrees . As soon as the Carpatair flight AZ1670 stopped , the two flight attendants , assisted by the crew members of another company on board as positioning crew , took care of the process of the evacuation of passengers , who , after exiting the aircraft fuselage , waited for the authorities to come and help . The first emergency vehicles of firefighters came to the scene after 10 minutes and due to the absence of a possible fire condition , they positioned themselves around the aircraft ready for intervention . A doctor , who arrived at the scene at the same time of the Police Department , would provide for the immediate relief of the wounded ones while carrying out the process of the nursing triage in order to encode the rescue urgency . The morning of the 3rd of February , the ANSV staff , returned to the crash site of Carpatair flight AZ1670 for further operational inspection , acknowledged that , after the first inspection , the livery of the Italian carrier for which the flight had been operating , had been removed from the aircraft leaving out only the identification marks and the flag of nationality . These are the evidences of the investigation of Carpatair flight AZ1670 accident : - The crew members were in possession of the necessary aeronautical and qualified titles for the flight concerned . - During the investigation there was nothing that could reveal the non good psychophysical condition of the crew members . - The aircraft was properly equipped , with the documents still valid and the maintenance had been carried out in accordance to the local regulations and the approved procedures . - There was no evidence that suggest that before the event the aircraft had been damaged . - The radio aids used at the airport of Fiumicino , in particular those necessary for the approach and the Instrument Landing System ( ILS ) for runway 16L , were properly working . - The radio communications between the YR - ATS operating the flight AZ1670 , and the relevant air traffic control units were held regularly without critical elements . - The Carpatair flight AZ1670 accident occurred in night light conditions during the landing phase at the runway 16L of Rome Fiumicino 's airport . - At 19:30 ' 50 \u201d the TWR of Rome Fiumicino , after giving the clearance to land , would again provide the crew of the YR - ATS the direction an the intensity of the wind : 250 degrees , with an intensity of 22 knots , with gusts up to 37 . From the evidence obtained it emerged that the TWR , in all of the communications with the other aircrafts landing , tended to highlight the value of the gusts , as it was of a significant value . Upon landing the weather conditions were characterized by the presence of crosswinds and wind gusts that were of a higher value than that allowed for the accident 's aircraft . - The aircraft touched violently the ground with the front gear while \u201c pitching down \u201d in an excessive way and having an approach speed higher compared to the one provided in the OM . In particular , at the moment of the first contact with the ground , the pitch angle was - 2.6 degrees with a speed of 125 KIAS and there was no detection of opposite inputs by the two crew members . The above data indicates that the aircraft touched the runway in a controlled flight . - From the traces found on the runway and by additional evidence acquired it emerged that the aircraft touched the Rome Fiumicino 's airport runway at 19:32'03 \u201d , close to the center line of runway 16L , at a distance of about 560 m from the threshold . After the first contact with the runway , the aircraft would attempt the touch down three more times ( in order to try to land it ) , during which the nose gear and later the main landing gear collapsed . After the last contact ( 4th and last one ) with the runway , the aircraft would permanently be supported by the fuselage , crawling for approximately 400 m before stopping completely . Throughout the swiping the aircraft 's trajectory was leaning to the right , only to stop on the grass , at about 30 m from the edge of the runway , near the intersection called \u201c DE \u201d . During the course of the sweep , the aircraft was leaning to the right by performing a rotation of about 170\u00b0 on its vertical axis , stopping with the prow nose oriented at 330\u00b0 of the magnetic field . - During the second touchdown with the runway , the engines went out , due to mechanical damage at the linkage of the engine control levers ( in particular the ones of the CLA ) which were damaged from the collapsing of the front landing gear . - Following the incident no fire was detected . - There is no evidence , from the analysis of the CVR , of the execution , by the crew , of the \u201c landing briefing \u201d , as suggested by the OM of the company . The Captain ( PF ) decided to maintain an approach speed ( 130 KIAS ) higher than the one suggested in the OM ( which was calculated at 118 KIAS [ maximum ] ) ; the first officer ( PNF ) behaved assertively and uncritically , accepting twice the quoted speed value communicated by the Captain . - The Captain ( PF ) made the aircraft touch the runway with the front landing gear having a pitch angle of - 2.6 degrees , value not consistent with neither a technique applicable to a normal landing , nor with the provisions in the OM . - The Captain and the first officer had both hands on the control columns before and after the first contact ; having used simultaneously opposite inputs to the flight controls , the interconnection decoupling between the commands was a direct result of these acts . - After the first contact with the ground , the procedure called balked landing had not been applied as provided in the OM of the company . - The evacuation took place without major problems , coordinated by the flight attendants assisted by the CMG ( Crew Must Go , positioning crew ) of other company present on board . - The search and rescue operations were carried out during nighttime in good - visibility conditions . - Rescuers reached the location of Carpatair flight AZ1670 10 minutes after the activation of the state of emergency . - Communications between the TWR and the Fire Department were not properly effective and no GRID - MAP has been used as suggested in the Safety Guide ( Manuale Rosso ) of Rome Fiumicino 's airport . Cause of the Carpatair flight AZ1670 accident was identified as \u201c human factor \u201c . In particular was caused by an improper conduct by the PF ( Captain ) during landing , not consistent with what is expected from the OM in an environment characterized by the presence of significant problems ( presence of crosswind with the values at the limit / excess of those permitted for the ATR 72 ) and in the absence of an effective CRM . The event may have been influenced by the following factors . - The not making of the \u201c landing briefing \u201d , which , in addition to being required by the company 's standards , would be an important opportunity to put a vital factor for ensuring the safety of the operations . - Maintaining a VAPP significantly higher than the expected . - The belief of the Captain ( PF ) , resulting from its significant general and specific experience on the aircraft , that he could still be able to conduct a safe landing despite the presence of critical wind conditions for the type of aircraft . - The substantial experience gap existing between the captain and the first officer , who reasonably accepted the Captain 's decision , making ineffective the CRM techniques .

The neighbourhood , just north of Mont Royal on the mountain 's plateau , was known for its cheap rents and the squalor they often invited . Not long ago , buildings were crumbling , the streets looked shoddy and businesses stayed away . Longtime residents considered the area a wasteland . Over the past decade , though , things have changed . Mile End is now gentrified , condos have taken over , shops have moved upscale and rents have gone up , making it one of the more desirable parts of the city to live in . The area used to be home to low-income artists and immigrants , but it 's now the place to be for Montreal 's young , well - paid professionals . At the epicentre of this transformation , in an old four-story textile building on the corner of Boulevard St. Laurent and Rue Saint Viateur , is Ubisoft Montreal , the main Canadian arm of the Paris - based video game publisher . The floorboards creak as you walk on them , but make no mistake \u2014 the building houses cutting - edge technology that has been used to create such hit games as Assassin 's Creed and Splinter Cell . Since its founding in 1997 , the studio has driven the area 's revitalization by employing a steadily growing number of designers , engineers and artists , many of whom moved into Mile End and parked their big salaries there . \" Thirteen years ago , Mile End was just emptiness , \" says Alain Tascan , a co-founder of the studio who is now vice - president and general manager of Ubisoft Montreal 's main rival , EA Montreal . \" If you visit the place now , it 's so vivid , so lively . \" While many industries measure their contribution to the economy in numbers such as total jobs or revenue generated , the impact of video games goes deeper . Number three globally In strictly numerical terms , the industry employs 14,000 people in this country , good enough to rank Canada third in the world , behind Japan and the United States , and just ahead of the United Kingdom . The total number of workers is n't nearly as high as other big industries , such as aerospace with 82,000 or manufacturing with 1.7 million , but just about all the employees in the video game business are highly skilled and well paid , says Industry Minister Tony Clement , which is n't necessarily the case with their counterparts in other major employers . \" This is an area where Canada is competing in the top rung as an industry , \" he says . \" It 's clearly something we want to be a player in . \" The Entertainment Software Association of Canada , the industry 's lobby group , says video game publishers in Canada generate about $ 2 billion a year in revenue , and they pump about $ 1.7 billion of that back into the economy . BY THE NUMBERS - Total video game employees : 14,000 - Total number of companies : 247 - Percentage in British Columbia : 44 % - Percentage in Quebec : 37 % - Percentage in Ontario : 14 % - Average employees per firm : 57 - Most employees nationally : 2,500 at Ubisoft - Employment growth , last three years : 23 % - Projected employment growth , next three years : 29 % - Total annual revenue : $ 2 billion - Average salary : $ 68,000 - Average age : 32 ( Source : Entertainment Software Association of Canada ) Indirectly , the industry spurs jobs and economic activity in related fields , such as special effects production , music and animation . Video game makers also spend research and development dollars on new technologies that spin out beyond the industry , such as the sort of vibration technology first found in game controllers and now used in cellphones and robotic limbs . \" It contributes to the virtuous circle , \" Clement says . \" The skills that are available for developers in gaming are potentially of use in the auto or aerospace sectors and other [ information technology ] sectors as well . There 's really no downside . \" The industry 's deeper impact , however , comes from how it transforms \u2014 for the better \u2014 the places it touches . The average salary in the industry is $ 68,000 and the average age is 32 , according to ESAC . Combine those factors and you have a lot of big spenders . \" People in the games industry are heavy consumers . They love the gadgets and electronics , they love getting the latest TVs , \" says Dan Sochan , a video game producer at Vancouver 's United Front Games . \" We generally work a lot of long hours so we have a lot of meals out . They become very active in their neighbourhoods , [ leading to ] restaurants and pubs . \" At Ubisoft , the average income is even higher at $ 73,000 , according to Nathalie Verge , the company 's senior adviser of corporate affairs . \" That makes for nicer homes , nicer cars and all that , \" she says . \" That has a big impact on life in Montreal . \" For Montreal , Ubisoft was only the tip of the iceberg . The studio 's growth \u2014 it now employs 1,800 people \u2014 helped generate an ecosystem , with software and sound companies springing up and local schools , including Concordia and McGill , developing design courses to feed the industry . That , in turn , has attracted other big international studios , such as California 's EA , which set up shop in 2004 , and London - based Eidos Interactive , which opened in 2007 . Montreal has rapidly developed into an international hotspot for video game development , and more new studios are on the way . THQ and Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment , also based in California , are both launching Montreal studios this year , and the employment numbers are expected to continue to grow . Marc Garneau , the federal Liberal technology critic and MP for Westmount - Ville Marie , says the video game industry 's revitalizing effect has spread well beyond Mile End . His downtown riding , which includes old Montreal , has seen similar growth of condos and high - end shops . \" [ Video game designers ] do n't want to live in suburbia , they want to live downtown where the action is . That has fallout in terms of what happens in neighbourhoods , \" he says . \" It 's kind of exciting . It makes the place that much more fun to live in . \" Vancouver another hotspot The same situation has evolved in Vancouver , Canada 's other major game development hotspot . The development of the city 's game - developer ecosystem actually predates Montreal 's by several years , with the opening of EA 's studio in Burnaby in 1991 . As in Montreal , local schools including Simon Fraser and the University of British Columbia developed design programs to feed EA , which in turn resulted in numerous smaller spinoff companies . Some of those startups , such as Relic Entertainment and Barking Dog , went on to be acquired by big multinationals such as THQ and New York - based Rockstar Games . Bernie Magnan , chief economist at the Vancouver Board of Trade , says that just as in Montreal , the video game industry is largely responsible for revitalizing parts of the city . Areas such as Yaletown used to only house businesses , but now there 's a mix of residential and offices , which has ballooned the downtown population to more than 110,000 from 40,000 . \" That blend and old Yaletown , where several of the studios are located , is something that seems to work for people who are in that industry , \" says Magnan , who used to work for a company that supplied computer servers to video game companies . The revitalizing effect is precisely what the respective provincial governments of Quebec and British Columbia were aiming for when they lured the international studios with hefty tax incentives \u2014 an issue covered in a separate story in the Pushing Buttons series . Ontario has noticed and is attempting to get its share of the action . With 1,300 workers in video game design it is already the third biggest in the sector , yet it is still wooing studios . Last year the province awarded $ 263 million in tax credits to Ubisoft to come to Toronto . The studio opened in January in an old CGE industrial factory near the Junction neighborhood , a part of Toronto that \u2014 like Mile End \u2014 has a reputation as something of a wasteland . The subsidy game Are taxpayers getting a return on the subsidies they 're paying to the video game industry ? Provinces are starting to engage in a civil war of sorts in trying to woo big game studios to set up shop . Read the story . The building , which is still being renovated , is cavernous on the inside right now \u2014 Ubisoft 's 40 current employees fill only a small corner of the giant space . But with plans to ramp up to 800 workers in the next 10 years , the building will soon be as bustling as its counterpart in Montreal . A condo development has already sprouted up directly across the street from the studio , with units starting at about $ 600,000 .

The neighbourhood , just north of Mont Royal on the mountain 's plateau , was known for its cheap rents and the squalor they often invited . Not long ago , buildings were crumbling , the streets looked shoddy and businesses stayed away . Longtime residents considered the area a wasteland . Over the past decade , though , things have changed . Mile End is now gentrified , condos have taken over , shops have moved upscale and rents have gone up , making it one of the more desirable parts of the city to live in . The area used to be home to low-income artists and immigrants , but it 's now the place to be for Montreal 's young , well - paid professionals . At the epicentre of this transformation , in an old four-story textile building on the corner of Boulevard St. Laurent and Rue Saint Viateur , is Ubisoft Montreal , the main Canadian arm of the Paris - based video game publisher . The floorboards creak as you walk on them , but make no mistake \u2014 the building houses cutting - edge technology that has been used to create such hit games as Assassin 's Creed and Splinter Cell . Since its founding in 1997 , the studio has driven the area 's revitalization by employing a steadily growing number of designers , engineers and artists , many of whom moved into Mile End and parked their big salaries there . \" Thirteen years ago , Mile End was just emptiness , \" says Alain Tascan , a co-founder of the studio who is now vice - president and general manager of Ubisoft Montreal 's main rival , EA Montreal . \" If you visit the place now , it 's so vivid , so lively . \" While many industries measure their contribution to the economy in numbers such as total jobs or revenue generated , the impact of video games goes deeper . Number three globally In strictly numerical terms , the industry employs 14,000 people in this country , good enough to rank Canada third in the world , behind Japan and the United States , and just ahead of the United Kingdom . The total number of workers is n't nearly as high as other big industries , such as aerospace with 82,000 or manufacturing with 1.7 million , but just about all the employees in the video game business are highly skilled and well paid , says Industry Minister Tony Clement , which is n't necessarily the case with their counterparts in other major employers . \" This is an area where Canada is competing in the top rung as an industry , \" he says . \" It 's clearly something we want to be a player in . \" The Entertainment Software Association of Canada , the industry 's lobby group , says video game publishers in Canada generate about $ 2 billion a year in revenue , and they pump about $ 1.7 billion of that back into the economy . BY THE NUMBERS - Total video game employees : 14,000 - Total number of companies : 247 - Percentage in British Columbia : 44 % - Percentage in Quebec : 37 % - Percentage in Ontario : 14 % - Average employees per firm : 57 - Most employees nationally : 2,500 at Ubisoft - Employment growth , last three years : 23 % - Projected employment growth , next three years : 29 % - Total annual revenue : $ 2 billion - Average salary : $ 68,000 - Average age : 32 ( Source : Entertainment Software Association of Canada ) Indirectly , the industry spurs jobs and economic activity in related fields , such as special effects production , music and animation . Video game makers also spend research and development dollars on new technologies that spin out beyond the industry , such as the sort of vibration technology first found in game controllers and now used in cellphones and robotic limbs . \" It contributes to the virtuous circle , \" Clement says . \" The skills that are available for developers in gaming are potentially of use in the auto or aerospace sectors and other [ information technology ] sectors as well . There 's really no downside . \" The industry 's deeper impact , however , comes from how it transforms \u2014 for the better \u2014 the places it touches . The average salary in the industry is $ 68,000 and the average age is 32 , according to ESAC . Combine those factors and you have a lot of big spenders . \" People in the games industry are heavy consumers . They love the gadgets and electronics , they love getting the latest TVs , \" says Dan Sochan , a video game producer at Vancouver 's United Front Games . \" We generally work a lot of long hours so we have a lot of meals out . They become very active in their neighbourhoods , [ leading to ] restaurants and pubs . \" At Ubisoft , the average income is even higher at $ 73,000 , according to Nathalie Verge , the company 's senior adviser of corporate affairs . \" That makes for nicer homes , nicer cars and all that , \" she says . \" That has a big impact on life in Montreal . \" For Montreal , Ubisoft was only the tip of the iceberg . The studio 's growth \u2014 it now employs 1,800 people \u2014 helped generate an ecosystem , with software and sound companies springing up and local schools , including Concordia and McGill , developing design courses to feed the industry . That , in turn , has attracted other big international studios , such as California 's EA , which set up shop in 2004 , and London - based Eidos Interactive , which opened in 2007 . Montreal has rapidly developed into an international hotspot for video game development , and more new studios are on the way . THQ and Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment , also based in California , are both launching Montreal studios this year , and the employment numbers are expected to continue to grow . Marc Garneau , the federal Liberal technology critic and MP for Westmount - Ville Marie , says the video game industry 's revitalizing effect has spread well beyond Mile End . His downtown riding , which includes old Montreal , has seen similar growth of condos and high - end shops . \" [ Video game designers ] do n't want to live in suburbia , they want to live downtown where the action is . That has fallout in terms of what happens in neighbourhoods , \" he says . \" It 's kind of exciting . It makes the place that much more fun to live in . \" Vancouver another hotspot The same situation has evolved in Vancouver , Canada 's other major game development hotspot . The development of the city 's game - developer ecosystem actually predates Montreal 's by several years , with the opening of EA 's studio in Burnaby in 1991 . As in Montreal , local schools including Simon Fraser and the University of British Columbia developed design programs to feed EA , which in turn resulted in numerous smaller spinoff companies . Some of those startups , such as Relic Entertainment and Barking Dog , went on to be acquired by big multinationals such as THQ and New York - based Rockstar Games . Bernie Magnan , chief economist at the Vancouver Board of Trade , says that just as in Montreal , the video game industry is largely responsible for revitalizing parts of the city . Areas such as Yaletown used to only house businesses , but now there 's a mix of residential and offices , which has ballooned the downtown population to more than 110,000 from 40,000 . \" That blend and old Yaletown , where several of the studios are located , is something that seems to work for people who are in that industry , \" says Magnan , who used to work for a company that supplied computer servers to video game companies . The revitalizing effect is precisely what the respective provincial governments of Quebec and British Columbia were aiming for when they lured the international studios with hefty tax incentives \u2014 an issue covered in a separate story in the Pushing Buttons series . Ontario has noticed and is attempting to get its share of the action . With 1,300 workers in video game design it is already the third biggest in the sector , yet it is still wooing studios . Last year the province awarded $ 263 million in tax credits to Ubisoft to come to Toronto . The studio opened in January in an old CGE industrial factory near the Junction neighborhood , a part of Toronto that \u2014 like Mile End \u2014 has a reputation as something of a wasteland . The subsidy game Are taxpayers getting a return on the subsidies they 're paying to the video game industry ? Provinces are starting to engage in a civil war of sorts in trying to woo big game studios to set up shop . Read the story . The building , which is still being renovated , is cavernous on the inside right now \u2014 Ubisoft 's 40 current employees fill only a small corner of the giant space . But with plans to ramp up to 800 workers in the next 10 years , the building will soon be as bustling as its counterpart in Montreal . A condo development has already sprouted up directly across the street from the studio , with units starting at about $ 600,000 . The project , when completed , will strike a big contrast to the dollar stores and fast - food joints the area is known for . All of the revitalization effects have come during massive growth by the industry . Up until the recent recession , studios around the world were seeing explosive growth as the market for video games kept growing . In Canada alone , employment grew 23 per cent between 2006 and 2009 , according to ESAC . The question when it comes to Canada 's future as a force in video game design , is can the growth \u2014 and therefore the effects \u2014 be sustained ?

The Ministry of Environmental Protection ( MEP ) last month gave tens of thousands of companies in 28 cities until Nov 1 to halve their use of diesel trucks over the winter months , when pollution is at its worst . The ministry , in a policy document , also set more stringent , permanent targets for more than 20 power and steel companies , including Zhengzhou Xinli Power , Xingtai Iron & Steel and Hebei Risun Coke , directing them to send at least half their shipments by rail . Trucking is a cheaper and preferred mode of transport for heavy industry in China , especially for inland companies moving goods over relatively short distances and those far from railways . Some provinces have taken even tougher stances on trucks . In Hebei and central Henan , some steel producers must deliver as much as 90 percent of their products via rail on a permanent basis , up from around 50 to 60 percent currently . The moves are the latest in Beijing 's years - long battle to tackle the pollution that blankets the north as houses turn up the heat between November and March , drawing on the nation 's power plants , which are mainly fueled with coal . China is also forcing steel mills and other factories to shut up to 50 percent of capacity across the north to try and prevent toxic air during the winter .

Or they may notice that D / FW is a lot less busy . It all depends on when they find themselves at the airport . American is implementing a major schedule change Sunday at D / FW Airport and its hub at Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport to put their banks of flights into narrow time windows . The idea is that with more flights arriving and departing in shorter time spans , American will offer better connecting times for people who arrive on one of its flights and depart on another . With better connections , American will attract more passengers and more revenue . That 's the idea , at least . Jeff Plant , vice president of American 's D/FW hub , said he 's confident the airline is ready for the big change . \u201c We have really turned over every stone in our preparation . We 've looked at the Skylink [ people - mover ] capacity . We 've looked at restaurants and the type of service they operate , grab - and - go vs. sit -down , \u201d Plant said . The carrier has also devoted a lot of time communicating with employees to ready them for what 's coming , he said . \u201c I really think that we have a good sense of what we 're in for and very prepared , \u201d he said . In an employee newsletter , American said that the change \u201c is a massive undertaking for these hubs and affects every aspect of the operation . There will be a lot of work but in the long run , rebanking will add more structure and integrity to the reliability of the operation . \u201d It 's called rebanking because American in the 1980s was a leader in scheduling tight banks of flights at its hubs . It departed from that concept in the 2000s when airline management concluded that spreading out the arrivals and departures into shallower peaks and valleys was more efficient . The new leadership at American Airlines , however , is taking D / FW back to the busier hub . They 've been planning this change ever since American 's Dec. 9 , 2013 , merger with US Airways , whose flights have also been folded into the banks . At an investor conference last year , new American Airlines president Scott Kirby noted that most U.S. airlines had moved away from banked hubs after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks as a way to save money . However , they \u201c quickly changed because the revenue benefit of just getting a few extra connecting customers on those planes far outweighs the incremental cost . So we will be rebanking the hubs , \u201d Kirby said . American 's executives recognize that the airline 's costs will be higher . It will need additional staff and equipment to handle the greater activity during the peaks , which then wo n't be busy during the valleys . But management believes that the added revenue will far outstrip the added expense . Plant said American has hired or is hiring more than 1,000 people to handle the stepped - up activity \u2014 handling bags , checking in passengers and other such work that has to be done quickly . \u201c Now that you 're going to create these banks that in some cases are upwards of 50 , 60 flights or airplanes here at once , you have to staff almost every gate that we have to work those airplanes simultaneously , \u201d he said . \u201c We 've shrunk the connect time down about 10 minutes on average . Now connecting bags is a little more intense , so we 've added some connecting bag drivers to have three on each arrival so we can spread the wealth as far as going to the different terminals and make it there in the shorter period of time , \u201d he said . Plant said that American will operate 10 distinct banks of arrivals and departures . Six of those banks will be \u201c directional , \u201d he said . Flights will arrive from the east and connect to flights headed west , or flights will arrive from the west and connect to flights headed east . The four others will be \u201c omni-directional , \u201d with flights arriving from and departing to any direction . Despite the operational challenge , he said he thought the schedule changes will benefit American 's passengers . \u201c We 're excited for our customers . They 're going to get a lot more options in connectivity , especially from those markets that do n't have as much frequency . The connect times will be shorter , so I think people enjoy that , getting to their destinations quicker , \u201d he said .

But management believes that the added revenue will far outstrip the added expense . Plant said American has hired or is hiring more than 1,000 people to handle the stepped - up activity \u2014 handling bags , checking in passengers and other such work that has to be done quickly . \u201c Now that you 're going to create these banks that in some cases are upwards of 50 , 60 flights or airplanes here at once , you have to staff almost every gate that we have to work those airplanes simultaneously , \u201d he said . \u201c We 've shrunk the connect time down about 10 minutes on average . Now connecting bags is a little more intense , so we 've added some connecting bag drivers to have three on each arrival so we can spread the wealth as far as going to the different terminals and make it there in the shorter period of time , \u201d he said . Plant said that American will operate 10 distinct banks of arrivals and departures . Six of those banks will be \u201c directional , \u201d he said . Flights will arrive from the east and connect to flights headed west , or flights will arrive from the west and connect to flights headed east . The four others will be \u201c omni-directional , \u201d with flights arriving from and departing to any direction . Despite the operational challenge , he said he thought the schedule changes will benefit American 's passengers . \u201c We 're excited for our customers . They 're going to get a lot more options in connectivity , especially from those markets that do n't have as much frequency . The connect times will be shorter , so I think people enjoy that , getting to their destinations quicker , \u201d he said .

It was built on the site of the earlier 1895 wooden Caledonian Theatre . The Gaiety 's plain exterior was finished in red brick and its elaborate interior , lit by gas , accommodated 1200 , divided into pit , dress circle , upper gallery and four boxes . It had six dressing rooms . However , its interior was largely destroyed by fire on 4th August 1903 A year later it was reconstructed under the direction of Alexander Cullen , architect , ( one of a number of Theatres to be designed by Cullen , Lochhead & Brown , of Hamilton ) with its auditorium remodelled in rococo style and the galleries taken down and re-erected in steel and concrete so that the auditorium became virtually fireproof . The walls were heightened by 11 feet , the number of boxes increased to eight , and an amphitheatre introduced . Exits were increased and improved . Under various owners it provided variety and cine-variety . It was remodelled again in 1935 with influences of Art Deco . After a fire in 1955 the accommodation was reduced to 570 . The most successful operators and owners from 1925 onwards were Ben Popplewell and his family - who first ran entertainments in Bradford , and became owner of the Queens Palace Theatre , Shipley , and lessees of the new Ayr Pavilion . They presented major stars including Sir Harry Lauder , Will Fyffe and the Houston Sisters . The Popplewell maxim was \" Run by a family for all families . \" Their first major summertime show was in 1929 , The Gaiety Whirl , topped by Dave Willis who led it for six years until he was contracted by Howard & Wyndham to lead their new Half Past Eight shows in the King`s Theatre , Glasgow .

Others include Alma Cogan , Danny La Rue , and Morecombe & Wise . One of the dancers was Lionel Blair who made his solo theatre dance debut in The Gaiety Whirl , 1949 .

In the mid 1990s an extension to one side was made , housing offices , box office , cafe and dressing rooms .

Late 18th century records for Ayr report an attempt by George Sutherland , actor / manager of a touring company , to build a Theatre in the town . He was unable to find a suitable location and moved to Dumfries where he helped to establish that town`s Theatre Royal in 1792 . In 1796 , a company gave performances in Ayr in the old school room of the Mill Vennel near the Wallace Tower . Beaumont 's company played there in 1802 . This company included a very young Edmund Kean . Beaumont moved in 1809 to the empty Gibb 's soapworks beside the main gate of Dalblair House . The next company who occupied the soap - work was managed by Montgomerie and Lacy . The well - known John Henry Alexander , of Glasgow Theatres , acted here about this time , as a lad , under the name of Master Middleton . Edinburgh born Henry Erskine Johnston ( 1777 - 1845 ) became an actor / manager of renown in Dublin , but bankrupted himself , before coming to Ayr where he ran drama before moving to a hall in Content Street , a building which later became a brass foundry . The great tragedian , Edmund Kean appeared at these premises in 1811 and 1812 , returning to Ayr for further engagements in later years . By 1812 , there were plans for a new Theatre and the Content Street hall was abandoned . Johnston also managed Theatre in Aberdeen and Greenock . In 1814 Johnston managed the Theatre Royal , Queen Street , Glasgow but his Irish creditors pursued him and had him jailed in Dundee . Later , Johnston became part-owner ( with James Morris ) and lessee of the new ' small but handsome ' Ayr Theatre , which had a list of 40 founding subscribers . It opened in Fort Street on 30th October 1815 , with the ' admired comedy ' of The Honeymoon and the farce of Raising the Wind ' . Johnstons company included players from Edinburgh , Newcastle and London . Press notices indicate that Mrs Clarke and Mrs Garrick , both from the Theatre Royal , Covent Garden would appear for a few nights . This Theatre , variously known as the New Theatre or the Queen 's Rooms ( for concerts ) , as well as the Theatre Royal , accommodated 600 . The Edinburgh Company of William Murray with Mrs Harriet Siddons and the Glasgow Company under Frank Seymour completed seasons at this Theatre . However the Post Office Directory for Ayr , published in 1830 relates that the Theatre '.... was got up in the year 1812 , under the supervision of Henry Erskine Johnston Esq . by a company of subscribers , consisting of forty - four , at twenty - five pounds each . The Theatre has never rewarded the enterprising zeal and exertions of the projectors , there being comparatively little encouragement in Ayr even for the first rate stars . The last lessee was Mr Seymour . The Theatre is lighted by gas , which through the excessive carelessness of the stage - managers is rendered perfectly intolerable . It is occasionally used as a place of worship , as a dancing and ball - room , and at times let out for the accommodation of lectures , magicians , and strolling adventurers . ' James Morris , part owner of the Theatre Royal ( and of a Theatre in Kilmarnock in the 1830s and 40s ) and a friend of Horatio and Arthur Lloyd - has left a record of many of the activities within the Theatre between 1815 and its closure in the 1870's He relates that Kean appeared at the Theatre Royal as Richard the Third , travelling from his home in Bute to Campbeltown and sailing on to Ayr for four appearances in that role . Arthur Lloyd is known to have performed here in April 1862 . Other players known to have visited the Theatre Royal included Charles Mackay ( the inimitable Baillie Nicol Jarvie ) , sometime resident in Ayr and the comedian Horatio Lloyd , famous for his comic walk . Other figures who appeared at the Theatre Royal , during those early years , include Macready , Miss Foote , Mr. and Mrs. Wood , Miss Helen Faucit , and Miss Stephens . Gustavus V Brooke was also in Ayr as an actor / manager . Over the years , the Theatre provided a home for music . Both Braham and Templeton , noted tenors , appeared in the house . Other singers of note included John Sinclair , John Wilson and Gale . In 1832 Paganini played two concerts at the Theatre . Tickets were priced at 7s 6d , 5s , and 3s 6d . Paganini was promised a fee of \u00a3 100 for his appearance but it appears that the manager ( Frank Seymour ) decamped with the funds . Seymour was an expert in this tactic . Thereafter , Paganini always demanded a fee in advance , asserting that he would play better with the cash in his back pocket . The building still stands at the top of Fort Street , and is now the Ayr Baptist Church .

For a prime site on the Low Green facing over the Firth of Clyde the Corporation of Ayr held an architectural competition in 1904 to design a Pavilion which would express the prosperity of Ayr and its position as one of the main holiday resorts on the Clyde coast . The winning architect was James Hunter Kennedy and the stylish Pavilion opened in 1911 , complete with its long narrow auditorium and horseshoe gallery , seating 1200 in total ( now some 600 ) , and promenade accommodation for 1300 more , with refreshment and retiring rooms . Set in promenade gardens , with putting greens adjacent , it has tall elegant Italianate towers at each corner . A Winter Garden fronting it ( but dismantled in the 1970s ) provided lunches and teas , and a place to change after enjoying the Green or beach . Ben Popplewell took over the lease in 1913 . He was a stockbroker who made money from running music hall entertainments in Bradford`s Frizinghall Pavilion , the name he gave to the former concert hall of the 1904 Bradford Exhibition , after dismantling and re-siting the building . In the Ayr Pavilion he presented a whole range of performers including Harry Lauder , Florrie Forde and Fred Karno . The Theatre gained a reputation as the \" house that rocks with laughter \" . In 1918 the lease was taken over by the Collins Variety Agencies of Glasgow until 1922 when they started developing their own circuit of Theatres , most notably the Pavilion Theatre , Glasgow , the Theatre Royal , Edinburgh and the Shakespeare Theatre , Liverpool . Fred Collins added a whole range of new artistes including a young Tommy Morgan and Dave Willis . Ben Popplewell came back to Ayr and by agreement with Collins resumed the lease . Three years later he bought the Gaiety and concentrated variety there , but continued the family`s interest in the Pavilion into the 1960`s . For four seasons , starting in 1926 , the Charlie Kemble 's Entertainers were the summer residents . During the 1930 `s it served as a dance hall and concert venue . When America entered WWII the US Air Force took over Prestwick airport in 1943 , making it their largest and busiest air base in Britain , and they brought a special wood from America to lay a new dance floor in the Pavilion . After the war ice skating seasons were introduced . Dances remained popular , including outdoors dancing . In the 1950s and 60s jazz bands from all over Britain entertained the dancers . To be followed by rock bands . In 1974 the scenery grid and stage were restored , and the balcony refurbished , by Ayr Intimate Opera , allowing their productions of opera , often with sets from Scottish Opera , over the next 10 years ; and the classical Ayr Concert Series with visiting orchestras , instrumentalists and choirs . It was a venue for many events including the British Chess Championships . The Pavilion later became a discotheque and night club . Currently it is operated as Pirate Pete`s Adventure Play Centre for families .

This system is used in major cities all over the world and is based on personal choice - motorists can drive if the convenience is worth the fee , or use alternatives like transit , biking , or walking . Or , they can choose to travel during less - congested times if they feel it is not worth paying to drive into the priced area during peak periods . The revenues from congestion charges are used to fund transportation improvements , such as better transit service , road improvements , and bicycle and pedestrian projects . Will it work in San Francisco ? This is the question the Study is meant to answer . Congestion pricing has worked in other cities and has the potential to improve San Francisco 's congestion problem as well . Preliminary analyses indicate that a feasible \" right - sized \" program can be designed for San Francisco that enhances mobility and access to the downtown while maintaining economic vitality . Any congestion pricing program considered for San Francisco will need to be shaped by our city 's principles with the broad goal of achieving a more vibrant and livable city for residents , workers , businesses , and visitors . What are the goals of congestion pricing ? Two of the most precious resources to Bay Area residents are our time and our environment . Congestion pricing is a solution that can potentially protect both of these resources . By managing congestion where it does exist and improving overall mobility in the city , travelers would waste less time in traffic or planning around unreliable commute times . The goals of pricing are consistent with the City 's \" Transit First \" and \" Clean and Green \" policies . In this way , the long - term goal of congestion pricing is to provide a means for sustainable growth of the city . How bad is the congestion problem and where / when does it exist ? There are over one million trips in and out of the combined Downtown , SOMA , and Civic Center areas on an average weekday . About half of daily travelers to these areas are driving in cars , while about 30 % take transit . During the peak commute hours , about 40 % of travelers to and from downtown , SOMA , and Civic Center use transit . Approximately half of daily travel to the area we are studying originates outside San Francisco and approaches the city by a limited number of congested regional routes , namely 101 , 280 , and the Golden Gate and Bay Bridges . Over 60 % of the surface streets in downtown San Francisco average less than 10 mph in peak periods . Many congested auto routes are also high ridership transit routes , so our most important transit services also suffer from these slow speeds . ABOUT THE STUDY What are the goals of the Study ? The Mobility , Access and Pricing Study will explore the feasibility of congestion pricing through technical , economic , financial , and legal / institutional evaluations of alternative pricing and mobility packages . The Study will also involve the public in the design and evaluation of these alternatives , including assessing their respective benefits , costs , and impacts . Why is San Francisco looking at congestion pricing now ? Traffic congestion in San Francisco restricts mobility and threatens the city 's overall quality of life and economic competitiveness . At the same time , the city seeks to add significant amounts of new housing and jobs in a way that is environmentally sustainable . San Franciscans have always valued being at the forefront of innovative solutions to the challenges faced in urban environments . What 's more , a grant of $ 1 million from the federal government to study congestion pricing , and the potential for additional federal funds for implementation , make it an opportune time to investigate the policy 's applicability to San Francisco . What is the current status of the study ? We are currently nearing completion of the Study and will be sharing our evaluation of potential congestion pricing scenarios at a series of public workshops beginning December 2 . We shared preliminary findings and gathered public input during our previous round of public outreach in Summer 2008 . The Study will be finalized in early 2009 with the completion a final report , which will be presented to the public and elected officials . What is the timeline for this Study ? The Study is scheduled to be completed in February 2009 . Preliminary results will be presented at public meetings in December 2008 , and we then will finalize our results and present a comprehensive report on the benefits and impacts of congestion pricing . Will there be opportunities for public input ? Yes , public input is an important part of the Study . The Authority is hosting a third series of public workshops in December . Public involvement efforts also include direct outreach to local and regional interests , such as presentations to community groups and civic organizations . Targeted market research activities , including polls and focus groups , are being conducted throughout the Study . Additionally , the Study is informed by the ongoing involvement of several stakeholder advisory groups , including representatives from local and regional transportation agencies , motorists and transit riders , members of the business community , and the Authority 's Citizens Advisory Committee . ON CONGESTION PRICING What would the fee be for driving into the charged area ? This is one of the key questions that will be addressed in the Study . The fees charged in cities where such a system has been implemented vary in the amount charged , payment and enforcement mechanisms , and variability depending on the time of day . Stockholm and London give us two different models . The current charge in London is $ 16 ( \u00a3 8 ) per day . In Stockholm , the charge varies between about $ 1.50 ( 10 kr ) and $ 3.00 ( 20 kr ) per trip , depending on time of day , with a maximum charge of about $ 8.60 ( 60 kr ) per day . Our Study will explore the various forms congestion pricing can take and seek the right model for San Francisco . How would you define the priced roadways or area ? In general , candidates for congestion pricing are areas with high levels of existing and projected traffic , low running speeds , and unreliable travel times for autos and transit . All of these measures are indicators of congestion . Other factors include whether an area is expected to have future economic or housing growth and the availability of robust transit options for local and regional travelers as an alternative to automobile trips . What are the potential congestion pricing options by location , fee level , and time of day ? There are two basic options for congestion pricing in this context . The first is pricing for driving in a defined area or zone . The second is pricing entry points or gateways leading into congested areas in San Francisco . The charges could be assessed either as a single daily charge or as a charge levied each time a specific location is crossed , similar to current bridge tolls . In addition , the fee could change as congestion varies throughout the day . Cities that have implemented congestion pricing typically levy the charge only on weekdays beginning in the morning and ending in the early evening . Would there be exemptions for any groups ? What about people living within the charged area , low income people , people with disabilities , hybrid cars , taxis , motorcycles , etc .? This is a question we will explore during the Study . London currently offers discounts or exemptions for residents of the charging zone and certain vehicle types . Stockholm offers exemptions for alternative fuel vehicles , motorcycles , mopeds , and for people with disabilities . We are exploring the possibility of similar discounts as part of this Study . Potential discounts include fleet rates for commercial vehicles and rental cars , a \" fee \" - bate for bridge toll - payers , and a substantial discount for low-income drivers . We are also studying exemptions for taxis and disabled motorists . The Study will assess the technical and financial implications of implementing these policies , and solicit public input on these policies . How much would it cost to set up and run this system ? Again , this is a question that the Study is meant to answer . The existing systems in London and Stockholm give us an indication of the potential costs and financial returns associated with a congestion pricing program . The London system cost about $ 307 million ( US $ ) to set up and $ 150 million to operate the first year . In the 2006/2007 fiscal year , the London system generated net revenues of $ 250 million ( \u00a3 123 million ) , which the city uses to improve its public transportation system and transportation infrastructure . The seven-month Stockholm congestion pricing trial cost $ 260 million ( US $ ) to set up and $ 70 million to operate . Now fully - implemented , the city 's program generates approximately $ 50 million in net revenue per year . The estimated cost to implement and operate congestion pricing in San Francisco will ultimately depend on the program design and the specific technology used . Who would pay for it ? The goal is for the system to be self-funding . That is , the revenues from congestion pricing should pay for the system and the cost of operations . Both London and Stockholm have shown that operating costs can be covered by congestion charging revenues . The Study will explore how initial start up costs can be funded . It is worth noting that the federal government recently made up to $ 1 billion available for these types of programs . Would bridge tolls stay the same ? Yes - the study is not looking at changing any bridge tolls . What would the revenues generated from the congestion charge be used for ? This question will be answered by the Study . Congestion pricing revenue would be reinvested in the transportation system , including upgrades to transit operations , such as improved service on San Francisco 's express routes and rapid corridors and on key regional transit routes . Improvements to the city 's streets would also be funded by a congestion pricing program . These improvements could include signal timing , street resurfacing , bike lane and pedestrian improvements , and real - time information systems . How much revenue could a congestion pricing program in San Francisco raise ? Estimates of the revenues that could be raised in San Francisco should be available in the coming months . In London , the system generates over $ 200 million ( US $ ) in net revenue per year . About $ 50 million is generated annually in Stockholm , a more similarly sized city to San Francisco . OTHER QUESTIONS Would there be improved access for bicyclists and pedestrians ? Yes . The revenues generated by congestion pricing would be used to fund a variety of improvements to the entire street environment , including enhancements for bicyclists and pedestrians . Is this just a way to help with Muni 's budget deficit ? The goal of congestion pricing is not to generate revenue , but to manage congestion and improve mobility . The revenue generated by a congestion pricing system is an added benefit that would allow San Francisco to provide accompanying improvements to transit , our streets , and other transportation infrastructure . Is any other U.S. city contemplating this ? Congestion pricing is used in London , Singapore , Rome , Stockholm , and Norway , among other cities . In the U.S. , congestion pricing has primarily been applied to carpool lanes , known as HOT lanes ( San Diego , Minneapolis ) , as well as through toll roads ( Orange County ) and parking ( Redwood City ) . Seattle is also planning to price a major bridge which serves as a gateway to the city center . New York studied congestion pricing and was set to receive $ 350 million in federal funding to implement area pricing in Manhattan on all streets south of 86th Street . However , despite support from the Mayor , the City Council , the business community , and transit advocates , the New York state legislature tabled the necessary legislation to implement a congestion pricing program and the federal monies were lost . New York will continue to study the possibility of implementing a program . The system in London has been in place since 2003 , and the program has been so popular that the pricing area was recently expanded . Before congestion pricing was implemented , traffic in central London was flowing at 2 - 5mph . Now it averages 10mph . Most displaced drivers switched to transit , and businesses have remained healthy . Congestion pricing has resulted in a reduction in congestion , an increase in public transit use , decreased pollution , and improved bus service ( with more regular schedules ) . In Stockholm , congestion pricing was instituted in 2006 for a seven-month trial implementation , which was followed by a public referendum on the program and permanent implementation in 2007 . The Stockholm program has reduced traffic by 22 % and reduced CO2 emissions by more than 10 % . Prior to the trial implementation , public opinion in Stockholm , as in London , was two -thirds against congestion pricing . Public support eventually rose to two -thirds as people came to understand the policy and the associated benefits . Does this only apply within the bounds of San Francisco ? What about all of the other congested areas in the Bay Area ? San Francisco is only looking at the potential for congestion pricing on streets and roads within San Francisco , not outside of the city . While the congestion charge would be on local facilities , the effects ( and potential congestion relief benefits ) would be far-reaching , as many of the vehicle trips traveling on our streets in congested periods originate outside the city . Congestion pricing revenues would also potentially be used to enhance regional transit services . Similar programs are being explored in other parts of the region . Alameda County and Santa Clara County are implementing a High Occupancy Toll lane in the I -680 corridor ( allowing single occupant drivers to use the HOV lane for a fee that varies with the amount of traffic in the HOV lane ) and both counties are looking at applying HOT lanes to other parts of their freeway network . Redwood City has implemented variable parking pricing , and other cities in the region are also studying this strategy . What does this mean for downtown businesses , especially small businesses ? The Study is assessing this question . In London , large businesses supported pricing while some small businesses felt that the charge affected sales . However , several years after the system was implemented , it has been found that businesses within the charged zone are growing faster than businesses outside the zone . This is consistent with earlier studies that found evidence of higher spending levels in Central London by transit users and pedestrians as compared with automobile drivers . In Stockholm , sales within the charged zone have seen an increase in sales of 5 % , in part because the charging system requires drivers to pay to both enter and exit the zone . This gives central Stockholm shoppers an incentive to shop locally rather than drive out to the suburbs . We 've recently conducted an economic intercept surveys of downtown shoppers and have found that about two -thirds of individuals visiting downtown currently travel there on foot or by transit and that they spend as much as , if not more than , drivers shopping downtown over the course of a month . Clearly , driving in downtown San Francisco now is n't cheap or easy . With a congestion pricing program in place , it is possible that downtown businesses will see an increase in customer traffic - including foot traffic - simply because traveling downtown would be faster , easier , and more pleasant . Would there be an impact on public health and safety ? With congestion pricing , we would certainly see a positive impact on public safety because traffic flow would be smoothed and the congestion fee revenues would be reinvested in pedestrian safety projects . London saw a 7 % decline in car crashes and a 6 % decline in crashes involving pedestrians . Bicycling was also up considerably ( by about one - third ) in London , for example . What are the environmental impacts of congestion on San Francisco ? We do n't seem to have smog . As in most urban areas , motorists in San Francisco and throughout the Bay Area generate significant amounts of polluting emissions and greenhouse gases . The city 's unique topography and weather mean that emissions rarely manifest as smog , as might occur in inland areas . Still , local residents understand the need to reduce our impact on the environment . Both Governor Schwarzenegger and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom have established aggressive greenhouse gas reduction goals *. Innovative and proactive congestion management measures will be a key component of efforts to reach these goals . Congestion pricing has been found to be an effective tool in this regard , reducing CO2 emissions in Stockholm by more than 10 % and in London by 16 % . * Executive Order S305 : Reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 ( CA Climate Action Team ) . SF Climate Action Plan : Reduce GHG emissions 20 % below 1990 levels by 2012 ( SF Department of the Environment ) .

The discussion of institutional and collective \u201c blind spots \u201d that prevent the formation of \u201c cross - sector action groups \u201d is particularly relevant to development where mechanisms in tackling these problems cross -sectorally have been scarce . \u2013 Frannie L\u00e9autier","annotations":[{"text":"political leaders","span":[7174,7190],"token_span":[1276,1277],"role":"Experiencer","label":"Experiencer","role_definition":"The Experiencer is the person or sentient entity that experiences or feels the emotions."},{"text":"civil servants","span":[7194,7207],"token_span":[1279,1280],"role":"Experiencer","label":"Experiencer","role_definition":"The Experiencer is the person or sentient entity that experiences or feels the emotions."},{"text":"managers","span":[7215,7222],"token_span":[1283,1283],"role":"Experiencer","label":"Experiencer","role_definition":"The Experiencer is the person or sentient entity that experiences or feels the emotions."},{"text":"clients","span":[7323,7329],"token_span":[1298,1298],"role":"Other","label":"Other","role_definition":"The Other is the person that evokes the emotional response in the Experiencer."},{"text":"clients ' perspectives","span":[7323,7344],"token_span":[1298,1300],"role":"Situation","label":"Situation","role_definition":"The Situation is the circumstances or topic about which the Experiencer feels an emotion."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-2366-527-frame-Others_situation_as_stimulus","frame":"Others_situation_as_stimulus","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Experiencer feels an emotion as evoked as an Other.","frame_ancestors":["Emotions_by_stimulus","Emotions","State"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"We understand that The Weeknd is disappointed at not being nominated .

In keeping with the teaching of Scripture and consistent with our position as a Christian denomination we will only recognise marriages between biological male and female . Therefore , in exercising their freedom of thought , conscience and religion we wish to make it absolutely plain that we anticipate that ministers in our denomination will not be conducting same sex marriages in any of our churches . Marriage is a holy institution given by God for the monogamous , lifelong , marital union of men and women . As apostasy from God and His Word deepens in our nation , all kinds of immorality abound throughout society . The consequence of this increasing immorality is that God 's institution of marriage is constantly treated with scorn as a sinful people give vent to their corrupt lusts . Sadly , in a relatively short period of time , there has been an alarming abandonment of the teaching of Scripture on marriage as ordained by God . This contempt for Biblical marriage includes , not only the abandonment of it as a divine institution , but also direct attack upon it in the promotion and acceptance of so-called same - sex marriage . The legislation of same sex marriage violates the law of God as Creator and offends God as the Judge of all . We would remind the powers that be of the Scriptural warning that God is not mocked and that legislators of evil will be called to give account at the Great Judgment Day . If you would like more information about the topic please contact the Moderator Rev Gordon Dane at the email given above . \u201c \u2026 for the word of God , and for the testimony of Jesus Christ . \u201d Revelation 1 verse 9 GENERAL PRESBYTERY OF THE FREE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH OF ULSTER PRESS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 2020 Rev Gordon Dane : Moderator Rev John Greer : Clerk of Presbytery Phone : 07709117500 email : gbdane@btinternet.com FREE PRESBYTERIANS URGE POLITICIANS TO STOP ABORTION AND SAME SEX MARRIAGE The Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster views the introduction of same sex marriage and abortion into Northern Ireland with deep concern . At the start of the talks process which is taking place at Stormont these were some of the central issues . We are concerned that those Members of Parliament from outside the Province who proposed that these measures be introduced to Northern Ireland have been able to contaminate the talks process by giving in to the demands of some . We would urge all politicians who oppose the current \u201c liberal \u201d social agenda that wants to attack the traditional family structure of society and kill the unborn to stand fast and raise these issues as part of the talks process . We are concerned at the refusal of the Secretary of State to meet us on these matters . If you would like more information about the topic please contact the Moderator Rev Gordon Dane at the email given above . \u201c \u2026 for the word of God , and for the testimony of Jesus Christ . \u201d Revelation 1 verse 9 REAFFIRMATION OF THIS PRESBYTERY'S POSITION ON MARRIAGE IN THE LIGHT OF THE INCREASING ABANDONMENT OF BIBLICAL TEACHING ON THE MATTER As apostasy from God and His Word deepens in our nation , all kinds of immorality abound throughout society . The consequence of every aspect of this increasing immorality is that God 's institution of marriage is constantly treated with scorn as a sinful people give vent to their corrupt lusts . Sadly , in a relatively short period of time , there has been an alarming abandonment of the teaching of Scripture on marriage as ordained by God . This contempt for Biblical marriage includes , not only the abandonment of it as a divine institution , but also direct attack upon it in the promotion and acceptance of so-called same - sex marriage . Legislation to allow same - sex marriage in England and Wales was passed by the Parliament of the UK , July 2013 . In Scotland the legislation of same - sex marriage was passed by the Scottish Parliament , February 2014 . Currently there is an increasing lobby for its legislation in Northern Ireland . Those who spearhead this lobby do so in defiance of God 's moral law and with arrogant contempt toward those who wish to honour the Lord 's revealed will for marriage . Moreover , this attack upon the divine institution of marriage , through favour and acceptance being shown toward same - sex marriage , is witnessed in varying degrees among visible bodies within professing ' Christendom ' in the UK . In such a day it is the duty of every section of Christ 's Church to remain faithful to Scripture on the subject of marriage and to reaffirm in a public manner a clear , Biblically - based position on this issue . That is the purpose of this position paper as formulated by the Officers of the General Presbytery of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster . We believe that this reaffirmation is in keeping with the ordination vow taken by all ministers and ruling elders in which they promise before God to believe \u201c \u2026 the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments not merely to contain but to be the verbally inspired Word of the Living God , the only infallible rule of faith and practice . \u201d This vow in relation to Scripture binds our consciences on what God has revealed about the institution of marriage . GOD'S INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE In Genesis 1:27 Moses writes \u2013 \u201c So God created man in His own image , in the image of God created He him ; male and female created He them . \u201d This is a general statement of the creation of man in God 's image but stressing distinction of gender . In Genesis 2 the Holy Spirit gives us some of the finer details , not only of human creation but of the institution of marriage also . The account of the two events melt into one as is especially seen in the record of the creation of Eve . The striking fact is that while Eve was taken from Adam in her creation , she was then joined to him again by the act of marriage . This is the import of Adam 's words in v.23 \u2013 \u201c And Adam said , ' This is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh . \u201d Adam 's words indicate that the beautiful creature brought to him by God was of the same species and nature as he possessed ; a human being like him . Yet at the same time he knew that there was a difference , indicated by his next words \u2013 \u201c \u2026 she shall be called Woman , because she was taken out of Man . \u201d In our English translation , but even more especially in the Hebrew original , it is seen that the man and the woman , while the same in nature , were different in gender . The Hebrew word for ' man ' is ISH \u2013 one sense of the word being that it signifies husband . But the Hebrew word for ' woman ' is ISHA \u2013 indicating one who is designed by God to be a wife . The clear message is that the creation of Eve paved the way for the divine institution of marriage . God 's intention for marriage was that marriage would be constituted by two human beings coming together ; but two people of different genders \u2013 male and female , as the Hebrew words ISH and ISHA signify . This fact is then reinforced by the divine comment in v.24 \u2013 \u201c Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh . \u201d Again , the word for man in this verse is ISH . The word for ' wife ' is the same Hebrew word as for ' woman ' in v.23 . So , the verse could be read \u2013 \u201c \u2026 a husband shall leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his woman and they shall be one flesh . \u201d The Genesis 2 record of the divine institution of marriage is fundamental to a Biblical view of marriage . It undergirds all that the rest of Scripture has to say on the subject . It contains the implicit warning that any attempt to erode God 's revealed will for marriage \u2013 such as is inherent within same - sex marriage \u2013 will bring His just displeasure . In addition , Genesis 2 makes it incumbent upon Christ 's Church to be the voice for God 's institution of marriage when that institution is under virulent attack by the same - sex marriage agenda . CHRIST'S PROPHETIC WARNING ABOUT THE LAST DAYS The Lord Jesus Christ , the only Head of the Church , in Luke 17:28 -30 delivers teaching that shows that the sin of same - sex or sodomite practices will mark the last days . In these verses the Lord draws a parallel between the days of Lot and the time of His Second Advent . In the course of what He teaches , the Lord specifically verifies the historicity of the destruction of Sodom . He declares \u2013 \u201c \u2026 the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all . \u201d Certainly the focus of Christ in Luke 17 is on the sudden destruction that will come on sinners at His coming just as sudden destruction came on the people of Sodom . However , other Scriptures such as Genesis 19 make it exceedingly clear that the sin for which the people of Sodom and its partner cities were destroyed was the sin of same - sex alliances . Therefore , in the parallel that Christ draws in Luke 17 , there is surely the inference at least that the sin that brought God 's wrath on Sodom will characterise the times that precede His coming again . In the light of the global acceptance of same - sex or sodomite behaviour , Christ 's Church would do well to heed His prophetic warning in Luke 17 . GOD'S ABHORRENCE OF SAME-SEX SIN ABOVE OTHER SINS Our Shorter Catechism teaches that while every sin deserves God 's wrath and curse , yet there are some sins that are more heinous than others . Scripture leaves us in no doubt that same - sex partnerships at any level constitute sin that is heinous in the sight of God and is utterly abhorrent to Him . It is a sin that God specifically abominates , Leviticus 18:22 ; 20:13 . The language used plainly speaks of a sexual alliance between men ; and declares that \u201c \u2026 they have committed an abomination . \u201d In Romans 1:24 - 28 Paul describes the state of the Gentile world of the 1st century . His description plainly refers to same - sex sin on the part of men with men and women with women , vs.26 - 27 . His exposure of this sin reveals that when nations and peoples are overrun by such sin it is a sign that they have been abandoned or given up by God . In Jude v.7 the sinners of Sodom and its associated cities \u201c \u2026 are set forth for an example , suffering the vengeance of eternal fire . \u201d It is very striking that while the Spirit could have presented other Old Testament examples of sinners enduring such suffering , He chooses Sodom and its allies . His choice underlines the divine abhorrence of same - sex sin . FORGIVENESS FOR ALL WHO REPENT OF SAME-SEX ALLIANCES While Almighty God abhors the sin of sodomy and will judge all who refuse to repent of this sin , yet He is merciful to those who turn from it and seek forgiveness through Christ 's one atoning sacrifice . This is the clear teaching of the Spirit of God in 1 Corinthians 6:9 - 11 . The sin of sodomy is in view in the particular sins that Paul highlights . In v.9 the Apostle includes those who are \u201c \u2026 effeminate , \u201d and \u201c \u2026 abusers of themselves with mankind . \u201d These terms refer to both passive and active participants in same - sex relationships ; thus debarring those who are guilty from entering the kingdom of God . However , v.11 gives the assurance that where there is repentance from such sin , for the penitent one there is cleansing from this sin , to be set apart to live a holy life through Christ , accepted and declared righteous by God in justification . CONCLUDING AFFIRMATION In the light of these Scriptures this Presbytery affirms : \u2022 That marriage between one man and one woman was ordained of God and is therefore a divine institution ; \u2022 That since civil government is to base its laws on marriage upon divine law , the law of the land should uphold the divine institution of marriage . It follows \u2013 \u2022 That while marriage is also a civil contract , no civil government has the right to change the divine institution of marriage ; \u2022 That the introduction and legislation of so-called same - sex partnerships or marriages by the state is a violation of God 's moral law in relation to marriage and is abhorrent to Him ; \u2022 That all ministers and elders of the General Presbytery of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster , who at ordination subscribed the Westminster Confession of Faith , which in Ch.24 , Section 1 states that \u201c Marriage is to be between one man and one woman , \u201d are thereby before God bound by that ordination oath not only to uphold the divine institution of marriage between male and female but are also required not to condone or endorse any same - sex or sodomite alliance . It follows , therefore \u2013 \u2022 That as ministers and elders of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster , being bound by our adherence to the infallible Scriptures and by our ordination vow to defend the truths of the said Scriptures ; we hereby re-affirm our adherence to its unchanging and unchangeable teaching on the divine and sacred institution of marriage and our opposition to acceptance and promotion of same - sex alliances .","annotations":[{"text":"SAME-SEX ALLIANCES","span":[11012,11029],"token_span":[2084,2085],"role":"Offense","label":"Offense","role_definition":"This role denotes the the illegal act that the Offender is pardoned for."},{"text":"Almighty God","span":[11037,11048],"token_span":[2087,2088],"role":"Authority","label":"Authority","role_definition":"Authority is the organization or person taht grants the pardon."},{"text":"to both passive and active participants in same - sex relationships","span":[11514,11580],"token_span":[2184,2194],"role":"Offender","label":"Offender","role_definition":"This role denotes the offender that seeks or gets the pardon."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"The Puritan notion of \" heart work . \" The goodness and grace ( unmerited favour ) of God , particularly the saving grace and forgiveness that comes through the redemption that is found in Christ Jesus .

In keeping with the teaching of Scripture and consistent with our position as a Christian denomination we will only recognise marriages between biological male and female . Therefore , in exercising their freedom of thought , conscience and religion we wish to make it absolutely plain that we anticipate that ministers in our denomination will not be conducting same sex marriages in any of our churches . Marriage is a holy institution given by God for the monogamous , lifelong , marital union of men and women . As apostasy from God and His Word deepens in our nation , all kinds of immorality abound throughout society . The consequence of this increasing immorality is that God 's institution of marriage is constantly treated with scorn as a sinful people give vent to their corrupt lusts . Sadly , in a relatively short period of time , there has been an alarming abandonment of the teaching of Scripture on marriage as ordained by God . This contempt for Biblical marriage includes , not only the abandonment of it as a divine institution , but also direct attack upon it in the promotion and acceptance of so-called same - sex marriage . The legislation of same sex marriage violates the law of God as Creator and offends God as the Judge of all . We would remind the powers that be of the Scriptural warning that God is not mocked and that legislators of evil will be called to give account at the Great Judgment Day .

At the start of the talks process which is taking place at Stormont these were some of the central issues . We are concerned that those Members of Parliament from outside the Province who proposed that these measures be introduced to Northern Ireland have been able to contaminate the talks process by giving in to the demands of some . We would urge all politicians who oppose the current \u201c liberal \u201d social agenda that wants to attack the traditional family structure of society and kill the unborn to stand fast and raise these issues as part of the talks process .

The consequence of every aspect of this increasing immorality is that God 's institution of marriage is constantly treated with scorn as a sinful people give vent to their corrupt lusts . Sadly , in a relatively short period of time , there has been an alarming abandonment of the teaching of Scripture on marriage as ordained by God . This contempt for Biblical marriage includes , not only the abandonment of it as a divine institution , but also direct attack upon it in the promotion and acceptance of so-called same - sex marriage . Legislation to allow same - sex marriage in England and Wales was passed by the Parliament of the UK , July 2013 . In Scotland the legislation of same - sex marriage was passed by the Scottish Parliament , February 2014 . Currently there is an increasing lobby for its legislation in Northern Ireland . Those who spearhead this lobby do so in defiance of God 's moral law and with arrogant contempt toward those who wish to honour the Lord 's revealed will for marriage . Moreover , this attack upon the divine institution of marriage , through favour and acceptance being shown toward same - sex marriage , is witnessed in varying degrees among visible bodies within professing ' Christendom ' in the UK . In such a day it is the duty of every section of Christ 's Church to remain faithful to Scripture on the subject of marriage and to reaffirm in a public manner a clear , Biblically - based position on this issue . That is the purpose of this position paper as formulated by the Officers of the General Presbytery of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster . We believe that this reaffirmation is in keeping with the ordination vow taken by all ministers and ruling elders in which they promise before God to believe \u201c \u2026 the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments not merely to contain but to be the verbally inspired Word of the Living God , the only infallible rule of faith and practice . \u201d This vow in relation to Scripture binds our consciences on what God has revealed about the institution of marriage . GOD'S INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE In Genesis 1:27 Moses writes \u2013 \u201c So God created man in His own image , in the image of God created He him ; male and female created He them . \u201d This is a general statement of the creation of man in God 's image but stressing distinction of gender . In Genesis 2 the Holy Spirit gives us some of the finer details , not only of human creation but of the institution of marriage also . The account of the two events melt into one as is especially seen in the record of the creation of Eve . The striking fact is that while Eve was taken from Adam in her creation , she was then joined to him again by the act of marriage . This is the import of Adam 's words in v.23 \u2013 \u201c And Adam said , ' This is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh . \u201d Adam 's words indicate that the beautiful creature brought to him by God was of the same species and nature as he possessed ; a human being like him . Yet at the same time he knew that there was a difference , indicated by his next words \u2013 \u201c \u2026 she shall be called Woman , because she was taken out of Man . \u201d In our English translation , but even more especially in the Hebrew original , it is seen that the man and the woman , while the same in nature , were different in gender . The Hebrew word for ' man ' is ISH \u2013 one sense of the word being that it signifies husband . But the Hebrew word for ' woman ' is ISHA \u2013 indicating one who is designed by God to be a wife . The clear message is that the creation of Eve paved the way for the divine institution of marriage . God 's intention for marriage was that marriage would be constituted by two human beings coming together ; but two people of different genders \u2013 male and female , as the Hebrew words ISH and ISHA signify . This fact is then reinforced by the divine comment in v.24 \u2013 \u201c Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh . \u201d Again , the word for man in this verse is ISH . The word for ' wife ' is the same Hebrew word as for ' woman ' in v.23 . So , the verse could be read \u2013 \u201c \u2026 a husband shall leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his woman and they shall be one flesh . \u201d The Genesis 2 record of the divine institution of marriage is fundamental to a Biblical view of marriage .

The agreement , signed on Thursday after months of negotiations , paves the way for a return to public and possibly political life for Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , who holds an almost unparalleled record of human rights abuses . These include indiscriminate shelling of civilians , targeted assassinations of intellectuals and disappearances of political opponents . Hekmatyar 's followers are accused of throwing acid at women and of running an underground torture prison in Pakistan . In a central , upper-class Kabul neighbourhood , a group of young activists organised a protest against the pardoning of the man known as the Butcher of Kabul , coinciding with the signing ceremony less than a mile away . Placards picturing Hekmatyar with blood spilling from his mouth and a rocket through his nose read : \u201c We will never forgive the executioner of Kabul . \u201d The accord also allows for the release of Hezb - i-Islami prisoners , and obligates the Afghan government to pay for security in two or three locations inside Afghanistan where the group can choose to settle its leadership . Human Rights Watch called the deal \u201c an affront to victims of grave abuses \u201d . \u201c [ Hekmatyar 's ] return will compound the culture of impunity that the Afghan government and its foreign donors have fostered by not pursuing accountability for the many victims of forces commanded by Hekmatyar and other warlords that laid waste to much of the country in the 1990s , \u201d the organisation said in a statement . Others see the inclusion of the armed opposition as a necessary step towards peace . In a working - class Kabul neighbourhood , where residents during the civil war were allied with Tajik commander Ahmad Shah Massoud , one of Hekmatyar 's foes , opinions were split . \u201c It is not a solution to keep fighting , \u201d said Abdul Samad , a middle - aged worker at a flour wholesale shop who lived through the civil war shelling . \u201c Everybody wants peace . Not just humans . Even the animals want peace . \u201d His 25 - year - old colleague , Mohammad Zarif , was of a different view . He was too young to remember the civil war , but said his uncle was killed by a Hezb - i-Islami rocket . \u201c I do n't want Hekmatyar to come to Kabul , \u201d he said . \u201c He is not honest . He will train suicide attackers , and if his supporters become parliamentarians , they will release suicide attackers from the prisons . \u201d Not only will Zarif face the return of Hekmatyar . He and other taxpayers will also help fund the insurgent leader 's security . The bill for residences , vehicles and guards for Hezb - i-Islami leadership have been reported to be as high as $ 4 m ( \u00a3 3 m ) . Hekmatyar , who has been in hiding since 1997 , has not yet returned to the capital . Neither he nor the country 's president , Ashraf Ghani , were present at the signing ceremony . Instead , the deal was inked by national security adviser Hanif Atmar , head of the High Peace Council Pir Sayed Ahmad Gailani and a Hezb - i-Islami delegation led by senior member Mohammad Amin Karim . Reading the peace accord aloud , the only female representative in the negotiation process , Habiba Sarobi , said Ghani and Hekmatyar will ratify the deal later . Hezb - i-Islami 's military significance has waned in recent years . In 2013 , the group conducted a suicide bombing that killed 10 Afghans and six American troops , but by then , that was a rare occurrence . Politically , however , loyalists of the movement have grown increasingly influential , and the peace accord permits them to run for office . The agreement had been discussed for months . The main sticking point , according to a western security official , was an article concerning the withdrawal of foreign forces . Hekmatyar has long refused to sign a deal as long as foreign troops are present in Afghanistan . The accord now stipulates that the two parties disagree on the matter , but that Hekmatyar commits to not supporting terrorism . The deal also obliges the Afghan authorities to work to have Hezb - i-Islami removed from the United Nations ' list of foreign terrorist organisations . Hekmatyar was designated by the US as a \u201c global terrorist \u201d in 2003 and blacklisted at Washington 's request by the UN the same year . Ibrahim Sadruddin , a young soldier in Kabul on leave , said inviting Hezb - i-Islami over to the government side would strengthen the security forces , weaken the morale of the Taliban and Islamic State , and show insurgents that entering the peace process could pay off . In that sense , Thursday 's peace accord can perhaps provide a blueprint for future negotiations with the country 's main insurgent group , the Taliban . Despite concerted efforts from the government , peace talks with the Taliban are dormant , and the militants show no sign of appeasement .

The agreement , signed on Thursday after months of negotiations , paves the way for a return to public and possibly political life for Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , who holds an almost unparalleled record of human rights abuses . These include indiscriminate shelling of civilians , targeted assassinations of intellectuals and disappearances of political opponents . Hekmatyar 's followers are accused of throwing acid at women and of running an underground torture prison in Pakistan . In a central , upper-class Kabul neighbourhood , a group of young activists organised a protest against the pardoning of the man known as the Butcher of Kabul , coinciding with the signing ceremony less than a mile away . Placards picturing Hekmatyar with blood spilling from his mouth and a rocket through his nose read : \u201c We will never forgive the executioner of Kabul . \u201d The accord also allows for the release of Hezb - i-Islami prisoners , and obligates the Afghan government to pay for security in two or three locations inside Afghanistan where the group can choose to settle its leadership . Human Rights Watch called the deal \u201c an affront to victims of grave abuses \u201d . \u201c [ Hekmatyar 's ] return will compound the culture of impunity that the Afghan government and its foreign donors have fostered by not pursuing accountability for the many victims of forces commanded by Hekmatyar and other warlords that laid waste to much of the country in the 1990s , \u201d the organisation said in a statement . Others see the inclusion of the armed opposition as a necessary step towards peace . In a working - class Kabul neighbourhood , where residents during the civil war were allied with Tajik commander Ahmad Shah Massoud , one of Hekmatyar 's foes , opinions were split . \u201c It is not a solution to keep fighting , \u201d said Abdul Samad , a middle - aged worker at a flour wholesale shop who lived through the civil war shelling . \u201c Everybody wants peace . Not just humans . Even the animals want peace . \u201d His 25 - year - old colleague , Mohammad Zarif , was of a different view . He was too young to remember the civil war , but said his uncle was killed by a Hezb - i-Islami rocket . \u201c I do n't want Hekmatyar to come to Kabul , \u201d he said . \u201c He is not honest . He will train suicide attackers , and if his supporters become parliamentarians , they will release suicide attackers from the prisons . \u201d Not only will Zarif face the return of Hekmatyar . He and other taxpayers will also help fund the insurgent leader 's security . The bill for residences , vehicles and guards for Hezb - i-Islami leadership have been reported to be as high as $ 4 m ( \u00a3 3 m ) . Hekmatyar , who has been in hiding since 1997 , has not yet returned to the capital . Neither he nor the country 's president , Ashraf Ghani , were present at the signing ceremony . Instead , the deal was inked by national security adviser Hanif Atmar , head of the High Peace Council Pir Sayed Ahmad Gailani and a Hezb - i-Islami delegation led by senior member Mohammad Amin Karim . Reading the peace accord aloud , the only female representative in the negotiation process , Habiba Sarobi , said Ghani and Hekmatyar will ratify the deal later . Hezb - i-Islami 's military significance has waned in recent years . In 2013 , the group conducted a suicide bombing that killed 10 Afghans and six American troops , but by then , that was a rare occurrence . Politically , however , loyalists of the movement have grown increasingly influential , and the peace accord permits them to run for office . The agreement had been discussed for months . The main sticking point , according to a western security official , was an article concerning the withdrawal of foreign forces . Hekmatyar has long refused to sign a deal as long as foreign troops are present in Afghanistan . The accord now stipulates that the two parties disagree on the matter , but that Hekmatyar commits to not supporting terrorism . The deal also obliges the Afghan authorities to work to have Hezb - i-Islami removed from the United Nations ' list of foreign terrorist organisations . Hekmatyar was designated by the US as a \u201c global terrorist \u201d in 2003 and blacklisted at Washington 's request by the UN the same year . Ibrahim Sadruddin , a young soldier in Kabul on leave , said inviting Hezb - i-Islami over to the government side would strengthen the security forces , weaken the morale of the Taliban and Islamic State , and show insurgents that entering the peace process could pay off . In that sense , Thursday 's peace accord can perhaps provide a blueprint for future negotiations with the country 's main insurgent group , the Taliban . Despite concerted efforts from the government , peace talks with the Taliban are dormant , and the militants show no sign of appeasement . After being embroiled in more than three decades of armed conflict , many residents believe continued fighting is futile . \u201c During the civil war , no side was innocent , \u201d said Karima , 39 . \u201c Hazaras , Uzbeks , Tajiks , Pashtuns \u2013 everybody committed crimes . \u201d She said the only solution was for long - time enemies to sit down and negotiate . \u201c Of course it is difficult , but we have to accept them .

So , you 've heard about jailbreaking , and it sounds intriguing . And dangerous . ( But mostly just intriguing . ) Here 's how to hack your i Phone , i Pod Touch or i Pad \u2014 yes , i Pad\u2014into an unrestricted , freshly empowered mega-machine . In buying an iProduct , you 're accepting that its fate will be dictated by Apple . They control what kind of apps you install on your device , which of the hardware functions you can exploit to their full potential , and which carrier you can use your i Phone with . They 've loosened up on at least one of those fronts in the last year or so , expanding the types of apps available in the App Store , but many \u2014 screw that , most \u2014 of the same restrictions still apply . Want to install an app that Apple has n't explicitly approved ? Sorry . Want to use an app over 3G that 's been designated for Wi-Fi ? Nope . Want to tether your phone ? Run applications in the background ? Change your device theme ? Install system - wide gestures ? No. Such . Luck . Enter jailbreaking . In technical terms , to jailbreak is to enable a device to run code , meaning programs or system modifications , that has n't been sanctioned by Apple . Its roots reach back to a time when there were no apps for i Phone OS , and a clever group of hackers zeroed in on some exploits gave people their first way to install apps on their devices , by way of an underground App Store called Installer . It used to be that you could hack your device simply by visiting a webpage . That was two years ago . Since then , the i Phone and i Pod Touch have been given a legit App Store , Apple has closed one security hole after another , and jailbreaking has become alternately more and less difficult , depending which device and software version you have . But just last week , a Windows and Mac tool called Spirit was released to the world . It 's simple , relatively safe , and finally , works on all devices . Every i Pod Touch can now be jailbroken to run custom apps . Every i Phone , too . Even the brand new i Pad can be hacked . Theming , data tethering , multitasking , console emulation , secret settings , and yes , you filthy thief , even pirated apps : With jailbreak , your i Thing is truly yours . Here 's how to jailbreak ( or in the case of phones , unlocked ) any i Pod Touch , i Phone or i Pad , using the new Spirit tool . But first , a disclaimer : When you jailbreak or unlock a device , you 're changing some fundamental aspects of the system software \u2014 you know , real low-level stuff . The tools are generally good , and if you follow directions carefully , you should be fine . But if something goes wrong \u2014 and there is more than one way this can happen \u2014 you can suffer data loss , or even brick your phone . Even worse , Apple claims that jailbreaking voids your warranty . You can restore your device to remove evidence that it ever happened , but if the device goes down while jailbroken , you could well be stuck . In addition , jailbreaking does not jibe with the DMCA , and breaks relate license agreements . To the point : Follow this guide at your own peril , know that there 's risk and be careful . Consult elsewhere if you 're nervous , or worry that I 've missed something . The Spirit tool has made the jailbreak fairly simple , but there 's still room for error . Step by step : What You Need : \u2022 Spirit Jailbreak Tool ( Windows and Mac ) \u2022 i Tunes 9.x ( Latest confirmed working version : 9.1.1 ) \u2022 i Pod cable \u2022 An iPad , i Phone or i Pod Touch that a. ) Is n't currently jailbroken ( obvious , but just in case ) , b. ) is working , i.e. not stuck in a startup loop , or displaying that \" Connect to i Tunes \" screen and c. ) is running a device software version 3.1.3 or lower ( or in the case of the iPad , version 3.2 ) 1 . Plug your device in , so that it 's recognized by i Tunes 2 . Back up your device to your iTunes library , and sync it . Having the backup handy will allow to you restore your settings in case you need to wipe your device later ; syncing everything \u2014 including photos , which some users report losing during the jailbreak process \u2014 ensures that all the media on your device will remain untouched , or at least restorable . 3 . Open the Spirit Jailbreak tool . It will open in a small window , and should display a message like \" i Pad ( 3.2 ) Connected . \" If not , disconnect and reconnect your device , and open the tool again . 4 . Click \" Jailbreak \" 5 . During the jailbreak routine , do n't interfere with the device . It 's probably better to leave your computer alone as well , to avoid a crash at a critical moment . First , you should see a screen on the device that says \" Restore Complete . \" The device will restart , display a spinning pinwheel icon , and open up a colorful screen like this , with a progress bar : Spirit should be done doing its thing in under 30 seconds . Your device should then boot up to your homescreen , as it was before \u2014 same background , same apps , same settings . Now you 're jailbroken . But there 's one more thing : 6 . When you restart your device , you 'll see a new icon on your homescreen , called Cydia . Open it up . This is your new App Store . Do n't worry , the regular App Store still works . Now you 've just got another one . Cydia will look a bit different on the iPad and i Phone or i Pod Touch , but will contain most of the same software . The first thing you need to do , though , is click the button that says , \" Make my life easier , thanks ! \" This will back up your device activation profile ( called an SHSH blob ) to remote servers , which ensures that you wo n't lose the ability to jailbreak if you accidentally upgrade your device device software in the future . More on that later . Regarding Unlocking Traditionally , unlocking ( opening your phone to use with different carriers ) and jailbreaking have fallen to the same tools . Since unlocking has become more difficult with later firmwares , the tools have grown apart . Spirit does n't unlock . If you want to unlock , though , there may be hope . If you have n't upgraded your i Phone to firmware 3.1.3 , or can downgrade to an earlier build , you can use the Pwnage Tool , located here . The process is self - guided and quite similar to using Spirit . Unlocking is a comparatively narrow concern , and can get much more complicated , so I 'll leave it at that . More info here . Anyway , that 's it ! It 's time to explore Cydia . Now that you 're jailbroken , it 's time to start downloading apps . Here are a handful of must-tries to get you started : \u2022 Backgrounder : Lets you run apps in the background , full stop . Perhaps my top reason to jailbreak , period . The latest version lets you set apps to run in the background with a huge variety of gestures . \u2022 Activator : Speaking of gestures , this provides a framework for all kinds of gestures across jailbroken apps . ( i Pad and i Phone ) \u2022 Kirikae : A task switcher to be used with Backgrounder . ( Think alt + tab ) ( i Phone ) \u2022 SBSettings : This opens up a whole slew of settings , accessible at any time via a pop-down system tray . Adjust brightness , toggle Wi-Fi , whatever . ( i Pad and i Phone ) \u2022 Cycorder : Lets you take full - motion video with your pre-3GS i Phone . ( i Phone ) \u2022 MyWy : Lets you share your 3G connection with other devices over Wi-Fi . It 's paid software , but a trial is available . ( i Phone and i Pad 3G ) \u2022 Winterboard : Lets you change themes , and install a lot of interesting modifications to your device 's homescreen , including folders , different icon arrangements , widgets and more . \u2022 i RealSMS : Lets you send text messages without opening the SMS app . ( i Phone ) \u2022 VoIPOver3G : Tricks apps into thinking they 're connected over Wi-Fi , even if they 're connected to 3G . ( i Phone , i Pad 3G ) \u2022 Intelliscreen : Puts all kinds of useful information on your lock screen , from weather to email to calendar events . Another paid app , but one that will be worth it to a lot of people . ( i Phone ) \u2022 Console emulators : Do your own searching on this one ; there 's one for virtually ever console released pre-2000 , and many have different approaches to controls , and acquiring games . Some , like those by ZOTDD , actually let you search for and download ROMs from within the app . ( i Phone and i Pad ) \u2022 Veency : A VNC server . No , not a client \u2014 a server . Control your i Phone from your computer . ( i Phone ) \u2022 Illicit goods : They 're there , but I wo n't tell you how to find them . Pay for your apps ! Trying before you buy is only a conscionable excuse if it 's actually true . Some general observations : Right now , a lot of apps have n't been updated for the iPad , so it 's worth doing a little Googling to see how they handle the subtle changes in the new OS . That said , most apps do work , although if you experiment enough , you 'll eventually get burned and have to restore your OS and start over , losing whatever tweaks you 've made in the jailbreak process . If you 've decided the jailbreak lifestyle is n't for you , or managed to screw up your device software enough that you want to switch back , it 's easy . ( Also , if Apple will be handling your device for any reason , you should probably un - jailbreak it . Warranties ! ) All you need is your device 's latest firmware file , helpfully linked here . Oh , and make sure you 've backed up \u2014 you 're going to lose everything . ( This guide only applies to software versions 3.1.3 for the i Phone and i Pod Touch , and 3.2 for the iPad . These are the latest versions at the time of posting , and newer software could break compatibility . ) 1 . Plug your device in , and open i Tunes 2 . Shift-click ( Windows ) or Option -click the \" Restore \" button in your iTunes device summary page . Navigate to the firmware you 've downloaded , and restore . 3 . Once this is done , i Tunes will ask you if you want to set up your device as a new device , or from a previously stored backup . If your goal is to return to a life before jailbreak , you 're probably going to want to restore . And that 's it ! What are the Downsides ? As mentioned before , there is a real risk of bricking your device , or losing data . But beyond that , there are stability issues with some jailbreak apps , and using apps like Backgrounder can seriously diminish your battery life . Also , flaunting your new found ability to tether your phone by running , say , torrents through your 3G connection is a good way to get in trouble with your carrier . What about future software upgrades ? Apple 's software updates almost always break jailbreak . When they come out , hold off on upgrading until the jailbreak community develops a hack , or an upgrade path . Upgrading to new software versions after a jailbreak often means installing a patched version of the update , specifically for jailbreakers . Why did I click that \" Make My Life Easier \" button ? If Apple does thwart jailbreak in its next software update ( likely ) , and you accidentally upgrade , you could be locked out of jailbreaking forever . Seriously ! Why ? Because as of late , Apple has been cracking down on jailbreakers by forcing their devices to authenticate with official servers every time they 're upgraded or downgraded . What this prevents , specifically , is restoring to older versions of the i Phone / iPad software , which contain the security holes necessary for jailbreaking . By keeping users from downgrading , Apple essentially locks them out of jailbreaking once they 've upgraded to an un- jailbreakable OS . The button you pressed in Cydia remotely saves what 's called an SHSH blob , which is the \" Go ! \" signal passed from Apple 's servers to your specific device . In the event of a later downgrade , i Tunes can be spoofed into thinking that Apple has approving the device 's software change , when in fact it 's just the Cydia store 's servers giving the green light . The downgrade process is something we wo n't have to worry about until Apple issues another update , after which I 'll update this guide . Until then , you can get a rough idea of how this whole thing by reading Saurik 's ( the guy behind Cydia ) blog post on how it works . Will It Work With OS 4.0 ? Surprisingly , yes ! OS 4.0 builds seem to respond well to jailbreaking with the Spirit tool . That said , this software is already fairly precarious , so I 'm not sure I would risk it . Update : Turns out I was wrong . The Spirit jailbreak tool does n't yet work on 4.0 . They 're working on it . I 've never owned and i Product , and just bought an iPad . Should I do this ? Maybe ! Kyle put together a helpful guide for i Padders earlier this week . In the Event of Emergency , Who Can Help ? Google . But no , seriously , Google . Another great resource is the ModMyi forums , where just about any question you can have has probably already been asked , and answered . Also , commenters : Help each other out ! And be nice . Special thanks to Saurik , the man behind Cydia , and the indefatigable Comex , for discovering the first userland jailbreak in a loooooooong time . Awesome work , guys .

They 've loosened up on at least one of those fronts in the last year or so , expanding the types of apps available in the App Store , but many \u2014 screw that , most \u2014 of the same restrictions still apply . Want to install an app that Apple has n't explicitly approved ? Sorry . Want to use an app over 3G that 's been designated for Wi-Fi ? Nope . Want to tether your phone ? Run applications in the background ? Change your device theme ? Install system - wide gestures ? No. Such . Luck . Enter jailbreaking . In technical terms , to jailbreak is to enable a device to run code , meaning programs or system modifications , that has n't been sanctioned by Apple . Its roots reach back to a time when there were no apps for i Phone OS , and a clever group of hackers zeroed in on some exploits gave people their first way to install apps on their devices , by way of an underground App Store called Installer . It used to be that you could hack your device simply by visiting a webpage . That was two years ago . Since then , the i Phone and i Pod Touch have been given a legit App Store , Apple has closed one security hole after another , and jailbreaking has become alternately more and less difficult , depending which device and software version you have . But just last week , a Windows and Mac tool called Spirit was released to the world . It 's simple , relatively safe , and finally , works on all devices . Every i Pod Touch can now be jailbroken to run custom apps . Every i Phone , too . Even the brand new i Pad can be hacked . Theming , data tethering , multitasking , console emulation , secret settings , and yes , you filthy thief , even pirated apps : With jailbreak , your i Thing is truly yours . Here 's how to jailbreak ( or in the case of phones , unlocked ) any i Pod Touch , i Phone or i Pad , using the new Spirit tool . But first , a disclaimer : When you jailbreak or unlock a device , you 're changing some fundamental aspects of the system software \u2014 you know , real low-level stuff . The tools are generally good , and if you follow directions carefully , you should be fine . But if something goes wrong \u2014 and there is more than one way this can happen \u2014 you can suffer data loss , or even brick your phone . Even worse , Apple claims that jailbreaking voids your warranty . You can restore your device to remove evidence that it ever happened , but if the device goes down while jailbroken , you could well be stuck . In addition , jailbreaking does not jibe with the DMCA , and breaks relate license agreements . To the point : Follow this guide at your own peril , know that there 's risk and be careful . Consult elsewhere if you 're nervous , or worry that I 've missed something . The Spirit tool has made the jailbreak fairly simple , but there 's still room for error . Step by step : What You Need : \u2022 Spirit Jailbreak Tool ( Windows and Mac ) \u2022 i Tunes 9.x ( Latest confirmed working version : 9.1.1 ) \u2022 i Pod cable \u2022 An iPad , i Phone or i Pod Touch that a. ) Is n't currently jailbroken ( obvious , but just in case ) , b. ) is working , i.e. not stuck in a startup loop , or displaying that \" Connect to i Tunes \" screen and c. ) is running a device software version 3.1.3 or lower ( or in the case of the iPad , version 3.2 ) 1 . Plug your device in , so that it 's recognized by i Tunes 2 . Back up your device to your iTunes library , and sync it . Having the backup handy will allow to you restore your settings in case you need to wipe your device later ; syncing everything \u2014 including photos , which some users report losing during the jailbreak process \u2014 ensures that all the media on your device will remain untouched , or at least restorable . 3 . Open the Spirit Jailbreak tool . It will open in a small window , and should display a message like \" i Pad ( 3.2 ) Connected . \" If not , disconnect and reconnect your device , and open the tool again . 4 . Click \" Jailbreak \" 5 . During the jailbreak routine , do n't interfere with the device . It 's probably better to leave your computer alone as well , to avoid a crash at a critical moment . First , you should see a screen on the device that says \" Restore Complete . \" The device will restart , display a spinning pinwheel icon , and open up a colorful screen like this , with a progress bar : Spirit should be done doing its thing in under 30 seconds . Your device should then boot up to your homescreen , as it was before \u2014 same background , same apps , same settings . Now you 're jailbroken . But there 's one more thing : 6 . When you restart your device , you 'll see a new icon on your homescreen , called Cydia . Open it up . This is your new App Store . Do n't worry , the regular App Store still works . Now you 've just got another one . Cydia will look a bit different on the iPad and i Phone or i Pod Touch , but will contain most of the same software . The first thing you need to do , though , is click the button that says , \" Make my life easier , thanks ! \" This will back up your device activation profile ( called an SHSH blob ) to remote servers , which ensures that you wo n't lose the ability to jailbreak if you accidentally upgrade your device device software in the future . More on that later . Regarding Unlocking Traditionally , unlocking ( opening your phone to use with different carriers ) and jailbreaking have fallen to the same tools . Since unlocking has become more difficult with later firmwares , the tools have grown apart . Spirit does n't unlock . If you want to unlock , though , there may be hope . If you have n't upgraded your i Phone to firmware 3.1.3 , or can downgrade to an earlier build , you can use the Pwnage Tool , located here . The process is self - guided and quite similar to using Spirit . Unlocking is a comparatively narrow concern , and can get much more complicated , so I 'll leave it at that . More info here . Anyway , that 's it ! It 's time to explore Cydia . Now that you 're jailbroken , it 's time to start downloading apps . Here are a handful of must-tries to get you started : \u2022 Backgrounder : Lets you run apps in the background , full stop . Perhaps my top reason to jailbreak , period . The latest version lets you set apps to run in the background with a huge variety of gestures . \u2022 Activator : Speaking of gestures , this provides a framework for all kinds of gestures across jailbroken apps . ( i Pad and i Phone ) \u2022 Kirikae : A task switcher to be used with Backgrounder . ( Think alt + tab ) ( i Phone ) \u2022 SBSettings : This opens up a whole slew of settings , accessible at any time via a pop-down system tray . Adjust brightness , toggle Wi-Fi , whatever . ( i Pad and i Phone ) \u2022 Cycorder : Lets you take full - motion video with your pre-3GS i Phone . ( i Phone ) \u2022 MyWy : Lets you share your 3G connection with other devices over Wi-Fi . It 's paid software , but a trial is available . ( i Phone and i Pad 3G ) \u2022 Winterboard : Lets you change themes , and install a lot of interesting modifications to your device 's homescreen , including folders , different icon arrangements , widgets and more . \u2022 i RealSMS : Lets you send text messages without opening the SMS app . ( i Phone ) \u2022 VoIPOver3G : Tricks apps into thinking they 're connected over Wi-Fi , even if they 're connected to 3G . ( i Phone , i Pad 3G ) \u2022 Intelliscreen : Puts all kinds of useful information on your lock screen , from weather to email to calendar events . Another paid app , but one that will be worth it to a lot of people . ( i Phone ) \u2022 Console emulators : Do your own searching on this one ; there 's one for virtually ever console released pre-2000 , and many have different approaches to controls , and acquiring games . Some , like those by ZOTDD , actually let you search for and download ROMs from within the app . ( i Phone and i Pad ) \u2022 Veency : A VNC server . No , not a client \u2014 a server . Control your i Phone from your computer . ( i Phone ) \u2022 Illicit goods : They 're there , but I wo n't tell you how to find them . Pay for your apps ! Trying before you buy is only a conscionable excuse if it 's actually true . Some general observations : Right now , a lot of apps have n't been updated for the iPad , so it 's worth doing a little Googling to see how they handle the subtle changes in the new OS . That said , most apps do work , although if you experiment enough , you 'll eventually get burned and have to restore your OS and start over , losing whatever tweaks you 've made in the jailbreak process . If you 've decided the jailbreak lifestyle is n't for you , or managed to screw up your device software enough that you want to switch back , it 's easy . ( Also , if Apple will be handling your device for any reason , you should probably un - jailbreak it . Warranties ! ) All you need is your device 's latest firmware file , helpfully linked here . Oh , and make sure you 've backed up \u2014 you 're going to lose everything . ( This guide only applies to software versions 3.1.3 for the i Phone and i Pod Touch , and 3.2 for the iPad . These are the latest versions at the time of posting , and newer software could break compatibility . ) 1 . Plug your device in , and open i Tunes 2 . Shift-click ( Windows ) or Option -click the \" Restore \" button in your iTunes device summary page . Navigate to the firmware you 've downloaded , and restore . 3 . Once this is done , i Tunes will ask you if you want to set up your device as a new device , or from a previously stored backup . If your goal is to return to a life before jailbreak , you 're probably going to want to restore . And that 's it ! What are the Downsides ? As mentioned before , there is a real risk of bricking your device , or losing data . But beyond that , there are stability issues with some jailbreak apps , and using apps like Backgrounder can seriously diminish your battery life . Also , flaunting your new found ability to tether your phone by running , say , torrents through your 3G connection is a good way to get in trouble with your carrier . What about future software upgrades ? Apple 's software updates almost always break jailbreak . When they come out , hold off on upgrading until the jailbreak community develops a hack , or an upgrade path . Upgrading to new software versions after a jailbreak often means installing a patched version of the update , specifically for jailbreakers . Why did I click that \" Make My Life Easier \" button ? If Apple does thwart jailbreak in its next software update ( likely ) , and you accidentally upgrade , you could be locked out of jailbreaking forever . Seriously ! Why ? Because as of late , Apple has been cracking down on jailbreakers by forcing their devices to authenticate with official servers every time they 're upgraded or downgraded . What this prevents , specifically , is restoring to older versions of the i Phone / iPad software , which contain the security holes necessary for jailbreaking . By keeping users from downgrading , Apple essentially locks them out of jailbreaking once they 've upgraded to an un- jailbreakable OS . The button you pressed in Cydia remotely saves what 's called an SHSH blob , which is the \" Go ! \" signal passed from Apple 's servers to your specific device . In the event of a later downgrade , i Tunes can be spoofed into thinking that Apple has approving the device 's software change , when in fact it 's just the Cydia store 's servers giving the green light . The downgrade process is something we wo n't have to worry about until Apple issues another update , after which I 'll update this guide . Until then , you can get a rough idea of how this whole thing by reading Saurik 's ( the guy behind Cydia ) blog post on how it works . Will It Work With OS 4.0 ? Surprisingly , yes ! OS 4.0 builds seem to respond well to jailbreaking with the Spirit tool . That said , this software is already fairly precarious , so I 'm not sure I would risk it . Update : Turns out I was wrong . The Spirit jailbreak tool does n't yet work on 4.0 . They 're working on it . I 've never owned and i Product , and just bought an iPad . Should I do this ? Maybe ! Kyle put together a helpful guide for i Padders earlier this week . In the Event of Emergency , Who Can Help ? Google . But no , seriously , Google . Another great resource is the ModMyi forums , where just about any question you can have has probably already been asked , and answered . Also , commenters : Help each other out ! And be nice . Special thanks to Saurik , the man behind Cydia , and the indefatigable Comex , for discovering the first userland jailbreak in a loooooooong time . Awesome work , guys .

The hijackers threatened to blow up the plane after Arab nations apparently refused them sanctuary . By The Associated Press The gunmen were joined by seven guerrillas who had been released from confinement in Cairo and the Netherlands and brought here in exchange for the freedom of 40 passengers and crew members aboard the plane , which was hijacked Thursday . Abdelkim Moussa , the . Tunisian director of information , said that the guerrillas had asked that they be allowed to disembark in Tunis with guarantees against prosecution and that they not be turned over to the Palestine Liberation Organization . P.L.O. Denounces Hijacking The P.L.O. , the guerrilla umbrella group heeded by Yasir Arafat , has denounced the hijacking . So have other Arab nations , including the militant Governments of Iraq and Libya , which observers had thought might provide a haven for the hijackers . In Beirut , the Palestinian press agency said that the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization intended to expose \u201c the group that committed this crime . \u201d After the 40 hostages were released from the British plane , the hijackers appeared to be ready to take off for an unknown destination . New Crew Is Refused But British Airways officials balked , saying it would be dangerous to take off without a fresh crew . The hijackers refused a new volunteer crew . The huge VC\u201010 jetliner remained on the taxiway at Tunis airport , where it has been since early Friday after it was commandeered during a stop in Dubai on the Persian Gulf while on a flight from London to Singapore and Brunei . The hijackers first sought the release of 13 guerrillas who have been under house arrest in Cairo , but the Egyptian Government agreed to give up only five of them . A short time later the Dutch Government agreed to turn over two guerrillas serving five\u2010year prison sentences for another hijacking .

By The Associated Press The gunmen were joined by seven guerrillas who had been released from confinement in Cairo and the Netherlands and brought here in exchange for the freedom of 40 passengers and crew members aboard the plane , which was hijacked Thursday . Abdelkim Moussa , the . Tunisian director of information , said that the guerrillas had asked that they be allowed to disembark in Tunis with guarantees against prosecution and that they not be turned over to the Palestine Liberation Organization .

More specifically , weather is the mix of events that happen each day in our atmosphere . Even though there 's only one atmosphere on Earth , the weather is n't the same all around the world . Weather is different in different parts of the world and changes over minutes , hours , days , and weeks . Most weather happens in the part of Earth 's atmosphere that is closest to the ground \u2014 called the troposphere .

Together , they determine what the weather is like at a given time and location . What exactly is climate ? Whereas weather refers to short - term changes in the atmosphere , climate describes what the weather is like over a long period of time in a specific area . Different regions can have different climates . To describe the climate of a place , we might say what the temperatures are like during different seasons , how windy it usually is , or how much rain or snow typically falls . When scientists talk about climate , they 're often looking at averages of precipitation , temperature , humidity , sunshine , wind , and other measures of weather that occur over a long period in a particular place . In some instances , they might look at these averages over 30 years . And , we refer to these three - decade averages of weather observations as Climate Normals . Looking at Climate Normals can help us describe whether the summers are hot and humid and whether the winters are cold and snowy at a particular place . They can also tell us when we might expect the warmest day of the year or the coldest day of the year at that location . But , while descriptions of an area 's climate provide a sense of what to expect , they do n't provide any specific details about what the weather will be on any given day . Here 's one way to visualize it . Weather tells you what to wear each day . Climate tells you what types of clothes to have in your closet . How do weather observations become climate data ? Across the globe , observers and automated stations measure weather conditions at thousands of locations every day of the year . Some observations are made hourly , others just once a day .

Are regional climates different from the global climate ? Like the United States , different regions of the world have varying climates . But , we can also describe the climate of an entire planet \u2014 referred to as the global climate . Global climate is a description of the climate of a planet as a whole , with all the regional differences averaged . Overall , global climate depends on the amount of energy received by the sun and the amount of energy that is trapped in the system . And , these amounts are different for different planets . Scientists who study Earth 's climate look at the factors that affect our planet as a whole . How does the climate change ? While the weather can change in just a few minutes or hours , climate changes over longer time frames . Climate events , like El Ni\u00f1o , happen over several years , with larger fluctuations happening over decades . And , even larger climate changes happen over hundreds and thousands of years . Today , climates are changing . Our Earth is warming more quickly than it has in the past according to the research of scientists . Hot summer days may be quite typical of climates in many regions of the world , but warming is causing Earth 's average global temperature to increase . The amount of solar radiation , the chemistry of the atmosphere , clouds , and the biosphere all affect Earth 's climate . As global climate changes , weather patterns are changing as well . While it 's impossible to say whether a particular day 's weather was affected by climate change , it is possible to predict how patterns might change . For example , scientists predict more extreme weather events as Earth 's climate warms . Why do we study climate ? Climate , climate change , and their impacts on weather events affect people all around the world . Rising global temperatures are expected to further raise sea levels and change precipitation patterns and other local climate conditions . Changing regional climates could alter forests , crop yields , and water supplies . They could also affect human health , animals , and many types of ecosystems .

Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on January 22 , 2020 Acid rain is made up of water droplets that are unusually acidic because of atmospheric pollution , most notably the excessive amounts of sulfur and nitrogen released by cars and industrial processes . Acid rain is also called acid deposition because this term includes other forms of acidic precipitation ( such as snow ) . Acidic deposition occurs in two ways : wet and dry . Wet deposition is any form of precipitation that removes acids from the atmosphere and deposits them on Earth 's surface . Dry deposition polluting particles and gases stick to the ground via dust and smoke in the absence of precipitation . Even though dry , this form of deposition is dangerous as well , because precipitation can eventually wash pollutants into streams , lakes , and rivers . Acidity itself is determined based on the pH level ( the amount of acidity or alkalinity ) of the water droplets . The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14 , with a lower pH being more acidic , while a high pH is alkaline , and seven is neutral . Normal rainwater is slightly acidic , with a pH range of 5.3 - 6.0 . Acid deposition is anything below that range . It is also important to note that the pH scale is logarithmic , and each whole number on the scale represents a 10 - fold change . Today , acid deposition is present in the northeastern United States , southeastern Canada , and much of Europe , including portions of Sweden , Norway , and Germany . In addition , parts of South Asia ( particularly China , Sri Lanka , and southern India ) and South Africa are all in danger of being affected by acid deposition in the future . What Causes Acid Rain ? Acid deposition can be caused by natural sources such as volcanoes , but it is mainly caused by the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide during fossil fuel combustion . When these gases are discharged into the atmosphere , they react with the water , oxygen , and other gases already present there to form sulfuric acid , ammonium nitrate , and nitric acid . These acids then disperse over large areas because of wind patterns and fall back to the ground as acid rain or other forms of precipitation . The gases most responsible for acid deposition are a byproduct of electric power generation and the burning of coal . As such , man - made acid deposition began becoming a significant issue during the Industrial Revolution and was first discovered by a Scottish chemist Robert Angus Smith in 1852 . In that year , he discovered the relationship between acid rain and atmospheric pollution in Manchester , England . Although it was discovered in the 1800s , acid deposition did not gain significant public attention until the 1960s , and the term \" acid rain \" was coined in 1972 . Public attention further increased in the 1970s when the \" New York Times \" published reports about problems occurring in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire . Effects of Acid Rain After studying the Hubbard Brook Forest and other areas , researchers found several important effects of acid deposition on both natural and man-made environments . Aquatic settings are the most clearly affected by acid deposition , however , because acidic precipitation falls directly into them . Both dry and wet deposition also runs off from forests , fields , and roads and flows into lakes , rivers , and streams . As this acidic liquid flows into larger bodies of water , it is diluted . Howvever , over time , acids can accrue and lower the overall pH of the body of water . Acid deposition also causes clay soils to release aluminum and magnesium , further lowering the pH in some areas . If the pH of a lake drops below 4.8 , its plants and animals risk death . It is estimated that around 50,000 lakes in the United States and Canada have a pH below normal ( about 5.3 for water ) . Several hundred of these have a pH too low to support any aquatic life . Aside from aquatic bodies , acid deposition can significantly affect forests . As acid rain falls on trees , it can make them lose their leaves , damage their bark , and stunt their growth . By damaging these parts of the tree , it makes them vulnerable to disease , extreme weather , and insects . Acid falling on a forest 's soil is also harmful because it disrupts soil nutrients , kills microorganisms in the soil , and can sometimes cause a calcium deficiency . Trees at high altitudes are also susceptible to problems induced by acidic cloud cover as the moisture in the clouds blankets them . Damage to forests by acid rain is seen all over the world , but the most advanced cases are in Eastern Europe . It 's estimated that in Germany and Poland , half of the forests are damaged , while 30 percent in Switzerland have been affected . Finally , acid deposition also has an effect on architecture and art because of its ability to corrode certain materials . As acid lands on buildings ( especially those constructed with limestone ) , it reacts with minerals in the stones , sometimes causing them to disintegrate and wash away . Acid deposition can also cause concrete to deteriorate , and it can corrode modern buildings , cars , railroad tracks , airplanes , steel bridges , and pipes above and below ground . What 's Being Done ? Because of these problems and the adverse effects of air pollution has on human health , a number of steps are being taken to reduce sulfur and nitrogen emissions . Most notably , many governments are now requiring energy producers to clean smokestacks with scrubbers that trap pollutants before they are released into the atmosphere and to reduce car emissions with catalytic converters . Additionally , alternative energy sources are gaining more prominence and funding is being put toward the restoration of ecosystems damaged by acid rain worldwide .

Today , acid deposition is present in the northeastern United States , southeastern Canada , and much of Europe , including portions of Sweden , Norway , and Germany . In addition , parts of South Asia ( particularly China , Sri Lanka , and southern India ) and South Africa are all in danger of being affected by acid deposition in the future . What Causes Acid Rain ? Acid deposition can be caused by natural sources such as volcanoes , but it is mainly caused by the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide during fossil fuel combustion . When these gases are discharged into the atmosphere , they react with the water , oxygen , and other gases already present there to form sulfuric acid , ammonium nitrate , and nitric acid . These acids then disperse over large areas because of wind patterns and fall back to the ground as acid rain or other forms of precipitation . The gases most responsible for acid deposition are a byproduct of electric power generation and the burning of coal . As such , man - made acid deposition began becoming a significant issue during the Industrial Revolution and was first discovered by a Scottish chemist Robert Angus Smith in 1852 . In that year , he discovered the relationship between acid rain and atmospheric pollution in Manchester , England . Although it was discovered in the 1800s , acid deposition did not gain significant public attention until the 1960s , and the term \" acid rain \" was coined in 1972 . Public attention further increased in the 1970s when the \" New York Times \" published reports about problems occurring in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire . Effects of Acid Rain After studying the Hubbard Brook Forest and other areas , researchers found several important effects of acid deposition on both natural and man-made environments . Aquatic settings are the most clearly affected by acid deposition , however , because acidic precipitation falls directly into them . Both dry and wet deposition also runs off from forests , fields , and roads and flows into lakes , rivers , and streams . As this acidic liquid flows into larger bodies of water , it is diluted . Howvever , over time , acids can accrue and lower the overall pH of the body of water . Acid deposition also causes clay soils to release aluminum and magnesium , further lowering the pH in some areas . If the pH of a lake drops below 4.8 , its plants and animals risk death . It is estimated that around 50,000 lakes in the United States and Canada have a pH below normal ( about 5.3 for water ) . Several hundred of these have a pH too low to support any aquatic life . Aside from aquatic bodies , acid deposition can significantly affect forests . As acid rain falls on trees , it can make them lose their leaves , damage their bark , and stunt their growth . By damaging these parts of the tree , it makes them vulnerable to disease , extreme weather , and insects . Acid falling on a forest 's soil is also harmful because it disrupts soil nutrients , kills microorganisms in the soil , and can sometimes cause a calcium deficiency . Trees at high altitudes are also susceptible to problems induced by acidic cloud cover as the moisture in the clouds blankets them . Damage to forests by acid rain is seen all over the world , but the most advanced cases are in Eastern Europe . It 's estimated that in Germany and Poland , half of the forests are damaged , while 30 percent in Switzerland have been affected . Finally , acid deposition also has an effect on architecture and art because of its ability to corrode certain materials . As acid lands on buildings ( especially those constructed with limestone ) , it reacts with minerals in the stones , sometimes causing them to disintegrate and wash away . Acid deposition can also cause concrete to deteriorate , and it can corrode modern buildings , cars , railroad tracks , airplanes , steel bridges , and pipes above and below ground . What 's Being Done ? Because of these problems and the adverse effects of air pollution has on human health , a number of steps are being taken to reduce sulfur and nitrogen emissions . Most notably , many governments are now requiring energy producers to clean smokestacks with scrubbers that trap pollutants before they are released into the atmosphere and to reduce car emissions with catalytic converters . Additionally , alternative energy sources are gaining more prominence and funding is being put toward the restoration of ecosystems damaged by acid rain worldwide .

They 're also a lot more common than you might think . According to the NHS , just under half a million individuals will fall victim each and every year . Whilst it 's true that in most cases ulcers are associated with pre-existing health issues , the risk of developing pressure sores is still a present danger for people who lay or sit for increased periods of times . The most common examples , of course , being wheelchair users and bedridden individuals . So what should you do if you do find yourself being affected ? Just as importantly , what should n't you do ? The Healing Process Pressure ulcers are essentially a result of restricted blood flow . Without the required blood containing oxygen and other essential nutrients , tissue can begin to weaken and eventually break . The result is an open wound sore offering the perfect environment for foreign bodies and microbes . Biofilm A group of microorganisms known as a biofilm may impair the healing process . The cells within a biofilm stick to one another and the outcome is often the sore staying inflamed and being unable to heal , increasing the risk of infection . Of course , infection is most definitely not wanted . A range of side effects is related to infected wounds including swelling , discomfort , pus-filled discharge , discolouration and gangrenous smells . This all adds up to unhygienic living conditions and a much - increased recovery time . To combat the potential problems that can arise , Antimicrobial dressings should be applied keep biofilm from getting out of control . It is also imperative to treat sores with an antiseptics ( including creams ) immediately . Under no circumstances , however , hydrogen peroxide and iodine - based products should never be used on pressure sores . They can be cytotoxic , damage the skin , make inflammation worse and prevent speedy recovery . Pressure Relief Relieving pressure on the affected sore and area is vital . This may seem difficult if you 're using a wheelchair or are confined to bedrest . Pressure relief pillows , specialised cushions and mattress pads can help to soften the impact of continual tension on the skin . Although cushions are beneficial , donut and ring - shaped cushions as they can restrict blood flow and deter skin improvement . On top of this , constantly changing position help to alleviate pressure at one site . Wheelchairs users should aim to be readjusting every 15 minutes . Bedridden sore sufferers should be shifted at around two -hour intervals . Remember that skin on and around the sore should never be massaged or rubbed as this adds to the pressure faced by the skin . Other Considerations As well as actively attending to the sore , ensuring that outside issues do n't come into play can play a pivotal role in the pressure sore recovery process and ensure no further injury and damage occurs . There a few things you can do to make sure you 're giving your skin every chance of effectively healing including lightly sprinkling bedsheets with powder , wearing clothes that do not rub on the sore and making sure you cannot slip or slide during sleep . On top of this , a healthy lifestyle can also promote quicker skin repair . The most obvious of course is keeping in line with a balanced diet . Proteins , vitamins and minerals are all encouraging of healthy skin and aid in repairing damage . High protein foods include meat , fish , yoghurt , eggs , cheese , nuts and seeds . Smoking reduces oxygen levels in the blood making it much harder for the heart to pump it around the body .

They 're also a lot more common than you might think . According to the NHS , just under half a million individuals will fall victim each and every year . Whilst it 's true that in most cases ulcers are associated with pre-existing health issues , the risk of developing pressure sores is still a present danger for people who lay or sit for increased periods of times . The most common examples , of course , being wheelchair users and bedridden individuals . So what should you do if you do find yourself being affected ? Just as importantly , what should n't you do ? The Healing Process Pressure ulcers are essentially a result of restricted blood flow . Without the required blood containing oxygen and other essential nutrients , tissue can begin to weaken and eventually break . The result is an open wound sore offering the perfect environment for foreign bodies and microbes . Biofilm A group of microorganisms known as a biofilm may impair the healing process . The cells within a biofilm stick to one another and the outcome is often the sore staying inflamed and being unable to heal , increasing the risk of infection . Of course , infection is most definitely not wanted . A range of side effects is related to infected wounds including swelling , discomfort , pus-filled discharge , discolouration and gangrenous smells . This all adds up to unhygienic living conditions and a much - increased recovery time . To combat the potential problems that can arise , Antimicrobial dressings should be applied keep biofilm from getting out of control . It is also imperative to treat sores with an antiseptics ( including creams ) immediately . Under no circumstances , however , hydrogen peroxide and iodine - based products should never be used on pressure sores . They can be cytotoxic , damage the skin , make inflammation worse and prevent speedy recovery . Pressure Relief Relieving pressure on the affected sore and area is vital . This may seem difficult if you 're using a wheelchair or are confined to bedrest . Pressure relief pillows , specialised cushions and mattress pads can help to soften the impact of continual tension on the skin . Although cushions are beneficial , donut and ring - shaped cushions as they can restrict blood flow and deter skin improvement . On top of this , constantly changing position help to alleviate pressure at one site . Wheelchairs users should aim to be readjusting every 15 minutes . Bedridden sore sufferers should be shifted at around two -hour intervals . Remember that skin on and around the sore should never be massaged or rubbed as this adds to the pressure faced by the skin . Other Considerations As well as actively attending to the sore , ensuring that outside issues do n't come into play can play a pivotal role in the pressure sore recovery process and ensure no further injury and damage occurs . There a few things you can do to make sure you 're giving your skin every chance of effectively healing including lightly sprinkling bedsheets with powder , wearing clothes that do not rub on the sore and making sure you cannot slip or slide during sleep . On top of this , a healthy lifestyle can also promote quicker skin repair . The most obvious of course is keeping in line with a balanced diet . Proteins , vitamins and minerals are all encouraging of healthy skin and aid in repairing damage . High protein foods include meat , fish , yoghurt , eggs , cheese , nuts and seeds . Smoking reduces oxygen levels in the blood making it much harder for the heart to pump it around the body . Oxygen is a necessary component of the recovery process and a reduced amount means it is much harder and takes much longer to repair . Smoking also results in a weakened immune system , again contributing to an extended healing time . If you can do so ( it may be best to ask a medical professional ) , exercises and stretches can improve circulation and promote healthier skin .

I 'll introduce you to Office Groove 2007 and explain the architectural underpinnings that make it an ideal tool for dynamic team collaboration . The Office Groove platform includes both decentralized client software ( Office Groove 2007 ) for information worker productivity and centralized services ( Office Groove Server 2007 ) for traversing network boundaries efficiently , enforcing IT management , and integrating data with other server - based systems . This article will cover only the Office Groove 2007 client software and the Office Groove Server Relay . Look for future coverage of the deployment capabilities of Office Groove Server Manager and the integration capabilities of Office Groove Server Data Bridge . Office Groove 2007 is the client software that enables individuals to work as teams within collaborative virtual workspaces . Office Groove 2007 enables teams to accomplish collaborative tasks , even when team members work for different organizations , work remotely , or need to work offline . Office Groove Server 2007 gives IT organizations enterprise - class server software and tools for deploying , managing , and integrating Office Groove 2007 clients across the enterprise . Among the components included in Office Groove Server 2007 is the Office Groove Server Relay . Office Groove Server Relay provides a store- and - forward service that automatically routes encrypted data changes between Office Groove 2007 clients when they ca n't connect directly . Also included are the Office Groove Server Manager and the Office Groove Server Data Bridge . I 'll discuss those more in a future article . Individual workers can use the Office Groove 2007 client software to form a team by creating workspaces , adding tools and data , and inviting other Groove users to join the workspace as team members . As team members collaborate in a workspace , Office Groove 2007 works in concert with Office Groove Server Relay to keep each team member 's copy of the workspace synchronized , even if no two users are online concurrently . The data within each Groove workspace is always protected by 192 - bit Advanced Encryption System ( AES ) encryption , whether it 's stored on a team member 's local disk , being transferred between client workspaces on the network , or being temporarily stored on Office Groove Server Relay . Collaboration Anytime , Anywhere \u00c2 \u00c2 Using Office Groove 2007 From a user 's perspective , Office Groove 2007 client software consists of five key elements : the launchbar , the workspace , tools , presence and communication , and alerts . The launchbar is the starting point for using Groove and provides easy access to a user 's workspaces and contacts . A Groove workspace ( see Figure 1 ) is where you share information and work with others on a specific task or project . A workspace is intended for a small group of approximately 2 to 50 members . Common projects and tasks executed in a Groove workspace might include document reviews , project - specific meetings , threaded discussions , reviewing and sharing published content , tracking tasks or issues , and collecting or aggregating structured data . Figure 1**\u00c2 The Groove Desktop\u00c2 **( Click the image for a larger view ) Tools are applications that can be added to workspaces for sharing and manipulating structured and unstructured data . Structured data is captured with tools like the Groove Info Path\u00c2\u00ae Forms tool and the Groove Forms tool ; unstructured data includes items such as documents , discussion threads , and images . Two new tools available in Office Groove 2007 include the SharePoint\u00c2\u00ae Files tool for synchronizing files between a Groove workspace and a SharePoint document library and the InfoPath Forms tool for importing InfoPath solutions into Groove . Presence and communication functionality includes built - in member presence awareness , workspace chat , messaging , and integration with Microsoft Office Communicator 2005 and 2007 . Alerts are text and audio notifications of events and activities that direct user attention to the relevant events and activities in a workspace . Teaming Up Across Boundaries You do n't need special network or domain privileges to create a new workspace or accept an invitation to join an existing workspace . Any user can create a workspace and send an invitation with Groove instant messaging or e-mail to prospective members . Furthermore , any Groove user can accept an invitation , join the workspace , become a team member , share information , and collaborate on a project without IT or network affiliations with other Groove members . This functionality is what enables dynamic team collaboration , even if team members are from different organizations or share no common infrastructure . When you send a workspace invitation , you do n't even have to worry whether the recipient is an existing Office Groove 2007 user . Recipients who do n't already have Office Groove 2007 installed on their computer can be invited via an e-mail message and will be prompted to download a free trial version of Groove . When you join a workspace , a copy of the workspace is transmitted over the network and stored on your computer . Office Groove 2007 can receive an initial copy of the workspace from any member who is online when the workspace invitation is created if the invitation is sent via Groove messaging . After the transmission is completed and a locally stored copy of a workspace is ready , you can enter the workspace and begin working with other members . Staying in Sync If a workspace member changes content in the workspace , a \" delta \" is created , representing a logical unit of workspace synchronization . The tool used to make changes determines what a delta contains . For example , a delta could be drawing a line in the Sketchpad tool ( a shared whiteboard application that can be added to a Groove workspace ) , changing an entry on a calendar , adding a member to the workspace , or the binary differentials between a changed file and the previous version . When a delta is created by a user , Groove first updates the user 's local copy of the workspace , then sends the delta to the rest of the members for execution in their local copies of the workspace . When all members ' copies of the workspace have introduced the delta , the workspace is synchronized . Though each member keeps a delta log locally with the associated workspace , Groove includes built - in logic to conclude that , after a delta has been executed by all members , the delta can then be deleted from the log . If you are online , changes are synchronized in near real-time . If you 're offline when deltas are executed by other workspace members , those deltas are sent to queues in your designated Office Groove Server Relay . The deltas are then consumed whenever you reconnect to a network and can establish a connection with the Office Groove Server Relay . In this way , all members ' copies of the workspace can be updated or synchronized regardless of the network status of any single user at the time a delta is sent . Above all , once a member saves a change to a workspace , Office Groove 2007 and Office Groove Server Relay carry out the transmission of the delta and subsequent synchronization automatically and transparently to all members . Factors such as how long a member has been offline , how much has changed in the workspace , how much network bandwidth is available , and how many members are online affect the time and computing resources Office Groove 2007 needs to automatically synchronize a workspace . If a member has not entered a workspace for 21 days , Office Groove 2007 will no longer synchronize that workspace for the member . This design decision is based on the assumption that it is more efficient to simply re-invite the user and get a fresh copy of the workspace as opposed to synchronizing 21 days of data with unpredictable amounts and intricate data dependencies developed over time . To avoid this scenario , it 's a good practice to leave Office Groove 2007 running while connected to the Internet whenever possible so Groove can synchronize soon after changes are introduced and keep the workspace content updated at all times . If necessary , a workspace manager can uninvite a member from the workspace . To protect the privacy of the workspace , this action will consequently delete the workspace stored locally on the uninvited member 's computer and generate a new workspace - specific encryption key for distribution to all remaining workspace members . If an uninvited member is online , deletion of the associated workspace occurs as soon as the uninvite message is received . If the user is offline , the uninvite message is queued at the designated Office Groove Server Relay and dequeued and executed the next time the user connects . Data Transmission Details The way Office Groove 2007 transmits data is in some ways similar to making a phone call . When Alice calls Bob , for instance , if Bob answers , a logical phone - to - phone connection is established . If the call is not answered , Alice might leave a voice message that Bob can hear the next time he dials into his voice message box . Office Groove 2007 will always try first to initiate a direct client - to - client connection between users . The direct connection is carried out by a proprietary protocol , Simple Symmetric Transmission Protocol ( SSTP ) , using TCP port 2492 . This client- to - client connection is bidirectional and transmits data asynchronously with near real - time performance . If a connection on port 2492 is blocked or the endpoint client is not reachable on the network , the sender client automatically transmits messages to the recipient 's designated Office Groove Server Relay , which queues up the messages to be consumed whenever the recipient reconnects ( see Figure 2 ) . Figure 2**\u00c2 Client-to - Client and Client-to- Relay Communication Models \u00c2 ** These two different connections\u00e2client - to - client and client- to - relay\u00e2do not necessarily imply a performance discrepancy that will be noticed by users . In most corporate network configurations , both connections offer a similar user experience . A client- to - client connection is preferred , yet may not be allowed or available . A client- to - relay connection , using outbound connections from the client to the Office Groove Server Relay , is often the least common denominator . The client can initiate connections to the Office Groove Server Relay using one of three available ports and protocols : SSTP / : 2492 , SSTP /:443 , and SSTP encapsulated in HTTP / :80 . The client will automatically try each protocol / port combination in order . Office Groove 2007 can HTTP POST to the user 's Office Groove Server Relay to publish the presence information and can HTTP GET to consume inbound messages and deltas . In addition , Groove clients can HTTP POST to an intended recipient 's Office Groove Server Relay for outbound messages and deltas . No matter which of the three connection types clients use , data is always encrypted and digitally signed to ensure confidentiality and integrity . At the same time , with HTTP encapsulations , Office Groove 2007 can communicate across firewalls and beyond any organizational boundaries . Presence Awareness Office Groove 2007 subscribes to presence information from all contacts in the contact store . The store is the superset of your contact list ( visible from the launchbar ) plus all workspace members . While it is true that when you have a contact in your contact list you subscribe to that person 's presence , you also subscribe to his presence if he is not in your contact list , but is in a workspace with you . In other words , subscribing to presence occurs automatically when you learn of someone , either through workspace membership , or by adding to contacts . Device presence is required first , though , before user awareness can be established . Device presence indicates that a user is logged into an Office Groove 2007 account on a particular computer , and the computer 's IP address is transmitted to the user 's designated Office Groove Server Relay . Device awareness within a subnet is achieved with LAN Device Presence Protocol ( DPP ) , a proprietary protocol that provides discovery and online status of devices without the need of a server . LAN DPP works only within a subnet , however . Device presence on a WAN requires a connection to an Office Groove Server Relay ( see Figure 3 ) . A user publishes device presence to his designated Office Groove Server Relay , and any contacts subscribing to the user 's presence can connect to the relay and consume that device presence information automatically . WAN presence cannot occur without a relay being contacted . Once you receive another contact 's device presence , you can go directly to that second contact to establish awareness . Figure 3**\u00c2 Groove User Presence Awareness \u00c2 ** Conflict Resolution Because Office Groove 2007 employs a decentralized model for collaboration , data conflicts can occur from time to time and are handled differently based on the tool and data type . Whenever a user is online , Office Groove 2007 will synchronize the local copy of a workspace automatically with other members . But when a user is offline and making changes to a workspace , other online and offline members may be making changes as well . When reconnected to a network , the Office Groove 2007 client will identify the dependencies and serialize the changes , as applicable . If there are conflicts , such as two people modifying the same data while offline , for example , Office Groove 2007 ensures that no data is lost , and that all users have the same view of the data . Many tools have discrete deltas , making conflicts in structured data very uncommon . For instance , Alice and Bob both respond to a discussion item at the same time . Regardless of network status , no conflict will occur since each entry is a self - contained transaction within the associated discussion thread . For unstructured data such as documents , it is possible to create a conflict . One user may stay offline for an extended period after modifying a file . During this period , other members working online may have made changes and synchronized the file several times . In this case , Office Groove 2007 warns the user that there is a conflict on the document and automatically creates a copy of the file . Each file is titled with a name identifying the member whose changes are causing a conflict . At this point , user intervention is required to reconcile the conflict , and the points of conflict should be clear . Roles and Permissions Office Groove 2007 includes a built - in , roles - based permissions framework that affords content safeguards to workspace creators within the decentralized nature of a Groove workspace . In Office Groove 2007 , a role is an access control mechanism for permitting users to perform tasks in a workspace and activities with individual tools . There are three built - in roles : manager , participant , and guest . By default , workspace creators are managers and those invited to workspaces are participants . Default permissions for each role can be changed by a manager . A manager can invite others as managers and a member 's role can be changed by a manager . The tool permissions associated with a role are customizable as well . The workspace rights and tool permissions associated with a role can therefore be configured at a workspace manager 's discretion . This role - based model in Office Groove 2007 is an effective way of controlling access . Figure 4 illustrates some of the default permissions .

As team members collaborate in a workspace , Office Groove 2007 works in concert with Office Groove Server Relay to keep each team member 's copy of the workspace synchronized , even if no two users are online concurrently . The data within each Groove workspace is always protected by 192 - bit Advanced Encryption System ( AES ) encryption , whether it 's stored on a team member 's local disk , being transferred between client workspaces on the network , or being temporarily stored on Office Groove Server Relay . Collaboration Anytime , Anywhere \u00c2 \u00c2 Using Office Groove 2007 From a user 's perspective , Office Groove 2007 client software consists of five key elements : the launchbar , the workspace , tools , presence and communication , and alerts . The launchbar is the starting point for using Groove and provides easy access to a user 's workspaces and contacts . A Groove workspace ( see Figure 1 ) is where you share information and work with others on a specific task or project . A workspace is intended for a small group of approximately 2 to 50 members . Common projects and tasks executed in a Groove workspace might include document reviews , project - specific meetings , threaded discussions , reviewing and sharing published content , tracking tasks or issues , and collecting or aggregating structured data . Figure 1**\u00c2 The Groove Desktop\u00c2 **( Click the image for a larger view ) Tools are applications that can be added to workspaces for sharing and manipulating structured and unstructured data . Structured data is captured with tools like the Groove Info Path\u00c2\u00ae Forms tool and the Groove Forms tool ; unstructured data includes items such as documents , discussion threads , and images . Two new tools available in Office Groove 2007 include the SharePoint\u00c2\u00ae Files tool for synchronizing files between a Groove workspace and a SharePoint document library and the InfoPath Forms tool for importing InfoPath solutions into Groove . Presence and communication functionality includes built - in member presence awareness , workspace chat , messaging , and integration with Microsoft Office Communicator 2005 and 2007 . Alerts are text and audio notifications of events and activities that direct user attention to the relevant events and activities in a workspace . Teaming Up Across Boundaries You do n't need special network or domain privileges to create a new workspace or accept an invitation to join an existing workspace . Any user can create a workspace and send an invitation with Groove instant messaging or e-mail to prospective members . Furthermore , any Groove user can accept an invitation , join the workspace , become a team member , share information , and collaborate on a project without IT or network affiliations with other Groove members . This functionality is what enables dynamic team collaboration , even if team members are from different organizations or share no common infrastructure . When you send a workspace invitation , you do n't even have to worry whether the recipient is an existing Office Groove 2007 user . Recipients who do n't already have Office Groove 2007 installed on their computer can be invited via an e-mail message and will be prompted to download a free trial version of Groove . When you join a workspace , a copy of the workspace is transmitted over the network and stored on your computer . Office Groove 2007 can receive an initial copy of the workspace from any member who is online when the workspace invitation is created if the invitation is sent via Groove messaging . After the transmission is completed and a locally stored copy of a workspace is ready , you can enter the workspace and begin working with other members . Staying in Sync If a workspace member changes content in the workspace , a \" delta \" is created , representing a logical unit of workspace synchronization . The tool used to make changes determines what a delta contains . For example , a delta could be drawing a line in the Sketchpad tool ( a shared whiteboard application that can be added to a Groove workspace ) , changing an entry on a calendar , adding a member to the workspace , or the binary differentials between a changed file and the previous version . When a delta is created by a user , Groove first updates the user 's local copy of the workspace , then sends the delta to the rest of the members for execution in their local copies of the workspace . When all members ' copies of the workspace have introduced the delta , the workspace is synchronized . Though each member keeps a delta log locally with the associated workspace , Groove includes built - in logic to conclude that , after a delta has been executed by all members , the delta can then be deleted from the log . If you are online , changes are synchronized in near real-time . If you 're offline when deltas are executed by other workspace members , those deltas are sent to queues in your designated Office Groove Server Relay . The deltas are then consumed whenever you reconnect to a network and can establish a connection with the Office Groove Server Relay . In this way , all members ' copies of the workspace can be updated or synchronized regardless of the network status of any single user at the time a delta is sent . Above all , once a member saves a change to a workspace , Office Groove 2007 and Office Groove Server Relay carry out the transmission of the delta and subsequent synchronization automatically and transparently to all members . Factors such as how long a member has been offline , how much has changed in the workspace , how much network bandwidth is available , and how many members are online affect the time and computing resources Office Groove 2007 needs to automatically synchronize a workspace . If a member has not entered a workspace for 21 days , Office Groove 2007 will no longer synchronize that workspace for the member . This design decision is based on the assumption that it is more efficient to simply re-invite the user and get a fresh copy of the workspace as opposed to synchronizing 21 days of data with unpredictable amounts and intricate data dependencies developed over time . To avoid this scenario , it 's a good practice to leave Office Groove 2007 running while connected to the Internet whenever possible so Groove can synchronize soon after changes are introduced and keep the workspace content updated at all times . If necessary , a workspace manager can uninvite a member from the workspace . To protect the privacy of the workspace , this action will consequently delete the workspace stored locally on the uninvited member 's computer and generate a new workspace - specific encryption key for distribution to all remaining workspace members . If an uninvited member is online , deletion of the associated workspace occurs as soon as the uninvite message is received . If the user is offline , the uninvite message is queued at the designated Office Groove Server Relay and dequeued and executed the next time the user connects . Data Transmission Details The way Office Groove 2007 transmits data is in some ways similar to making a phone call . When Alice calls Bob , for instance , if Bob answers , a logical phone - to - phone connection is established . If the call is not answered , Alice might leave a voice message that Bob can hear the next time he dials into his voice message box . Office Groove 2007 will always try first to initiate a direct client - to - client connection between users . The direct connection is carried out by a proprietary protocol , Simple Symmetric Transmission Protocol ( SSTP ) , using TCP port 2492 . This client- to - client connection is bidirectional and transmits data asynchronously with near real - time performance . If a connection on port 2492 is blocked or the endpoint client is not reachable on the network , the sender client automatically transmits messages to the recipient 's designated Office Groove Server Relay , which queues up the messages to be consumed whenever the recipient reconnects ( see Figure 2 ) . Figure 2**\u00c2 Client-to - Client and Client-to- Relay Communication Models \u00c2 ** These two different connections\u00e2client - to - client and client- to - relay\u00e2do not necessarily imply a performance discrepancy that will be noticed by users . In most corporate network configurations , both connections offer a similar user experience . A client- to - client connection is preferred , yet may not be allowed or available . A client- to - relay connection , using outbound connections from the client to the Office Groove Server Relay , is often the least common denominator . The client can initiate connections to the Office Groove Server Relay using one of three available ports and protocols : SSTP / : 2492 , SSTP /:443 , and SSTP encapsulated in HTTP / :80 . The client will automatically try each protocol / port combination in order . Office Groove 2007 can HTTP POST to the user 's Office Groove Server Relay to publish the presence information and can HTTP GET to consume inbound messages and deltas . In addition , Groove clients can HTTP POST to an intended recipient 's Office Groove Server Relay for outbound messages and deltas . No matter which of the three connection types clients use , data is always encrypted and digitally signed to ensure confidentiality and integrity . At the same time , with HTTP encapsulations , Office Groove 2007 can communicate across firewalls and beyond any organizational boundaries . Presence Awareness Office Groove 2007 subscribes to presence information from all contacts in the contact store . The store is the superset of your contact list ( visible from the launchbar ) plus all workspace members . While it is true that when you have a contact in your contact list you subscribe to that person 's presence , you also subscribe to his presence if he is not in your contact list , but is in a workspace with you . In other words , subscribing to presence occurs automatically when you learn of someone , either through workspace membership , or by adding to contacts . Device presence is required first , though , before user awareness can be established . Device presence indicates that a user is logged into an Office Groove 2007 account on a particular computer , and the computer 's IP address is transmitted to the user 's designated Office Groove Server Relay . Device awareness within a subnet is achieved with LAN Device Presence Protocol ( DPP ) , a proprietary protocol that provides discovery and online status of devices without the need of a server . LAN DPP works only within a subnet , however . Device presence on a WAN requires a connection to an Office Groove Server Relay ( see Figure 3 ) . A user publishes device presence to his designated Office Groove Server Relay , and any contacts subscribing to the user 's presence can connect to the relay and consume that device presence information automatically . WAN presence cannot occur without a relay being contacted . Once you receive another contact 's device presence , you can go directly to that second contact to establish awareness . Figure 3**\u00c2 Groove User Presence Awareness \u00c2 ** Conflict Resolution Because Office Groove 2007 employs a decentralized model for collaboration , data conflicts can occur from time to time and are handled differently based on the tool and data type . Whenever a user is online , Office Groove 2007 will synchronize the local copy of a workspace automatically with other members . But when a user is offline and making changes to a workspace , other online and offline members may be making changes as well . When reconnected to a network , the Office Groove 2007 client will identify the dependencies and serialize the changes , as applicable . If there are conflicts , such as two people modifying the same data while offline , for example , Office Groove 2007 ensures that no data is lost , and that all users have the same view of the data . Many tools have discrete deltas , making conflicts in structured data very uncommon . For instance , Alice and Bob both respond to a discussion item at the same time . Regardless of network status , no conflict will occur since each entry is a self - contained transaction within the associated discussion thread . For unstructured data such as documents , it is possible to create a conflict . One user may stay offline for an extended period after modifying a file . During this period , other members working online may have made changes and synchronized the file several times . In this case , Office Groove 2007 warns the user that there is a conflict on the document and automatically creates a copy of the file . Each file is titled with a name identifying the member whose changes are causing a conflict . At this point , user intervention is required to reconcile the conflict , and the points of conflict should be clear . Roles and Permissions Office Groove 2007 includes a built - in , roles - based permissions framework that affords content safeguards to workspace creators within the decentralized nature of a Groove workspace . In Office Groove 2007 , a role is an access control mechanism for permitting users to perform tasks in a workspace and activities with individual tools . There are three built - in roles : manager , participant , and guest . By default , workspace creators are managers and those invited to workspaces are participants . Default permissions for each role can be changed by a manager . A manager can invite others as managers and a member 's role can be changed by a manager . The tool permissions associated with a role are customizable as well . The workspace rights and tool permissions associated with a role can therefore be configured at a workspace manager 's discretion . This role - based model in Office Groove 2007 is an effective way of controlling access . Figure 4 illustrates some of the default permissions .

Cleveland was at one time referred to as \u00e2the American Debrecen\u00e2 following the popularly held belief that it was the city with the second largest population of Hungarians , outside of Hungary , after Budapest . Although this title did not hold up statistically ( best estimates in the early 1900s would globally rank its Hungarian population as , perhaps , fourth largest ) , the popular name of \u00e2the American Debrecen\u00e2 remained with the Cleveland Hungarian community in published books and magazines for many decades . Hungarians came to Cleveland because of job availability , accessibility , and , as more Hungarians settled here , the proximity of countrymen . Hungarian immigration to Cleveland occurred in 3 distinct waves : turn - of - the - century immigration ( 1870 - 1924 ) , the largest and most influential wave ; post - WORLD WAR II \" displaced persons ; \" and post -1956 refugee immigration . Hungarians who first arrived settled at the easternmost edge of the city , which became the Buckeye Rd . Hungarian neighborhood , and formed a smaller settlement on the near west side . Significant Hungarian immigration to the city began in the 1870s . They came because land was scarce in their homeland and cheap labor was plentiful . The majority were single men or men who had left their families behind , because they initially intended to return home with enough savings to purchase land . They lived in boarding houses , run by the few women who had immigrated with their husbands . By 1900 there were 9,558 Hungarians in Cleveland . A distinct Hungarian settlement evolved during the mid-1880s , with the first families settling close to the factories where they worked : around Madison St. ( now E. 79th ) and Woodland Ave. from E. 65th onward . At the eastern outskirts of the city , the streets were unpaved and dark , but the area was attractive because housing was cheap , residents could walk to work , and they could live with their countrymen . Reportedly , older , more established immigrant groups treated these newcomers with disdain , ridiculing their dress and Old World ways . Until there were a substantial number of their countrymen in the city , Hungarians were wary of speaking their native tongue in the streets for fear of reprisals . Hungarians initially found work at EBERHARD MFG . CO. , Mechanical Rubber Works , Natl . Malleable Steel Castings , Ohio Foundry , Standard Foundry , Van Dorn Iron Works , Glidden Varnish , Cleveland Bronze , and Carlin Bronze . They earned a reputation as hard - working and tolerant , and according to some sources , employers sought them out when hiring . As more Hungarians found accommodation and employment in Cleveland and wrote to their relatives and friends at home , more Hungarians immigrated to Cleveland . This process of \" chain migration \" was especially evident on the west side of the city , where several hundred immigrants from the same Hungarian village settled , lured by the success of THEODOR KUNDTZ , who established his own cabinetmaking company in 1876 . By 1900 Kundtz Mfg. employed 2,500 skilled workers , most of them Hungarian immigrants . Kundtz became one of Cleveland 's wealthiest industrialists and built \" Hungaria Hall \" on Clark Ave. in 1890 for the community . However , the number of Hungarians on the west side was not large enough to support such a massive community center , and it was later sold to a Czech Sokol ( Sokol Nova Vlast ) . The first organizations established by the Hungarians were self - help / sick-benefit societies . Other organizations were founded for the added purpose of establishing a church . Through the efforts of King St. Ladislaus Roman Catholic Men's & Women 's Sick Benefit Society , Rev. CHAS . BOEHM was sent to Cleveland ; upon his arrival , he established the first Hungarian Roman Catholic church in North America , St. Elizabeth of Hungary . Cleveland was the first location of several Hungarian church denominations in North America : the FIRST HUNGARIAN REFORMED ( 1891 ) , Roman Catholic ( ST. ELIZABETH'S CHURCH , 1892 ) , and Greek Catholic churches ( St. John 's Greek Catholic , 1892 ) . In the 1890s these 3 denominations built churches on lower Buckeye Rd . By the early 1920s , 11 Hungarian churches representing 6 denominations had been established : 7 on the east side and 4 on the west . In addition , there were 3 Hungarian Jewish congregations on the east side . Large-scale projects , requiring the support of all Hungarians living in Cleveland , stimulated a sense of community awareness and pride . A statue of Hungarian patriot Louis Kossuth was erected at UNIV . CIRCLE in 1902 , when only 10,000 Hungarians lived in Cleveland . The founding of the UNITED HUNGARIAN SOCIETIES in 1902 also promoted unity . This organization was , at its founding , unique among Hungarian - American organizations in the U.S. Major movements of general interest to all Hungarian - Americans originated in Cleveland . The American Hungarian Fed. was founded in Cleveland in 1906 to represent Hungarians and safeguard their rights as American citizens . The movement to erect a statue of Geo. Washington in Budapest was spearheaded by TIHAMER KOHANYI , editor of the Cleveland - based SZABADSAG . The Buckeye Rd. Hungarian community was a transient neighborhood until 1920 . Immigrants known as \" migrating birds \" came and went\u00e2visiting and helping their families in Hungary at harvest time , and returning to work in the factories during the winter , living in boarding houses and not concerned with establishing permanent ties . This situation altered dramatically , however , with WORLD WAR I and the Treaty of Trianon , which imposed harsh economic and political conditions on Hungary . Suddenly the decision of Hungarian immigrants in the U.S. to return or to remain was imminent . Moreover , the U.S. imposed the quota system in 1921 , curtailing immigration in any year to 3 % of the number of the nationality in the U.S. in 1900 ; later this was reduced to 2 % . More than half of the 1 million Hungarian immigrants living in the U.S. returned to Hungary during and after World War I . In the Cleveland Hungarian community , World War I and the Treaty of Trianon decided the fate of the ethnic enclave . After 1920 , an increasing number of residents purchased their own homes and became U.S. citizens . The original Hungarian neighborhood around E. 79th and Holton Ave. expanded from Buckeye Rd. to Woodland Ave. and E. 72nd St. , and east along Buckeye from Woodhill Rd. to E. 125th St. Hungarian businesses soon dominated the entire span of Buckeye . Clubhouses were built , and churches , which until then were wooden structures , were rebuilt in stone . In the development of the Buckeye Rd . Hungarian community , 1920 - 30 is known as the period of expansion , while 1930 - 60 is designated as the period of stability . Cleveland 's Hungarian immigrant population rose from 9,558 to 43,134 by 1920 . Hungarians constituted 8 % of the city 's foreign - born population in 1900 , and 18 % in 1920 . The Buckeye Rd. neighborhood became a dynamic ethnic community . The 7 churches and 8 clubhouses were in constant use . The community 's social calendar included the following regular events : 12 grape harvest festivals , 11 New Year 's Eve dances , 14 picnics , 12 plays , 20 banquets , and over 100 Hungarian weddings . In addition , lectures , forums , civic and political meetings , bazaars , and card parties were weekly held at clubhouses and halls . Six Hungarian-language newspapers served the community . The largest , Szabadsag , reached a daily circulation of 40,612 in 1940 . By 1920 there were more than 300 Hungarian - owned businesses and 81 Hungarian organizations in Cleveland . By the 1930s many Cleveland Hungarians were becoming acculturated to the American way of life , but many retained their native tongue and customs . At this time a substantial number of 2nd - generation Hungarian - American youths were active in the community , forming their own social and civic groups . During the Depression , organizations assisted the community through hard economic times , including charity committees , such as that established by the Women 's Hungarian Social Club , homeowners ' associations to try to prevent evictions , and several labor organizations , including a Hungarian - language section of the IWW . The Hungarian community , overwhelmingly Democratic , evolved into a political voting bloc during the 1930s . Ward 29 was represented by Hungarian councilmen for nearly 45 years starting in 1921 . In Ward 16 , Hungarian representation spanned 30 years , 1939 - 71 . Approximately 26 Hungarian -Americans from the Buckeye community were elected or appointed to various city , county , and state offices . From 1931 - 74 , usually 2 and often 3 judges of the 9 on the bench of the Municipal Court of Cleveland were Hungarian . The most influential Hungarian - American politician in Cleveland city government was JACK P. RUSSELL , who became president of the city council in 1957 and held the position for 11 years . World War II disrupted the Hungarian community of Cleveland drastically : many Hungarian - American youths served and died overseas . In the predominantly Hungarian 29th Ward , 4,305 men ( 13 % of the population ) served in the armed forces . Most returning veterans did not go back to the neighborhoods where they grew up , but moved to suburbs to start families , beginning the disintegration of the Buckeye neighborhood . Following the war , the community worked with and absorbed a new wave of Hungarian immigrants , displaced persons obtaining \" Home and Job Assurances \" needed by postwar immigrants to enter the U.S. , and searching for housing and employment once they arrived . Between 1947 - 53 , approx . 6,000 Hungarian immigrants arrived in Cleveland , generally from Hungary 's urban centers and from the middle and upper-middle classes . Most were well - educated , emigrated with their families , and were established in their careers when they left . They were handicapped by being middle - aged : losing everything and having to start anew proved extremely difficult for many . The postwar immigrants left Hungary because of changes in the political system , not for economic reasons , and intended to return to Hungary when the Soviet occupation of the country ended , making them \u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9s rather than immigrants . They were the most politically conscious among Cleveland 's Hungarians , even compared to the later Hungarian refugees of 1956 . They founded organizations to maintain their homeland traditions , especially those undermined by the postwar government , and emphasized educating the 2nd generation in their language and heritage through Saturday language schools and the Hungarian Scouting movement . They included many writers and journalists ; several new newspapers were founded in Cleveland during the 1950s and 1960s , and they published more books than any other wave of Hungarian immigrants . The revolution in Hungary in Oct. 1956 brought a wave of approx . 41,000 refugees to the U.S. The revolution was unexpected ; the community only recently absorbed the postwar immigrants , but Hungarians in Cleveland reacted quickly . Within the first days mass rallies were held , and organizations initiated relief programs . These refugees were the youngest wave of Hungarian immigrants and the group least prepared with future plans and goals . Unlike previous immigrants , these refugees had to leave Hungary suddenly and unexpectedly ; many possessed a technical trade or had several years of university study . They evoked great public sympathy in the U.S. because of their fight against communism , and numerous opportunities , such as scholarship programs , job placement , and financial assistance , were made available to them . It is difficult to determine the exact number of refugees who settled in Cleveland because census data statistics between 1950 - 60 include many of the postwar immigrants as well , but it has been estimated at 6,000 - 9,000 . Moreover , it is impossible to ascertain how many stayed in Cleveland once they familiarized themselves with English and life in the U.S. Because of their relative youth , technical skills , and single status , they adjusted with greater ease than previous immigrants and exhibited less attachment to community organizations and institutions . For over 100 years , a distinct and unique Hungarian community has existed in Cleveland , constantly rejuvenated by new waves of immigrants . The Buckeye Rd. neighborhood began declining in the 1960s and experienced an alarming increase in crime during the late 1960s and 1970s . By 1980 few Cleveland Hungarians lived there ; but the local Hungarian community was still viable . By the 1980s , there were 113,000 Greater Clevelanders of Hungarian birth or descent . Although the number of Greater Clevelanders claiming Hungarian descent dropped to 61,681 in the 1990 census and the number of people of Hungarian birth resident in Cleveland was a mere 924 , the community remained active . Old organizations were replaced by new ones , founded by 2nd or 3rd generation Hungarian Americans , consisting mainly of folkdance groups , cultural organizations , and civic clubs . Even within the old Buckeye neighborhood , which was almost totally devoid of Hungarian residents , a heritage museum was established at St. Elizabeth 's church , and both remained focal points of Hungarian pride and culture in 1995 . All of these new organizations epitomized an ongoing attempt to preserve cultural traditions and an awareness of ethnic background among the American - born children of Hungarian immigrants .

Reportedly , older , more established immigrant groups treated these newcomers with disdain , ridiculing their dress and Old World ways . Until there were a substantial number of their countrymen in the city , Hungarians were wary of speaking their native tongue in the streets for fear of reprisals . Hungarians initially found work at EBERHARD MFG . CO. , Mechanical Rubber Works , Natl . Malleable Steel Castings , Ohio Foundry , Standard Foundry , Van Dorn Iron Works , Glidden Varnish , Cleveland Bronze , and Carlin Bronze . They earned a reputation as hard - working and tolerant , and according to some sources , employers sought them out when hiring . As more Hungarians found accommodation and employment in Cleveland and wrote to their relatives and friends at home , more Hungarians immigrated to Cleveland . This process of \" chain migration \" was especially evident on the west side of the city , where several hundred immigrants from the same Hungarian village settled , lured by the success of THEODOR KUNDTZ , who established his own cabinetmaking company in 1876 . By 1900 Kundtz Mfg. employed 2,500 skilled workers , most of them Hungarian immigrants . Kundtz became one of Cleveland 's wealthiest industrialists and built \" Hungaria Hall \" on Clark Ave. in 1890 for the community . However , the number of Hungarians on the west side was not large enough to support such a massive community center , and it was later sold to a Czech Sokol ( Sokol Nova Vlast ) . The first organizations established by the Hungarians were self - help / sick-benefit societies . Other organizations were founded for the added purpose of establishing a church . Through the efforts of King St. Ladislaus Roman Catholic Men's & Women 's Sick Benefit Society , Rev. CHAS . BOEHM was sent to Cleveland ; upon his arrival , he established the first Hungarian Roman Catholic church in North America , St. Elizabeth of Hungary . Cleveland was the first location of several Hungarian church denominations in North America : the FIRST HUNGARIAN REFORMED ( 1891 ) , Roman Catholic ( ST. ELIZABETH'S CHURCH , 1892 ) , and Greek Catholic churches ( St. John 's Greek Catholic , 1892 ) . In the 1890s these 3 denominations built churches on lower Buckeye Rd . By the early 1920s , 11 Hungarian churches representing 6 denominations had been established : 7 on the east side and 4 on the west . In addition , there were 3 Hungarian Jewish congregations on the east side . Large-scale projects , requiring the support of all Hungarians living in Cleveland , stimulated a sense of community awareness and pride . A statue of Hungarian patriot Louis Kossuth was erected at UNIV . CIRCLE in 1902 , when only 10,000 Hungarians lived in Cleveland . The founding of the UNITED HUNGARIAN SOCIETIES in 1902 also promoted unity . This organization was , at its founding , unique among Hungarian - American organizations in the U.S. Major movements of general interest to all Hungarian - Americans originated in Cleveland . The American Hungarian Fed. was founded in Cleveland in 1906 to represent Hungarians and safeguard their rights as American citizens . The movement to erect a statue of Geo. Washington in Budapest was spearheaded by TIHAMER KOHANYI , editor of the Cleveland - based SZABADSAG . The Buckeye Rd. Hungarian community was a transient neighborhood until 1920 . Immigrants known as \" migrating birds \" came and went\u00e2visiting and helping their families in Hungary at harvest time , and returning to work in the factories during the winter , living in boarding houses and not concerned with establishing permanent ties . This situation altered dramatically , however , with WORLD WAR I and the Treaty of Trianon , which imposed harsh economic and political conditions on Hungary . Suddenly the decision of Hungarian immigrants in the U.S. to return or to remain was imminent . Moreover , the U.S. imposed the quota system in 1921 , curtailing immigration in any year to 3 % of the number of the nationality in the U.S. in 1900 ; later this was reduced to 2 % . More than half of the 1 million Hungarian immigrants living in the U.S. returned to Hungary during and after World War I . In the Cleveland Hungarian community , World War I and the Treaty of Trianon decided the fate of the ethnic enclave . After 1920 , an increasing number of residents purchased their own homes and became U.S. citizens . The original Hungarian neighborhood around E. 79th and Holton Ave. expanded from Buckeye Rd. to Woodland Ave. and E. 72nd St. , and east along Buckeye from Woodhill Rd. to E. 125th St. Hungarian businesses soon dominated the entire span of Buckeye . Clubhouses were built , and churches , which until then were wooden structures , were rebuilt in stone . In the development of the Buckeye Rd . Hungarian community , 1920 - 30 is known as the period of expansion , while 1930 - 60 is designated as the period of stability . Cleveland 's Hungarian immigrant population rose from 9,558 to 43,134 by 1920 . Hungarians constituted 8 % of the city 's foreign - born population in 1900 , and 18 % in 1920 . The Buckeye Rd. neighborhood became a dynamic ethnic community . The 7 churches and 8 clubhouses were in constant use . The community 's social calendar included the following regular events : 12 grape harvest festivals , 11 New Year 's Eve dances , 14 picnics , 12 plays , 20 banquets , and over 100 Hungarian weddings . In addition , lectures , forums , civic and political meetings , bazaars , and card parties were weekly held at clubhouses and halls . Six Hungarian-language newspapers served the community . The largest , Szabadsag , reached a daily circulation of 40,612 in 1940 . By 1920 there were more than 300 Hungarian - owned businesses and 81 Hungarian organizations in Cleveland . By the 1930s many Cleveland Hungarians were becoming acculturated to the American way of life , but many retained their native tongue and customs . At this time a substantial number of 2nd - generation Hungarian - American youths were active in the community , forming their own social and civic groups . During the Depression , organizations assisted the community through hard economic times , including charity committees , such as that established by the Women 's Hungarian Social Club , homeowners ' associations to try to prevent evictions , and several labor organizations , including a Hungarian - language section of the IWW . The Hungarian community , overwhelmingly Democratic , evolved into a political voting bloc during the 1930s . Ward 29 was represented by Hungarian councilmen for nearly 45 years starting in 1921 . In Ward 16 , Hungarian representation spanned 30 years , 1939 - 71 . Approximately 26 Hungarian -Americans from the Buckeye community were elected or appointed to various city , county , and state offices . From 1931 - 74 , usually 2 and often 3 judges of the 9 on the bench of the Municipal Court of Cleveland were Hungarian . The most influential Hungarian - American politician in Cleveland city government was JACK P. RUSSELL , who became president of the city council in 1957 and held the position for 11 years . World War II disrupted the Hungarian community of Cleveland drastically : many Hungarian - American youths served and died overseas . In the predominantly Hungarian 29th Ward , 4,305 men ( 13 % of the population ) served in the armed forces . Most returning veterans did not go back to the neighborhoods where they grew up , but moved to suburbs to start families , beginning the disintegration of the Buckeye neighborhood . Following the war , the community worked with and absorbed a new wave of Hungarian immigrants , displaced persons obtaining \" Home and Job Assurances \" needed by postwar immigrants to enter the U.S. , and searching for housing and employment once they arrived . Between 1947 - 53 , approx . 6,000 Hungarian immigrants arrived in Cleveland , generally from Hungary 's urban centers and from the middle and upper-middle classes . Most were well - educated , emigrated with their families , and were established in their careers when they left . They were handicapped by being middle - aged : losing everything and having to start anew proved extremely difficult for many . The postwar immigrants left Hungary because of changes in the political system , not for economic reasons , and intended to return to Hungary when the Soviet occupation of the country ended , making them \u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9s rather than immigrants . They were the most politically conscious among Cleveland 's Hungarians , even compared to the later Hungarian refugees of 1956 . They founded organizations to maintain their homeland traditions , especially those undermined by the postwar government , and emphasized educating the 2nd generation in their language and heritage through Saturday language schools and the Hungarian Scouting movement . They included many writers and journalists ; several new newspapers were founded in Cleveland during the 1950s and 1960s , and they published more books than any other wave of Hungarian immigrants . The revolution in Hungary in Oct. 1956 brought a wave of approx . 41,000 refugees to the U.S. The revolution was unexpected ; the community only recently absorbed the postwar immigrants , but Hungarians in Cleveland reacted quickly . Within the first days mass rallies were held , and organizations initiated relief programs . These refugees were the youngest wave of Hungarian immigrants and the group least prepared with future plans and goals . Unlike previous immigrants , these refugees had to leave Hungary suddenly and unexpectedly ; many possessed a technical trade or had several years of university study . They evoked great public sympathy in the U.S. because of their fight against communism , and numerous opportunities , such as scholarship programs , job placement , and financial assistance , were made available to them . It is difficult to determine the exact number of refugees who settled in Cleveland because census data statistics between 1950 - 60 include many of the postwar immigrants as well , but it has been estimated at 6,000 - 9,000 . Moreover , it is impossible to ascertain how many stayed in Cleveland once they familiarized themselves with English and life in the U.S. Because of their relative youth , technical skills , and single status , they adjusted with greater ease than previous immigrants and exhibited less attachment to community organizations and institutions . For over 100 years , a distinct and unique Hungarian community has existed in Cleveland , constantly rejuvenated by new waves of immigrants . The Buckeye Rd. neighborhood began declining in the 1960s and experienced an alarming increase in crime during the late 1960s and 1970s . By 1980 few Cleveland Hungarians lived there ; but the local Hungarian community was still viable . By the 1980s , there were 113,000 Greater Clevelanders of Hungarian birth or descent . Although the number of Greater Clevelanders claiming Hungarian descent dropped to 61,681 in the 1990 census and the number of people of Hungarian birth resident in Cleveland was a mere 924 , the community remained active . Old organizations were replaced by new ones , founded by 2nd or 3rd generation Hungarian Americans , consisting mainly of folkdance groups , cultural organizations , and civic clubs . Even within the old Buckeye neighborhood , which was almost totally devoid of Hungarian residents , a heritage museum was established at St. Elizabeth 's church , and both remained focal points of Hungarian pride and culture in 1995 . All of these new organizations epitomized an ongoing attempt to preserve cultural traditions and an awareness of ethnic background among the American - born children of Hungarian immigrants .

A study on the distribution of freshwater mollusks that occur within the limits of protected areas was carried out . The objective was to determine the status of the endemic species and the potential threats of introduced snails . It was found that the inclusion of freshwater mollusks is not a criterion for proposing protected areas no matter how ecologically important they actually can be . A total of 42 species of freshwater mollusks occur in Cuba , but only 24 exist in the National System of Protected Areas . More critical is the fact that of the 10 Cuban endemics , three are not protected and the distribution data on all of them are not abundant . Introduced species such as Tarebia granifera and Melanoides tuberculata are spread throughout the country and might be a threat for endemics and other native snails . Data on the distribution of endemic mollusks is presented and the role of some introduced / invasive species is discussed .

A study on the distribution of freshwater mollusks that occur within the limits of protected areas was carried out . The objective was to determine the status of the endemic species and the potential threats of introduced snails . It was found that the inclusion of freshwater mollusks is not a criterion for proposing protected areas no matter how ecologically important they actually can be . A total of 42 species of freshwater mollusks occur in Cuba , but only 24 exist in the National System of Protected Areas . More critical is the fact that of the 10 Cuban endemics , three are not protected and the distribution data on all of them are not abundant . Introduced species such as Tarebia granifera and Melanoides tuberculata are spread throughout the country and might be a threat for endemics and other native snails . Data on the distribution of endemic mollusks is presented and the role of some introduced / invasive species is discussed .

Se encontr\u00f3 que la presencia de moluscos fluviales no es utilizada como criterio a la hora de proponer \u00e1reas protegidas independientemente de la importancia ecol\u00f3gica que presentan . Un total de 42 especies de moluscos fluviales existen en Cuba , pero solo 24 aparecen en el Sistema Nacional de \u00c1reas Protegidas . M\u00e1s cr\u00edtico es el hecho de que de las diez especies end\u00e9micas ( 23.8 % ) , tres no se encuentran protegidas y los datos sobre su distribuci\u00f3n no son abundantes . Especies introducidas como Tarebia granifera y Melanoides tuberculata se han dispersado por todo el pa\u00eds y pueden ser una amenaza para especies end\u00e9micas y otras especies nativas .

This project identified fourteen sites of global importance for birds during three years of extensive field work and the subsequent inventory : Important Bird Areas ( IBAs ) in Fiji : Conserving Fijis Natural Heritage was launched in 2006 ( see BirdLife 's news story , Fiji 's IBA book launched ) . Having identified Fiji\u00eds IBAs , the challenge is to turn research in to action which is now being undertaken with further support from the Darwin Initiative . In 2006 , a project called Community - Based Conservation Groups at Fiji\u00eds Key Conservation Sites was initiated . The overall purpose of this project is to build the capacity of Fijian conservation professionals to conserve forest resources through the establishment of protected areas , management planning processes and monitoring frameworks . These conservation professionals will then train community members in the management of their own forest resources . The challenges remain significant , however . Fiji has already lost the majority of its forest resources with logging , urban and agricultural encroachment and invasive alien species posing the greatest threats to these forests , often all at the same time .. Logging operations disturb forest blocks while logging roads increase access by agriculture pests and alien plants and animals . Four sites are the target of this project\u00eds activities : three have no formal protection and one is reserved . They are : - The Natewa / Tunuloa Peninsula ( FJ03 ) on Vanua Levu , which has lowland forest and , together with the island of Taveuni , supports the only populations of the charismatic Orange Dove and Silktail . The area is under particular threat from logging ; - Nabukulevu and Kadavu East on the island of Kadavu support four bird species and several subspecies endemic to Kadavu ; they are threatened by agricultural encroachment and invasive alien species ; and - Taveuni , the only formally protected area , which is under looming threat from agricultural encroachment and invasive alien species . The main objectives of the project are to : - develop models of community - based protected areas ; - establish management plans for priority sites ; - develop an IBA monitoring framework and establish a baseline on which to assess future conditions of IBAs ; and - raise resources for the further development of managed areas in Fiji . Significant progress has been achieved . Highlights include : - positive responses from communities and provincial governments for the development of managed or protected areas ; - the establishment of a community conservation group on the Natewa Peninsula while continuing work with existing conservation groups in two other IBAs ; - the establishment of a community - declared protected area totaling about 5000ha on the Natewa Peninsula ; - a management plan drafted for the statutory reserves on Taveuni ; - two university students supported to develop frameworks relating to bird populations and forest management ; - the establishment of a draft monitoring framework and initial baseline ; - a fundraising workshop resulting in funding for two project concepts from the GEF Small Grants Programme ; - extensive awareness work in Fiji through media , community work and awareness materials - International promotion at the 2006 British Birdwatching Fair . The challenges to conserving Fiji\u00eds forest resources remain substantial : the causes of deforestation are deep-seated with low local capacity to manage forests . Communities , however , are often under great pressure to derive income through logging . On the hopeful side , many communities would like to manage their forests in sustainable ways , often aware that forest management is related to water quality , fresh water and marine fisheries , the availability of sustainable forest products including fruits and vegetables and flood risk management . This Darwin Initiative project is building the capacity of a cohort of young Fijian conservational professionals who are developing skills that will contribute to sustainable forest management in the future .

The Redskins , who would have clinched their fourth straight playoff appearance with a victory today , now must win one of their remaining two games - a week from Monday night at Los Angeles or Dec. 15 at home against Chicago - to extend their season . \" I do n't have very much to say , \" coach George Allen said when it was over . \" It was probably the toughest loss we ever had . \" The Redskins had done everything in their power to deal the Cowboys a killing blow . They recovered four fumbles , they intercepted a pass , they had three field goals from Mark Moseley and two touchdowns from Duane Thomas . And what should have been most important , Dave Robinson knocked Roger Staubach out of the game on a brutal tackle with 9:57 to play in the third quarter . \" I was a little bit scared , \" Longley said . It hardly showed . Before the day was through , he had bombed the Redskins ' proud defenses , completing 11 of 20 passes for 203 yards and two touchdowns , the game winner to Pearson and another of 35 yards to tight end Billy Joe DuPree . Still , many fans in the crowd of 63,243 were filling toward the traffic jams when Dallas got the football one more time , trailing by 23 - 17 with 1:45 to play and no time - outs remaining .

Along with the final touchdown pass and a blocked Redskin field goal attempt , it may have been the most important play of the game . On first down , Longley passed incomplete to Pearson , the NFC 's leading receiver , who could not hold onto what would have been the game - tying touchdown pass in the first Washington - Dallas game 11 days ago . There were 35 seconds left when Longley went back one more time . Dallas head coach Tom Landry described the play : \" We were just able to run through the zone , \" he said . \" If you have time to throw the ball - and normally you would n't - you try to get the receiver deep in the zone . \" It was a post route and he was supposed to come back over the middle . But he was able to split the two defenders and he was gone . It was a good move on his part . Longley moved away from their rush and slid outside . The pass was perfectly thrown . We caught them flat -footed . \" The Redskins were in their nickel defense , with five defensive backs in the line - up . Pearson was supposed to have been double - covered by Mike Bass and nickel - man Ken Stone , who accepted full responsibility for the game - winning touchdown . \" They were doubling me , \" Pearson said . \" I gave them an inside move .

Many of them pointed to a block of Moseley 's 24 - yard field goal attempt by Ed ( Too Tall ) Jones with 10:51 to play . Earlier in the game Moseley had hit on kicks of 45 , 34 and 39 yards . The 24 - yard effort set up by Ron McDole 's recovery of a Charles Young fumble , would have given the Redskins a 26 - 17 lead and made the Cowboys ' final touchdown academic . The Redskins may also look back on some conservative play - calling in their last three possessions of the fourth quarter before Longley 's game - winning pass . They never got a first down after Thomas swept left end behind Jerry Smith 's block for a touchdown that gave them a 23 - 17 lead 1:34 into the fourth period . On their next possession , quarterback Billy Kilmer called three running plays before Moseley 's 24 - yard effort was blocked . Four minutes later , the Redskins got the ball at their own 12 . A quick - out to Roy Jefferson was out of bounds and two running plays netted three yards . Mike Bragg punted . The Redskins seemingly had the game won and a playoff spot clinched 2 1/2 minutes later when Pearson fumbled after receiving a Longley pass for 20 yards . A hit by corner back Pat Fischer forced the bobble ; Bass recovered and returned the ball to the Washington 31 . Kilmer took over with 2:29 to play . One first down was all that was necessary . But again Kilmer handed off to Moses Denson for a yard ; Denson got three more on second down and Thomas was hit by Charlie Waters on a six -yard loss on third . Bragg punted again and \" that rookie \" got his hands on the ball one more time . It was all he needed . Following Longley 's bomb to Pearson , the Redskins gained possession on their 34 with 25 seconds and three time - outs left . But Kilmer was sacked and fumbled on first down and the Cowboys ran out the clock . Longley said he had been made aware of Talbert 's comments before the teams ' last meeting . \" I enjoy that now , \" he said . \" I did n't think he was attacking me . It 's just that there was a rookie behind Roger . As long as Roger is healthy , I know I 'm not getting in .

The Telegraph revealed in January plans from Steve Webb , pensions minister , to devise a system of selling on annuities . Last week , it emerged that this plan would be tabled by the Coalition , and this was then confirmed by George Osborne on Sunday . This is great news for those who have missed out on the pension freedoms . Annuity rates have been very poor for the last couple of years and many recent retirees feel aggrieved that they were forced to buy poor value products that pay a paltry income .

Last week , it emerged that this plan would be tabled by the Coalition , and this was then confirmed by George Osborne on Sunday . This is great news for those who have missed out on the pension freedoms . Annuity rates have been very poor for the last couple of years and many recent retirees feel aggrieved that they were forced to buy poor value products that pay a paltry income . Experts say there is a market for specialist brokers to buy and sell the contracts , but pricing them would be difficult and there would be significant fees involved , as well as possible tax implications . >> The best of Telegraph Money : get our weekly newsletter","annotations":[{"text":"the lifetime allowance will rise in line with inflation ( consumer prices index )","span":[1243,1323],"token_span":[241,254],"role":"Event","label":"Event","role_definition":"Name of the Event which occurs."},{"text":"from 2018","span":[1325,1333],"token_span":[255,256],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the Event occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-2980-153-frame-Process_start","frame":"Process_start","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Event begins at a certain Time and Place.","frame_ancestors":["Event"],"frame_descendants":["Activity_start","Come_into_effect"],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Oy\u00e9- Mba was an unsuccessful candidate for the position of President of the African Development Bank in 2005 ; he reached the fourth round of voting on the first day of the election , 18 May 2005 . \" Obasanjo at ADB Meeting , election of new President commences \" , nigeriafirst.org , 19 May 2005 .","annotations":[{"text":"the first day of the election , 18 May 2005","span":[152,194],"token_span":[27,36],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the Event occurs."},{"text":"ADB Meeting","span":[212,222],"token_span":[41,42],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"Where the Event takes place."},{"text":"election of new President","span":[226,250],"token_span":[44,47],"role":"Event","label":"Event","role_definition":"Name of the Event which occurs."}],"trigger":{"text":"commences","start_char":252,"end_char":260,"start_token":48,"end_token":48,"frame":"Process_start"}},"source":{"text":"| International News | President Olusegun Obasanjo on 18 May attended the opening ceremony of the African Development Bank ( ADB ) Group Annual Meeting , which comprised the 40th Annual Meeting of the ADB and the 31st Annual Meeting of the African Development Fund ( ADF ) . | Obasanjo at ADB Meeting , election of new President commences | May 19 , 2005 , 18:29 | | The event took place at the Nicon Hilton Hotel in Abuja .

Even more startling is the factor H\u00f6ffner believes caused this development -- in his view , it was none other than copyright law , which was established early in Great Britain , in 1710 , that crippled the world of knowledge in the United Kingdom . Germany , on the other hand , did n't bother with the concept of copyright for a long time . Prussia , then by far Germany 's biggest state , introduced a copyright law in 1837 , but Germany 's continued division into small states meant that it was hardly possible to enforce the law throughout the empire . H\u00f6ffner 's diligent research is the first academic work to examine the effects of the copyright over a comparatively long period of time and based on a direct comparison between two countries , and his findings have caused a stir among academics . Until now , copyright was seen as a great achievement and a guarantee for a flourishing book market . Authors are only motivated to write , runs the conventional belief , if they know their rights will be protected . Yet a historical comparison , at least , reaches a different conclusion . Publishers in England exploited their monopoly shamelessly . New discoveries were generally published in limited editions of at most 750 copies and sold at a price that often exceeded the weekly salary of an educated worker .

In Germany during the same period , publishers had plagiarizers -- who could reprint each new publication and sell it cheaply without fear of punishment -- breathing down their necks . Successful publishers were the ones who took a sophisticated approach in reaction to these copycats and devised a form of publication still common today , issuing fancy editions for their wealthy customers and low-priced paperbacks for the masses . A Multitude of Treatises This created a book market very different from the one found in England . Bestsellers and academic works were introduced to the German public in large numbers and at extremely low prices . \" So many thousands of people in the most hidden corners of Germany , who could not have thought of buying books due to the expensive prices , have put together , little by little , a small library of reprints , \" the historian Heinrich Bensen wrote enthusiastically at the time .

The German proliferation of knowledge created a curious situation that hardly anyone is likely to have noticed at the time .

H\u00f6ffner explains that this \" lively scholarly discourse \" laid the basis for the Gr\u00fcnderzeit , or foundation period , the term used to describe the rapid industrial expansion in Germany in the late 19th century . The period produced later industrial magnates such as Alfred Krupp and Werner von Siemens . The market for scientific literature did n't collapse even as copyright law gradually became established in Germany in the 1840s . German publishers did , however , react to the new situation in a restrictive way reminiscent of their British colleagues , cranking up prices and doing away with the low-price market . Authors , now guaranteed the rights to their own works , were often annoyed by this development . Heinrich Heine , for example , wrote to his publisher Julius Campe on October 24 , 1854 , in a rather acerbic mood : \" Due to the tremendously high prices you have established , I will hardly see a second edition of the book anytime soon .

The market for scientific literature did n't collapse even as copyright law gradually became established in Germany in the 1840s . German publishers did , however , react to the new situation in a restrictive way reminiscent of their British colleagues , cranking up prices and doing away with the low-price market . Authors , now guaranteed the rights to their own works , were often annoyed by this development . Heinrich Heine , for example , wrote to his publisher Julius Campe on October 24 , 1854 , in a rather acerbic mood : \" Due to the tremendously high prices you have established , I will hardly see a second edition of the book anytime soon . But you must set lower prices , dear Campe , for otherwise I really do n't see why I was so lenient with my material interests . \"","annotations":[{"text":"books","span":[150,154],"token_span":[26,26],"role":"Set","label":"Set","role_definition":"The group of entities, possibly construed as a collective, whose number changes."},{"text":"an incomparable mass","span":[502,521],"token_span":[92,94],"role":"Final_state","label":"Final_state","role_definition":"A description that presents the Set's state after the change in the Attribute's value as an independent predication."},{"text":"the 19th century","span":[790,805],"token_span":[136,138],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time is the time-frame in which the change in number occurs."},{"text":"Germany","span":[641,647],"token_span":[115,115],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"A location where the Set changes in number."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-1497-1245-frame-Proliferating_in_number","frame":"Proliferating_in_number","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"The number of entities that make up the Set changes from an Initial_number to a Final_number.","frame_ancestors":["Change_position_on_a_scale","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"21st century In 2020 the city ordered churches to shut down to prevent the spread of COVID - 19 and issued citations and fines to those attending a drive - in church gathering .","annotations":[{"text":"the city","span":[21,28],"token_span":[4,5],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"A location where the Set changes in number."},{"text":"COVID - 19","span":[85,94],"token_span":[16,18],"role":"Set","label":"Set","role_definition":"The group of entities, possibly construed as a collective, whose number changes."}],"trigger":{"text":"spread","start_char":75,"end_char":80,"start_token":14,"end_token":14,"frame":"Proliferating_in_number"}},"source":{"text":"A small Mississippi Church got some major support Tuesday from the federal government in its lawsuit against the city that tried to shut down a drive - in church service over coronavirus concerns .

John Plimmer was born on 28 June 1812 at Upton-under - Amon , near Shrewsbury , Shropshire , the youngest but one of the 12 children of Isaac Plimmer , a builder and timber merchant , and of Mary , n\u00e9e Roden . He was educated at the local parish school and intended for the teaching profession ; however , he preferred to train as a master builder and plasterer . When his father moved to Willenhall , Staffordshire , Plimmer plied his trade there until he was attracted by the colonising activities of the New Zealand Company . On 31 October 1841 he arrived at Port Nicholson in the Gertrude and settled at Te Aro , Wellington , where he commenced a prosperous timber and charcoal - burning business and a small limeworks . In 1850 he purchased the Inconstant ( 586 tons ) , which had been wrecked at Pencarrow Head . After towing the hull to Lambton foreshore , to a point opposite the present Barrett 's Hotel , he converted it into a wharf , business offices , and a bonded warehouse . Plimmer 's wharf or \u201c Noah 's Ark \u201d , as it became popularly known , proved a most profitable concern and continued to be used until 1883 . Over the years Plimmer invested much of the money he made from the \u201c Ark \u201d in various local public companies . After the 1855 earthquake he devoted himself to his building and contracting business , became a foundation member of the Wellington Chamber of Commerce , and was elected to the first Town Board ( 1867\u201371 ) . He represented Wellington City in the Provincial Council ( 1856 \u2013 57 ) and opposed the sale of the city 's reserved lands . During his term he introduced , and successfully piloted through the Council , a Bill to vest these in the city authorities . Possessing keen business foresight , Plimmer became a strong advocate of railways , the reclamation of portions of Wellington 's waterfront , and improved harbour facilities . For many years he urged the construction of the North Island Main Trunk railway and was prominent in the agitation which preceded the formation of the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Co . Plimmer was a foundation member of the company , remaining on its board until 1900 . He was also a director of the New Zealand Times Co. for many years and contributed many letters and articles on current topics to that and other Wellington newspapers . During the Boer War he conducted vigorous press campaigns to aid the patriotic funds . In 1901 the Government appointed him one of the Wellington Commissioners to welcome the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York . Partly because of his extreme longevity and partly because his firm was responsible for erecting many of the well - known commercial buildings in the city , John Plimmer has been called \u201c the Father of Wellington \u201d . More justly , perhaps , this title should belong to Colonel Wakefield . Plimmer was twice married : first , in 1833 , at Birmingham , to Mary Roden , who was probably a cousin ; and , secondly , in 1864 , at Wellington , to Janet , a sister of John Anderson , editor of the Wellington Independent .

At least not the life of Imants Lesinskis . Mr. Lesinskis spent 23 years working in various positions for the Soviet Committee for State Security ( KGB ) prior to his 1978 defection to the United States . Though he was not a KGB version of James Bond , Lesinskis was nonetheless effective at what he did . Intelligence experts characterize his former job as '' Soviet active measures . '' Lesinskis calls it ' 'ethnic espionage . '' He worked in his native Latvia , one of the tiny Baltic states taken over by the Soviets following World War II . In the Latvian capital city , Riga , he served as editor of the newspaper Dzimtenes Balss ( Voice of the Motherland ) and as chairman of the Latvian Committee for Cultural Relations , a group that maintains ties with Latvians living abroad . He says both of these organizations are KGB fronts . The man who today is chairman of the LCCR is a KGB lieutenant colonel who was expelled from Sweden for spying in 1982 , Lesinskis says . According to a newspaper account dated April 22 , 1982 , Soviet vice - consul Alberts Liepa , a Latvian , was expelled from Sweden for trying to recruit Latvian emigres as spies . Another press report quoted Latvian emigres in Sweden as saying that Mr. Liepa was ''well known among their community for his propaganda broadcasts to Sweden on Riga Radio in the late 1960s . '' '' It was a big operation on the Soviet scale , '' Lesinskis says . In effect , Lesinskis directed a system for assembling and distributing disinformation to discredit ( Lesinskis today uses the word ' ' slander ' ' ) Latvians and Latvian emigres throughout the world whom Soviet authorities had determined to be anti-Soviet . Latvian nationalists were prime targets . He says it was a '' Soviet propaganda offensive . '' Emigre mail is intercepted by the Soviets , he says . Lists of people living abroad are made , then files are made and updated on each of them . He adds , '' There are files on almost all active immigrants . '' There are an estimated 35,000 Latvian immigrants in the US . '' Many people living in the West have ties to the old country and it is relatively easy for the KGB to use that nostalgia for the old country for their own purposes , '' Lesinskis says . '' One of their main aims is to organize Soviet support groups that can invite KGB people of the native country into the US , '' he says . '' What they do is split our emigre community in half , '' says Aristids Lambergs , vice - chairman of the Boston - based American - Latvian Cultural Exchange Committee . '' It dilutes our strength . It gets us to fight among ourselves . '' They are very effective , '' Mr. Lambergs adds . He ought to know . According to Lambergs , both he and his conservative , pro-West group are exactly what Lesinskis would have been targeting a decade ago . Today , the two men are working together to do some targeting of their own . Through a combination of speeches and press releases , Lesinskis and Lambergs intend to expose current and future KGB efforts to infiltrate and harass the Latvian emigre community in the US . '' It is very difficult for the American government to counteract those ties because the American policy has been one of promoting human contact between emigres and their homeland , '' says Lambergs . He adds , '' We have started a program of identifying these ( KGB ) people when they come . '' '' I know all the support groups , the people , the methods , and aims , '' Lesinskis says . '' Nothing has changed in comparison with the mid-1970s when I was in charge . '' Their first salvo was announcing that four of a group of seven Latvian scientists scheduled to attend a coming conference on Baltic studies in Montreal have KGB connections . '' It started an uproar in Riga to start identifying these people , '' Lambergs says . Lesinskis adds that a West Coast - based Latvian group has invited a number of persons with KGB connections . He adds that he knows of a Latvian scientist who is scheduled to begin a trip to the US today . '' He is a professional spy . I was with him in Austria in 1964 . '' Since his defection in September 1978 , Lesinskis has kept a low profile , granting only occasional interviews . He says he holds a regular , well - paying job in the US and that he was treated well by the US government during his defection . He is reluctant to talk in detail about his new life in America . '' I still feel my life is in danger , '' he says . '' I wish I could tell some more details . I think there would be more defections , '' he says . At the time of his defection , Lesinskis was working as a translator in the United Nations Secretariat . Only a few months earlier Arkadi Shevchenko , an undersecretary - general at the UN and one of the highest - ranking Soviets in the US , shocked the UN diplomatic corps as well as his superiors in Moscow by defecting to the US . Shortly after that , Lesinskis 's KGB contact in New York - UN political affairs officer Valdik Enger - was arrested and convicted with two other Soviets of having paid $ 16,000 in bribes to obtain classified US documents on antisubmarine warfare . Lesinskis says he was blackmailed into working as a KGB informer in Latvia in 1956 , and though he continued to work for the KGB for more than 20 years , he was quietly opposed to its methods and goals . He says he resented what he calls the Soviet oppression of Latvia .","annotations":[{"text":"Imants Lesinskis","span":[120,135],"token_span":[25,26],"role":"Self_mover","label":"Self_mover","role_definition":"This is the entity which moves under its own power."},{"text":"1978","span":[262,265],"token_span":[50,50],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the motion takes place."},{"text":"to the United States","span":[277,296],"token_span":[52,55],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place is where the motion (which is specified by a Source, Path or Goal) is located."},{"text":"the Latvian capital city , Riga","span":[645,675],"token_span":[122,127],"role":"Source","label":"Source","role_definition":"Any expression which implies a definite starting-point of motion expresses the frame element Source.

It gets us to fight among ourselves . '' They are very effective , '' Mr. Lambergs adds . He ought to know . According to Lambergs , both he and his conservative , pro-West group are exactly what Lesinskis would have been targeting a decade ago . Today , the two men are working together to do some targeting of their own . Through a combination of speeches and press releases , Lesinskis and Lambergs intend to expose current and future KGB efforts to infiltrate and harass the Latvian emigre community in the US . '' It is very difficult for the American government to counteract those ties because the American policy has been one of promoting human contact between emigres and their homeland , '' says Lambergs . He adds , '' We have started a program of identifying these ( KGB ) people when they come . '' '' I know all the support groups , the people , the methods , and aims , '' Lesinskis says . '' Nothing has changed in comparison with the mid-1970s when I was in charge . '' Their first salvo was announcing that four of a group of seven Latvian scientists scheduled to attend a coming conference on Baltic studies in Montreal have KGB connections . '' It started an uproar in Riga to start identifying these people , '' Lambergs says . Lesinskis adds that a West Coast - based Latvian group has invited a number of persons with KGB connections . He adds that he knows of a Latvian scientist who is scheduled to begin a trip to the US today . '' He is a professional spy . I was with him in Austria in 1964 . '' Since his defection in September 1978 , Lesinskis has kept a low profile , granting only occasional interviews . He says he holds a regular , well - paying job in the US and that he was treated well by the US government during his defection . He is reluctant to talk in detail about his new life in America . '' I still feel my life is in danger , '' he says . '' I wish I could tell some more details . I think there would be more defections , '' he says . At the time of his defection , Lesinskis was working as a translator in the United Nations Secretariat . Only a few months earlier Arkadi Shevchenko , an undersecretary - general at the UN and one of the highest - ranking Soviets in the US , shocked the UN diplomatic corps as well as his superiors in Moscow by defecting to the US . Shortly after that , Lesinskis 's KGB contact in New York - UN political affairs officer Valdik Enger - was arrested and convicted with two other Soviets of having paid $ 16,000 in bribes to obtain classified US documents on antisubmarine warfare . Lesinskis says he was blackmailed into working as a KGB informer in Latvia in 1956 , and though he continued to work for the KGB for more than 20 years , he was quietly opposed to its methods and goals . He says he resented what he calls the Soviet oppression of Latvia .","annotations":[{"text":"Imants Lesinskis","span":[120,135],"token_span":[25,26],"role":"Self_mover","label":"Self_mover","role_definition":"This is the entity which moves under its own power."},{"text":"Riga","span":[672,675],"token_span":[127,127],"role":"Source","label":"Source","role_definition":"Any expression which implies a definite starting-point of motion expresses the frame element Source.

Nothing happened . CHARLOTTE , N.C. ( WBTV ) \u2013 Former female students at Myers Park High School reported being raped , sexually assaulted and sexually harassed by fellow students at school but virtually nothing was done to address the reports , according to former students ' lawsuits and interviews . Myers Park and Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools have faced two lawsuits from former students alleging the school and school system violated federal laws meant to protect students from sexual violence on campus . One of the lawsuits settled in late April . Requests for an interview for this story sent to CMS communications staff , school board members and the Myers Park principal all went unanswered or were denied . WBTV has been investigating the way in which Myers Park administrators handle reports of sexual violence on campus since 2015 , when a former student first reported being raped in the woods behind the school . Our 2015 investigation described how a female student had reported being forced into the woods behind the school by her boyfriend and made to perform sex acts . Both in our prior story and in her lawsuit , the student said that her friends managed to flag the school resource officer \u2014 a CMPD officer assigned to the school \u2014 who found the pair but decided no crime had been committed because , in his estimation , both students had agreed to skip class and go into the woods voluntarily . Previous : Former Myers Park HS student sues school district over handling of rape allegations That incident ended with the girl 's mother taking her for a rape kit and police refusing to come to collect the kit for hours , despite multiple calls from hospital staff . Ultimately , that student and her parents filed a lawsuit against Myers Park , CMS and CMPD , among others . That case is now referred to as the Jane Doe case , using the pseudonym the female student used to file the lawsuit . ' I was struck by how similar it was to my case ' A second female Myers Park student saw that story in November 2015 . \u201c When I read the report that you guys did on the Jane Doe case , I was struck by how similar it was to my case , \u201d the second student told WBTV in a recent interview . The second student , who would eventually file a lawsuit against Myers Park , CMS and others under the pseudonym Jill Roe , reported being raped in the woods when she was a 15 - year - old sophomore at the school in 2014 . According to the lawsuit Roe filed , her then - boyfriend texted her one day that he had brought a gun to school and would kill himself if she did n't meet him in the woods adjacent to the school . Once in the woods , the lawsuit says , the male student forced Roe to undress before he attempted to anally rape her and did vaginally rape her . Roe reported the incident the next day to a Community in Schools staff member who worked at the school , according to the lawsuit . She was referred to a school counselor who then sent Roe to the school resource officer \u2014 the same one who dismissed the 2015 incident \u2014 who ultimately took Roe to the school 's principal , Mark Bosco . Document : Lawsuit filed by Jill Roe against Myers Park High School , CMS In an interview with WBTV , Roe said she was hesitant to report what happened but did so in hopes school officials would help protect her from future violence . \u201c It was just a difficult thing to talk about with anyone in the first place ; a difficult thing to admit had happened , \u201d she said . \u201c He was still harassing me and I knew I needed help and I needed an adult to get involved . And , so , I went to the school because I thought they could protect me . \u201d But instead of helping her , both Roe and her lawsuit allege , both the SRO and Bosco , the principal , dismissed her report . \u201c Defendant Bosco then informed Ms. Roe that she could make a fifth ' formal ' report , but then discouraged the 15 - year - old Ms. Roe from doing so by claiming that if [ the male student ] was ' found innocent ' it would mean that she would be found responsible for having sex on campus to subject her to disciplinary action and negatively impact her good standing at MPHS , \u201d the lawsuit said . \u201c Bosco then directly implied to Ms. Roe that she should just let the whole thing blow over in order to avoid this risk to her academic future , \u201d the lawsuit continued . In her interview with WBTV , Roe said she left that meeting with Bosco feeling worse than when she walked in . \u201c I felt less listened to and less believed leaving there than I did when I came in , \u201d she said . Bosco confirmed in a deposition under oath that he warned Roe what could happen if her report was found to not be credible at the end of a formal investigation . \u201c I just wanted her to be aware , and that she was confident that what she thought happened happened , \u201d Bosco said under oath . During his deposition , Bosco also said he did not have an obligation to report incidents of students reporting rape or sexual assault to either CMPD or CMS Police . Roe said she is still dealing with the fallout from the trauma she experienced in 2014 . She has diagnosed PTSD , has been to multiple inpatient treatment centers and is still in therapy . She also had to drop out of college . \u201c It took me over three years to finally go to therapy because I was so disheartened by the way the school handled it that I thought all adults would make me feel the way that the school did and the way that the counselors did and the way the principal did and the way the school resource officer did , ' she said . \u201c It felt like adults would n't believe me and that if I told anyone they would only make me feel worse . So , I felt like I had to suffer in silence because of the way that the school handled it . \u201d ' I definitely did not feel super safe ' In the course of reporting this story , WBTV spoke with multiple former Myers Park High School students who said there was a lot of sexual harassment at the school that went unchecked by administrators . Most declined to talk with a reporter on the record . But one former student , a female who graduated in 2019 , did agree to talk on the condition we not reveal her identity . The former student said she experienced sexual assault and sexual harassment \u2014 including males pinching and touching her in the hallways and elsewhere on campus \u2014 on a daily basis . She said she would report the behavior to administrators but little or nothing was ever done . \u201c Most of the time they would dismiss it but the times that they did n't dismiss it to my face , I do n't ever believe that they reached out to that other individual and did anything about it , \u201d she said . She did not feel safe on campus at Myers Park High School , she said . \u201c I ca n't speak for everybody but I know that I definitely did not feel super safe being there , \u201d she said . She said she was especially aware that the woods surrounding the school \u2014 part of which are owned by CMS and other parts of which are owned by other city and county agencies \u2014 were not safe . \u201c I know some of the girls who had things happen to them in those woods and I know how personally it affected them and how uncomfortable those woods made them , so I felt for my own safety , it would be better to just stay clear of there , \u201d she said . So , what is CMS and Myers Park doing to make things safer on campus ? A CMS spokesman refused an interview request , saying the district does n't comment on pending litigation . Jill Roe settled her lawsuit in late April for $ 50,000 . The Jane Doe case remains pending in federal court . Multiple emails to Bosco , CMS board chair Elyse Dashew , vice chair Thelma - Byers Bailey and District 5 representative Margaret Marshall , whose district includes Myers Park , all went unanswered . On Monday , a WBTV reporter attempted to ask questions of CMS Superintendent Earnest Winston for this story . He stared straight ahead , emotionless , and did not acknowledge the reporter when asked what , if anything , the district was doing to respond to reports of rape , sexual assault and sexual harassment from female students at Myers Park High School . CMS board chair Elyse Dashew said she had been instructed not to respond to WBTV 's questions . \u201c I really do n't comment on legal matters , \u201d Dashew said when first approached by a reporter . \u201c There are legal matters involved here , and so I 've been advised to follow our usual protocol , \u201d Dashew said after further pressing . That continued silence from school leaders is why Jill Roe chose to file a lawsuit and speak out now . \u201c I need to help because what happened to Jane Doe was so messed up , what happened to me was so messed up and it 's a school 's job to protect people , \u201d she said . \u201c It 's a school 's job to protect their students and when they do n't do that , I feel like someone has to stand up . \u201d Copyright 2021 WBTV .

Multiple emails to Bosco , CMS board chair Elyse Dashew , vice chair Thelma - Byers Bailey and District 5 representative Margaret Marshall , whose district includes Myers Park , all went unanswered . On Monday , a WBTV reporter attempted to ask questions of CMS Superintendent Earnest Winston for this story . He stared straight ahead , emotionless , and did not acknowledge the reporter when asked what , if anything , the district was doing to respond to reports of rape , sexual assault and sexual harassment from female students at Myers Park High School . CMS board chair Elyse Dashew said she had been instructed not to respond to WBTV 's questions . \u201c I really do n't comment on legal matters , \u201d Dashew said when first approached by a reporter . \u201c There are legal matters involved here , and so I 've been advised to follow our usual protocol , \u201d Dashew said after further pressing . That continued silence from school leaders is why Jill Roe chose to file a lawsuit and speak out now . \u201c I need to help because what happened to Jane Doe was so messed up , what happened to me was so messed up and it 's a school 's job to protect people , \u201d she said . \u201c It 's a school 's job to protect their students and when they do n't do that , I feel like someone has to stand up . \u201d Copyright 2021 WBTV .

War rapes in present times The Bangladesh war of 1971 was hardly the last time rape was used as a tool for inflicting terror and brutality upon the enemy in the event of a war .

Much of Kabul seemed a city numbed by war and fearful of harbouring hope . Reminiscent of liberating Kuwait I was also sobered by an event I was reminded of , a decade earlier , during the fall of Kuwait City at the end of the Gulf War . Back then I could still hear the sound of distant gunfire as I entered the city alongside American troops . It had rained overnight and the air was filled with smoke from burning oilfields , ignited by fleeing Iraqi soldiers . I went into the nearly deserted Hilton Hotel on Arabian Gulf Street . The hotel staff had long gone and there was no power , but I was still hoping to grab an empty room . Cowering in a corner in near darkness were half a dozen Filipino girls who had been working as domestic maids for local Kuwaitis . I asked how they were ; the Iraqis had treated them well , they said . Then suddenly , struck with fear , one of the girls grabbed my arm and pleaded that I should not allow the Kuwaitis to return . I listened as two of the girls told me that they had been raped by their Kuwaiti masters . Their erstwhile employers held their passports and the girls were too fearful to report the crimes . After listening to their harrowing accounts , I 'd had to admit to them that I was powerless to help . Somewhat embarrassed , I simply wished them well and explained that I had work to do . I was to experience a similar feeling in Kabul . Hope is restrained I ventured west to the district of Afshar , where block after block of shattered housing resembles the ruins of an ancient civilisation . In 1993 , it was the site of repeated human butchery during fighting between a faction that adheres to the Shi'ite Muslim faith and followers of a Saudi backed Mujahideen leader , Abdul Rasul Sayyaf . Amnesty International reported that Sayyaf 's forces rampaged through Afshar , murdering , raping and burning homes . Now Sayyaf 's forces are back in Kabul , a key component of the Northern Alliance army . The future As we filmed the devastation in Afshar , I noticed a woman peering from the doorway of her home . She was perhaps 50 , though the poor diet and harsh climate often makes Afghans appear much older than their age . Her face was showing under a headscarf . She was not wearing the burqa - the head to toe covering required for women under Taleban law . I asked if she was happy that the Taleban had fled and she no longer needed to abide by their strict dress code . She shrugged . Her name was Mrs Waseeq . It did n't matter who was in charge , she said , and wearing the burqa was of little consequence . Then , in a sudden flurry of excitement , she called her son , a thin young man who looked about 15 . She pushed him towards me . \" His name is Sayed . Take him , \" she pleaded , \" take him home with you . He is a strong young man . He can help you . Take him with you to your country . \" Her sullen face was now round with anticipation , her eyes widened by hope . Taken aback , I said the boy should stay to look after his mother and it was impossible to bring him into Britain . Her face narrowed in disappointment . \" There 's no future here . There is nothing here . Nothing to live for . \" Resigned , Mrs Waseeq pulled her son back and closed the door behind them . She was trapped in her world and I was powerless to liberate her . I had work to do . And the aim of the war in Afghanistan is to ensure that the United States becomes a safer place , rather than to provide hope to Mrs Waseeq and her son Sayed .

It had rained overnight and the air was filled with smoke from burning oilfields , ignited by fleeing Iraqi soldiers . I went into the nearly deserted Hilton Hotel on Arabian Gulf Street . The hotel staff had long gone and there was no power , but I was still hoping to grab an empty room . Cowering in a corner in near darkness were half a dozen Filipino girls who had been working as domestic maids for local Kuwaitis . I asked how they were ; the Iraqis had treated them well , they said . Then suddenly , struck with fear , one of the girls grabbed my arm and pleaded that I should not allow the Kuwaitis to return . I listened as two of the girls told me that they had been raped by their Kuwaiti masters . Their erstwhile employers held their passports and the girls were too fearful to report the crimes . After listening to their harrowing accounts , I 'd had to admit to them that I was powerless to help . Somewhat embarrassed , I simply wished them well and explained that I had work to do . I was to experience a similar feeling in Kabul . Hope is restrained I ventured west to the district of Afshar , where block after block of shattered housing resembles the ruins of an ancient civilisation . In 1993 , it was the site of repeated human butchery during fighting between a faction that adheres to the Shi'ite Muslim faith and followers of a Saudi backed Mujahideen leader , Abdul Rasul Sayyaf . Amnesty International reported that Sayyaf 's forces rampaged through Afshar , murdering , raping and burning homes . Now Sayyaf 's forces are back in Kabul , a key component of the Northern Alliance army . The future As we filmed the devastation in Afshar , I noticed a woman peering from the doorway of her home . She was perhaps 50 , though the poor diet and harsh climate often makes Afghans appear much older than their age . Her face was showing under a headscarf . She was not wearing the burqa - the head to toe covering required for women under Taleban law . I asked if she was happy that the Taleban had fled and she no longer needed to abide by their strict dress code . She shrugged . Her name was Mrs Waseeq . It did n't matter who was in charge , she said , and wearing the burqa was of little consequence . Then , in a sudden flurry of excitement , she called her son , a thin young man who looked about 15 . She pushed him towards me . \" His name is Sayed . Take him , \" she pleaded , \" take him home with you . He is a strong young man . He can help you . Take him with you to your country . \" Her sullen face was now round with anticipation , her eyes widened by hope . Taken aback , I said the boy should stay to look after his mother and it was impossible to bring him into Britain . Her face narrowed in disappointment . \" There 's no future here . There is nothing here . Nothing to live for . \" Resigned , Mrs Waseeq pulled her son back and closed the door behind them . She was trapped in her world and I was powerless to liberate her . I had work to do . And the aim of the war in Afghanistan is to ensure that the United States becomes a safer place , rather than to provide hope to Mrs Waseeq and her son Sayed .

More than the melodies , more than the arrangements , more than the choice of subject matter , more than his puzzle - maker 's sense of structure , it was his commitment to truth that made the work great . Any time you sat down to watch one of his musicals or listen to one of his songs , you entered into a pact with Sondheim : he was going to tell you the truth , the hard truth , about life as he saw it , compassionately but without sugarcoating anything . You , the audience member , were going to accept that the truth was messy , and that Sondheim was n't here to lie about that . He was n't going to give you the sorts of easy reassurances and neat resolutions that the marketplace tends to demand of entertainers and artists . You were going to think and feel , and what you thought about and felt might not necessarily fill you with affection and hope for humanity . That was inspiring , because it was brave . Like so many creative people , I thought of Sondheim as a guiding light . I knew I was never going to reach the heights that he did as an artist or poet and scholar of human experience , because Sondheim was the American Shakespeare . But thanks to Sondheim , I had an example of what to aim for . Along with a handful of other theater luminaries \u2014 including his mentor , lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II ( \" Oklahoma ! \" \" Carousel \" ) \u2014 Sondheim produced work that was as close to uncompromised as it was possible for an American to get . The appeal of Sondheim is his pursuit of The Truth , caps on both words . Not truth as \" telling my truth , \" but The Truth : an account of existence that speaks to everyone , whatever the specifics of their lives . You ca n't capture The Truth unless you forget about trying to create a hit or a critic 's darling or a snapshot of the zeitgeist , and instead take a hard look at the basics : love , fairness , psychology ; coincidence , fate ; the intertwined drives to create and destroy . These are matters that we can all agree are hard to talk about , and that do n't yield answers \u2014 at least not the kind that we may long to hear , like , \" True love conquers all \" and \" The arc of the universe bends towards justice . \" Sondheim was n't a pessimist or a knee - jerk contrarian , so he did n't answer those questions and others like them with a flat , \" No \u2014 it does n't . \" He liked to put a \" maybe \" in front of those types of assertions , and tack an \" except when it does n't \" onto the end , then build that out into something more complicated than you expected to find in a musical . He was adamant that unresolved contradictions were an immutable part of life , they were inherently fascinating , and they could be funny when framed just so . And because each person is a unique bundle of contradictions and often uncontainable drives , Sondheim 's songs never lacked for richness and beauty . The best observed the interior life of individuals as astutely and unmercifully as Shakespeare 's plays , which the scholar Harold Bloom posited as the forerunner of Sigmund Freud 's writings on psychology . Look at the songs from just one Sondheim classic , 1970 's Company , about the complexities of sex , love , and commitment . In the HBO documentary \" Six by Sondheim , \" Sondheim recalls being mystified by a rave review praising the musical as an attack on marriage when in fact it was simply , and above all else , \" about marriage . \" It 's a sardonic affirmation of how impossible and unresolvable and fraught with pitfalls and downsides even a great marriage can be . This is all crystallized in \" The Little Things You Do Together , \" which feels at once celebratory and rueful . It 's the little things you share together Swear together Wear together That make perfect relationships The concerts you enjoy together Neighbors you annoy together Children you destroy together That keep marriage intact . And then : [ It 's ] the little ways you try together Cry together Lie together That make perfect relationships Becoming a cliche together Growing old and gray together Withering away together That make marriage a joy ! That the words \" a joy \" are typically sung in a \" joyful \" way adds to the song 's delightful sense of unresolved tension and contradiction . Same with \" And Jesus Christ is it fun ! \" , a line that the hard - edged Joanne ( as played by the original cast 's Elaine Stritch ) delivers in a voice that 's a laugh and a sneer . In that the same musical 's \" Being Alive , \" the commitment - phobic Bobby gets close to an epiphany while he sings ( in a deliberately distancing , second - person voice ) of wanting : Someone to hold you too close Someone to hurt you too deep Someone to sit in your chair And ruin your sleep Someone to need you too much Someone to know you too well Someone to pull you up short To put you through hell Sondheim 's lyrics are filled with these sorts of constructions , juxtaposing feelings and ideas and whatever their opposites might be , and allowing them to coexist in the moment , seemingly on equal footing . They ask questions without supplying answers . They describe predicaments that are exciting and boring , ecstatic and misery - inducing , seemingly easy to grasp and yet , upon closer inspection , inscrutable . Neither condition cancels the other . That 's what makes Sondheim Sondheim . Consider \" Move On , \" from Sunday in the Park with George : I chose and my world was shaken So what ? The choice may have been mistaken , The choosing was not . It 's defiant . It 's regretful . It 's bewildered . It 's introspective . It 's several more things , all at the same time . It 's four lines . In Into the Woods , the Baker 's Wife sings a verse that reads like an affirmation that all experience , even the most awful kind , is preferable to never truly feeling your own existence as it unfolds : Oh , if life were made of moments , Even now and then a bad one \u2014 ! But if life were only moments , Then you 'd never know you had one Sondheim 's mastery of language \u2014 not just of the meanings of words , but of the emotional effects that occur when they 're put together in a line , and the line 's meter , its sound \u2014 might seem as if it were meant to get the artist and the audience closer to answers . Instead , they ( deliberately ) got the listeners lost in a mirror - hall of meaning that denied or deferred a lot of the simpler pleasures . Only the sheer beauty of the vocal and instrumental arrangements and Sondheim 's gift for a pleasing melody prevented the lyrics from becoming too demanding for some audiences to bear . The tension between the music and the lyrics could power a whole book , or podcast , by itself . It 's not unlike the feeling of watching \" A Clockwork Orange \" ( a film Sondheim admired for lots of reasons ) and being disturbed by how the ugliness of the content and the verve of the filmmaking seemed to work at cross- purposes , on purpose . Exhibits A and B within Sondheim 's body of work are probably Assassins , which consists of musical character portraits of various American assassins and would - be assassins , and that is almost maddeningly irresistible , given the subject ; and Sweeney Todd , a quasi-operetta that takes the exploits of a vengeful murderer and the pie-maker who turns his victims into food and churns them into an epic of thwarted desire and fury , packed with eccentric , often hilarious supporting characters worthy of a Charles Dickens novel , and songs that are as beautiful as Todd 's actions are ghastly . The resolutions that Sondheim 's music gave you were primarily musical and / or mathematical . His work did n't give you the kind of resolution that let allowed you to leave the theater smiling and humming your favorite tunes , eager to have a nightcap and perhaps a dessert and then go home to sleep . He wrote songs that you had to struggle with and puzzle over , and that pulled your intellect and feelings in disparate directions . Sondheim 's greatest musicals all began with the unstated proposition , \" We 're adults here , so let 's not lie to each other about what life is . \" They also expected you to engage with the work on its terms , not yours . His greatest collaboration with director James Lapine , Sunday in the Park with George , is the work that won him a Pulitzer for drama , arguably his masterpiece , and perhaps his most difficult and demanding , thanks to its conceptual boldness and lack of obvious emotional anchor points for the audience . George , a fictionalized version of painter George Seraut , paints his masterpiece Sunday Afternoon on the Isle of Grand Jatte , an \" ensemble \" painting filled wherein no person is looking at any other person ; meanwhile , he clashes with his grandson , also named George , a contemporary painter . The musical is \" about \" a lot of things , including representation versus abstraction in the arts , the solitary nature of existence even in crowds , the unglamorous parts of the creative process , and the idea that artists create ( and audiences seek out their creations ) in part to understand life and distract themselves from the inevitability of death ( which is connected , glancingly and with respect for the audience , to a blank canvas : the story ends with the words , \" a blank canvas , his favorite \u2014 so many possibilities \" ) . There 's no reason why such a conceptually oriented work should engage the emotions , yet this one proved devastating . That was Sondheim 's greatest trick . He did it over and over , to greater and lesser degrees , throughout his career . What a magician he was . Upon Sondheim 's death , Imelda Staunton , who performed in several Sondheim productions , including revivals of Follies and Gypsy , said , \" His stories will live as long as Shakespeare 's because he speaks about people , about emotional difficulties , about the need we all have for love or recognition and to be noticed . A lot of musicals are about happy things \u2014 but his musicals are about the difficult things . \u201d The difficult things , and the little things . And the uncertainty . And the not-knowing . And having to live with , and in , the not-knowing . You were never supposed to come out of Sondheim 's musicals feeling comfortable , released from any unpleasant feelings or lingering doubts about what , exactly , you just watched . Sondheim wanted audiences to talk about what he 'd given them , see themselves in it , or not see themselves in it , and argue about it , criticize it , be moved by it , angered , saddened : all that and more . The audience was responsible for \u2014to invoke another Sondheim touchstone \u2014 putting it together . In interviews and tributes during the second half of his life , Stephen Sondheim frankly acknowledged that for such a long - lived musical theater force , he had surprisingly few commercial hits \u2014 and the songs that did become popular did n't have any obvious outward indicators of being hits . He noticed that his hits tended to become hits because performers liked to sing them , and did them well enough that other singers were inspired to cover them , too . If they got performed enough times by enough singers that people had heard of , they got grandfathered into \" hit \" status even if they 'd never previously appeared on any chart . \u201c West Side Story \" was not a hit during its original Broadway run , and its yearning masterpiece \u201c Somewhere \u201d only became a popular song to cover once stars like Dionne Warwick and Barbra Streisand imprinted their style upon it . Ditto \" Send in the Clowns \" from A Little Night Music , \" I 'm Still Here \" from Follies , and many others . The critics and even the fans kept having to catch up with him . Sometimes it took repeat viewings or listenings of a new work to get into Sondheim 's groove . People used to say about Stanley Kubrick that you always had to see his movies twice , the first time to get over whatever expectations you brought into it , and the second time to appreciate what it actually was . The same was true of Sondheim . He was that kind of artist . He wanted you to lean forward and pay attention . He wanted you to think . And while he wanted you to like what he did , making people happy was not his primary goal in life . He was after other satisfactions . Sondheim 's musicals hit a lot of the same sweet spots as the American and international art films that he loved : films like \" Citizen Kane , \" \" The Elephant Man , \" Au Hasard Balthazar , \" \" Out of the Past , \" and the 1966 , Soviet - produced \" War and Peace . \" He transformed Ingmar Bergman 's Shakespeare adaptation \" Smiles of a Summer Night \" into \" A Little Night Music . \" In the years before he died , he and David Ives were working on a musical that would fuse the plots of two Luis Bunuel films , \" The Exterminating Angel \" and \" The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie . \" Playbill reported earlier this year that development of the project had been abandoned , but in his final interview , conducted five days before his death , he made it sound as if he and Ives were back at it again . ( Sondheim provided a partial list of his favorite films to The Sondheim Review in 2005 , around the same time that he curated a film series at the Museum of Modern Art . ) Sondheim loved pure entertainment as well , but only if it was cleverly imagined and assembled . There are no stupid or slovenly films on Sondheim 's list ; even the silly comedies he cites , such as \" This is Spinal Tap , \" are written , directed and performed with ambition and intelligence . Sondheim co- wrote a gem of a murder mystery , 1973 's \" The Last of Sheila , \" with his friend and fellow puzzle - lover Anthony Perkins that showed how thoroughly he understood how to manipulate an audience . He could do that . And he did , in production after production . The fun aspects of a Sondheim musical were what allowed him to take risks everywhere else . He knew entertaining could be a Trojan horse for art . He viewed art as work . Not work as in drudgery : work as in a task , a process , a thing that had to be done . He was never precious about his own work . He regretted ( and occasionally revised ) lines that he 'd written decades earlier ( he seems never to have been entirely satisfied with his efforts on his first major production , 1955 's \" West Side Story \" ) . And even when the lyrics were acrobatically graceful , showy in the way that a gymnast could be , he rarely used words that you had to look up . Most of the sentences were short . Most of the words were simple . And there was always an idea in there that you could actually see or feel or otherwise grab onto . He was n't big on abstractions in lyrics , or bromides , or general sentiments . He liked for things to be concrete , their expression direct . In an interview with National Public Radio to promote his classic two - volume book about the creative process , \" Finishing the Hat , \" Sondheim pulled two examples from Hammerstein to illustrate the values that he prized in lyric writing . First , he quoted \" All the Things You Are , \" written for Very Warm for May , as an example of a \" lyrical cardinal sin : \" You are the promised kiss of springtime That makes the lonely winter seem long You are the breathless hush of evening That trembles on the brink of a lovely song . \" Those are all very pretty words , but what do they mean ? \" Sondheim told NPR . \" Take a look at those images . I do n't know what they mean . I also do n't know how they apply personally to anybody . I just think they are poesy \" -- in the sense of forced , sentimentalized poetic writing -- \" and not poetry .

More than the melodies , more than the arrangements , more than the choice of subject matter , more than his puzzle - maker 's sense of structure , it was his commitment to truth that made the work great . Any time you sat down to watch one of his musicals or listen to one of his songs , you entered into a pact with Sondheim : he was going to tell you the truth , the hard truth , about life as he saw it , compassionately but without sugarcoating anything . You , the audience member , were going to accept that the truth was messy , and that Sondheim was n't here to lie about that . He was n't going to give you the sorts of easy reassurances and neat resolutions that the marketplace tends to demand of entertainers and artists . You were going to think and feel , and what you thought about and felt might not necessarily fill you with affection and hope for humanity . That was inspiring , because it was brave . Like so many creative people , I thought of Sondheim as a guiding light . I knew I was never going to reach the heights that he did as an artist or poet and scholar of human experience , because Sondheim was the American Shakespeare . But thanks to Sondheim , I had an example of what to aim for . Along with a handful of other theater luminaries \u2014 including his mentor , lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II ( \" Oklahoma ! \" \" Carousel \" ) \u2014 Sondheim produced work that was as close to uncompromised as it was possible for an American to get . The appeal of Sondheim is his pursuit of The Truth , caps on both words . Not truth as \" telling my truth , \" but The Truth : an account of existence that speaks to everyone , whatever the specifics of their lives . You ca n't capture The Truth unless you forget about trying to create a hit or a critic 's darling or a snapshot of the zeitgeist , and instead take a hard look at the basics : love , fairness , psychology ; coincidence , fate ; the intertwined drives to create and destroy . These are matters that we can all agree are hard to talk about , and that do n't yield answers \u2014 at least not the kind that we may long to hear , like , \" True love conquers all \" and \" The arc of the universe bends towards justice . \" Sondheim was n't a pessimist or a knee - jerk contrarian , so he did n't answer those questions and others like them with a flat , \" No \u2014 it does n't . \" He liked to put a \" maybe \" in front of those types of assertions , and tack an \" except when it does n't \" onto the end , then build that out into something more complicated than you expected to find in a musical . He was adamant that unresolved contradictions were an immutable part of life , they were inherently fascinating , and they could be funny when framed just so . And because each person is a unique bundle of contradictions and often uncontainable drives , Sondheim 's songs never lacked for richness and beauty . The best observed the interior life of individuals as astutely and unmercifully as Shakespeare 's plays , which the scholar Harold Bloom posited as the forerunner of Sigmund Freud 's writings on psychology . Look at the songs from just one Sondheim classic , 1970 's Company , about the complexities of sex , love , and commitment . In the HBO documentary \" Six by Sondheim , \" Sondheim recalls being mystified by a rave review praising the musical as an attack on marriage when in fact it was simply , and above all else , \" about marriage . \" It 's a sardonic affirmation of how impossible and unresolvable and fraught with pitfalls and downsides even a great marriage can be . This is all crystallized in \" The Little Things You Do Together , \" which feels at once celebratory and rueful . It 's the little things you share together Swear together Wear together That make perfect relationships The concerts you enjoy together Neighbors you annoy together Children you destroy together That keep marriage intact . And then : [ It 's ] the little ways you try together Cry together Lie together That make perfect relationships Becoming a cliche together Growing old and gray together Withering away together That make marriage a joy ! That the words \" a joy \" are typically sung in a \" joyful \" way adds to the song 's delightful sense of unresolved tension and contradiction . Same with \" And Jesus Christ is it fun ! \" , a line that the hard - edged Joanne ( as played by the original cast 's Elaine Stritch ) delivers in a voice that 's a laugh and a sneer . In that the same musical 's \" Being Alive , \" the commitment - phobic Bobby gets close to an epiphany while he sings ( in a deliberately distancing , second - person voice ) of wanting : Someone to hold you too close Someone to hurt you too deep Someone to sit in your chair And ruin your sleep Someone to need you too much Someone to know you too well Someone to pull you up short To put you through hell Sondheim 's lyrics are filled with these sorts of constructions , juxtaposing feelings and ideas and whatever their opposites might be , and allowing them to coexist in the moment , seemingly on equal footing . They ask questions without supplying answers . They describe predicaments that are exciting and boring , ecstatic and misery - inducing , seemingly easy to grasp and yet , upon closer inspection , inscrutable . Neither condition cancels the other . That 's what makes Sondheim Sondheim . Consider \" Move On , \" from Sunday in the Park with George : I chose and my world was shaken So what ? The choice may have been mistaken , The choosing was not . It 's defiant . It 's regretful . It 's bewildered . It 's introspective . It 's several more things , all at the same time . It 's four lines . In Into the Woods , the Baker 's Wife sings a verse that reads like an affirmation that all experience , even the most awful kind , is preferable to never truly feeling your own existence as it unfolds : Oh , if life were made of moments , Even now and then a bad one \u2014 ! But if life were only moments , Then you 'd never know you had one Sondheim 's mastery of language \u2014 not just of the meanings of words , but of the emotional effects that occur when they 're put together in a line , and the line 's meter , its sound \u2014 might seem as if it were meant to get the artist and the audience closer to answers . Instead , they ( deliberately ) got the listeners lost in a mirror - hall of meaning that denied or deferred a lot of the simpler pleasures . Only the sheer beauty of the vocal and instrumental arrangements and Sondheim 's gift for a pleasing melody prevented the lyrics from becoming too demanding for some audiences to bear . The tension between the music and the lyrics could power a whole book , or podcast , by itself . It 's not unlike the feeling of watching \" A Clockwork Orange \" ( a film Sondheim admired for lots of reasons ) and being disturbed by how the ugliness of the content and the verve of the filmmaking seemed to work at cross- purposes , on purpose . Exhibits A and B within Sondheim 's body of work are probably Assassins , which consists of musical character portraits of various American assassins and would - be assassins , and that is almost maddeningly irresistible , given the subject ; and Sweeney Todd , a quasi-operetta that takes the exploits of a vengeful murderer and the pie-maker who turns his victims into food and churns them into an epic of thwarted desire and fury , packed with eccentric , often hilarious supporting characters worthy of a Charles Dickens novel , and songs that are as beautiful as Todd 's actions are ghastly . The resolutions that Sondheim 's music gave you were primarily musical and / or mathematical . His work did n't give you the kind of resolution that let allowed you to leave the theater smiling and humming your favorite tunes , eager to have a nightcap and perhaps a dessert and then go home to sleep . He wrote songs that you had to struggle with and puzzle over , and that pulled your intellect and feelings in disparate directions . Sondheim 's greatest musicals all began with the unstated proposition , \" We 're adults here , so let 's not lie to each other about what life is . \" They also expected you to engage with the work on its terms , not yours . His greatest collaboration with director James Lapine , Sunday in the Park with George , is the work that won him a Pulitzer for drama , arguably his masterpiece , and perhaps his most difficult and demanding , thanks to its conceptual boldness and lack of obvious emotional anchor points for the audience . George , a fictionalized version of painter George Seraut , paints his masterpiece Sunday Afternoon on the Isle of Grand Jatte , an \" ensemble \" painting filled wherein no person is looking at any other person ; meanwhile , he clashes with his grandson , also named George , a contemporary painter . The musical is \" about \" a lot of things , including representation versus abstraction in the arts , the solitary nature of existence even in crowds , the unglamorous parts of the creative process , and the idea that artists create ( and audiences seek out their creations ) in part to understand life and distract themselves from the inevitability of death ( which is connected , glancingly and with respect for the audience , to a blank canvas : the story ends with the words , \" a blank canvas , his favorite \u2014 so many possibilities \" ) . There 's no reason why such a conceptually oriented work should engage the emotions , yet this one proved devastating . That was Sondheim 's greatest trick . He did it over and over , to greater and lesser degrees , throughout his career . What a magician he was . Upon Sondheim 's death , Imelda Staunton , who performed in several Sondheim productions , including revivals of Follies and Gypsy , said , \" His stories will live as long as Shakespeare 's because he speaks about people , about emotional difficulties , about the need we all have for love or recognition and to be noticed . A lot of musicals are about happy things \u2014 but his musicals are about the difficult things . \u201d The difficult things , and the little things . And the uncertainty . And the not-knowing . And having to live with , and in , the not-knowing . You were never supposed to come out of Sondheim 's musicals feeling comfortable , released from any unpleasant feelings or lingering doubts about what , exactly , you just watched . Sondheim wanted audiences to talk about what he 'd given them , see themselves in it , or not see themselves in it , and argue about it , criticize it , be moved by it , angered , saddened : all that and more . The audience was responsible for \u2014to invoke another Sondheim touchstone \u2014 putting it together . In interviews and tributes during the second half of his life , Stephen Sondheim frankly acknowledged that for such a long - lived musical theater force , he had surprisingly few commercial hits \u2014 and the songs that did become popular did n't have any obvious outward indicators of being hits . He noticed that his hits tended to become hits because performers liked to sing them , and did them well enough that other singers were inspired to cover them , too . If they got performed enough times by enough singers that people had heard of , they got grandfathered into \" hit \" status even if they 'd never previously appeared on any chart . \u201c West Side Story \" was not a hit during its original Broadway run , and its yearning masterpiece \u201c Somewhere \u201d only became a popular song to cover once stars like Dionne Warwick and Barbra Streisand imprinted their style upon it . Ditto \" Send in the Clowns \" from A Little Night Music , \" I 'm Still Here \" from Follies , and many others . The critics and even the fans kept having to catch up with him . Sometimes it took repeat viewings or listenings of a new work to get into Sondheim 's groove . People used to say about Stanley Kubrick that you always had to see his movies twice , the first time to get over whatever expectations you brought into it , and the second time to appreciate what it actually was . The same was true of Sondheim . He was that kind of artist . He wanted you to lean forward and pay attention . He wanted you to think . And while he wanted you to like what he did , making people happy was not his primary goal in life . He was after other satisfactions . Sondheim 's musicals hit a lot of the same sweet spots as the American and international art films that he loved : films like \" Citizen Kane , \" \" The Elephant Man , \" Au Hasard Balthazar , \" \" Out of the Past , \" and the 1966 , Soviet - produced \" War and Peace . \" He transformed Ingmar Bergman 's Shakespeare adaptation \" Smiles of a Summer Night \" into \" A Little Night Music . \" In the years before he died , he and David Ives were working on a musical that would fuse the plots of two Luis Bunuel films , \" The Exterminating Angel \" and \" The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie . \" Playbill reported earlier this year that development of the project had been abandoned , but in his final interview , conducted five days before his death , he made it sound as if he and Ives were back at it again . ( Sondheim provided a partial list of his favorite films to The Sondheim Review in 2005 , around the same time that he curated a film series at the Museum of Modern Art . ) Sondheim loved pure entertainment as well , but only if it was cleverly imagined and assembled . There are no stupid or slovenly films on Sondheim 's list ; even the silly comedies he cites , such as \" This is Spinal Tap , \" are written , directed and performed with ambition and intelligence . Sondheim co- wrote a gem of a murder mystery , 1973 's \" The Last of Sheila , \" with his friend and fellow puzzle - lover Anthony Perkins that showed how thoroughly he understood how to manipulate an audience . He could do that . And he did , in production after production . The fun aspects of a Sondheim musical were what allowed him to take risks everywhere else . He knew entertaining could be a Trojan horse for art . He viewed art as work . Not work as in drudgery : work as in a task , a process , a thing that had to be done . He was never precious about his own work . He regretted ( and occasionally revised ) lines that he 'd written decades earlier ( he seems never to have been entirely satisfied with his efforts on his first major production , 1955 's \" West Side Story \" ) . And even when the lyrics were acrobatically graceful , showy in the way that a gymnast could be , he rarely used words that you had to look up . Most of the sentences were short . Most of the words were simple . And there was always an idea in there that you could actually see or feel or otherwise grab onto . He was n't big on abstractions in lyrics , or bromides , or general sentiments . He liked for things to be concrete , their expression direct . In an interview with National Public Radio to promote his classic two - volume book about the creative process , \" Finishing the Hat , \" Sondheim pulled two examples from Hammerstein to illustrate the values that he prized in lyric writing . First , he quoted \" All the Things You Are , \" written for Very Warm for May , as an example of a \" lyrical cardinal sin : \" You are the promised kiss of springtime That makes the lonely winter seem long You are the breathless hush of evening That trembles on the brink of a lovely song . \" Those are all very pretty words , but what do they mean ? \" Sondheim told NPR . \" Take a look at those images . I do n't know what they mean . I also do n't know how they apply personally to anybody . I just think they are poesy \" -- in the sense of forced , sentimentalized poetic writing -- \" and not poetry . Oscar did a lot of poetic writing , which I would call poesy , using images that are not germane to what 's going on . I think that 's just a writer trying to be poetic . \" But Hammerstein , said Sondheim , could also be genuinely poetic . Take , for example , the opening lines to Oklahoma 's \" Oh , What A Beautiful Mornin ' \" : Oh , what a beautiful mornin ' , Oh , what a beautiful day . I got a beautiful feelin' Ev'rythin 's goin ' my way ! Sondheim says that though that lyrics do n't sound exciting on paper , they soar when set to Richard Rodgers ' score . \" This is a lyric that does n't look interesting , but it 's thrilling , \" he says . \" It 's made for music . \" \" Finishing the Hat , \" the phrase as well as the song itself , feels in some ways like a summing - up of Sondheim 's sensibility .

A former columnist for the San Diego Union - Tribune and author of seven books , Louv gained wide attention through his acclaimed book , Last Child in the Woods . The book reveals a direct connection between the absence of nature in the lives of today 's wired youth and its negative health and societal impacts , a phenomenon Louv terms \" Nature - Deficit Disorder . \" Louv lists the human costs of alienation from nature as including attention disorders , depression and obesity . He reveals that environmental education and direct experiences in nature have dramatic positive effects on the physical and emotional health of children , significantly improving test scores and grade point averages , and boosting skills in problem solving , critical thinking and decision making . He also shows that contact with nature can be a powerful therapy to reduce the symptoms of ADHD , negative stresses and depression . It is also well known to be an important inspiration for environmental stewardship . Last Child in the Woods struck a chord with parents , educators and consumers alike . Louv has used this visibility to spark the development of a nationwide movement of regional grassroots campaigns in more than 40 regions .

Similar centers in New York , Los Angeles , and Seattle and other communities coast to coast offer a proven remedy for Nature - Deficit Disorder . \" It is gratifying to receive this honor from an organization like Audubon that has made such a major commitment to connecting future generations to the natural world , \" said Louv . \" I 'm deeply moved by the presentation of the Audubon Medal especially for what it says about the emerging movement and the work that has been done for decades -- long before my book came along -- by countless volunteers , professionals , and organizations , including Audubon itself . \" Established in 1947 , the Audubon Medal has been bestowed on a wide array of influential environmentalists in recognition of outstanding achievement in the field of conservation and environmental protection . This distinguished environmental honor recognizes either a single , extraordinary feat or a record of significant contributions .

Alexander Christie , said to be from Glasgow , joined the Hudson 's Bay Company in 1809 and was sent to Moose Factory to investigate the possibilities of the lumber trade . He returned to Britain in 1810 but was back in Moose Factory the following year to establish a sawmill . In 1817 he was in charge of the company 's Eastmain business and made his headquarters at Rupert 's House . One of his major duties at the time was the supervision of the company 's whale fishery business . At the time of the union of the HBC with the North West Company in 1821 , he was listed in the Deed Poll as a chief factor . Christie was on furlough in 1824 , and in charge of Moose Factory from 1826 until 1830 when he was transferred to York Factory . Three years later he was placed in charge of Red River and appointed governor of Assiniboia . On 10 Feb. 1835 , at Red River , Christie 's marriage with Anne Thomas , daughter of Thomas Thomas * Sr , was confirmed by the Church of England . Like many company employees , Christie had married according to \u201c the custom of the country \u201d since in remote areas of the HBC 's territory clergymen were seldom present to perform the ceremony . Formal marriage ceremonies and baptism of children took place when a missionary visited the area or when the couple reached a settlement where a church had been established . Two of Christie 's sons , Alexander and William Joseph , and a grandson , Alexander , entered the company 's service . While he was in charge at Red River , Alexander Christie supervised the building of Lower Fort Garry , which had been begun about 1831 some 20 miles north of present - day Winnipeg ; he also began construction of Upper Fort Garry on the site of an earlier company post of the same name at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers . Between 1839 and 1844 he was in England on furlough and at Moose Factory . During his second term as governor of Assiniboia \u2013 from 1844 until his retirement in 1848 \u2013 Christie was forced to take strong measures against free traders in the Red River Settlement who challenged the HBC 's legal right to a fur trade monopoly . Individual traders and small merchants , led by Andrew McDermot * and James Sinclair * , sought an unrestricted trade with American settlements to the south . The problem became particularly acute after 1843 when Norman Wolfred Kittson * , an agent for Henry H. Sibley of St Paul , established an American trading post at Pembina just across the international boundary . Christie attempted to limit such trading by threatening to inspect the mails and seize goods imported by merchants and traders engaging in illicit trade . He issued a proclamation on 7 Dec. 1844 stating that the company 's ships would not receive , at any port , goods addressed to anyone unless that person lodged at the company 's office at Upper Fort Garry ( Winnipeg ) a declaration to the effect that he had neither directly nor indirectly trafficked in furs . On 20 December he ordered that all letters be sent to Fort Garry for inspection . Christie , however , had no adequate force to support his authority , and his efforts were unsuccessful . It was his opinion that only a military force could maintain law and order in the settlement . As a result of HBC requests to the imperial government ( and the possibility of war with the United States over Oregon ) , a force of approximately 350 men of the 6th Royal Regiment of Foot was sent to Red River in 1846 under Colonel John Folliot Crofton * . These troops were replaced two years later by 56 army pensioners under Major William Bletterman Caldwell * . The latter group proved ineffective , and illegal trading continued . Following the trial of Pierre -Guillaume Sayer in 1849 on a charge of illicit trade , the company abandoned all legal means of enforcing its monopoly [ see George - Antoine Bellecourt ] .

The wonderful support of the National Lottery Heritage Fund has now made this project possible . We very much look forward to developing the scheme with SDPT and Hugh Broughton Architects . \u201d Our Funders The National Lottery funding has been matched with nearly \u00a3 3 m of grants from some of the UK 's leading philanthropic trusts , foundations and individuals including : \u00b7 The Julia and Hans Rausing Trust \u00b7 Lund Trust , a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin \u00b7 Colyer Fergusson Charitable Trust \u00b7 Garfield Weston Foundation \u00b7 The Sackler Trust \u00b7 Foyle Foundation \u00b7 Wolfson Foundation \u00b7 Henry Oldfield Trust \u00b7 The Swire Charitable Trust \u00b7 Pilgrim Trust \u00b7 Architectural Heritage Fund \u00b7 Kent Community Foundation \u00b7 Roger de Haan Charitable Trust \u00b7 Rothschild Foundation \u00b7 Peter Stormonth Darling Charitable Trust Jeremy Noles , Grants Officer for Allchurches Trust , who gave a \u00a3 102,000 grant , said : \u201c This unique project will bring this historic dockyard church back from the brink and breathe new life into the local economy , giving young people in Sheerness new opportunities to build a bright future for themselves and their town . We 're delighted to have been able to support its restoration . \u201d Matthew Mckeage , Chief Executive of the Architectural Heritage Fund , said : \u201c Without the courageous efforts of SDPT , the future of this wonderful historic building \u2013 one of great importance to the town of Sheerness - would remain bleak . The impressive backing secured by the Trust for their innovative plans demonstrates the real difference that a community - led charitable organisation can have in turning round the fortunes of buildings that matter to people , locally and nationally . The Architectural Heritage Fund is delighted to be supporting the Trust . \u201d The AHF provided three grants totalling \u00a3 50,000 to help the Trust when it first started out through to developing the project proposals , helping them to secure the major funding now in place .","annotations":[{"text":"Sheerness Dockyard Church","span":[119,143],"token_span":[20,22],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The concrete or abstract thing that is brought into an earlier state in which it was more effective and powerful."},{"text":"Hugh Broughton Architects","span":[4623,4647],"token_span":[815,817],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent puts the Entity into a state of renewed vigor."},{"text":"Martin Ashley Architects","span":[4533,4556],"token_span":[799,801],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent puts the Entity into a state of renewed vigor."},{"text":"early 2020","span":[4811,4820],"token_span":[846,847],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the Agent causes the renewal of the Entity."},{"text":"Sheerness , on the Isle of Sheppey , Kent","span":[483,523],"token_span":[79,87],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the place where the Agent brings about the change in the Entity's state."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-0025-854-frame-Rejuvenation","frame":"Rejuvenation","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"The action of an Agent or the occurrence of a Cause event returns an Entity to an earlier state of vigor and strength.","frame_ancestors":["Transitive_action","Objective_influence","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Conservation efforts After retirement from the bank , Vanderpoel devoted much of his time to land conservation and prairie restoration .","annotations":[{"text":"Vanderpoel","span":[54,63],"token_span":[8,8],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent puts the Entity into a state of renewed vigor."},{"text":"prairie","span":[115,121],"token_span":[18,18],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The concrete or abstract thing that is brought into an earlier state in which it was more effective and powerful."}],"trigger":{"text":"restoration","start_char":123,"end_char":133,"start_token":19,"end_token":19,"frame":"Rejuvenation"}},"source":{"text":"Nature , Commerce Achieve Balance At New Sears Park HOFFMAN ESTATES , Ill . - Nearly two decades after it topped Chicago 's skyline with the world 's tallest building , Sears , Roebuck and Co. aims to make a similar impact on suburban office park design .

The Croswell unveiled a $ 6.2 million capital campaign Friday evening , during its \u201c Great Big Night \u201d fundraiser , with a presentation showing patrons the scope of the work to be done . \u201c Tonight we 're going to share with you some exciting plans , \u201d said Croswell Board President Emory Schmidt . \u201c The reason it 's so exciting is that these are the plans that will put the Croswell on a strong footing for the next 150 years . \u201d Schmidt noted that 50 years ago , after the Croswell had ended its tenure as a movie theater , \u201c there were people who wanted to tear this building down . It was old , it was falling apart , and people just were n't going to movies like they used to . \u2026 This building , this incredible treasure , could have been a parking lot . \u201d The campaign announced Friday got its impetus two years ago when George and Julia Argyros contributed $ 1 million to the Croswell that \u201c gave us the opportunity to breathe a little and step away from our annual needs , and really start thinking about how to put the Croswell on a solid footing for the next 150 years , \u201d Schmidt said . The project 's goals fall into three main categories : infrastructure , patron comfort , and new facilities to give the Croswell additional programming flexibility and improve its sustainability . Additionally , the theater will build its endowment to help stabilize its financial future . Most visibly , patrons will find more restrooms , improved accessibility to bring the entryway and box office up to Americans with Disability Act standards , improved lighting and acoustics in the auditorium , and two major new features : a larger multipurpose Heritage Room and a new performance space in what is now the rehearsal room . Where the Heritage Room is concerned , the existing room will be expanded out to the Maumee Street storefront , making it possible for patrons to look out onto the street \u2014 and for passers - by to be able to look in and see what 's going on inside \u2014 and allowing the room to be used as a small entertainment venue and lounge . The room will be open many nights other than when there are shows in the auditorium . \u201c I fully anticipate that people will come to the Heritage Room on nights even if nothing else is happening downtown , to maybe hear someone play piano , \u201d said Croswell Artistic Director Jere Righter in an interview about the campaign . As for the other new feature , a performance space at what 's now the rehearsal room , an even more major change to the building is involved . Right now , the Croswell 's rehearsal room is small and accessible only from a back stairwell behind the Heritage Room . In the renovation , the room will be enlarged and accessible from the auditorium 's mezzanine level , which will be able to be reached via a newly installed elevator . In addition to being a rehearsal area , the room will be used as a \u201c black box \u201d theater , although it wo n't literally be a black - box space . \u201c With a ' black box ' we can do a wide range of shows \u201d in an intimate setting , Righter said . Not only will it be more ideal for smaller shows than using the main auditorium , but it gives the Croswell much -needed flexibility . \u201c Right now , when a show is onstage , nothing else can go there , \u201d Righter said . For example , this season the show \u201c Love , Loss and What I Wore , \u201d counting rehearsals and performances , \u201c tied up our stage for four weeks , \u201d said Righter , and would have been ideally suited for the new venue . From a production standpoint , the show itself would have been right at home in that room , and since shows like it draw smaller audiences , the space would have felt more \u201c right - sized \u201d than the 651 - seat auditorium . Also part of the construction plans \u2014 addressing a need often mentioned by patrons \u2014 are new restroom facilities both on the main floor and , now , upstairs as well . \u201c We 're more than doubling the number of restrooms and putting them on the mezzanine level too , \u201d Righter said . \u201c It 's time . \u201d A number of other improvements planned as part of the campaign wo n't be visible to patrons , but are crucial to the Croswell 's \u201c health \u201d as a building . For one thing , the aging electrical and HVAC systems will be updated and sprinklers installed . For another thing , the floor in the \u201c catacombs \u201d will be cemented so that costumes can be stored there in a dry , safe place . The electrical work especially \u201c is so desperately needed that the longer we wait , the more pressure we put on an infrastructure that 's quite outdated , \u201d Righter said . And , she said , as much as she 's \u201c thrilled and excited \u201d about all the visible facilities that are about to be built thanks to the campaign , the extensive electrical work \u2014 which alone will account for more than $ 1 million of the project 's total cost \u2014 is the most critically necessary . \u201c Is it sexy ? No . But is it essential for the longevity of the building ? Yes , \u201d Righter said . Krieghoff - Lenawee is the general contractor for the project . Quinn Evans Architects of Ann Arbor is the architect . Jennifer Henriksen of Quinn Evans , the project manager , said the fact that the Croswell is in such tight surroundings posed a challenge in thinking about how to expand . \u201c They do need more space for the bathrooms and the rehearsal room , but there 's not room to expand outward , \u201d she said . \u201c So we had to be really creative . \u201d Another issue is that \u201c the spaces are isolated now . So we needed to find a way to tie all those spaces together in a way that makes it all work the way it should . \u201d And the design work needed to retain the general character of the building , which is actually three separate buildings plus a lobby that at one time was an open-air walkway back to the actual theater . \u201c Our approach was really about the street fa\u00e7ade , \u201d she said . \u201c How do we respect that character of the three separate buildings while tying it all together ? And we wanted to retain that lobby , which is n't something you 'd find ( in theaters ) today . \u201d Quinn Evans ' work began with a trip to the Croswell by the design team to see a show there , and Henricksen said they came away impressed . \u201c We could see the quality ( of production ) they can do . It 's amazing what they can do with the space they have , \u201d she said . \u201c And it let us see what 's really needed . \u201d Righter said the plan is to \u201c really push very hard \u201d to raise two -thirds to three - quarters of the needed funds by fall , when the construction is slated to begin . Shows will take place in other venues , such as the Madison Schools ' Performing Arts Center where \u201c Handel 's Messiah Rocks \u201d will be staged late this year , during the work . The Croswell would reopen in the summer of 2016 . To date , $ 2.2 million has been raised toward the goal . Major pledges have been made by businesses and family foundations including the Steve and Sally Hickman Foundation , Doug and Mary Kapnick , the Employees of Brazeway Inc. , Frank and Shirley Dick , the Weatherwax Foundation , and the Maurice and Dorothy Stubnitz Foundation . But , Righter said , in addition to the major gifts needed from donors like these , she hopes the community at large will want to get involved . \u201c Do we need our large lead gifts ? Of course , and we 're grateful to these people who have the means , \u201d she said . \u201c But the Croswell belongs to this community , and that 's how the money is going to get raised \u2014 from the people who have been our patrons . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"Croswell Opera House","span":[96,115],"token_span":[16,18],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The concrete or abstract thing that is brought into an earlier state in which it was more effective and powerful."},{"text":"Croswell Opera House","span":[96,115],"token_span":[16,18],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the place where the Agent brings about the change in the Entity's state."},{"text":"The Croswell","span":[312,323],"token_span":[55,56],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent puts the Entity into a state of renewed vigor."},{"text":"a $ 6.2 million capital campaign","span":[334,365],"token_span":[58,63],"role":"Cause","label":"Cause","role_definition":"An event or state whose occurrence brings about the Entity's return to a vigorous state."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"A capital campaign to renovate the theater was announced in May 2015 , with changes to include new public spaces , more restrooms , Americans with Disabilities Act improvements , and electrical and other infrastructure upgrades .","annotations":[{"text":"the theater","span":[31,41],"token_span":[5,6],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The concrete or abstract thing that is brought into an earlier state in which it was more effective and powerful."},{"text":"A capital campaign","span":[0,17],"token_span":[0,2],"role":"Cause","label":"Cause","role_definition":"An event or state whose occurrence brings about the Entity's return to a vigorous state."},{"text":"May 2015","span":[60,67],"token_span":[10,11],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the Agent causes the renewal of the Entity."}],"trigger":{"text":"renovate","start_char":22,"end_char":29,"start_token":4,"end_token":4,"frame":"Rejuvenation"}},"source":{"text":"Croswell Opera House planning renovations , sets $ 6.2 million fundraising goal By the time the Croswell Opera House celebrates its 150th anniversary next year , if all goes according to plan it will be sporting a new look and a host of features designed to stabilize the venerable old building for the future .

And , she said , as much as she 's \u201c thrilled and excited \u201d about all the visible facilities that are about to be built thanks to the campaign , the extensive electrical work \u2014 which alone will account for more than $ 1 million of the project 's total cost \u2014 is the most critically necessary . \u201c Is it sexy ? No . But is it essential for the longevity of the building ? Yes , \u201d Righter said . Krieghoff - Lenawee is the general contractor for the project . Quinn Evans Architects of Ann Arbor is the architect . Jennifer Henriksen of Quinn Evans , the project manager , said the fact that the Croswell is in such tight surroundings posed a challenge in thinking about how to expand . \u201c They do need more space for the bathrooms and the rehearsal room , but there 's not room to expand outward , \u201d she said . \u201c So we had to be really creative . \u201d Another issue is that \u201c the spaces are isolated now . So we needed to find a way to tie all those spaces together in a way that makes it all work the way it should . \u201d And the design work needed to retain the general character of the building , which is actually three separate buildings plus a lobby that at one time was an open-air walkway back to the actual theater . \u201c Our approach was really about the street fa\u00e7ade , \u201d she said . \u201c How do we respect that character of the three separate buildings while tying it all together ? And we wanted to retain that lobby , which is n't something you 'd find ( in theaters ) today . \u201d Quinn Evans ' work began with a trip to the Croswell by the design team to see a show there , and Henricksen said they came away impressed . \u201c We could see the quality ( of production ) they can do . It 's amazing what they can do with the space they have , \u201d she said . \u201c And it let us see what 's really needed . \u201d Righter said the plan is to \u201c really push very hard \u201d to raise two -thirds to three - quarters of the needed funds by fall , when the construction is slated to begin . Shows will take place in other venues , such as the Madison Schools ' Performing Arts Center where \u201c Handel 's Messiah Rocks \u201d will be staged late this year , during the work . The Croswell would reopen in the summer of 2016 . To date , $ 2.2 million has been raised toward the goal . Major pledges have been made by businesses and family foundations including the Steve and Sally Hickman Foundation , Doug and Mary Kapnick , the Employees of Brazeway Inc. , Frank and Shirley Dick , the Weatherwax Foundation , and the Maurice and Dorothy Stubnitz Foundation . But , Righter said , in addition to the major gifts needed from donors like these , she hopes the community at large will want to get involved . \u201c Do we need our large lead gifts ? Of course , and we 're grateful to these people who have the means , \u201d she said . \u201c But the Croswell belongs to this community , and that 's how the money is going to get raised \u2014 from the people who have been our patrons . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"Croswell Opera House","span":[96,115],"token_span":[16,18],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The concrete or abstract thing that is brought into an earlier state in which it was more effective and powerful."},{"text":"a $ 6.2 million capital campaign","span":[334,365],"token_span":[58,63],"role":"Cause","label":"Cause","role_definition":"An event or state whose occurrence brings about the Entity's return to a vigorous state."},{"text":"Friday","span":[367,372],"token_span":[64,64],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the Agent causes the renewal of the Entity."},{"text":"Croswell Opera House","span":[96,115],"token_span":[16,18],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the place where the Agent brings about the change in the Entity's state."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-1099-634-frame-Removing","frame":"Removing","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Agent causes a Theme to move away from a location, the Source.","frame_ancestors":["Transitive_action","Objective_influence","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Varuna , the sea-god , had forbidden nude bathing in rivers , ponds and other public places , but gopis often resorted to it .

On \u201c Northern Downpour \u201d , he peels off a new timbre to his panting swank entirely , serving an emotionally bare , Robert Smith -esque performance that does n't sound like him at all . When he 's not commanding the mic , the quartet takes playful delight in mini-song interludes , shelving their techno for vaudevillian ( \u201c I Have Friends in High Places \u201d ) , pre-album disclaimer ( \u201c We 're So Starving \u201d ) and \u201c Folkin ' Around \u201d , which is what Bob Dylan may have sounded like if we took him back forty - five years and sucked out all his acerbic irony . Pretty . Odd. is fine - tuned to such an extent that free - wheelin ' harmonies feel conversational even though they border on ridiculous . However , all posturing is undertaken in good taste , from the stabbing piano chords on \u201c When the Day Met the Night \u201d , lifted from the Beatles ' \u201c Getting Better \u201d , to Panic at the Disco 's first guitar solo , ever , on \u201c Pas de Cheval \u201d . On the other side of the fence , Urie and Ross share a notable fondness for quaint baroque arrangements ; pizzicato guitar adorns \u201c Behind the Sea \u201d , while a ludicrously stiff chamber pop dynamic coats \u201c She Had the World \u201d , featuring a harpsichord ! \u201c The piano knows something I do n't know \u201d , Urie bemoans in a sudden moment of paranoia on the track of the same name . He may well be right : in a sophomore set to this lofty scale , who is really directing whom ? If this is Panic at the Disco 's bid to win oldies fans and bridge the age divide \u2014 leaving behind the teenage girls , seeking former student protestors and hippies \u2014 it may be ridden with cheese . The fact remains , even if this batch of songs is a little clumsy and without nuance at times , most are memorable and enjoyable .

When he 's not commanding the mic , the quartet takes playful delight in mini-song interludes , shelving their techno for vaudevillian ( \u201c I Have Friends in High Places \u201d ) , pre-album disclaimer ( \u201c We 're So Starving \u201d ) and \u201c Folkin ' Around \u201d , which is what Bob Dylan may have sounded like if we took him back forty - five years and sucked out all his acerbic irony . Pretty . Odd. is fine - tuned to such an extent that free - wheelin ' harmonies feel conversational even though they border on ridiculous . However , all posturing is undertaken in good taste , from the stabbing piano chords on \u201c When the Day Met the Night \u201d , lifted from the Beatles ' \u201c Getting Better \u201d , to Panic at the Disco 's first guitar solo , ever , on \u201c Pas de Cheval \u201d . On the other side of the fence , Urie and Ross share a notable fondness for quaint baroque arrangements ; pizzicato guitar adorns \u201c Behind the Sea \u201d , while a ludicrously stiff chamber pop dynamic coats \u201c She Had the World \u201d , featuring a harpsichord ! \u201c The piano knows something I do n't know \u201d , Urie bemoans in a sudden moment of paranoia on the track of the same name . He may well be right : in a sophomore set to this lofty scale , who is really directing whom ? If this is Panic at the Disco 's bid to win oldies fans and bridge the age divide \u2014 leaving behind the teenage girls , seeking former student protestors and hippies \u2014 it may be ridden with cheese . The fact remains , even if this batch of songs is a little clumsy and without nuance at times , most are memorable and enjoyable . Let 's compare again : the scope-expanding vision that characterizes Pretty . Odd. with , for example , \u201c Maybe I 'm the one , Who is the schizophrenic psycho ! \u201d ' ( Puddle of Mudd , \u201c Psycho \u201d ) . The outlook is laughably one-sided . That leaves only one question left to be asked of Panic at the Disco . Now they 've successfully pulled of their Beatles pastiche , where the hell do they go now ?","annotations":[{"text":"Brendon Urie","span":[280,291],"token_span":[57,58],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent is the person (or other force) that causes the Theme to move."},{"text":"a new timbre","span":[4619,4630],"token_span":[914,916],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"Theme is the object that changes location."},{"text":"his panting swank","span":[4635,4651],"token_span":[918,920],"role":"Source","label":"Source","role_definition":"The Source is the initial location of the Theme, before it changes location."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-0823-4-frame-Removing","frame":"Removing","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Agent causes a Theme to move away from a location, the Source.","frame_ancestors":["Transitive_action","Objective_influence","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Home media In the United Kingdom , the film was released direct - to - video by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment .

As testament to the staying power of its cultural jounce , Swept Away was remade in 2003 as a vehicle for pop star Madonna . The main character is a manically self - involved blonde named Raffaella . She resembles conservative commentator Ann Coulter , only she 's Italian -- a self - described \" ruthless profiteer \" who spends most of her yachting vacation hectoring her companions about the failures of communism .

Ravishment and slaps soon lead to a blissed - out Raffaella contently washing Gennarino 's underpants and bedecking her master 's nether regions with pretty flowers as he slumbers . But Gennarino becomes slowly , inexorably vulnerable to her -- a dynamic that plays out operatically after their rescue and the pair reassume their places in the capitalist hierarchy .
