The main local landowner and source of political and economic power in the Middle Ages , St. Albans Abbey , knew how essential milling was to daily life . The punishments they imposed for private milling forced people to pay to use the Abbey 's watermills , helping to incite the 1381 Peasants ' Revolt locally . Only a few of the Ver 's older mill buildings remain today , the remainder lost to fire , re-building , decay and demolition . Precise sites , names , uses and building dates are often uncertain . Mill buildings that survive are now used mainly as private dwellings , small businesses or restaurants . Clean Power It 's worth reflecting that over a distance of less than 10 miles of its 15 mile length , the Ver 's waters powered around a dozen mills , providing renewable energy with no cross-generational nuclear risk and negligible carbon footprint \u2013 clean power ! This density of water - milling was not uncommon in Hertfordshire and beyond \u2013 the Colne , into which the Ver flows , served nearly thirty watermills . Unreliable Flow All this power may seem at odds with the trickle often seen in the Ver today , but remember the flow was greater prior to the substantial depletion of the chalk aquifers , which feed the Ver , to provide us with water . Also , we need to remember the ingenuity with which water was diverted into leats ( mill stream channels ) and mill ponds to provide powerful heads of water to drive mill wheels . Even so , the flow was not always reliable \u2013 in the 13th century the Abbot of St. Albans built a mill to be driven by horses because of the Ver 's capacity to dry up in summer . The water supply was not predictable enough for milling to be sustained north of Redbourn . There are no known watermill sites before the Ver is joined by the Red River ( the stream which gives Redbourn its name ) , behind the Chequers pub on Watling Street just south of the village . There was a silk mill in Redbourn village , but this was a 18th century steam-driven mill . The Domesday book refers to two mills in Redbourn , and whilst it is possible that there may have been mills within the present village , the two referred to are generally thought to refer to the known watermill sites south of the village : Do-Little and Redbournbury Mills . Do- Little Mill The photographs show the handsome mill house on Watling Street ( today 's A5183 ) and its adjacent barn . These private residences mark the site of Do-Little Mill . Over the centuries it had been re-built and known variously as the Bettespool Mill , Malt Mill , Water Corn Mill , Redbourn Little Mill and finally Do-Little Mill . The mill race was powered by a large mill pond rather than a millstream , reflecting the unreliable flow of the water here . It was converted to paper milling in 1753 , burnt down in 1783 , rebuilt as a corn mill and closed in 1927 . Today 's buildings and the former millpond lie on the west side of Watling Street , but the mill was on the east side . It was the widening of Watling Street in 1950 which caused the mill to be demolished . According to the mediaeval chronicler Thomas Walsingham , in 1344 a 5 year old girl 's recovery from falling into the mill race and being thrown out by the wheel was due to her mother 's prayer to St. Alban . Redbournbury Mill This beautifully located working mill is well worth a visit \u2013 normally open and working on Sunday afternoons . Bread and flour can be bought there some mornings . Why not buy your bread here if your morning commute takes you along the A5183 between Redbourn and St. Albans ? See Redbournbury Mill . Milling at Redbournbury goes back to at least Saxon times . Variously owned by the Abbey , the crown and Gorhambury Estates , it was much re-built in 1790 and restored after a fire in 1987 \u2013 seven centuries after the mediaeval mill here had also burned down ! Using sluice gates , a \u201c leat \u201d was built to divert water from the river and build up a head to pour over the mill wheel . The water filled buckets in the wheel , the weight keeping it turning . Water power was first supplemented by the end of 19th century by a steam or gas engine . The last tenant in the 1950s was Ivy Hawkins , \u201c the last lady miller in England \u201d , whose family had run the mill since the 19th century . The mill was re-built after the 1987 fire . A 1930s diesel engine was obtained and restored to provide power to turn the stones to grind the local wheat into the flour to make today 's bread . Shafford Mill This handsome building dates mainly from the 1840s . It features a long , and still flowing , mill stream above the meadows to the east of Watling Street between St. Albans and Redbourn . The now private house and garden are on the ' island ' between the millstream and the river channel . In 1669 , the miller here also farmed wheat and barley , ran a flour shop and leased Redbournbury mill ! Shafford , Do-Little and Redbournbury mills were then owned by the Speaker of the Restoration Parliament , Gorhambury - based Sir Harbottle Grimston . Pre ( or Prae ) Mill Pre Mill , just north of the Pr\u00e9 Hotel , was most recently a saw mil , now derelict \u2013 the photograph is from the 1980s . But milling here also goes back to the Middle Ages . The name probably comes from the nearby Roman Praetorian Gate to Verulamium . The other photographs show the neighbouring mill cottages , and Pre Mill House from the Ver meadows looking east from the Gorhambury estate . In the 16th century , Prae Mill pumped water up to Gorhambury House . There is some evidence of other mills between Shafford and Kingsbury \u2013 the site of a Ditchmill mentioned in the late 12th century is either where Prae Mill is now or a little downstream . Kingsbury Mill Another mill and accompanying miller 's house well worth a visit . The museum containing the mill workings \u2013 and the waffle house restaurant in the mill \u2013 are open most days . This was the Abbot 's malt mill , in the parish of St. Michael 's , St. Albans , and passed into Sir Francis Bacon 's family at Gorhambury after the Dissolution of the Monasteries . The present building is Tudor , with a later Georgian brick fa\u00e7ade , but the site is probably one of the thee St. Albans mills mentioned in the Domesday book . Milling for flour and then animal foodstuffs continued until the mid 20th century . In 1973 , the mill was turned into a working mill museum , waffle house and gift shop . Abbey Mills Opposite the Ye Olde Fighting Cocks inn in Verulam Park , these were last in use as silk mills , to which they had been fully converted in 1804 . The Abbey Mills had been important corn mills when the Abbey was at the height of its power , and probably long before . The mill race still gushes out opposite the inn , although the once - successful silk mills were closed in the 1930s and demolished in the 1950s . The mill buildings are now used as houses and apartments . Cotton Mill This photograph of the Ver flowing between the old swimming pool and the Cottonmill Lane allotments shows the site of an important St. Albans mill from the late 18th to late 19th century . Used variously for diamonds , cotton , candlewicks , wool and grain , in the 1840s over 60 people worked in this mill . The map detail is from an 1822 map in Clutterbuck 's The History of the County of Hertford . The letter P shows the cotton mill where the river flows under Cottonmill Lane . Holywell House and its ornamental lake no longer exist . The Stankfield Mill referred to the 12th century is generally thought to be have been located here , although Chris Saunders ( see sources ) locates this between Sopwell and New Barnes Mills . Sopwell Mill The mill on this site is predominantly late Victorian after fire destroyed its predecessor , a little further upstream , in 1868 . It is now a private house , Sopwell Hill Farm , just off the Ver Valley Walk further down Cottonmill Lane . Sopwell Mill was probably one of the three St. Albans mills referred to in the Domesday Book . There was certainly a mill here at the time of the Peasants ' Revolt . It was still grinding corn until the Second World War , and had been a paper mill in the 16th and 17th centuries . New Barnes Mill This mill at the bottom of Cottonmill Lane stands near to the Sopwell House Hotel . The present buildings , used for light industry and business , date mainly from the late 19th century , although have been extended as recently as the 1990s . Again , there was earlier milling here under the Abbey 's control . Flour was milled here up to the 2nd World War . Park Mill Park Street 's mill , near where the Ver crosses Watling Street for the last time , was another of the Abbey 's mills , believed to have been built in the late 11th century . The present building is a 19th century structure which has now been converted into flats . The mill wheel is visible , although the millstream has been cut off . There may have been another mill further south of Park Mill , but no evidence remains . Moor Mill Another of the Abbot 's mediaeval mills , this last mill on the Ver still has its water wheel visible inside what is now a public house and conference centre . A meal may cost you more than the \u00a3 11 which it cost the Abbots of St. Albans to rebuild this mill in 1351 . The present building dates from 1762 and was working until 1939 .

Selee himself never played an inning of major league baseball . He was working at a watch factory in Waltham , Mass . , when he learned to play the game with an amateur team from nearby Melrose . In 1884 , Selee quit his job and raised $ 1,000 to form a minor league team . His reputation for having a sharp baseball mind soon spread to the major leagues , and in 1890 Selee was named manager of the National League 's Boston Beaneaters . In just his second season at the helm , Selee and his Beaneaters won 87 games and captured their first of three consecutive National League pennants . In 1892 , Boston became the first NL team to win 100 games . Two years later , the Beaneaters set a league record for runs scored and became the only National League club from 1885 - 1921 to hit more than 100 home runs . In 12 seasons as Boston 's manager , Selee complied a .607 winning percentage and captured five league pennants . \u201c Frank Selee is yet a young man , but he has established for himself a reputation as one of the foremost managers in the profession , \u201d wrote the New York Clipper . \u201c He has a quiet yet decisive way that probably enables him with better results than is attained by managers who make a great deal of noise and unnecessary bluster . \u201d Contrary to the rough tactics of rival clubs like the Baltimore Orioles , Selee encouraged his players to play a more civilized style . His teams surpassed brawnier opponents by hitting behind runners , employing the bunt and utilizing the double steal . \u201c The fact that the Bostons have always been noted for their gentlemanly deportment is due , in a great measure , to the example set by Selee , \u201d reads a banquet program from the era , \u201c who will not countenance anything that savors of rowdyism or \u201c dirty \u201d ball . The standing of the club during his incumbency is a tribute to his skill as a manager and his credit as a man . \u201d Though it was said that Selee could \u201c tell a ballplayer in his street clothes , \u201d it was his ability to see where that talent could be utilized on the diamond that made him a top-rate skipper . In Boston , Selee converted minor league outfielder Jimmy Collins into a Hall of Fame third baseman . Then , he took a struggling left-handed catcher named Fred Tenney and molded him into an elite first baseman who perfected the 3 - 6 - 3 double play . Historian David Nemec described Selee as having \u201c a flair for bending players acquired from here , there and everywhere . [ He was ] a master at putting together a team better than the sum of its parts . \u201d In 1902 , Selee was released by Boston and invited to the Windy City to manage the Chicago Cubs . In short time , Selee laid the foundation for the Cubs , who had experienced a down stretch in the National League , to become a powerhouse . In the winter of 1903 , Selee traded two players to the Cardinals for rookie pitcher and future Hall of Famer Mordecai \u201c Three Finger \u201d Brown . Meanwhile , Selee was also busy assembling one of the greatest infields in baseball history . He acquired minor league third baseman Joe Tinker and moved him to shortstop , picked up 20 - year old second baseman Johnny Evers from the New York State League , and moved catcher Frank Chance to first base . Soon these three players would be forever linked as the famous double play combination of \u201c Tinker to Evers to Chance . \u201d Those players would go on to win four out of five pennants and two World Series championships from 1906 - 10 . But the Cubs ' grand architect would be forced to watch their success from a hospital bed . Citing poor health , Selee retired from baseball during the 1905 season and turned the team over to Chance . Selee died on July 5 , 1909 , from tuberculosis at the age of 49 . Selee retired with a winning percentage of .598 over 16 seasons as a manager . He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1999 .

His reputation for having a sharp baseball mind soon spread to the major leagues , and in 1890 Selee was named manager of the National League 's Boston Beaneaters . In just his second season at the helm , Selee and his Beaneaters won 87 games and captured their first of three consecutive National League pennants . In 1892 , Boston became the first NL team to win 100 games . Two years later , the Beaneaters set a league record for runs scored and became the only National League club from 1885 - 1921 to hit more than 100 home runs . In 12 seasons as Boston 's manager , Selee complied a .607 winning percentage and captured five league pennants . \u201c Frank Selee is yet a young man , but he has established for himself a reputation as one of the foremost managers in the profession , \u201d wrote the New York Clipper . \u201c He has a quiet yet decisive way that probably enables him with better results than is attained by managers who make a great deal of noise and unnecessary bluster . \u201d Contrary to the rough tactics of rival clubs like the Baltimore Orioles , Selee encouraged his players to play a more civilized style . His teams surpassed brawnier opponents by hitting behind runners , employing the bunt and utilizing the double steal . \u201c The fact that the Bostons have always been noted for their gentlemanly deportment is due , in a great measure , to the example set by Selee , \u201d reads a banquet program from the era , \u201c who will not countenance anything that savors of rowdyism or \u201c dirty \u201d ball . The standing of the club during his incumbency is a tribute to his skill as a manager and his credit as a man . \u201d Though it was said that Selee could \u201c tell a ballplayer in his street clothes , \u201d it was his ability to see where that talent could be utilized on the diamond that made him a top-rate skipper . In Boston , Selee converted minor league outfielder Jimmy Collins into a Hall of Fame third baseman . Then , he took a struggling left-handed catcher named Fred Tenney and molded him into an elite first baseman who perfected the 3 - 6 - 3 double play . Historian David Nemec described Selee as having \u201c a flair for bending players acquired from here , there and everywhere . [ He was ] a master at putting together a team better than the sum of its parts . \u201d In 1902 , Selee was released by Boston and invited to the Windy City to manage the Chicago Cubs . In short time , Selee laid the foundation for the Cubs , who had experienced a down stretch in the National League , to become a powerhouse . In the winter of 1903 , Selee traded two players to the Cardinals for rookie pitcher and future Hall of Famer Mordecai \u201c Three Finger \u201d Brown . Meanwhile , Selee was also busy assembling one of the greatest infields in baseball history . He acquired minor league third baseman Joe Tinker and moved him to shortstop , picked up 20 - year old second baseman Johnny Evers from the New York State League , and moved catcher Frank Chance to first base . Soon these three players would be forever linked as the famous double play combination of \u201c Tinker to Evers to Chance . \u201d Those players would go on to win four out of five pennants and two World Series championships from 1906 - 10 . But the Cubs ' grand architect would be forced to watch their success from a hospital bed . Citing poor health , Selee retired from baseball during the 1905 season and turned the team over to Chance . Selee died on July 5 , 1909 , from tuberculosis at the age of 49 . Selee retired with a winning percentage of .598 over 16 seasons as a manager . He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1999 .

Even with just 30 seconds of allotted time to give his acceptance speech for winning game of the year at this month 's Game Awards in Los Angeles , he managed to make things memorably odd by telling everyone in the crowd : \u201c If you do n't have children , go get them . \u201d It was something of a full - circle moment for Fares , who , as part of a promo spot at 2017 \u2032s Game Awards , transformed himself into a viral sensation with a colorful rant whose thesis was \u201c F - -- the Oscars . \u201d Four years later , there he was taking home the biggest award at the gaming industry 's biggest show . Speaking to The Post , he reflected on both Game Awards moments , as well as his place in a rapidly changing industry . Before the interview , conducted over Zoom , could even begin , Fares panned the camera over to his toddler daughter and showered her with affection . \u201c This is my daughter , \u201d he said . \u201c I f------ love her so much . \u2026 Of course , I do n't think everybody should get kids . That just came out of my mouth [ onstage ] because , like , it 's such a wild trip to have kids , and I really love it . These days I hear a lot of youngsters that do n't want kids , which is absolutely okay as well . But I 'm just saying that you 're going to miss out on something , man . \u201d If there was any confusion as to why Fares used his precious handful of seconds on the Game Awards stage to encourage large - scale childbirth and / or adoption , he quickly dispelled it during the interview . \u201c I never plan a speech at all , \u201d said Fares , who explained he was n't expecting \u201c It Takes Two \u201d to win game of the year . \u201c The only thing I had in my head was that I needed to thank my team and my daughter . \u201d Fares 's ebullient attitude toward parenting does not match that of his game , which is about two bickering parents who are transformed into toys while their daughter braces for their impending divorce . From his perspective , however , \u201c It Takes Two \u201d is ultimately optimistic . \u201c The story is n't really about how it is to be divorced , \u201d he said . \u201c It 's about these two people that should find each other again in this harsh situation . Then they realize how they forgot about their daughter . \u201d At the Game Awards , thanking his team and his daughter ended up being just about all Fares had time to do . The ceremony devotes a significant chunk of runtime to announcements and ad spots , more so than to the awards themselves . Fares , however , said he does not have an ax to grind with the Game Awards in the same way he does with the Oscars . In fact , contrary to what many believe , he does n't really hold a grudge against the Oscars , either . \u201c When I came to Game Awards 2017 , everybody was talking like , ' This is the Oscars of games , ' \" Fares explained . \u201c So onstage , me being me , instantly in my head I was like , ' F - -- the Oscars , we 're having a great time [ here instead ] . ' That was where it came from . It was n't a statement that I think the Oscars are bad . \u201d Fares remains glad he said it , though , because he believes games deserve more respect from Hollywood . \u201c As someone who 's been on both sides , doing six feature films and now four games , I 'm telling you : When I go back and make a movie \u2014 which I will someday in the future \u2014 it 'll be like taking a vacation , \u201d he said . He then cited an example : the herculean task that was cramming \u201c It Takes Two \u201d full of far more than two game mechanics . \u201c We have an extreme amount of different mechanics , and we need to take them to a level where it makes sense , polish - wise , \u201d he said . \u201c Not only that , we had to create bosses , enemies and all that , and every boss takes around six to nine months to create . How it functions for the player is around five to six minutes of play , but it 's an extreme amount of stuff in the background . \u201d Fares clarified that he does n't think movies are easy to make , but with so many moving parts , he sees video game production as a more complex art . \u201c It 's interactive entertainment . You have your audience going loose , and you 're creating everything from the ground up , \u201d he explained . \u201c [ With a movie ] , you have an actor , you have a human being , you have a voice , you have movement , you have environment , you have sound , you have over 100 years of how to plan a movie and do a script . \u2026 And it 's a much more controllable medium . \u201d Despite the difficulty , Fares feels like he and his 65 - person team at Swedish studio Hazelight have made significant progress since he directed his first game , \u201c Brothers : A Tale of Two Sons , \u201d back in 2013 . \u201c It Takes Two \u201d regularly blurs genre lines , introducing mechanics as far-flung as \u201c Diablo \u201d - style , hack - and - slash action , third - person shooting and \u201c Tony Hawk \u201d - esque rail grinding , but Fares said development was relatively smooth sailing . Certainly the team had to omit some exciting ideas \u2014 including a section in which one player obtains a hammer and the other a nail , which would have allowed players to nail enemies to the ground \u2014 but , by and large , their meticulous planning paid off . \u201c The thing is , with this game we hardly did any crunch , \u201d Fares said . \u201c We managed to do it in a good way . We planned good . Sometimes , of course , [ crunch ] happened , but it was rare . That 's our approach to the next one as well , so hopefully we can keep doing that . \u201d Fares could not say what Hazelight 's next game is , but he was happy to elaborate on what it 's definitely not . While many video game publishers are diving into the deep ends of live - service games and NFTs \u2014 games that encourage players to spend money via endless updates and controversial \u201c non - fungible tokens \u201d that utilize the blockchain to confer ownership , respectively \u2014 Fares emphasized that the buzzword - laden zeitgeist is not for him . \u201c Live service ? We 'll never have that , \u201d he said . \u201c People can work with that , and I 'm not saying replayability is bad for every game . Some games are actually designed for it . I 'm just saying [ for ] the games we do \u2014 story - based games , most single - player games \u2014 the focus on replayability should n't be there because that 's not what it 's about . We already have a problem that people are not even finishing single - player experience games , so why focus on replayability ? \u201d Fares had even harsher words for NFTs , saying that he 'd rather get \u201c shot in the knee \u201d than include them in future games . \u201c Let me tell you this : Whatever decision you take in a game , where you have to adjust the design to make the player pay or do something that makes you want him to pay money , that is wrong , if you ask me . If you make a game [ with the goal of telling ] a story , I think it 's wrong , \u201d Fares said . \u201c Now , if you ask a big CEO that runs a company , he would say I 'm stupid because companies are about making money . But I would still say no . For me , gaming is art . \u201d The aforementioned big CEOs were another major subject at this year 's Game Awards , with serious allegations against Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick buzzing on the lips of nearly everyone in attendance . Following an outcry over host Geoff Keighley 's initial response to the Activision Blizzard situation ( a week before the Game Awards , Keighley told The Post he was still considering how to \u201c navigate \u201d the ceremony 's involvement with the publisher ) , the show opened with a call for support of game creators , saying that the industry \u201c should not and will not tolerate any abuse , harassment or predatory practice by anyone . \u201d Fares applauded the moment , which he hopes spurs growth for the industry . \u201c I think we need to mature like every other industry , \u201d Fares said . \u201c I think sometimes you need to go through some s--- to get to the other side . That 's what 's happening . \u201d As a resident of Sweden , a country where unions are far more common and centralized than in the U.S. , Fares added that he believes unions and organizing efforts like walkouts are an important part of the solution . But he does n't believe they 're a silver bullet . \u201c Yeah , for sure [ unions help ] , \" Fares said . \u201c But that 's just one of the things . I do n't think it solves everything . Education and knowledge , I think that 's most important . The gaming industry is not that old . We 're learning all the time . \u2026 If someone has done something bad , sure it 's bad , but I also want to see how we fix this . \u201d When it came to his own role in facilitating fixes , however , he said that as studio director , he prefers to focus on the creative side of things and leave workplace culture to other Hazelight team members \u2014 even though senior creatives have been accused of failing to prevent workplace discrimination at companies like Activision Blizzard and Ubisoft . \u201c I 'm the head of creative . We have another guy who 's head of the studio , \u201d Fares said . \u201c People are happy at our place . And also the [ other studio leaders ] are still doing stuff and making changes , so people are getting more and more comfortable , but I do n't know in detail exactly because that 's not really what I do . \u201d On the whole , Fares is optimistic , even if prospects might look bleak for an industry that seems to surface a new worker mistreatment scandal every other week . \u201c You can become a bit pessimistic when you hear it 's happening everywhere , \u201d Fares said , \u201c but I think we 're going toward a brighter future . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"Josef Fares","span":[21,31],"token_span":[4,5],"role":"Target","label":"Target","role_definition":"The entity which is hit by a Projectile directed by the Agent."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"He said he would \" rather get shot in the knee \" than include NFTs in future games , he also put forward that adjusting game design to make the player pay is wrong , and stated \" For me , gaming is art \" .

It was n't a statement that I think the Oscars are bad . \u201d Fares remains glad he said it , though , because he believes games deserve more respect from Hollywood . \u201c As someone who 's been on both sides , doing six feature films and now four games , I 'm telling you : When I go back and make a movie \u2014 which I will someday in the future \u2014 it 'll be like taking a vacation , \u201d he said . He then cited an example : the herculean task that was cramming \u201c It Takes Two \u201d full of far more than two game mechanics . \u201c We have an extreme amount of different mechanics , and we need to take them to a level where it makes sense , polish - wise , \u201d he said . \u201c Not only that , we had to create bosses , enemies and all that , and every boss takes around six to nine months to create . How it functions for the player is around five to six minutes of play , but it 's an extreme amount of stuff in the background . \u201d Fares clarified that he does n't think movies are easy to make , but with so many moving parts , he sees video game production as a more complex art . \u201c It 's interactive entertainment . You have your audience going loose , and you 're creating everything from the ground up , \u201d he explained . \u201c [ With a movie ] , you have an actor , you have a human being , you have a voice , you have movement , you have environment , you have sound , you have over 100 years of how to plan a movie and do a script . \u2026 And it 's a much more controllable medium . \u201d Despite the difficulty , Fares feels like he and his 65 - person team at Swedish studio Hazelight have made significant progress since he directed his first game , \u201c Brothers : A Tale of Two Sons , \u201d back in 2013 . \u201c It Takes Two \u201d regularly blurs genre lines , introducing mechanics as far-flung as \u201c Diablo \u201d - style , hack - and - slash action , third - person shooting and \u201c Tony Hawk \u201d - esque rail grinding , but Fares said development was relatively smooth sailing . Certainly the team had to omit some exciting ideas \u2014 including a section in which one player obtains a hammer and the other a nail , which would have allowed players to nail enemies to the ground \u2014 but , by and large , their meticulous planning paid off . \u201c The thing is , with this game we hardly did any crunch , \u201d Fares said . \u201c We managed to do it in a good way . We planned good . Sometimes , of course , [ crunch ] happened , but it was rare . That 's our approach to the next one as well , so hopefully we can keep doing that . \u201d Fares could not say what Hazelight 's next game is , but he was happy to elaborate on what it 's definitely not . While many video game publishers are diving into the deep ends of live - service games and NFTs \u2014 games that encourage players to spend money via endless updates and controversial \u201c non - fungible tokens \u201d that utilize the blockchain to confer ownership , respectively \u2014 Fares emphasized that the buzzword - laden zeitgeist is not for him . \u201c Live service ? We 'll never have that , \u201d he said . \u201c People can work with that , and I 'm not saying replayability is bad for every game . Some games are actually designed for it . I 'm just saying [ for ] the games we do \u2014 story - based games , most single - player games \u2014 the focus on replayability should n't be there because that 's not what it 's about . We already have a problem that people are not even finishing single - player experience games , so why focus on replayability ? \u201d Fares had even harsher words for NFTs , saying that he 'd rather get \u201c shot in the knee \u201d than include them in future games . \u201c Let me tell you this : Whatever decision you take in a game , where you have to adjust the design to make the player pay or do something that makes you want him to pay money , that is wrong , if you ask me . If you make a game [ with the goal of telling ] a story , I think it 's wrong , \u201d Fares said . \u201c Now , if you ask a big CEO that runs a company , he would say I 'm stupid because companies are about making money . But I would still say no . For me , gaming is art . \u201d The aforementioned big CEOs were another major subject at this year 's Game Awards , with serious allegations against Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick buzzing on the lips of nearly everyone in attendance . Following an outcry over host Geoff Keighley 's initial response to the Activision Blizzard situation ( a week before the Game Awards , Keighley told The Post he was still considering how to \u201c navigate \u201d the ceremony 's involvement with the publisher ) , the show opened with a call for support of game creators , saying that the industry \u201c should not and will not tolerate any abuse , harassment or predatory practice by anyone . \u201d Fares applauded the moment , which he hopes spurs growth for the industry . \u201c I think we need to mature like every other industry , \u201d Fares said . \u201c I think sometimes you need to go through some s--- to get to the other side . That 's what 's happening . \u201d As a resident of Sweden , a country where unions are far more common and centralized than in the U.S. , Fares added that he believes unions and organizing efforts like walkouts are an important part of the solution . But he does n't believe they 're a silver bullet . \u201c Yeah , for sure [ unions help ] , \" Fares said . \u201c But that 's just one of the things . I do n't think it solves everything . Education and knowledge , I think that 's most important . The gaming industry is not that old . We 're learning all the time . \u2026 If someone has done something bad , sure it 's bad , but I also want to see how we fix this . \u201d When it came to his own role in facilitating fixes , however , he said that as studio director , he prefers to focus on the creative side of things and leave workplace culture to other Hazelight team members \u2014 even though senior creatives have been accused of failing to prevent workplace discrimination at companies like Activision Blizzard and Ubisoft . \u201c I 'm the head of creative . We have another guy who 's head of the studio , \u201d Fares said . \u201c People are happy at our place . And also the [ other studio leaders ] are still doing stuff and making changes , so people are getting more and more comfortable , but I do n't know in detail exactly because that 's not really what I do . \u201d On the whole , Fares is optimistic , even if prospects might look bleak for an industry that seems to surface a new worker mistreatment scandal every other week . \u201c You can become a bit pessimistic when you hear it 's happening everywhere , \u201d Fares said , \u201c but I think we 're going toward a brighter future . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"Josef Fares","span":[21,31],"token_span":[4,5],"role":"Target","label":"Target","role_definition":"The entity which is hit by a Projectile directed by the Agent."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-1110-397-frame-Hostile_encounter","frame":"Hostile_encounter","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"This frame consists of words that describe a hostile encounter between opposing forces (Side_1 and Side_2, collectively conceptualizable as Sides) over a disputed Issue and/or in order to reach a specific Purpose.

Flair , battle royal , Bound for Glory hype Oct 7 , 2010 - 10:10:49 PM PLEASE TAKE A MOMENT TO BOOKMARK US & VISIT US DAILY TNA Impact Results on Spike TV October 7 , 2010 Live in Orlando , Fla . Report by James Caldwell , PWTorch assistant editor Impact opened cold with Abyss having a hold of TNA president Dixie Carter . The Reaction - style camera followed Abyss as he dragged Carter around backstage toward the Impact Zone . Carter begged for mercy as Abyss dragged her where \" they \" have instructed her to go . Abyss threatened anyone who tried to help her before shoving away the cameraman . Impact Zone : Abyss , with Carter , made it into the Impact Zone as Carter asked for someone to help . Abyss said tonight is a preview of what happens at 10 - 10 - 10 at Bound for Glory . He said at the PPV , Carter will be gone , gone , gone from TNA . Abyss said \" they \" wanted to ask Carter one final question before the PPV : \" Do you prefer Janice or Bob ? \" Eric Bischoff came jogging down the entrance ramp and tried to approach Abyss . Terry Taylor joined in as Bischoff shouted at everyone to back off . TNA agents eventually got their camera time helping Carter escape from Abyss . Abyss backed away as Bischoff asked for the director to cut away . Before they cut to break , Sting 's music hit . Bischoff was then handed a headset from the red-headed floor manager as Sting , Kevin Nash , and The Pope showed up on stage apparently to confront Bischoff , who was no-selling their presence since he was busy on the headset . [ Commercial Break ] Impact Zone : Nash , Pope , and Sting were kind of standing around in the ring with Bischoff as they returned from break . Pope was the first to speak . He said maybe it 's time he retracts his statement from last week when he called Eric a \" no good son of a Bischoff . \" Pope said maybe Bischoff is good by continuing to run the smoke and mirrors routine . He said Abyss might not be the smartest monster , he had one thing right that at Bound for Glory , the walls are going to come crashing down on Bischoff . Bischoff said he respects Pope , but he does n't know what he 's talking about . \" You do n't have a clue , \" he said . Pope said they 're not 300 lions , but three calculating wolves . Pope said Bischoff has made it perfectly clear that this thing is bigger than Pope . Bischoff said Pope is following around Nash and Sting like they think they know what they 're talking about . He said Pope is just like a dog chasing its tail . Pope said he 's tired of talking to Bischoff . Bischoff said this thing is about Sting and Hulk Hogan . Sting stepped forward and took the mic . He said Bischoff is \" dead on \" about this . Back to ten years ago in ol ' WCW . Sting said the best way to end this is for Hogan to get back in the ring . He said this is n't about wrestling anymore ( was it ever about wrestling ? ) , but it 's about life . Sting asked Bischoff if Hogan is ready to \" put it all out there \" and put it on the line . Sting said Hogan 's true character will be revealed at BFG , so will he be ready to walk away ? A crawler came on the screen plugging the live Reaction coming up after Impact . Bischoff had no comment . [ Q2 ] Samoa Joe and Jeff Jarrett then came jogging down the entrance ramp to the ring . Bischoff told them to back off and let him handle it . Bischoff said he 'll give them the answers . He said Sting is trying to fill a big , black hole in his heart . Bischoff said Sting is challenging a man who 's currently in intensive care . They cut to footage on the video screen of Hogan 's various back procedures . Bischoff said that 's the eighth surgery Hogan has had since February 2009 . The video went inside the surgical procedure as Bischoff asked the three of them whether they 're man enough . Bischoff told all three of them to beat him up for all they care . He said Joe and Jarrett are man enough to face them in a handicap match . Sting was n't pleased while Nash just kept leaning against the ropes . And ...cut . Reax : 20 minutes . 20 minutes of talking in circles , a faux kidnapping , and a silent crowd waiting for some clues to figure out anything anyone is talking about . Suddenly , they cut backstage where Mickie James was shown arriving in a vehicle . The roving cameraman asked what she was doing in TNA . Mickie said everyone will just have to wait to find out . [ Commercial Break ] TNA World Title feature : They aired a video package with recent Reaction comments from Kurt Angle , Jeff Hardy , and Mr. Anderson talking about their title match at the Bound for Glory PPV . New York : Team 3 D was shown at Times Square in a pre-recorded video interview . Brother Ray said this is where Team 3 D was born and bred . He said at Bound for Glory , Team 3 D will make the \" biggest announcement \" of their career . Yes , more hyperbole . Ray said the announcement will \" change tag team wrestling forever . \" 1 -- KO champion ANGELINA LOVE & VELVET SKY vs. MADISON RAYNE & TARA -- Winner gets rights to \" Beautiful People \" name The match started just before the start of the third quarter - hour with a wild brawl in the ring to get over this \" grudge feud . \" [ Q3 ] Miss T. came out on stage two minutes into the action to get a closer look at the division she 's been put in charge of . At 3:00 , Madison came in with a hot tag and the action broke down . Madison had the win in hand , but she tagged in Tara , who lost control of the match . Velvet Sky then hit a roundhouse kick on Tara and scored the pin for the win . After the finish , the BP celebrated while Madison sold from ringside that she was distraught . Miss T. then cut a promo reminding the four of them that the KO Title will be on the line at Bound for Glory with a special referee . Miss T. then brought out Mickie James on stage and everyone shot her dirty looks . Mickie said everyone should have known she would make an \" impact \" in TNA . Mickie said she would be honored to crown the new KO champion at BFG , but she has her eyes on the KO Title . Mickie said it will be \" epic . \" Her music hit and she hugged Miss T. as they cut away . WINNERS : Love & Sky in 4:00 to retain the BP name . ( *) Video : They cut to a video interview of Mick Foley plugging his book from a Boston book signing . Foley said he will stop at nothing to make sure he is the Last Man Standing vs. Ric Flair tonight . Foley reminded Flair of his promise to kiss Foley 's ass if Foley wins . Still to come : $ 100,000 gauntlet - style battle royal invitational . Mike Tenay almost ran out of breath getting the name of the match out . And they 're going to Foley - Flair up next . [ Commercial Break ] Backstage : The Reaction camera caught up to Dixie Carter , who told Bischoff to fire Abyss and do it tonight . Bischoff asked for some more time . Carter said she wo n't be like RVD . Why does n't Carter just fire him ? She told Bischoff to get him in the ring and fire him and humiliate him like he did to her . No excuses . Impact Zone : Ric Flair came out to the ring for the match against Foley . No pre-match promo . No in - show hype from Flair . No opportunity for the audience to anticipate this match during the show . TNA is setting this up to be \" just another match . \" Mick Foley came out behind Flair as Taz noted the difference with Flair in a $ 15,000 robe and Foley in torn up clothes . [ Q4 ] 2 -- MICK FOLEY vs. RIC FLAIR -- Last Man Standing match They went right to the blood with Flair opening up Foley 's forehead after the promo exchange \" last week . \" On the outside , Foley landed a low blow as blood continued to flow from Foley 's forehead into his eyes . Foley then found a barbed wire baseball bat underneath the ring steps and brought it into the ring to drop Flair with . Flair went down to his knees and bladed . Another barbed wire shot and Flair was shown visibly taking a giant swipe across his forehead with a blade to open himself up . The fight went to the announce table where Foley tried to use the barbed wire bat to open up Flair some more before Flair gouged him in the eyes . Flair then threw Foley off the stage through a merchandise table positioned on the ground below . They bleeped out a \" holy s --- \" chant as Foley sold on the floor . Flair made his way down to Foley as they cut to break . [ Commercial Break ] Back live , Flair was ramming an elbow into Foley 's forehead inside the ring . During the break , Flair used Foley 's book as a weapon hitting Foley over the back with it . Foley and Flair were covered in blood , with Foley bleeding buckets . Flair then went under the ring and retrieved some thumbtacks that he spread across the ring . Foley then blocked a corner attack and back dropped Flair across the ring into the tacks . That should have been the finish , but it turned into a mid-match transitional hold . Flair got up and begged off in the corner before Foley pounded him down to the corner . Foley then ran a barbed wire board into Flair 's face . Flair got up at five to answer the ten count before Foley went under the ring to retrieve a table . Foley set up the table in the ring , then Flair lured him into a crotch shot that decked Foley . Flair proceeded to place Foley on a table before going up top . He then dove off the top with a splash that took both men through the table . Flair then got up , but did a Flair Flop into the thumbtacks . The ref suddenly reached a ten count with Foley squatting in the corner . It just kind of ended there with Flair face - down on the mat and Foley gasping for air , the winner . WINNER : Foley in 13:00 . Just a disgusting match that was hard to watch . Sure , the blood was supposed to add intensity to the blow - off match , but it was just way , way over the top . It fits TNA 's line of thinking , \" Hey , we can use blood , unlike WWE , so tons and tons of something must make it better ! \" To make matters worse , the finish was non- conclusive ; the match just ended with a random , non-dramatic ten count with Foley declared the winner while he was randomly squatting in the corner after a comedy heel spot from Flair doing the flop into the tacks . [ Q5 -- second hour ] Post-match : Afterward , Flair walked out of the ring and nearly de-pansted himself . Foley continued to gasp for air , then took the mic . He said Flair has to kiss his ass , per their pre-match agreement . Flair stood on the entrance ramp as Foley told him to get in the ring and kiss it . Flair slowly made his way into the ring as they milked this for a while . Suddenly , Fortune hit the ring and jumped Foley . They stomped away on Foley before EV2 hit the ring and Fortune scattered . Raven was late to join the party . Flair then took the mic and started to cut a promo before screaming at a fan . Flair said that on Sunday , they 're going to kiss all of EV2 's asses . Flair spit down blood . Announcers : They cut to Tenay and Taz to focus on the blood that was splattered near their table . Tenay then plugged the main event battle royal gauntlet still to come . ... Backstage : Bischoff was shown stomping down the hallway as Tenay said it 's time for him to pink slip Abyss . Impact Zone : Bischoff made his way into the Impact Zone , walking past the ECW guys on the way to the ring . They cut to footage from the top of the show when Abyss tried to hold Dixie Carter hostage . Bischoff , in the ring , surveyed the train wreck in the ring . He then checked with the floor manager again to find out how much time he has . Bischoff told Abyss to come out now . Tenay declared that Bischoff fires Abyss next . [ Commercial Break ] Impact Zone : Back live , silence . Bischoff asked for Abyss to hurry on up and get to the ring so they can \" do what they have to do . \" Instead , Rob Van Dam 's music hit to bring out RVD . Tenay noted , moments after saying Bischoff was set to fire Abyss , that RVD faces Abyss at the Bound for Glory PPV on Sunday . RVD entered the ring and surveyed the damage before telling Bischoff there 's no way he 's going to be screwed out of the opportunity to face Abyss on Sunday . RVD said he will leave TNA over this if he does n't get a shot at him . RVD said there 's a code , brother . He said he is 1,010 percent about this . RVD told Bischoff to go tell Dixie that either Abyss wrestles him on Sunday or she loses the Whole F'n Show from TNA . Tenay declared Abyss gets a reprieve until Sunday . Taz corrected him that maybe it 's happening . Confusion reigns . Video package : From \" earlier this week , \" Tommy Dreamer and Rhino were shown walking down the street with ECW fans . Rhino kept screaming as Dreamer laughed along with Rhino 's exuberance . Still to come : $ 100,000 battle royal . [ Commercial Break ] [ Q6 ] Earlier Today : Orlando Jordan was showing Eric Young how to win the carnival games . Young said they 're meant to be as a tag team . Young said it 's only a matter of time before they get their props in TNA . Orlando vowed to grab his balls . They hugged it out a little to close for Young 's comfort . Impact Zone : Randomly in the ring back from break were Ink , Inc. Cue up Jordan 's music to bring out OJ & EY to face Shannon and Neal . They cut to footage from Xplosion to show off how great this OJ and EY pairing is by showing them ... losing . 3 -- ERIC YOUNG & ORLANDO JORDAN vs. INK , INC . ( SHANNON MOORE & JESSE NEAL ) Young went for comedy early on pretending to lock up with Orlando after the opening bell . Taz talked in circles about Orlando 's \" character \" as Orlando rubbed against Neal in the corner . Young then inadvertently distracted Orlando to allow Moore to tag into the match for Ink , Inc . Moore hit a moonsault on Orlando and scored a two count . Young then entered the ring and high - fived Moore . The match broke down , then Orlando low-blowed Moore behind the ref 's back to score the win . Post-match : Young tackled the referee and called for a time - out to over - rule the finish . Young told Orlando it 's for his own good . Young said they are forfeiting this match . He proposed at Bound for Glory they get matching tattoos , then do the match all over again . WINNERS : Young & Jordan in 5:00 . With a locker room full of wrestlers who could put on a strong wrestling match to showcase TNA 's talent roster , they went this route investing ten minutes of TV time on a comedy team in a comedy tag match . ( n/ a ) Video package : Jay Lethal narrated footage of his home where he grew up . This just came across so random and having nothing to do with anything . Maybe it 's because it followed the previous segment . Backstage : They showed Jeff Hardy , Mr. Anderson , and Kurt Angle warming up backstage ahead of the battle royal gauntlet match . [ Commercial Break ] [ Q7 ] Backstage : Dixie Carter told RVD that she \" gets the code thing . \" She told RVD that win , lose , or draw on Sunday , Abyss is gone from TNA .

Taz wanted to know if they 're here to wrestle or talk . The latter . Robbie started by introducing the new act .

Flair , battle royal , Bound for Glory hype Oct 7 , 2010 - 10:10:49 PM PLEASE TAKE A MOMENT TO BOOKMARK US & VISIT US DAILY TNA Impact Results on Spike TV October 7 , 2010 Live in Orlando , Fla . Report by James Caldwell , PWTorch assistant editor Impact opened cold with Abyss having a hold of TNA president Dixie Carter . The Reaction - style camera followed Abyss as he dragged Carter around backstage toward the Impact Zone . Carter begged for mercy as Abyss dragged her where \" they \" have instructed her to go . Abyss threatened anyone who tried to help her before shoving away the cameraman . Impact Zone : Abyss , with Carter , made it into the Impact Zone as Carter asked for someone to help . Abyss said tonight is a preview of what happens at 10 - 10 - 10 at Bound for Glory . He said at the PPV , Carter will be gone , gone , gone from TNA . Abyss said \" they \" wanted to ask Carter one final question before the PPV : \" Do you prefer Janice or Bob ? \" Eric Bischoff came jogging down the entrance ramp and tried to approach Abyss . Terry Taylor joined in as Bischoff shouted at everyone to back off . TNA agents eventually got their camera time helping Carter escape from Abyss . Abyss backed away as Bischoff asked for the director to cut away . Before they cut to break , Sting 's music hit . Bischoff was then handed a headset from the red-headed floor manager as Sting , Kevin Nash , and The Pope showed up on stage apparently to confront Bischoff , who was no-selling their presence since he was busy on the headset . [ Commercial Break ] Impact Zone : Nash , Pope , and Sting were kind of standing around in the ring with Bischoff as they returned from break . Pope was the first to speak . He said maybe it 's time he retracts his statement from last week when he called Eric a \" no good son of a Bischoff . \" Pope said maybe Bischoff is good by continuing to run the smoke and mirrors routine . He said Abyss might not be the smartest monster , he had one thing right that at Bound for Glory , the walls are going to come crashing down on Bischoff . Bischoff said he respects Pope , but he does n't know what he 's talking about . \" You do n't have a clue , \" he said . Pope said they 're not 300 lions , but three calculating wolves . Pope said Bischoff has made it perfectly clear that this thing is bigger than Pope . Bischoff said Pope is following around Nash and Sting like they think they know what they 're talking about . He said Pope is just like a dog chasing its tail . Pope said he 's tired of talking to Bischoff . Bischoff said this thing is about Sting and Hulk Hogan . Sting stepped forward and took the mic . He said Bischoff is \" dead on \" about this . Back to ten years ago in ol ' WCW . Sting said the best way to end this is for Hogan to get back in the ring . He said this is n't about wrestling anymore ( was it ever about wrestling ? ) , but it 's about life . Sting asked Bischoff if Hogan is ready to \" put it all out there \" and put it on the line . Sting said Hogan 's true character will be revealed at BFG , so will he be ready to walk away ? A crawler came on the screen plugging the live Reaction coming up after Impact . Bischoff had no comment . [ Q2 ] Samoa Joe and Jeff Jarrett then came jogging down the entrance ramp to the ring . Bischoff told them to back off and let him handle it . Bischoff said he 'll give them the answers . He said Sting is trying to fill a big , black hole in his heart . Bischoff said Sting is challenging a man who 's currently in intensive care . They cut to footage on the video screen of Hogan 's various back procedures . Bischoff said that 's the eighth surgery Hogan has had since February 2009 . The video went inside the surgical procedure as Bischoff asked the three of them whether they 're man enough . Bischoff told all three of them to beat him up for all they care . He said Joe and Jarrett are man enough to face them in a handicap match . Sting was n't pleased while Nash just kept leaning against the ropes . And ...cut . Reax : 20 minutes . 20 minutes of talking in circles , a faux kidnapping , and a silent crowd waiting for some clues to figure out anything anyone is talking about . Suddenly , they cut backstage where Mickie James was shown arriving in a vehicle . The roving cameraman asked what she was doing in TNA . Mickie said everyone will just have to wait to find out . [ Commercial Break ] TNA World Title feature : They aired a video package with recent Reaction comments from Kurt Angle , Jeff Hardy , and Mr. Anderson talking about their title match at the Bound for Glory PPV . New York : Team 3 D was shown at Times Square in a pre-recorded video interview . Brother Ray said this is where Team 3 D was born and bred . He said at Bound for Glory , Team 3 D will make the \" biggest announcement \" of their career . Yes , more hyperbole . Ray said the announcement will \" change tag team wrestling forever . \" 1 -- KO champion ANGELINA LOVE & VELVET SKY vs. MADISON RAYNE & TARA -- Winner gets rights to \" Beautiful People \" name The match started just before the start of the third quarter - hour with a wild brawl in the ring to get over this \" grudge feud . \" [ Q3 ] Miss T. came out on stage two minutes into the action to get a closer look at the division she 's been put in charge of . At 3:00 , Madison came in with a hot tag and the action broke down . Madison had the win in hand , but she tagged in Tara , who lost control of the match . Velvet Sky then hit a roundhouse kick on Tara and scored the pin for the win . After the finish , the BP celebrated while Madison sold from ringside that she was distraught . Miss T. then cut a promo reminding the four of them that the KO Title will be on the line at Bound for Glory with a special referee . Miss T. then brought out Mickie James on stage and everyone shot her dirty looks . Mickie said everyone should have known she would make an \" impact \" in TNA . Mickie said she would be honored to crown the new KO champion at BFG , but she has her eyes on the KO Title . Mickie said it will be \" epic . \" Her music hit and she hugged Miss T. as they cut away . WINNERS : Love & Sky in 4:00 to retain the BP name . ( *) Video : They cut to a video interview of Mick Foley plugging his book from a Boston book signing . Foley said he will stop at nothing to make sure he is the Last Man Standing vs. Ric Flair tonight . Foley reminded Flair of his promise to kiss Foley 's ass if Foley wins . Still to come : $ 100,000 gauntlet - style battle royal invitational . Mike Tenay almost ran out of breath getting the name of the match out . And they 're going to Foley - Flair up next . [ Commercial Break ] Backstage : The Reaction camera caught up to Dixie Carter , who told Bischoff to fire Abyss and do it tonight . Bischoff asked for some more time . Carter said she wo n't be like RVD . Why does n't Carter just fire him ? She told Bischoff to get him in the ring and fire him and humiliate him like he did to her . No excuses . Impact Zone : Ric Flair came out to the ring for the match against Foley . No pre-match promo . No in - show hype from Flair . No opportunity for the audience to anticipate this match during the show . TNA is setting this up to be \" just another match . \" Mick Foley came out behind Flair as Taz noted the difference with Flair in a $ 15,000 robe and Foley in torn up clothes . [ Q4 ] 2 -- MICK FOLEY vs. RIC FLAIR -- Last Man Standing match They went right to the blood with Flair opening up Foley 's forehead after the promo exchange \" last week . \" On the outside , Foley landed a low blow as blood continued to flow from Foley 's forehead into his eyes . Foley then found a barbed wire baseball bat underneath the ring steps and brought it into the ring to drop Flair with . Flair went down to his knees and bladed . Another barbed wire shot and Flair was shown visibly taking a giant swipe across his forehead with a blade to open himself up . The fight went to the announce table where Foley tried to use the barbed wire bat to open up Flair some more before Flair gouged him in the eyes . Flair then threw Foley off the stage through a merchandise table positioned on the ground below . They bleeped out a \" holy s --- \" chant as Foley sold on the floor . Flair made his way down to Foley as they cut to break . [ Commercial Break ] Back live , Flair was ramming an elbow into Foley 's forehead inside the ring . During the break , Flair used Foley 's book as a weapon hitting Foley over the back with it . Foley and Flair were covered in blood , with Foley bleeding buckets . Flair then went under the ring and retrieved some thumbtacks that he spread across the ring . Foley then blocked a corner attack and back dropped Flair across the ring into the tacks . That should have been the finish , but it turned into a mid-match transitional hold . Flair got up and begged off in the corner before Foley pounded him down to the corner . Foley then ran a barbed wire board into Flair 's face . Flair got up at five to answer the ten count before Foley went under the ring to retrieve a table . Foley set up the table in the ring , then Flair lured him into a crotch shot that decked Foley . Flair proceeded to place Foley on a table before going up top . He then dove off the top with a splash that took both men through the table . Flair then got up , but did a Flair Flop into the thumbtacks . The ref suddenly reached a ten count with Foley squatting in the corner . It just kind of ended there with Flair face - down on the mat and Foley gasping for air , the winner . WINNER : Foley in 13:00 . Just a disgusting match that was hard to watch . Sure , the blood was supposed to add intensity to the blow - off match , but it was just way , way over the top . It fits TNA 's line of thinking , \" Hey , we can use blood , unlike WWE , so tons and tons of something must make it better ! \" To make matters worse , the finish was non- conclusive ; the match just ended with a random , non-dramatic ten count with Foley declared the winner while he was randomly squatting in the corner after a comedy heel spot from Flair doing the flop into the tacks . [ Q5 -- second hour ] Post-match : Afterward , Flair walked out of the ring and nearly de-pansted himself . Foley continued to gasp for air , then took the mic . He said Flair has to kiss his ass , per their pre-match agreement . Flair stood on the entrance ramp as Foley told him to get in the ring and kiss it . Flair slowly made his way into the ring as they milked this for a while . Suddenly , Fortune hit the ring and jumped Foley . They stomped away on Foley before EV2 hit the ring and Fortune scattered . Raven was late to join the party . Flair then took the mic and started to cut a promo before screaming at a fan . Flair said that on Sunday , they 're going to kiss all of EV2 's asses . Flair spit down blood . Announcers : They cut to Tenay and Taz to focus on the blood that was splattered near their table . Tenay then plugged the main event battle royal gauntlet still to come . ... Backstage : Bischoff was shown stomping down the hallway as Tenay said it 's time for him to pink slip Abyss . Impact Zone : Bischoff made his way into the Impact Zone , walking past the ECW guys on the way to the ring . They cut to footage from the top of the show when Abyss tried to hold Dixie Carter hostage . Bischoff , in the ring , surveyed the train wreck in the ring . He then checked with the floor manager again to find out how much time he has . Bischoff told Abyss to come out now . Tenay declared that Bischoff fires Abyss next . [ Commercial Break ] Impact Zone : Back live , silence . Bischoff asked for Abyss to hurry on up and get to the ring so they can \" do what they have to do . \" Instead , Rob Van Dam 's music hit to bring out RVD . Tenay noted , moments after saying Bischoff was set to fire Abyss , that RVD faces Abyss at the Bound for Glory PPV on Sunday . RVD entered the ring and surveyed the damage before telling Bischoff there 's no way he 's going to be screwed out of the opportunity to face Abyss on Sunday . RVD said he will leave TNA over this if he does n't get a shot at him . RVD said there 's a code , brother . He said he is 1,010 percent about this . RVD told Bischoff to go tell Dixie that either Abyss wrestles him on Sunday or she loses the Whole F'n Show from TNA . Tenay declared Abyss gets a reprieve until Sunday . Taz corrected him that maybe it 's happening . Confusion reigns . Video package : From \" earlier this week , \" Tommy Dreamer and Rhino were shown walking down the street with ECW fans . Rhino kept screaming as Dreamer laughed along with Rhino 's exuberance . Still to come : $ 100,000 battle royal . [ Commercial Break ] [ Q6 ] Earlier Today : Orlando Jordan was showing Eric Young how to win the carnival games . Young said they 're meant to be as a tag team . Young said it 's only a matter of time before they get their props in TNA . Orlando vowed to grab his balls . They hugged it out a little to close for Young 's comfort . Impact Zone : Randomly in the ring back from break were Ink , Inc. Cue up Jordan 's music to bring out OJ & EY to face Shannon and Neal . They cut to footage from Xplosion to show off how great this OJ and EY pairing is by showing them ... losing . 3 -- ERIC YOUNG & ORLANDO JORDAN vs. INK , INC . ( SHANNON MOORE & JESSE NEAL ) Young went for comedy early on pretending to lock up with Orlando after the opening bell . Taz talked in circles about Orlando 's \" character \" as Orlando rubbed against Neal in the corner . Young then inadvertently distracted Orlando to allow Moore to tag into the match for Ink , Inc . Moore hit a moonsault on Orlando and scored a two count . Young then entered the ring and high - fived Moore . The match broke down , then Orlando low-blowed Moore behind the ref 's back to score the win . Post-match : Young tackled the referee and called for a time - out to over - rule the finish . Young told Orlando it 's for his own good . Young said they are forfeiting this match . He proposed at Bound for Glory they get matching tattoos , then do the match all over again . WINNERS : Young & Jordan in 5:00 . With a locker room full of wrestlers who could put on a strong wrestling match to showcase TNA 's talent roster , they went this route investing ten minutes of TV time on a comedy team in a comedy tag match . ( n/ a ) Video package : Jay Lethal narrated footage of his home where he grew up . This just came across so random and having nothing to do with anything . Maybe it 's because it followed the previous segment . Backstage : They showed Jeff Hardy , Mr. Anderson , and Kurt Angle warming up backstage ahead of the battle royal gauntlet match . [ Commercial Break ] [ Q7 ] Backstage : Dixie Carter told RVD that she \" gets the code thing . \" She told RVD that win , lose , or draw on Sunday , Abyss is gone from TNA .

Of the other complaints IPSO formally investigated in those three years , it chose not to uphold six and its mediation helped to resolve a further two . Press Gazette understands around 40 complaints did not reach the IPSO investigation stage , for reasons that could include being resolved amicably with the newspaper or because the regulator did not consider there were any potential breaches of the code .

The MBM had been produced by the rendering ( industrial cooking ) of carcases of cattle infected with BSE . Cattle feed contaminated with pig or poultry feed containing MBM continued to infect cattle after the 1988 ban on the use of ruminant MBM in cattle feed , although the feed ban and 1990 Specified Bovine Offal ( SBO ) controls markedly reduced the risk of infection . The feeding of MBM to all farmed animals was banned in 1996 and an EU - wide ban has been in place since 2001 . Exactly what caused the first case of BSE before the disease was amplified by feeding infectious bovine MBM back to cattle remains uncertain . The BSE Inquiry suggested that a new transmissible spongiform encephalopathy ( TSE ) agent emerged in the 1970s and that the first cases of BSE in the 1970s and 1980s escaped detection . The cause of this new agent was likely to have been a new mutation affecting the prion protein ( PrP ) in cattle , or possibly in sheep . The BSE Inquiry commented that it was a common misconception that a reduction in rendering temperature or a failure to prescribe minimum rendering times led to a failure of inactivation of the scrapie agent and its subsequent transmission to cattle . Changes in the rendering industry in the 1970s and early 1980s \u2013 a switch from batch to continuous processing and the abandonment of solvent extraction of tallow \u2013 might have led to a reduction in the inactivation of the BSE agent . However , the BSE Inquiry noted that processes used previously were also incapable of completely inactivating TSE agents . The BSE Inquiry concluded that all the evidence pointed to the specific association of an abnormal form of the prion protein ( PrP ) and TSEs . Normal PrPC is harmless . In TSEs , PrPC is converted to an abnormal form known as PrPSc resulting in the death of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord . The BSE Inquiry noted that all the sources of BSE examined had shown the same characteristics in mice . The same strain had been detected in exotic ungulates and carnivores from zoos and in cats developing feline spongiform encephalopathy ( FSE ) . The BSE Inquiry also discounted alternative theories for the cause of BSE such as the organophosphate and the autoimmune theories . The Government published a ' Response to the Report of the BSE Inquiry ' ( 478 KB ) . Great Britain first introduced statutory rendering controls in 1981 . These were aimed at reducing the contamination of animal feed with Salmonella . European Council Directive 90/667/EC introduced harmonised rendering standards across the European Community and these were implemented in Great Britain by the Animal By- Products Order 1992 . These were the first statutory time / temperature controls to be applied to the rendering process . That year the European Commission also commissioned a study to assess how effective the different rendering processes operating in the EC were at inactivating TSE agents . The most effective rendering process involved a temperature of 133oC and 3 - bar pressure for a minimum of 20 minutes . As a result the Commission introduced new standards in 1997 . In October 2002 , the EU adopted Regulation ( EC ) No.1774/2002 . The Regulation ensured that only materials derived from animal declared fit for human consumption could be used for the production of animal feed . It also banned intra-species recycling . In the light of the BSE Inquiry 's conclusions , the Government asked a committee led by Professor Gabriel Horn to review the scientific findings on the origins of BSE , including evidence presented to the BSE Inquiry and emerging findings . Their Review of the Origin of BSE ( 257 KB ) was considered by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee ( SEAC ) and published on 19 July 2001 . The Horn Review agreed with most of the conclusions of the BSE Inquiry . The Horn Review explored the reasons for the BSE epidemic beginning in Britain in the 1970s / early 1980s . MBM had been fed for several years in a number of countries , many of which also had sheep with scrapie . The Horn Review concluded that an unusual combination of events occurred in the UK in the 1970s /1980s . These related to changes in rendering practices producing a ten - fold increase in the amount of TSE infectivity surviving , the feeding of rations containing MBM to very young calves , a high ratio of sheep to cattle and an infectious agent in the MBM \u2013 possibly derived from sheep with scrapie , a sporadic mutation in a cow or other sources such as goats or exotic ungulates . In November 2001 , the European Commission 's Standing Scientific Committee published a scientific report ( 647 KB ) on the origin of BSE and the transmission of BSE . In 2005 , Defra published an independent review ( 181 KB ) of BSE cases born after the 1996 reinforced feed ban ( BARB cases ) , carried out by Professor William Hill FRS of the University of Edinburgh . Further information on BARB cases and the Government 's response to the Hill Review is available ( 553 KB ) . In 2004 , Italy and France reported the detection of a small number of cases with different molecular characteristics to BSE cases seen previously . Several other European countries ( including Denmark , Poland , Belgium , The Netherlands , Sweden , Switzerland , and Germany ) as well as Japan , the United States of America and Canada have also reported similar cases . These cases have primarily been detected by active surveillance in cattle over 10 years of age , on the basis of the molecular characteristics of the disease - associated prion protein ( PrPsc ) . They fall into two groups - those with Lower molecular weight PrPsc ( L-Type ) and those with Higher molecular weight PrPsc ( H-Type ) . The Italian L-Type cases have also been described as Bovine Amyloidotic Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BASE ) due to the due to the presence of amyloid plaques in their brains . Experimental studies have shown that both H- Type and L-Type BSE retain their molecular characteristics following experimental transmission to mice . In August 2006 , the Veterinary Laboratories Agency began a retrospective examination of brain samples taken from previous BSE cases as part of a research programme . The aim of the studies is to determine whether different forms of BSE have occurred in the UK in the past . Although the studies are ongoing , they have so far identified a single case of H-type BSE in a 13 year old cow which was tested as fallen stock and confirmed with BSE in 2005 . Further information on the retrospective studies ( SE1795 and SE1796 ) is available .

Lateral view of part of the mantle and head of a 30 mm ML C. scabra showing tubercles . Photograph by R. Young . C. scabra , the only species in the genus , is small ( 150 mm ML ) and one of the most distinctive cranchiids . The mantle is covered by large , multi-pointed cartilagenous tubercles ( see Roper and Lu 1990 , for a description of the tubercle structure ) . When disturbed , the squid often pulls its head and arms into the mantle cavity and folds its fins tightly against the mantle to form a turgid ball . The tubercules , presumably , provide some type of protection but it is unclear what predators are affected and how . In addition , the squid may ink into the mantle cavity , making the ball opaque . This was thought to be an aberrant behavior due to stress and confinement of shipboard aquaria until the same inking behavior was seen in cranchiids from submersibles ( Hunt , 1996 ) . The function of this behavior is unknown . Brief diagnosis : A cranchiin ... - with mantle covered with cartilagenous tubercules . Characteristics - Tentacles - Suckers in a transverse row on club manus of equal size . - Diagonally set pairs of suckers and pad on distal 2/3 of tentacular stalk . - Head - Eyes sessile in paralarvae . - Beaks : Descriptions can be found here : Lower beak ; upper beak . - Funnel - Funnel valve present , large . - Mantle - Mantle covered with cartilagenous tubercles bearing 3 - 5 sharp cusps . - Fins - Each fin nearly oval in shape with free posterior lobes . - Photophores - Fourteen oval photophores on each eye ( ventral - proximal series of 8 photophores , ventral - distal series of 4 photophores near lens and dorsal series of two photophores near lens ) .

Ventral view of a maturing ( ? ) but damaged female C. scabra , Gulf of Mexico , 150 mm ML , showing the red-pigmented photophores at the tips of the arms . Photograph by M. Vecchione . Comments Characteristics are from Voss ( 1980 ) . More details of the description of C. scabra can be found here . Behavior The small C. scabra below , photographed in a shipboard aquarium , has retracted its head with arms and tentacles into the mantle cavity . The mantle has taken the shape of a sphere and the chromatophores have expanded . This response to disturbance perhaps makes their consumption by small- mouthed predators more difficult . The photographs below , also taken in an aquarium , show two different color phases of the same squid . A typical transparent phase on the right and a peculiar anteriorly pigmented phase on the left . The half - pigmented phase was seen several times ( D. Fenolio , pers. communication ) . Figure . Two side views of the same C. scabra , Sea of Japan , ca. 10 cm ML. Photographs by Dant\u00e9 Fenolio . Life History Small paralarvae lack tubercles and are similar in appearance to paralarvae of Liocranchia . However they can easily be separated from paralarvae of Liocranchia by the numerous , scattered chromatophores that cover much or all of the mantle and by the short , thick tentacles that appear to be rugose or , possibly , glandular . Note the sessile eyes . By 8 mm ML they have numerous tubercules . Figure . Paralarval C. scabra . Left - Ventral and dorsal views , 4.7 mm ML , Hawaiian waters .

Lateral view of part of the mantle and head of a 30 mm ML C. scabra showing tubercles . Photograph by R. Young . C. scabra , the only species in the genus , is small ( 150 mm ML ) and one of the most distinctive cranchiids . The mantle is covered by large , multi-pointed cartilagenous tubercles ( see Roper and Lu 1990 , for a description of the tubercle structure ) . When disturbed , the squid often pulls its head and arms into the mantle cavity and folds its fins tightly against the mantle to form a turgid ball . The tubercules , presumably , provide some type of protection but it is unclear what predators are affected and how . In addition , the squid may ink into the mantle cavity , making the ball opaque . This was thought to be an aberrant behavior due to stress and confinement of shipboard aquaria until the same inking behavior was seen in cranchiids from submersibles ( Hunt , 1996 ) . The function of this behavior is unknown . Brief diagnosis : A cranchiin ... - with mantle covered with cartilagenous tubercules . Characteristics - Tentacles - Suckers in a transverse row on club manus of equal size . - Diagonally set pairs of suckers and pad on distal 2/3 of tentacular stalk . - Head - Eyes sessile in paralarvae . - Beaks : Descriptions can be found here : Lower beak ; upper beak . - Funnel - Funnel valve present , large . - Mantle - Mantle covered with cartilagenous tubercles bearing 3 - 5 sharp cusps . - Fins - Each fin nearly oval in shape with free posterior lobes . - Photophores - Fourteen oval photophores on each eye ( ventral - proximal series of 8 photophores , ventral - distal series of 4 photophores near lens and dorsal series of two photophores near lens ) .

Comments Characteristics are from Voss ( 1980 ) . More details of the description of C. scabra can be found here . Behavior The small C. scabra below , photographed in a shipboard aquarium , has retracted its head with arms and tentacles into the mantle cavity . The mantle has taken the shape of a sphere and the chromatophores have expanded . This response to disturbance perhaps makes their consumption by small- mouthed predators more difficult . The photographs below , also taken in an aquarium , show two different color phases of the same squid . A typical transparent phase on the right and a peculiar anteriorly pigmented phase on the left . The half - pigmented phase was seen several times ( D. Fenolio , pers. communication ) . Figure . Two side views of the same C. scabra , Sea of Japan , ca. 10 cm ML. Photographs by Dant\u00e9 Fenolio . Life History Small paralarvae lack tubercles and are similar in appearance to paralarvae of Liocranchia . However they can easily be separated from paralarvae of Liocranchia by the numerous , scattered chromatophores that cover much or all of the mantle and by the short , thick tentacles that appear to be rugose or , possibly , glandular . Note the sessile eyes . By 8 mm ML they have numerous tubercules . Figure . Paralarval C. scabra . Left - Ventral and dorsal views , 4.7 mm ML , Hawaiian waters . Chromatophores were faint and pattern may not be complete ; at slightly larger sizes the chromatophores cover the entire mantle . Drawings by R. Young . Right - Ventral view , 8 mm ML , showing tubercules , not chromatophores . Drawing from Voss , 1980 , p. 377 , printed with the permission of the Bulletin of Marine Science . Scale bar is 1 mm .

The British approached Philadelphia from the Chesapeake , landing at Head of Elk , Maryland ( present day Elkton ) . As the British began their march toward the city , Washington and the people of Philadelphia were confident that the British could be stopped . Washington chose the high ground in the area of Chadds Ford to defend against the British advance . Chadds Ford allowed safe passage across the Brandywine River on the road from Baltimore to Philadelphia . On the morning of September 9th Washington placed his troops along the Brandywine River to guard the main fords . By placing detachments of troops at Pyle 's Ford \u2014 the southernmost possible crossing of the river \u2014 and Wistar 's Ford \u2014 the northernmost crossing of the river before it forked \u2014 Washington hoped to force a fight at Chadds Ford , an advantageous position . Washington believed that he had all of the fords along the Brandywine guarded by his troops and that the closest unguarded ford was twelve miles up-river . Washington was confident that the area was secure . The British grouped at nearby Kennett Square and formulated a plan . A portion of the British army was to march from Kennett Square as if they intended to meet Washington on the banks of the river at Chadds Ford . Meanwhile , the majority of the army under Howe 's direction would march north of Wistar 's Ford , cross the river at a ford unknown to Washington , and march south into the flank of the American forces . Superior tactics and better knowledge of the area allowed the British to outwit Washington and his army . September 11 , 1777 : The Day of the Battle The day of the battle began with a heavy fog which blanketed the area , providing cover for the approaching British troops . When the fog cleared , the sun blazed and the heat was sweltering . The first reports of British troop movements indicated to Washington that Howe had divided his forces . Subsequent reports both confirmed and denied this report . In the confusion Washington persisted in the mistaken belief that the British were sending their entire force against his line at Chadds Ford . Meanwhile , Howe and the majority of his force continued their approach . By mid-afternoon the British had crossed the river at the unguarded ford to the north of Washington 's force and they had gained a strategic position near Birmingham Friends Meeting House . When the British appeared on the American right flank , Washington realized that he had been outmaneuvered . He ordered his army to take the high ground around Birmingham Friends Meeting House as a last defense . Unfortunately , in the confusion caused by the surprise , the Americans were unable to successfully defend their position . The Americans fought valiantly , but they had been outwitted on the rolling hills along the Brandywine . Nightfall finally brought an end to the battle . The defeated Americans retreated to Chester . The bulk of the army arrived by midnight with the remainder trickling in until dawn . General Howe 's exhausted men camped on the battlefield and the surrounding countryside including the farmyards of Benjamin Ring and Gideon Gilpin . British Captain John Andre wrote in his journal , \" Night and the fatigue the soldiers had undergone prevented any pursuit . \" September 26 , 1777 : The Result : The British Take Philadelphia Although the American army was forced to retreat after the Battle of Brandywine , the defeat did not demoralize the men . They believed the defeat was not the result of poor fighting ability but rather because of unfamiliarity with the landscape and poor reconnaissance information . During the next several days , General Howe and his Army moved closer to Philadelphia with little opposition from Washington . The two armies maneuvered in hopes of finding the other at a disadvantage , but no decisive military actions were taken during the next two weeks . Congress abandoned Philadelphia and moved first to Lancaster and then to York to escape before the British takeover . Important military supplies were moved out of the Philadelphia area to Reading , Pennsylvania , where they could be defended . Washington responded cautiously after the battle .

A nationwide debate surrounding this issue has been underway since Dylann Roof killed nine African - Americans in a Charleston , South Carolina , church in 2015 in an effort to \" start a race war . \" And it flared up again after white nationalists marched last weekend to protest the removal of a Robert E.

The National Register of Historic Places does not keep a detailed list of Confederate memorials . In 2016 , the Southern Poverty Law Center identified 1,503 Confederate \" place names and other symbols in public spaces \" across the nation but admitted the study was \" far from comprehensive . \" Some Civil War monuments in the South , such as at battlefields , do not have pro-Confederate symbolism . Many local government officials are now weighing whether to keep Confederate memorials in their cities and towns . Here 's a state - by- state breakdown : Removing Kentucky Lexington will relocate the statues of John Hunt Morgan and John C. Brackenridge after the City Council unanimously approved their removal . \" By relocating these statues we are not destroying , hiding or sanitizing history . We are honoring and learning our history through this relocation , \" Lexington Mayor Jim Gray wrote on Twitter . Gray had announced his intent to relocate the statues in a series of tweets just after the Charlottesville attack . Florida The Hillsborough County Board of Commissioners voted in July to remove the Memoria In Aeterna monument , which honors Confederate soldiers , from a county courthouse . The county commission voted Wednesday that the monument will only be removed if donations can be raised to cover the cost , estimated to be as high as $ 280,000 . The money must be raised by September 16 , the commission said . The Tampa Bay Buccaneers , Lightning and Rays donated an undisclosed amount of money to help move the statue , the teams said in a joint statement Thursday . The teams said the monument \" does not reflect the values of our community . \" \" Now more than ever before , we must stand united and committed to diversity and inclusion as we all attempt to heal from the tragedy in Charlottesville , \" the statement read . The board is also expected to relocate the Hillsborough County Civil War Veterans Monument . New York Busts of Lee and Confederate Lt. Gen. Stonewall Jackson will be removed from the City University of New York 's Hall of Fame for Great Americans because \" New York stands against racism , \" Gov. Andrew Cuomo tweeted Wednesday . \" There are many great Americans , many of them New Yorkers worthy of a spot in this great hall , \" Cuomo tweeted . \" These two Confederates are not among them . \" Also Wednesday , Cuomo requested that the acting US secretary of the Army , Ryan McCarthy , reconsider his refusal to rename General Lee Avenue and Stonewall Jackson Drive at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn . Virginia The Charlottesville City Council voted in April to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee at the newly renamed Emancipation Park , CNN affiliate WVIR reported . The violence there over the weekend came after this decision . The removal is on hold pending litigation . Wisconsin Madison Mayor Paul Soglin announced Thursday that two Confederate memorials at the Forest Hill Cemetery will be removed . In a statement , Soglin said taking down the \" monuments will not erase our shared history . The Confederacy 's legacy will be with us , whether we memorialize it in marble or not . \" \" There should be no place in our country for bigotry , hatred or violence against those who seek to unite our communities and our country , \" the mayor 's statement said .

But its liquidity - fuelled real estate and tourism binge in the last decade may have been one step too far . Q. What is the extent of its problems ? A. The emirate has said it has $ 80bn of debts , though some analysts say the true figure could be double that . Dubai World , the state - owned holding company whose bail - out plans triggered the current crisis , has liabilities of about $ 60 bn , though only part of that is debt .

It has the world 's largest sovereign wealth fund . A. Abu Dhabi has , via the federal central bank , bought one $ 10 bn bond issued by the Dubai government earlier this year , and , via its own banks , bought another $ 5 bn bond this week .

And how is the Dubai World debt to be met , even after the six-month delay , if Abu Dhabi will not fund the rescue package ? Q. What about other Dubai companies ? How are they doing ? A.

The diversity of species in Star Wars is never really spoken about directly , it 's just a fact of life , and accordingly , no one uses the word \" alien , \" in any of the films . And yet , in nearly twenty Star Wars novels published between 1999 and 2003 , a giant alien invasion trope threatened the galaxy , and the legitimacy of Star Wars right along with it . When the Star Wars canon was reorganized a few years ago , article after article decried the loss of the \" Expanded Universe \" . The basic complaint was tat Mara Jade and Grand Admiral Thrawn and all the cool stuff from Star Wars books were taken away from the fans and turned into \" Legends , \" which was code for non- canonical stories ; glorified , monetized fan fiction in the Disney age . But , to my knowledge , most fans of the EU were n't ( and are n't ) really losing any sleep about getting rid of the massive storyline which runs through the majority of the EU's New Jedi Order series . I 'm talking about the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of the Star Wars galaxy ; a moment in Star Wars fandom only slightly less dark than introduction of Jar Jar Binks . First thing 's first : if you 're really into Star Wars books , you certainly read these things for character stuff and not necessarily the plots . The characters and their legacy are the enduring cool things about these books , including The New Jedi Order . Plus , to be perfectly crystal clear , a ton of these books were written by fantastic science fiction and fantasy writers including R.A. Salvatore , Michael Stackpole , Karen Traviss , Walter Jon Williams , Grey Keyes , Troy Denning , Michael Jan Freidman , Elaine Cunningham , James Luceno , Kathy Tyres and many more quality writers . I 'm not sure any of these writers can be blamed for the fumble of the Yuuzhan Vong storyline at all .

If we define \" aliens \" as simply being intelligent life not found on the planet Earth , then literally everyone - including the \" humans \" Obi-Wan , Han Solo , Rey , and Leia - are all aliens , too . The diversity of species in Star Wars is never really spoken about directly , it 's just a fact of life , and accordingly , no one uses the word \" alien , \" in any of the films . And yet , in nearly twenty Star Wars novels published between 1999 and 2003 , a giant alien invasion trope threatened the galaxy , and the legitimacy of Star Wars right along with it . When the Star Wars canon was reorganized a few years ago , article after article decried the loss of the \" Expanded Universe \" . The basic complaint was tat Mara Jade and Grand Admiral Thrawn and all the cool stuff from Star Wars books were taken away from the fans and turned into \" Legends , \" which was code for non- canonical stories ; glorified , monetized fan fiction in the Disney age . But , to my knowledge , most fans of the EU were n't ( and are n't ) really losing any sleep about getting rid of the massive storyline which runs through the majority of the EU's New Jedi Order series . I 'm talking about the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of the Star Wars galaxy ; a moment in Star Wars fandom only slightly less dark than introduction of Jar Jar Binks . First thing 's first : if you 're really into Star Wars books , you certainly read these things for character stuff and not necessarily the plots . The characters and their legacy are the enduring cool things about these books , including The New Jedi Order . Plus , to be perfectly crystal clear , a ton of these books were written by fantastic science fiction and fantasy writers including R.A. Salvatore , Michael Stackpole , Karen Traviss , Walter Jon Williams , Grey Keyes , Troy Denning , Michael Jan Freidman , Elaine Cunningham , James Luceno , Kathy Tyres and many more quality writers . I 'm not sure any of these writers can be blamed for the fumble of the Yuuzhan Vong storyline at all .

Published on May 10 , 2008 Plenty of spoilers here ! Tonight 's rather good - though badly plot-holed - effort from writer Stephen Greenhorn ( who also wrote last season 's The Lazarus Experiment ) and director Alice Troughton was once again undermined by incessant music telling us when to cry , when to be excited , when to reflect \u2026 we 're lucky series composer Murray Gold has n't got a ' bouncy spring ' player in his orchestra , or they 'd probably punctuate the jokes with ' twang ' effects , Carry - on style . Producer Phil Collinson at least spares us the ' rimshot sting ' on punchlines . Collinson is doubtless a very busy man indeed , but he really ought to make time for the extras in his DVD collection , where he 'll find a phalanx of interviewed movie composers saying , over and over again , that a good score is just as much about when there is n't any music . Silence is also an instrument in a score , creating tension , letting the actors perform and the story breathe , and maximising the effect of music when it comes . I know I 've moaned about this before , and I 'll stop moaning about it when they stop washing Who senseless with a score that should accentuate the story but instead becomes - by repetition - meaningless muzak . Okay then . Last week 's end-of - episode Tardis hi-jack lands the Doctor , Donna and semi-reluctant passenger Dr. Martha Jones in very familiar Who territory \u2013 a dank and fairly cheap series of underground tunnels , where they are almost immediately set-upon by the human contingent in an eternal war that is being fought with the liquid - breathing \u2013 but actually rather nice - ' Hath ' . Desperately in need of back - up troops , the soldiers force the Doctor 's hand into a cloning machine , which the breakneck pace of the show dictates must produce a fully - formed ( and fully dressed ) female spin-off Doctor - clone within ten seconds . The nameless , fully - trained blonde that emerges is played by Georgia Moffett , the daughter of fifth Doctor Peter Davison . Why Donna and Martha are not cloned is never explained , but it certainly would have cost the show focus to have two Tate-style whingers running about , so let 's be glad of it . A skirmish with the sinister - looking Hath erupts immediately , and Martha is taken prisoner by the liquid - breathing aliens whilst the Doctor and Donna are led to General Cobb ( Excalibur 's Nigel Terry , who puts in a customary first - rate performance ) . Cobb informs them that the humans are engaged in a relentless war that has gone on for generations following the Hath betrayal of a mixed human / Hath colony centuries ago . Cloning machines now fuel a war that apparently will never have an end until the ' source ' is found \u2013 a mythical and potent object which the warriors associate with God . The Doctor discovers a hidden section to the map that both sides are using , inadvertantly sending the humans and the Hath on collission course . Our Gallifrean hero wears his pacifist credentials on his sleeve , and when he objects to Cobb 's genocidal intentions , is locked up along with Donna and his impromptu progeny , whom Donna has named ' Jenny ' and who is now feared to share the Doctor 's peace - loving ideals . Over in Hath-land , Martha Jones wakes up next to her wounded captor in the debris of an explosion , relocates his shoulder ( having had some difficulty finding it ) and instantly makes a friend of the aliens , who are n't nearly as nasty as they look . In fact the monster of The Doctor 's Daughter is really the war-like Cobb , who equates peace with victory at any cost . The fine points of the Doctor 's pacifism are discussed whilst trapped in the cell , where Donna begins to see a logical pattern in the apparently banal number - plates that are riveted onto the walls of the underground complex . However , it 's not another ' big bad wolf ' scenario , and Ms. Noble is destined to solve it by episode 's end . In the meantime , the Doctor 's course is clear \u2013 escape and bring peace where there 's war . Writer Greenhorn gets them out of the cell with a rather lazy ' seduction ploy ' , and by the inclusion of the classic ' dumbest guard in the world ' character , but never mind \u2013 our heroes are free , and suddenly the Doctor realises that his ' daughter ' shares old assistant Leela 's trigger - happy habits . Despite his reluctance to accept the Moffett character as any part of himself , he starts handing out lectures - and actually seems to be softening \u2026 I 'm tempted to theorise that it 's the medium budget episodes of Who that satisfy most these days . The confined corridors and straightfoward matte painting that greets Martha when she escapes to planet Messaline 's rather gothic surface are n't budget - breakers , and a story like The Doctor 's Daughter has to stand on the quality of its ideas and writing \u2026 which , for the most part , it does . I am biased , being a tremendous Baker-ite ; this episode is quite redolent of Baker-era Who , with plenty of dark and cheap corridors to run down and two under-manned warring factions for the Doctor to bring peace to , if he can . But the dizzy pace of the series does n't relapse into John - Nathan Turner - style languidness , and the make - up and design of the Hath is excellent . They could have walked straight out of Bioshock , and it 's almost a disappointment that they 're so nice . Donna 's role as the Doctor 's conscience is beginning to take shape , and I must admit that it 's refreshing to have an assistant who therefore serves a purpose other than needing to be rescued and asking ' What 's that , Doctor ' . Tate has toned down the grating voice a tad , which is welcome . Hopefully Tennant will eventually stop shouting too \u2013 it 's a dramatic tool that ( like excessive music ) becomes meaningless if over-used . Freema Agyman acquits herself well in a moment of tragedy on the planet 's surface ( how does an alien with scuba-breathing equipment on drown , by the way ? ) , and we see that the ' problem ' \u2013 the BBC clearly believe there was one \u2013 with Martha Jones was that she had been under-written and under-motivated ; they 're not making the same mistake with Tate , and I do feel sorry for Agyeman in that respect . The BBC , unwilling to take Who canon so far out of its roots as to have the Doctor regenerate female , has literally split off part of his character into Moffet 's new and equally nameless Gallifrean . There is early promise in The Doctor 's Daughter that Moffett will join the Tardis crew , at which point we know her death is inevitable \u2013 assistants are announced and feted a year before the series goes on air . Greenhorn cunningly uses this to convince us that Moffett 's death at Cobb 's hand at the end of the episode is for keeps ( more about the future of Moffett 's clone - Doctor here ) . It is n't . Putting an audience through the wringer with a character 's death , only to revive them later , is admittedly a pretty cheap trick ; but this is outshone by the big surprise at ' Jenny ' 's career - choice at the conclusion of The Doctor 's Daughter . Wow . Daughter interestingly showed a tender \u2013 and very hurt \u2013 side to the Doctor which we rarely glimpse , particularly in his initial denial of Moffett 's validity as his own flesh and blood . It was also interesting to hear the Doctor refer to his previous child ( or children , since Carol Ann Ford played William Hartnell 's granddaughter originally ) . It was n't clear from the writing just how the Tardis had been summoned / hijacked into this episode at the conclusion of The Poison Sky - Daughter 's end -of - episode post-mortem was a clumsy , dated flourish that , to boot , shed little light on the matter . Oh well ... Next week , the Doctor and Donna meet Agatha Christie \u2013 let 's hope it 's better than Black Orchid .

Daughter interestingly showed a tender \u2013 and very hurt \u2013 side to the Doctor which we rarely glimpse , particularly in his initial denial of Moffett 's validity as his own flesh and blood . It was also interesting to hear the Doctor refer to his previous child ( or children , since Carol Ann Ford played William Hartnell 's granddaughter originally ) . It was n't clear from the writing just how the Tardis had been summoned / hijacked into this episode at the conclusion of The Poison Sky - Daughter 's end -of - episode post-mortem was a clumsy , dated flourish that , to boot , shed little light on the matter . Oh well ... Next week , the Doctor and Donna meet Agatha Christie \u2013 let 's hope it 's better than Black Orchid . Check out last week 's episode , The Poison Sky , which was reviewed by Simon and Martin . Doctor Who interviews at Geek ...

Mr Dikko , who had fled Nigeria after a military coup , was accused of stealing $ 1 bn ( \u00c2\u00a3 625 m ) of government money . The plot was foiled by a young British customs officer , Charles David Morrow , who has now told the BBC World Service Witness programme what happened . On a summer 's day , Mr Dikko walked out of his front door in an upmarket neighbourhood of Bayswater in London . Within seconds he had been grabbed by two men and bundled into the back of a transit van . \" I remember the very violent way in which I was grabbed and hurled into a van , with a huge fellow sitting on my head - and the way in which they immediately put on me handcuffs and chains on my legs , \" he told the BBC a year later . Mr Dikko had been minister for transport in the government of Shehu Shagari until it was overthrown by the military at the end of 1983 . He fled to London accused by Nigeria 's new rulers of embezzlement - a charge he has always denied . Labelled \" Nigeria 's most wanted man \" , a plot was hatched to get both him and the money back . The extraordinary plan was to kidnap Mr Dikko , drug him , stick him into a specially made crate and put him on a plane back to Nigeria - alive . Israeli anaesthetist An Israeli alleged former Mossad agent , Alexander Barak , was recruited to lead the kidnap team . It included a Nigerian intelligence officer , Maj Mohammed Yusufu , and Israeli nationals Felix Abitbol and Dr Lev-Arie Shapiro , who was to inject Mr Dikko with an anaesthetic . The kidnappers switched vehicles in a car park by London Zoo and headed towards Stansted airport where a Nigerian Airways plane was waiting . They injected Mr Dikko and laid him , unconscious , in a crate . The Israeli anaesthetist climbed into the crate as well , carrying medical equipment to make sure Mr Dikko did n't die en route . Barak and Abitbol got into a second crate . Both boxes were then sealed . At the cargo terminal of Stansted Airport , 40 miles ( 64 km ) north of London , a Nigerian diplomat was anxiously waiting for the crates to arrive . Also on duty that day was a young customs officer , Charles David Morrow . Diplomatic bag \" The day had gone fairly normally until about 3 pm .

I met a guy who turned out to be a Nigerian diplomat called Mr Edet . He showed me his passport and he said it was diplomatic cargo . Being ignorant of such matters , I asked him what it was , and he told me it was just documents and things . \" No - one on duty at Stansted had dealt with a diplomatic bag before and Mr Morrow went to check the procedure . Just then a colleague returned from the passenger terminal with some startling news . There was an All Ports Bulletin from Scotland Yard saying that a Nigerian had been kidnapped and it was suspected he would be smuggled out of the country . The police had been alerted by Mr Dikko 's secretary who had witnessed his abduction from a window in the house . Hearing the news , Mr Morrow realised he had a problem on his hands . \" I just put two and two together . The classic customs approach is not to look for the goods , you look for the space , \" he said . \" So I am looking out of the window and I can see the space which is these two crates , clearly big enough to get a man inside . We 've got a Nigerian Airways 707 , which we do n't normally see . They do n't want the crates manifested , so there would be no record of them having gone through .

The decision was taken that the crates could be opened - but it would be done by the book . That required the presence of a Nigerian diplomat , but as Mr Morrow pointed out , one was already on hand . By now , the crates were up on special trolleys ready to be loaded on to the plane . \" Peter , the cargo manager , hit the lid on the bottom and lifted it . And as he lifted it , the Nigerian diplomat , who was standing next to me , took off like a startled rabbit across the tarmac , \" Mr Morrow said . \" You have to remember we are on an airfield which is square miles of nothing . He ran about five yards ( 4.5 m ) , realised no - one was chasing him and then stopped . \" Peter looked into the crate and said : ' There 's bodies inside ! ' He parked a forklift truck so its tines lay across the top of the crate so it could n't be opened . Mr Morrow dialled the emergency number 999 . \" My name 's Morrow , from Customs at Stansted . We 've got some bodies in a crate . Do you think you can send someone over , \" he recalls saying . \" They said : ' Alive or Dead ? ' \" I said : ' That 's a very good point . I do n't know . ' \" They said : ' We 'll send an ambulance as well . ' \" After half an hour , police started to arrive , and they opened the second crate .

Diplomatic relations between the UK and Nigeria broke down and were only fully restored two years later . The Nigerian and Israeli governments have always denied involvement in the kidnapping .

Big crowds gathered outside the court in Athens as the judges gave verdicts on 68 defendants . Golden Dawn secured 18 MPs in 2012 , as Greeks were battered by a financial crisis . The criminal inquiry into the party began with the murder of an anti-fascist musician in 2013 . Leader Nikos Michaloliakos and six colleagues were convicted of heading a criminal group . Supporter Giorgos Roupakias was found guilty of murdering an anti-racist musician and 15 others were convicted of conspiracy in the case . Some 2,000 police were deployed around Athens Appeals Court as thousands of protesters demanded long jail terms , carrying banners that read \" fear will not win \" and \" Nazis in prison \" , Greek media reported . Tear gas was fired into the crowd as some of the protesters clashed with police and threw petrol bombs . Eleven of the defendants were in the court when the verdict was read out , along with 50 attorneys and 50 journalists . Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou said the verdict was an important day for democracy and proof that Greek institutions were able to \" fend off any attempt to undermine them \" . Hundreds of witnesses gave evidence in the trial , which was delayed this year by the Covid - 19 pandemic . Who was on trial ? At the centre of the trial are Golden Dawn leader Nikos Michaloliakos and 18 ex - MPs who were elected in 2012 when the neo -Nazi party came third in national elections on an anti-immigrant , nationalist platform . Golden Dawn no longer has any MPs in parliament . After they won almost 7 % of the vote in May 2012 , emboldened supporters attacked political opponents and migrants . Golden Dawn supporter Giorgos Roupakias had already confessed to the murder of rapper Pavlos Fyssas . The musician was chased down by thugs and stabbed in Piraeus in September 2013 . As the verdict was delivered , Fyssas 's mother Magda cried out , \" My Pavlos defeated them alone ! \" . What were the verdicts ? The key verdict on Wednesday was that Golden Dawn - Chrysi Avgi in Greek - was a criminal group . Its leadership was found guilty of running it . They included Michaloliakos and six former MPs - Ilias Kasidiaris , Ioannis Lagos , Christos Pappas , Artemis Matthaiopoulos , Ilias Panagiotaros and Giorgos Germenis . The other ex - MPs were found guilty of joining a criminal organisation . The three judges , led by Maria Lepeniotou , were due to deliver sentencing later . As well as the fatal stabbing of Pavlos Fyssas , defendants in the trial were also convicted of other violent attacks on migrants and left-wing political opponents . Five Golden Dawn members were convicted of the attempted murders of Egyptian fishermen and four of the attempted murder of communist activists in the PAME union . In the courtroom By Dimitris Psarras , investigative journalist who has tracked Golden Dawn 's rise As the Golden Dawn leaders were convicted , very few inside the room applauded but outside thousands began to celebrate . I felt very satisfied , of course . Because I knew the facts revealed during those five and a half years , and I was always optimistic . From 2010 , Golden Dawn had managed to poison the Greek political system and democratic institutions , securing contacts with the army , the police , the judiciary and the Church . It is an excellent verdict . Who is their leader ? Nikos Michaloliakos founded the movement in the mid-1980s and was admirer of Nazism and a Holocaust denier , giving the Hitler salute at party rallies . But he had always denied any knowledge of the Pavlos Fyssas murder . When police raided his home in 2013 , they found weapons and ammunition . Golden Dawn officially denied being a neo -Nazi movement , but its badge closely resembled a swastika , some senior members praised Adolf Hitler , and the clothing of choice at anti-immigrant protests was black T-shirts and combat trousers . Witnesses told the trial that members were trained to handle weapons and used Nazi symbols . Last December , chief prosecutor Adamantia Economou prompted uproar , with a call for the party officials to be cleared , arguing there was no evidence they had any part in planning or carrying out the series of attacks . How has Greece reacted There has been disgust at Golden Dawn across the political spectrum in Greece . Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he would not normally comment on court decisions but said the Greek republic had first expelled Golden Dawn from parliament and now Greece 's independent judiciary had acted too . \" Democracy won today . It is up to us that it wins every day , \" he said . The verdict was praised as \" just \" and \" historic \" by Prokopis Pavlopoulos , who was president of Greece until earlier this year . Centre-left political leader Fofi Gennimata said the decision sent a strong message to Europe that \" fascism has no place in our lives \" . Nils Muiznieks of Amnesty International also said the trial sent a clear message : that \" violent and racist criminal activity - whether perpetrated by individuals on the street or members of parliament - will not go unpunished \" .

Big crowds gathered outside the court in Athens as the judges gave verdicts on 68 defendants . Golden Dawn secured 18 MPs in 2012 , as Greeks were battered by a financial crisis . The criminal inquiry into the party began with the murder of an anti-fascist musician in 2013 . Leader Nikos Michaloliakos and six colleagues were convicted of heading a criminal group . Supporter Giorgos Roupakias was found guilty of murdering an anti-racist musician and 15 others were convicted of conspiracy in the case . Some 2,000 police were deployed around Athens Appeals Court as thousands of protesters demanded long jail terms , carrying banners that read \" fear will not win \" and \" Nazis in prison \" , Greek media reported . Tear gas was fired into the crowd as some of the protesters clashed with police and threw petrol bombs . Eleven of the defendants were in the court when the verdict was read out , along with 50 attorneys and 50 journalists . Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou said the verdict was an important day for democracy and proof that Greek institutions were able to \" fend off any attempt to undermine them \" . Hundreds of witnesses gave evidence in the trial , which was delayed this year by the Covid - 19 pandemic . Who was on trial ? At the centre of the trial are Golden Dawn leader Nikos Michaloliakos and 18 ex - MPs who were elected in 2012 when the neo -Nazi party came third in national elections on an anti-immigrant , nationalist platform . Golden Dawn no longer has any MPs in parliament . After they won almost 7 % of the vote in May 2012 , emboldened supporters attacked political opponents and migrants . Golden Dawn supporter Giorgos Roupakias had already confessed to the murder of rapper Pavlos Fyssas . The musician was chased down by thugs and stabbed in Piraeus in September 2013 . As the verdict was delivered , Fyssas 's mother Magda cried out , \" My Pavlos defeated them alone ! \" . What were the verdicts ? The key verdict on Wednesday was that Golden Dawn - Chrysi Avgi in Greek - was a criminal group . Its leadership was found guilty of running it . They included Michaloliakos and six former MPs - Ilias Kasidiaris , Ioannis Lagos , Christos Pappas , Artemis Matthaiopoulos , Ilias Panagiotaros and Giorgos Germenis . The other ex - MPs were found guilty of joining a criminal organisation . The three judges , led by Maria Lepeniotou , were due to deliver sentencing later . As well as the fatal stabbing of Pavlos Fyssas , defendants in the trial were also convicted of other violent attacks on migrants and left-wing political opponents . Five Golden Dawn members were convicted of the attempted murders of Egyptian fishermen and four of the attempted murder of communist activists in the PAME union . In the courtroom By Dimitris Psarras , investigative journalist who has tracked Golden Dawn 's rise As the Golden Dawn leaders were convicted , very few inside the room applauded but outside thousands began to celebrate . I felt very satisfied , of course . Because I knew the facts revealed during those five and a half years , and I was always optimistic . From 2010 , Golden Dawn had managed to poison the Greek political system and democratic institutions , securing contacts with the army , the police , the judiciary and the Church . It is an excellent verdict . Who is their leader ? Nikos Michaloliakos founded the movement in the mid-1980s and was admirer of Nazism and a Holocaust denier , giving the Hitler salute at party rallies . But he had always denied any knowledge of the Pavlos Fyssas murder . When police raided his home in 2013 , they found weapons and ammunition . Golden Dawn officially denied being a neo -Nazi movement , but its badge closely resembled a swastika , some senior members praised Adolf Hitler , and the clothing of choice at anti-immigrant protests was black T-shirts and combat trousers . Witnesses told the trial that members were trained to handle weapons and used Nazi symbols . Last December , chief prosecutor Adamantia Economou prompted uproar , with a call for the party officials to be cleared , arguing there was no evidence they had any part in planning or carrying out the series of attacks . How has Greece reacted There has been disgust at Golden Dawn across the political spectrum in Greece . Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he would not normally comment on court decisions but said the Greek republic had first expelled Golden Dawn from parliament and now Greece 's independent judiciary had acted too . \" Democracy won today . It is up to us that it wins every day , \" he said . The verdict was praised as \" just \" and \" historic \" by Prokopis Pavlopoulos , who was president of Greece until earlier this year . Centre-left political leader Fofi Gennimata said the decision sent a strong message to Europe that \" fascism has no place in our lives \" . Nils Muiznieks of Amnesty International also said the trial sent a clear message : that \" violent and racist criminal activity - whether perpetrated by individuals on the street or members of parliament - will not go unpunished \" . Meanwhile , the Jewish cemetery in Athens was daubed this week with anti-Semitic graffiti and Nazi slogans , prompting condemnation from Greek ministers and the Jewish community .","annotations":[{"text":"Nikos Michaloliakos","span":[508,526],"token_span":[92,93],"role":"Killer","label":"Killer","role_definition":"The person or sentient entity that causes the death of the Victim."},{"text":"six colleagues","span":[532,545],"token_span":[95,96],"role":"Killer","label":"Killer","role_definition":"The person or sentient entity that causes the death of the Victim."},{"text":"Giorgos Roupakias","span":[1885,1901],"token_span":[339,340],"role":"Killer","label":"Killer","role_definition":"The person or sentient entity that causes the death of the Victim."},{"text":"migrants","span":[1852,1859],"token_span":[334,334],"role":"Victim","label":"Victim","role_definition":"The living entity that dies as a result of the killing."},{"text":"political opponents","span":[1828,1846],"token_span":[331,332],"role":"Victim","label":"Victim","role_definition":"The living entity that dies as a result of the killing."},{"text":"Pavlos Fyssas","span":[1949,1961],"token_span":[349,350],"role":"Victim","label":"Victim","role_definition":"The living entity that dies as a result of the killing."},{"text":"stabbed","span":[2007,2013],"token_span":[360,360],"role":"Means","label":"Means","role_definition":"The method or action that the Killer or Cause performs resulting in the death of the Victim."},{"text":"September 2013","span":[2029,2042],"token_span":[364,365],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The point or period of time within which the Victim is killed."},{"text":"Piraeus","span":[2018,2024],"token_span":[362,362],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the death took place."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-5110-450-frame-Legal_rulings","frame":"Legal_rulings","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Authority with the power to make decisions hands down a Finding over a question presented in a formal or informal Case.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":["Verdict"],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"After a six-lap on - track test session , which he was judged to have run at a sufficient pace later that day , and two medical consultations with Steve Olvey , CART 's director of medical affairs , he was permitted to drive in a protective hand brace and use a modified steering wheel .

But Rodriguez was killed on a road course , where speeds are much slower than on the high - speed ovals . And CART -- and the IRL and NASCAR -- are conscious of the ever-increasing speeds and work to harness it , partly for safety , partly so people can actually see the cars as they race . The track record at California Speedway , for instance , is 240.942 mph . Mauricio Gugelmin went that fast two years ago . After that , however , CART mandated the Handford Device to slow the champ cars on the high - speed tracks , the Michigan and California speedways . As a result , Scott Pruett , the fastest qualifier for Sunday 's race , reached only 235.398 . But the simple fact is , speed and racing are inseparable . In any race , from the three - legged race at the Cub Scout picnic to the Indianapolis 500 , the idea is to get to the end first . And to do that , you have to be the fastest .

In 1925 the American Council on Education called a conference of representatives of a number of its constituent members , among them the American Association of University Professors , for the purpose of formulating a shorter statement of principles on academic freedom and tenure . The statement formulated at this conference , known as the 1925 Conference Statement on Academic Freedom and Tenure , was endorsed by the Association of American Colleges ( now the American Association of Colleges and Universities ) in 1925 and by the American Association of University Professors in 1926 . In 1940 , following a series of joint conferences begun in 1934 , representatives of the American Association of University Professors and of the Association of American Colleges ( now the American Association of Colleges and Universities ) agreed upon a restatement of principles set forth in the 1925 Conference Statement on Academic Freedom and Tenure . This restatement is known to the profession as the 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure . Following extensive discussions on the 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure with leading educational associations and with individual faculty members and administrators , a joint committee of the AAUP and the Association of American Colleges met during 1969 to reevaluate this key policy statement . On the basis of the comments received , and the discussions that ensued , the joint committee felt the preferable approach was to formulate interpretations of the 1940 Statement from the experience gained in implementing and applying it for over thirty years and of adapting it to current needs . The committee submitted to the two associations for their consideration Interpretive Comments that are included below as footnotes to the 1940 Statement . 1 These interpretations were adopted by the Council of the American Association of University Professors in April 1970 and endorsed by the Fifty - Sixth Annual Meeting as Association Policy . The purpose of this statement is to promote public understanding and support of academic freedom and tenure and agreement upon procedures to ensure them in colleges and universities . Institutions of higher education are conducted for the common good and not to further the interest of either the individual teacher or the institution as a whole . 2 The common good depends upon the free search for truth and its free exposition . Academic freedom is essential to these purposes and applies to both teaching and research . Freedom in research is fundamental to the advancement of truth . Academic freedom in its teaching aspect is fundamental for the protection of the rights of the teacher in teaching and of the student to freedom in learning . It carries with it duties correlative with rights . 3 Tenure is a means to certain ends ; specifically : ( 1 ) freedom of teaching and research and of extramural activities , and ( 2 ) a sufficient degree of economic security to make the profession attractive to men and women of ability . Freedom and economic security , hence , tenure , are indispensable to the success of an institution in fulfilling its obligations to its students and to society . Academic Freedom - Teachers are entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results , subject to the adequate performance of their other academic duties ; but research for pecuniary return should be based upon an understanding with the authorities of the institution . - Teachers are entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing their subject , but they should be careful not to introduce into their teaching controversial matter which has no relation to their subject . 4 Limitations of academic freedom because of religious or other aims of the institution should be clearly stated in writing at the time of the appointment . 5 - College and university teachers are citizens , members of a learned profession , and officers of an educational institution . When they speak or write as citizens , they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline , but their special position in the community imposes special obligations . As scholars and educational officers , they should remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances . Hence they should at all times be accurate , should exercise appropriate restraint , should show respect for the opinions of others , and should make every effort to indicate that they are not speaking for the institution . 6 Academic Tenure After the expiration of a probationary period , teachers or investigators should have permanent or continuous tenure , and their service should be terminated only for adequate cause , except in the case of retirement for age , or under extraordinary circumstances because of financial exigencies . In the interpretation of this principle it is understood that the following represents acceptable academic practice : - The precise terms and conditions of every appointment should be stated in writing and be in the possession of both institution and teacher before the appointment is consummated . - Beginning with appointment to the rank of full - time instructor or a higher rank , 7 the probationary period should not exceed seven years , including within this period full - time service in all institutions of higher education ; but subject to the proviso that when , after a term of probationary service of more than three years in one or more institutions , a teacher is called to another institution , it may be agreed in writing that the new appointment is for a probationary period of not more than four years , even though thereby the person 's total probationary period in the academic profession is extended beyond the normal maximum of seven years . 8 Notice should be given at least one year prior to the expiration of the probationary period if the teacher is not to be continued in service after the expiration of that period . 9 - During the probationary period a teacher should have the academic freedom that all other members of the faculty have . 10 - Termination for cause of a continuous appointment , or the dismissal for cause of a teacher previous to the expiration of a term appointment , should , if possible , be considered by both a faculty committee and the governing board of the institution . In all cases where the facts are in dispute , the accused teacher should be informed before the hearing in writing of the charges and should have the opportunity to be heard in his or her own defense by all bodies that pass judgment upon the case . The teacher should be permitted to be accompanied by an advisor of his or her own choosing who may act as counsel . There should be a full stenographic record of the hearing available to the parties concerned . In the hearing of charges of incompetence the testimony should include that of teachers and other scholars , either from the teacher 's own or from other institutions . Teachers on continuous appointment who are dismissed for reasons not involving moral turpitude should receive their salaries for at least a year from the date of notification of dismissal whether or not they are continued in their duties at the institution . 11 - Termination of a continuous appointment because of financial exigency should be demonstrably bona fide . Endorsers The 1940 Statement of Principles has been endorsed by more than 250 scholarly and education groups . Endnotes : 1 . The Introduction to the Interpretive Comments notes : In the thirty years since their promulgation , the principles of the 1940 \u201c Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure \u201d have undergone a substantial amount of refinement . This has evolved through a variety of processes , including customary acceptance , understandings mutually arrived at between institutions and professors or their representatives , investigations and reports by the American Association of University Professors , and formulations of statements by that association either alone or in conjunction with the Association of American Colleges . These comments represent the attempt of the two associations , as the original sponsors of the 1940 \u201c Statement , \u201d to formulate the most important of these refinements . Their incorporation here as Interpretive Comments is based upon the premise that the 1940 \u201c Statement \u201d is not a static code but a fundamental document designed to set a framework of norms to guide adaptations to changing times and circumstances . Also , there have been relevant developments in the law itself reflecting a growing insistence by the courts on due process within the academic community which parallels the essential concepts of the 1940 \u201c Statement \u201d ; particularly relevant is the identification by the Supreme Court of academic freedom as a right protected by the First Amendment . As the Supreme Court said in Keyishian v. Board of Regents , 385 US 589 ( 1967 ) , \u201c Our Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom , which is of transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the teachers concerned . That freedom is therefore a special concern of the First Amendment , which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom . \u201d Back to text . 2 . The word \u201c teacher \u201d as used in this document is understood to include the investigator who is attached to an academic institution without teaching duties . Back to text . 3 . First 1970 comment : The Association of American Colleges and the American Association of University Professors have long recognized that membership in the academic profession carries with it special responsibilities . Both associations either separately or jointly have consistently affirmed these responsibilities in major policy statements , providing guidance to professors in their utterances as citizens , in the exercise of their responsibilities to the institution and to students , and in their conduct when resigning from their institution or when undertaking government - sponsored research . Of particular relevance is the \u201c Statement on Professional Ethics \u201d adopted in 1966 as Association policy ( AAUP , Policy Documents and Reports , 11th ed. [ Baltimore : Johns Hopkins University Press , 2015 ] , 145 \u2013 46 ) . Back to text . 4 . Second 1970 comment : The intent of this statement is not to discourage what is \u201c controversial . \u201d Controversy is at the heart of the free academic inquiry which the entire statement is designed to foster . The passage serves to underscore the need for teachers to avoid persistently intruding material which has no relation to their subject . Back to text . 5 . Third 1970 comment : Most church - related institutions no longer need or desire the departure from the principle of academic freedom implied in the 1940 \u201c Statement , \u201d and we do not now endorse such a departure . Back to text . 6 . Fourth 1970 comment : This paragraph is the subject of an interpretation adopted by the sponsors of the 1940 \u201c Statement \u201d immediately following its endorsement : If the administration of a college or university feels that a teacher has not observed the admonitions of paragraph 3 of the section on Academic Freedom and believes that the extramural utterances of the teacher have been such as to raise grave doubts concerning the teacher 's fitness for his or her position , it may proceed to file charges under paragraph 4 of the section on Academic Tenure . In pressing such charges , the administration should remember that teachers are citizens and should be accorded the freedom of citizens . In such cases the administration must assume full responsibility , and the American Association of University Professors and the Association of American Colleges are free to make an investigation . Paragraph 3 of the section on Academic Freedom in the 1940 \u201c Statement \u201d should also be interpreted in keeping with the 1964 \u201c Committee A Statement on Extramural Utterances , \u201d Policy Documents and Reports , 31 , which states inter alia : \u201c The controlling principle is that a faculty member 's expression of opinion as a citizen cannot constitute grounds for dismissal unless it clearly demonstrates the faculty member 's unfitness for his or her position . Extramural utterances rarely bear upon the faculty member 's fitness for the position . Moreover , a final decision should take into account the faculty member 's entire record as a teacher and scholar . \u201d Paragraph 5 of the \u201c Statement on Professional Ethics , \u201d Policy Documents and Reports , 146 , also addresses the nature of the \u201c special obligations \u201d of the teacher : As members of their community , professors have the rights and obligations of other citizens . Professors measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of their responsibilities to their subject , to their students , to their profession , and to their institution . When they speak or act as private persons , they avoid creating the impression of speaking or acting for their college or university . As citizens engaged in a profession that depends upon freedom for its health and integrity , professors have a particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom . Both the protection of academic freedom and the requirements of academic responsibility apply not only to the full - time probationary and the tenured teacher , but also to all others , such as part - time faculty and teaching assistants , who exercise teaching responsibilities . Back to text . 7 . Fifth 1970 comment : The concept of \u201c rank of full - time instructor or a higher rank \u201d is intended to include any person who teaches a full - time load regardless of the teacher 's specific title . [ For a discussion of this question , see the \u201c Report of the Special Committee on Academic Personnel Ineligible for Tenure , \u201d AAUP Bulletin 52 ( September 1966 ) : 280 \u2013 82 . ] Back to text . 8 . Sixth 1970 comment : In calling for an agreement \u201c in writing \u201d on the amount of credit given for a faculty member 's prior service at other institutions , the \u201c Statement \u201d furthers the general policy of full understanding by the professor of the terms and conditions of the appointment . It does not necessarily follow that a professor 's tenure rights have been violated because of the absence of a written agreement on this matter . Nonetheless , especially because of the variation in permissible institutional practices , a written understanding concerning these matters at the time of appointment is particularly appropriate and advantageous to both the individual and the institution . [ For a more detailed statement on this question , see \u201c On Crediting Prior Service Elsewhere as Part of the Probationary Period , \u201d Policy Documents and Reports , 167 \u2013 68 . ] Back to text . 9. Seventh 1970 comment : The effect of this subparagraph is that a decision on tenure , favorable or unfavorable , must be made at least twelve months prior to the completion of the probationary period . If the decision is negative , the appointment for the following year becomes a terminal one . If the decision is affirmative , the provisions in the 1940 \u201c Statement \u201d with respect to the termination of service of teachers or investigators after the expiration of a probationary period should apply from the date when the favorable decision is made . The general principle of notice contained in this paragraph is developed with greater specificity in the \u201c Standards for Notice of Nonreappointment , \u201d endorsed by the Fiftieth Annual Meeting of the American Association of University Professors ( 1964 ) ( Policy Documents and Reports , 99 ) . These standards are : Notice of nonreappointment , or of intention not to recommend reappointment to the governing board , should be given in writing in accordance with the following standards : 1 . Not later than March 1 of the first academic year of service , if the appointment expires at the end of that year ; or , if a one - year appointment terminates during an academic year , at least three months in advance of its termination . 2 . Not later than December 15 of the second academic year of service , if the appointment expires at the end of that year ; or , if an initial two - year appointment terminates during an academic year , at least six months in advance of its termination . 3 . At least twelve months before the expiration of an appointment after two or more years in the institution . Other obligations , both of institutions and of individuals , are described in the \u201c Statement on Recruitment and Resignation of Faculty Members , \u201d Policy Documents and Reports , 153 \u2013 54 , as endorsed by the Association of American Colleges and the American Association of University Professors in 1961 . Back to text . 10 . Eighth 1970 comment : The freedom of probationary teachers is enhanced by the establishment of a regular procedure for the periodic evaluation and assessment of the teacher 's academic performance during probationary status . Provision should be made for regularized procedures for the consideration of complaints by probationary teachers that their academic freedom has been violated . One suggested procedure to serve these purposes is contained in the \u201c Recommended Institutional Regulations on Academic Freedom and Tenure , \u201d Policy Documents and Reports , 79 \u2013 90 , prepared by the American Association of University Professors . Back to text . 11 . Ninth 1970 comment : A further specification of the academic due process to which the teacher is entitled under this paragraph is contained in the \u201c Statement on Procedural Standards in Faculty Dismissal Proceedings , \u201d Policy Documents and Reports , 91 \u2013 93 , jointly approved by the American Association of University Professors and the Association of American Colleges in 1958 . This interpretive document deals with the issue of suspension , about which the 1940 \u201c Statement \u201d is silent . The \u201c Statement on Procedural Standards in Faculty Dismissal Proceedings \u201d provides : \u201c Suspension of the faculty member during the proceedings is justified only if immediate harm to the faculty member or others is threatened by the faculty member 's continuance . Unless legal considerations forbid , any such suspension should be with pay . \u201d A suspension which is not followed by either reinstatement or the opportunity for a hearing is in effect a summary dismissal in violation of academic due process . The concept of \u201c moral turpitude \u201d identifies the exceptional case in which the professor may be denied a year 's teaching or pay in whole or in part . The statement applies to that kind of behavior which goes beyond simply warranting discharge and is so utterly blameworthy as to make it inappropriate to require the offering of a year 's teaching or pay . The standard is not that the moral sensibilities of persons in the particular community have been affronted . The standard is behavior that would evoke condemnation by the academic community generally .

In all cases where the facts are in dispute , the accused teacher should be informed before the hearing in writing of the charges and should have the opportunity to be heard in his or her own defense by all bodies that pass judgment upon the case . The teacher should be permitted to be accompanied by an advisor of his or her own choosing who may act as counsel . There should be a full stenographic record of the hearing available to the parties concerned . In the hearing of charges of incompetence the testimony should include that of teachers and other scholars , either from the teacher 's own or from other institutions . Teachers on continuous appointment who are dismissed for reasons not involving moral turpitude should receive their salaries for at least a year from the date of notification of dismissal whether or not they are continued in their duties at the institution . 11 - Termination of a continuous appointment because of financial exigency should be demonstrably bona fide . Endorsers The 1940 Statement of Principles has been endorsed by more than 250 scholarly and education groups . Endnotes : 1 . The Introduction to the Interpretive Comments notes : In the thirty years since their promulgation , the principles of the 1940 \u201c Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure \u201d have undergone a substantial amount of refinement . This has evolved through a variety of processes , including customary acceptance , understandings mutually arrived at between institutions and professors or their representatives , investigations and reports by the American Association of University Professors , and formulations of statements by that association either alone or in conjunction with the Association of American Colleges . These comments represent the attempt of the two associations , as the original sponsors of the 1940 \u201c Statement , \u201d to formulate the most important of these refinements . Their incorporation here as Interpretive Comments is based upon the premise that the 1940 \u201c Statement \u201d is not a static code but a fundamental document designed to set a framework of norms to guide adaptations to changing times and circumstances . Also , there have been relevant developments in the law itself reflecting a growing insistence by the courts on due process within the academic community which parallels the essential concepts of the 1940 \u201c Statement \u201d ; particularly relevant is the identification by the Supreme Court of academic freedom as a right protected by the First Amendment . As the Supreme Court said in Keyishian v. Board of Regents , 385 US 589 ( 1967 ) , \u201c Our Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom , which is of transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the teachers concerned . That freedom is therefore a special concern of the First Amendment , which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom . \u201d Back to text . 2 . The word \u201c teacher \u201d as used in this document is understood to include the investigator who is attached to an academic institution without teaching duties . Back to text . 3 . First 1970 comment : The Association of American Colleges and the American Association of University Professors have long recognized that membership in the academic profession carries with it special responsibilities . Both associations either separately or jointly have consistently affirmed these responsibilities in major policy statements , providing guidance to professors in their utterances as citizens , in the exercise of their responsibilities to the institution and to students , and in their conduct when resigning from their institution or when undertaking government - sponsored research . Of particular relevance is the \u201c Statement on Professional Ethics \u201d adopted in 1966 as Association policy ( AAUP , Policy Documents and Reports , 11th ed. [ Baltimore : Johns Hopkins University Press , 2015 ] , 145 \u2013 46 ) . Back to text . 4 . Second 1970 comment : The intent of this statement is not to discourage what is \u201c controversial . \u201d Controversy is at the heart of the free academic inquiry which the entire statement is designed to foster . The passage serves to underscore the need for teachers to avoid persistently intruding material which has no relation to their subject . Back to text . 5 . Third 1970 comment : Most church - related institutions no longer need or desire the departure from the principle of academic freedom implied in the 1940 \u201c Statement , \u201d and we do not now endorse such a departure . Back to text . 6 . Fourth 1970 comment : This paragraph is the subject of an interpretation adopted by the sponsors of the 1940 \u201c Statement \u201d immediately following its endorsement : If the administration of a college or university feels that a teacher has not observed the admonitions of paragraph 3 of the section on Academic Freedom and believes that the extramural utterances of the teacher have been such as to raise grave doubts concerning the teacher 's fitness for his or her position , it may proceed to file charges under paragraph 4 of the section on Academic Tenure . In pressing such charges , the administration should remember that teachers are citizens and should be accorded the freedom of citizens . In such cases the administration must assume full responsibility , and the American Association of University Professors and the Association of American Colleges are free to make an investigation . Paragraph 3 of the section on Academic Freedom in the 1940 \u201c Statement \u201d should also be interpreted in keeping with the 1964 \u201c Committee A Statement on Extramural Utterances , \u201d Policy Documents and Reports , 31 , which states inter alia : \u201c The controlling principle is that a faculty member 's expression of opinion as a citizen cannot constitute grounds for dismissal unless it clearly demonstrates the faculty member 's unfitness for his or her position . Extramural utterances rarely bear upon the faculty member 's fitness for the position . Moreover , a final decision should take into account the faculty member 's entire record as a teacher and scholar . \u201d Paragraph 5 of the \u201c Statement on Professional Ethics , \u201d Policy Documents and Reports , 146 , also addresses the nature of the \u201c special obligations \u201d of the teacher : As members of their community , professors have the rights and obligations of other citizens . Professors measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of their responsibilities to their subject , to their students , to their profession , and to their institution . When they speak or act as private persons , they avoid creating the impression of speaking or acting for their college or university . As citizens engaged in a profession that depends upon freedom for its health and integrity , professors have a particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom . Both the protection of academic freedom and the requirements of academic responsibility apply not only to the full - time probationary and the tenured teacher , but also to all others , such as part - time faculty and teaching assistants , who exercise teaching responsibilities . Back to text . 7 . Fifth 1970 comment : The concept of \u201c rank of full - time instructor or a higher rank \u201d is intended to include any person who teaches a full - time load regardless of the teacher 's specific title . [ For a discussion of this question , see the \u201c Report of the Special Committee on Academic Personnel Ineligible for Tenure , \u201d AAUP Bulletin 52 ( September 1966 ) : 280 \u2013 82 . ] Back to text . 8 . Sixth 1970 comment : In calling for an agreement \u201c in writing \u201d on the amount of credit given for a faculty member 's prior service at other institutions , the \u201c Statement \u201d furthers the general policy of full understanding by the professor of the terms and conditions of the appointment . It does not necessarily follow that a professor 's tenure rights have been violated because of the absence of a written agreement on this matter . Nonetheless , especially because of the variation in permissible institutional practices , a written understanding concerning these matters at the time of appointment is particularly appropriate and advantageous to both the individual and the institution . [ For a more detailed statement on this question , see \u201c On Crediting Prior Service Elsewhere as Part of the Probationary Period , \u201d Policy Documents and Reports , 167 \u2013 68 . ] Back to text . 9. Seventh 1970 comment : The effect of this subparagraph is that a decision on tenure , favorable or unfavorable , must be made at least twelve months prior to the completion of the probationary period . If the decision is negative , the appointment for the following year becomes a terminal one . If the decision is affirmative , the provisions in the 1940 \u201c Statement \u201d with respect to the termination of service of teachers or investigators after the expiration of a probationary period should apply from the date when the favorable decision is made . The general principle of notice contained in this paragraph is developed with greater specificity in the \u201c Standards for Notice of Nonreappointment , \u201d endorsed by the Fiftieth Annual Meeting of the American Association of University Professors ( 1964 ) ( Policy Documents and Reports , 99 ) . These standards are : Notice of nonreappointment , or of intention not to recommend reappointment to the governing board , should be given in writing in accordance with the following standards : 1 . Not later than March 1 of the first academic year of service , if the appointment expires at the end of that year ; or , if a one - year appointment terminates during an academic year , at least three months in advance of its termination . 2 . Not later than December 15 of the second academic year of service , if the appointment expires at the end of that year ; or , if an initial two - year appointment terminates during an academic year , at least six months in advance of its termination . 3 . At least twelve months before the expiration of an appointment after two or more years in the institution . Other obligations , both of institutions and of individuals , are described in the \u201c Statement on Recruitment and Resignation of Faculty Members , \u201d Policy Documents and Reports , 153 \u2013 54 , as endorsed by the Association of American Colleges and the American Association of University Professors in 1961 . Back to text . 10 . Eighth 1970 comment : The freedom of probationary teachers is enhanced by the establishment of a regular procedure for the periodic evaluation and assessment of the teacher 's academic performance during probationary status . Provision should be made for regularized procedures for the consideration of complaints by probationary teachers that their academic freedom has been violated . One suggested procedure to serve these purposes is contained in the \u201c Recommended Institutional Regulations on Academic Freedom and Tenure , \u201d Policy Documents and Reports , 79 \u2013 90 , prepared by the American Association of University Professors . Back to text . 11 . Ninth 1970 comment : A further specification of the academic due process to which the teacher is entitled under this paragraph is contained in the \u201c Statement on Procedural Standards in Faculty Dismissal Proceedings , \u201d Policy Documents and Reports , 91 \u2013 93 , jointly approved by the American Association of University Professors and the Association of American Colleges in 1958 . This interpretive document deals with the issue of suspension , about which the 1940 \u201c Statement \u201d is silent . The \u201c Statement on Procedural Standards in Faculty Dismissal Proceedings \u201d provides : \u201c Suspension of the faculty member during the proceedings is justified only if immediate harm to the faculty member or others is threatened by the faculty member 's continuance . Unless legal considerations forbid , any such suspension should be with pay . \u201d A suspension which is not followed by either reinstatement or the opportunity for a hearing is in effect a summary dismissal in violation of academic due process . The concept of \u201c moral turpitude \u201d identifies the exceptional case in which the professor may be denied a year 's teaching or pay in whole or in part . The statement applies to that kind of behavior which goes beyond simply warranting discharge and is so utterly blameworthy as to make it inappropriate to require the offering of a year 's teaching or pay . The standard is not that the moral sensibilities of persons in the particular community have been affronted . The standard is behavior that would evoke condemnation by the academic community generally .

Wendy Alec told viewers last week that her husband Rory now lives on a farm in South Africa with a divorced jazz musician . She said the woman \u201c had an audible voice from God that Rory was the man of her life\u00e2 and that \u201c the \u201c devil got in very , very easily \u201d to destroy her marriage . The Alecs , South Africans who were married 27 years ago , launched God TV in London in 1995 . Its main studio is in Jerusalem , \u201c where it hosts events that are attended by leading Israeli officials , \u201d according to the Daily Telegraph . \u201c It employs more that 100 people at a headquarters and studios in Plymouth . \u201d God TV has broadcast from Israel since 2001 , carrying a mix of programming involving various Christian leaders , live broadcasts , and satellite link -ups . It is available around the world , including on the US DirecTV satellite platform and Britain 's SKY .

Desert Locust-Schistocerca gregaria| The life cycle comprises three stages : egg , hopper , adult ( Fig. 12 ) . The time spent in each stage varies considerably depending on the weather . This is discussed in more detail in the the section on seasonal movements and breeding areas ( page 36 ) . Immature adults Immature adults are usually pink , lighter or darker according to whether the locusts have been bred under high or low temperatures . The bright pink may change to a brownish red if the locusts have spent more than two months in this immature stage . Maturation Desert Locusts may become sexually mature in a few weeks or a few months , according to environmental circumstances . In unfavourable weather and food conditions , as for instance when they are subjected to low temperatures and drought , maturation may take as long as six months . If they have the right kind of food and weather , maturation can take place rapidly in 2 - 4 weeks . The exact conditions that cause locusts to mature are not known but the process is usually associated with the start of the rainy season . Male locusts start to mature first and then give off from their skin a chemical substance the odour of which causes maturation to start in females , and also in any males in which it has not already begun . The beginning of maturation can be recognised by the disappearance of the pink colour from the hind tibia . At this stage yolk is deposited in the eggs . It is at this stage that the eggs present in the female locusts begin to accumulate yolk and as they grow to full size over the next week the abdomens of the females become distended . Mature adults The mature adult is yellow , the males being a brighter yellow than the females . The ovaries of the female locusts contain eggs which can easily be seen if the abdomen is pulled away from the thorax . At this stage large swarms break up into smaller ones , as those locusts that mature first settle on the ground for breeding , while those not yet quite mature fly on . Copulation This is the mating act . The male jumps on the back of the female and holds on to her with the front pair of legs ( Fig. 13 ) . The tips of their abdomens come into contact and the male sex cells ( spermatozoa ) are passed into the body of the female where they fertilise the eggs . The time spent in copulation varies from 3 to 14 h. Several females can be fertilised by one male and the spermatozoa can be stored inside the female 's body and used to fertilise more than one set of eggs . Sometimes there are many more males than females in a mature swarm and then fighting occurs amongst the males for possession of females . Laying and eggs When copulation ends the males usually remain for some time on the backs of the females . The females become restless and walk about carrying the males . They begin to select a suitable place to lay their eggs by probing and testing the soil with the tip of the abdomen . During this probing they can detect warmth , hardness , moisture and salinity ( salt content ) of the soil . They are also attracted to each other at this time , assembling together in groups . Selection of laying places then depends partly on the soil conditions and vegetation and partly on the presence of other locusts . Laying can occur at all times of day and night provided that the soil surface does not become too hot or too cold , and that the soil is moist , at least below the surface . Laying can also occur in a wide range of soil types varying from quite coarse sand to silty clays , but the female must be able to dig into the soil with the extremity of her abdomen . Generally the top layer , about 6 cm deep , is dry , and there is a layer of damp soil below . This must be sufficiently deep to take all the eggs , that is , about 4 cm . When a suitable place is found the female pushes the ovipositor into the soil and makes a hole . The abdomen stretches to about twice its normal length and the eggs are laid ( Fig. 14 ) . The whole process of probing , digging and laying takes 1.5 - 2 h. A copulating and laying swarm usually stays in the same area for 1 - 2 days . Sometimes copulation occurs with females which appear not to be fully mature , that is , females in which the eggs are not fully developed . Mature female locusts often dig holes without laying eggs in them , even though the soil conditions appear to be suitable . The reasons for this behaviour are not known . On occasions females have been seen to lay eggs on the surface of the ground or on trees . This is usually because the soil is too hard and dry . Once eggs are fully developed inside the female she can only keep them for about 3 days ; then they must be laid whether suitable soil is available or not . Eggs laid on the soil surface or on trees do not hatch . Abnormal laying of this kind , especially when on a large scale , constitutes important information and should be either mentioned in the routine locust reports , or reported separately . Female locusts lay many eggs at a time and these are bound together by a frothy secretion which forms them into an egg pod ( Fig. 15 ) . The egg pod is 3 - 4 cm long , the bottom being usually about 10 cm down in the soil . On top of the eggs the frothy substance hardens to form a plug which extends almost to the surface of the soil . The plug helps to prevent the eggs drying and it also provides a medium through which the young hoppers can easily reach the surface when they hatch . Egg pods are nearly always laid in groups , which may be either large or small . It is useful to record the maximum density in one square foot . The area over which egg pods are laid , which varies from a few square metres to a square kilometre or more , is called an egg field . The number of eggs in a pod can vary from about 20 to over 100 but the number for swarming locusts is usually between 70 and 80 for the first laying , between 60 and 70 for the second laying and less than 50 for the third laying , if it occurs . It is noteworthy that the egg pods of locusts not in swarms usually contain many more eggs than pods laid by swarming locusts . Three is probably the maximum number of egg pods laid by swarming locusts in the field , but those kept in laboratories can lay many more . There is some evidence that in the field non-swarming locusts lay more pods than swarming ones , about five on average . When the eggs are laid they are yellow in colour but in the soil they turn brown . They absorb water from the soil , about their own weight of water in the first five days if it is available at the time , and this is enough to allow them to develop successfully . Research has shown that 20 mm of water is sufficient . If they do not get this quantity of water they will not hatch . If , however , there is not sufficient water in the soil during the first few days , they can absorb as much as the supply permits and then wait for several days before taking in the remainder , after more rain has fallen . It is not possible for Desert Locust eggs to stay dry in the ground from one rainy season to the next and then hatch when the rain comes . Incubation period and hatching The period of egg development , between laying and hatching , is called the incubation period . The rate at which eggs develop varies according to the soil temperature . For example , in the summer breeding areas of West Africa , the Red Sea coast and lowland India the incubation period takes 10 - 14 days but this is extended to 25 - 30 days in the cooler spring breeding areas of central Arabia , southern Iran and Pakistan while in North Africa it can take as long as 70 days in exceptionally cold weather . More detailed information can be found in the section on seasonal movements and breeding areas ( Page 36 ) . When they are fully developed in the eggs , the young hoppers burst their way out of the egg shells , wriggle up the froth tube to the surface , and immediately shed a thin white skin . These white skins are easily visible on the surface of the soil and are an indication that hatching has recently taken place . They are , however , soon blown away by the wind . Hatching takes place either shortly before or within 3 h of sunrise , and all the hoppers from one egg pod normally hatch on the same morning . It usually takes three days for the complete hatching of a whole egg field but longer periods have been recorded . Only a few hoppers hatch on the first of these days , most on the second and a few more on the third . Hoppers When hatching is complete , some small and some larger groups of hoppers will be noticed all over the egg field . Sometimes there is very little movement of hoppers on the first day of hatching but after a day or two the groups of hoppers will have joined together to form larger groups which move about ; these are called bands . Moulting By the time they are a day old the hoppers have started to feed . Their skin is hard and tough by now and will only stretch a little . They therefore have to grow by casting off their skins from time to time . This process is called moulting . When the hopper sheds its old skin it has a new , soft skin underneath . This stretches for a short time , allowing the hopper to grow , before it hardens . Moulting usually occurs five times during the development of the Desert Locust ( apart from the skin-shedding that occurs at hatching ) . Instars The hopper stage of the life cycle is thus divided into five instars . ( Hoppers are sometimes called nymphs and the hopper instars are then called nymphal instars . The word ' stage ' is occasionally used instead of ' instar ' in locust reports , e.g. ' fifth - stage hoppers ' ; it should , however , be restricted to the three main stages of the life cycle , egg , hopper and adult . ) Figures 16 - 22 show the distinctions between the different instars of the Desert Locust . The first instar is whitish in colour when newly hatched but in 1 - 2 h turns mainly black . As it grows bigger and becomes ready for moulting a pale colour pattern becomes more obvious . It is not always easy to distinguish the second instar from the first but with experience one recognises that the pale colour pattern is more obvious and that the head is much larger . It is easily distinguished from the third instar because there is no sign yet of wing growth . The third instar is easily recognised by the two pairs of wing ' buds ' which can be seen projecting from underneath the pronotum on each side of the thorax . The colour now is conspicuously black and yellow , more black in cold conditions and less black in hot . The wing buds are larger and more obvious but they are still shorter than the length of the pronotum measured along the middle line . The colour of the fifth instar is bright yellow with a black pattern , again varying with temperature . Wing buds are now longer than the pronotum , but still cannot be used for flight . Fledging The final moult is from the fifth-instar hopper to the adult stage . This change is called fledging and the young adult is called a fledgling . After this there is no further moulting and the adult locust cannot grow in size but gradually increases in weight . Notice the thin bent wings hanging down ; later they will be pumped full of blood and take up their final shape . The fledgling is pink and the wings , head and body are relatively soft . Activity is limited to walking and short descending flights . Fledglings gradually become hard and able to fly strongly . Locusts in this condition are called immature adults . Duration of life cycle The length of life of individual adults varies . Some have been kept alive in cages for over a year , but in the field they probably live between 2.5 and 5 months . Apart from accidental death the life span depends on how long they take to become sexually mature . The quicker they mature the shorter the total length of life . Phase Desert Locusts can exist as scattered individuals within the recession area or , when numerous , as swarms throughout the invasion area . This is because the locust exists in different phases . When breeding conditions lead to an increase in the numbers of locusts crowded together the insects have the ability to change their colour , behaviour , shape and physiology . Not all these characteristics change at once ; behaviour and colour being the characteristics to change first . Colour An adult in the solitary phase is likely to be pale grey or beige when immature , with the males becoming pale yellow on maturation . In contrast , an adult from the swarming ( gregarious ) phase will be bright pink when immature and bright yellow when mature . Behaviour Solitary locusts live separately , the hoppers do not move together and the adults usually fly individually at night . They are often difficult to see and their colours blend with their surroundings . Gregarious hoppers move in marching bands and have distinctive black markings . The brightly coloured adults move together in cohesive day-flying swarms . In between the two extremes are locusts exhibiting some characteristics of solitary locusts and some gregarious ones ; such locusts are referred to as transient locusts . Shape Scientists have tried to describe the changes in shape which occur by measuring parts of the locust ( Fig. 8 ) . For example , if the length of the front wing or elytron ( E ) is divided by the length of the femur ( F ) of the hind leg the resulting ratio is greater in the case of locusts taken from a swarm than for those locusts living alone . These measurements are called morphometrics . Changes in the shape of the pronotum and sternum of the Desert Locust are shown in Fig. 24 . Unfortunately it is necessary to introduce a note of warning at this point . Morphometric studies do not always give a completely reliable indication of the behaviour phase . One reason is that changes in behaviour and appearance do not always occur at the same rate . In the Desert Locust for example , some swarms comprise locusts whose morphometrics are the same as those of solitary - living ones . The environmental conditions during the development of the hopper can affect the morphometrics of the adults . Nevertheless , it is safe to state , as a general rule , that locusts taken from swarms will have a certain appearance ( and certain morphometrics ) , whilst those of the same species taken from an area where there have been no swarms for several months will have a different appearance ( and different morphometrics ) . Physiology Solitary locusts lay pods containing 95 - 158 eggs each . In the laboratory they have been known to lay more than three pods ; gregarious females lay pods usually containing less than 80 eggs and laying occurs twice , rarely three times . Hoppers in the solitary phase usually develop through six instars before fledging , each moult is indicated by a marked stripe on the eye ( total 7 ) . Gregarious hoppers invariably fledge after five instars and have a total of six eye stripes although sometimes the eye can be a uniform dark brown .","annotations":[{"text":"on the ground","span":[1981,1993],"token_span":[370,372],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The spatial setting in which the manipulation takes place."},{"text":"The male","span":[2088,2095],"token_span":[392,393],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent manipulates an object.

For example , in the summer breeding areas of West Africa , the Red Sea coast and lowland India the incubation period takes 10 - 14 days but this is extended to 25 - 30 days in the cooler spring breeding areas of central Arabia , southern Iran and Pakistan while in North Africa it can take as long as 70 days in exceptionally cold weather . More detailed information can be found in the section on seasonal movements and breeding areas ( Page 36 ) . When they are fully developed in the eggs , the young hoppers burst their way out of the egg shells , wriggle up the froth tube to the surface , and immediately shed a thin white skin . These white skins are easily visible on the surface of the soil and are an indication that hatching has recently taken place . They are , however , soon blown away by the wind . Hatching takes place either shortly before or within 3 h of sunrise , and all the hoppers from one egg pod normally hatch on the same morning . It usually takes three days for the complete hatching of a whole egg field but longer periods have been recorded . Only a few hoppers hatch on the first of these days , most on the second and a few more on the third . Hoppers When hatching is complete , some small and some larger groups of hoppers will be noticed all over the egg field . Sometimes there is very little movement of hoppers on the first day of hatching but after a day or two the groups of hoppers will have joined together to form larger groups which move about ; these are called bands . Moulting By the time they are a day old the hoppers have started to feed . Their skin is hard and tough by now and will only stretch a little . They therefore have to grow by casting off their skins from time to time . This process is called moulting . When the hopper sheds its old skin it has a new , soft skin underneath . This stretches for a short time , allowing the hopper to grow , before it hardens . Moulting usually occurs five times during the development of the Desert Locust ( apart from the skin-shedding that occurs at hatching ) . Instars The hopper stage of the life cycle is thus divided into five instars . ( Hoppers are sometimes called nymphs and the hopper instars are then called nymphal instars . The word ' stage ' is occasionally used instead of ' instar ' in locust reports , e.g. ' fifth - stage hoppers ' ; it should , however , be restricted to the three main stages of the life cycle , egg , hopper and adult . ) Figures 16 - 22 show the distinctions between the different instars of the Desert Locust . The first instar is whitish in colour when newly hatched but in 1 - 2 h turns mainly black . As it grows bigger and becomes ready for moulting a pale colour pattern becomes more obvious . It is not always easy to distinguish the second instar from the first but with experience one recognises that the pale colour pattern is more obvious and that the head is much larger . It is easily distinguished from the third instar because there is no sign yet of wing growth . The third instar is easily recognised by the two pairs of wing ' buds ' which can be seen projecting from underneath the pronotum on each side of the thorax . The colour now is conspicuously black and yellow , more black in cold conditions and less black in hot . The wing buds are larger and more obvious but they are still shorter than the length of the pronotum measured along the middle line . The colour of the fifth instar is bright yellow with a black pattern , again varying with temperature . Wing buds are now longer than the pronotum , but still cannot be used for flight . Fledging The final moult is from the fifth-instar hopper to the adult stage . This change is called fledging and the young adult is called a fledgling . After this there is no further moulting and the adult locust cannot grow in size but gradually increases in weight . Notice the thin bent wings hanging down ; later they will be pumped full of blood and take up their final shape . The fledgling is pink and the wings , head and body are relatively soft . Activity is limited to walking and short descending flights . Fledglings gradually become hard and able to fly strongly . Locusts in this condition are called immature adults . Duration of life cycle The length of life of individual adults varies . Some have been kept alive in cages for over a year , but in the field they probably live between 2.5 and 5 months . Apart from accidental death the life span depends on how long they take to become sexually mature . The quicker they mature the shorter the total length of life . Phase Desert Locusts can exist as scattered individuals within the recession area or , when numerous , as swarms throughout the invasion area . This is because the locust exists in different phases . When breeding conditions lead to an increase in the numbers of locusts crowded together the insects have the ability to change their colour , behaviour , shape and physiology . Not all these characteristics change at once ; behaviour and colour being the characteristics to change first . Colour An adult in the solitary phase is likely to be pale grey or beige when immature , with the males becoming pale yellow on maturation . In contrast , an adult from the swarming ( gregarious ) phase will be bright pink when immature and bright yellow when mature . Behaviour Solitary locusts live separately , the hoppers do not move together and the adults usually fly individually at night . They are often difficult to see and their colours blend with their surroundings . Gregarious hoppers move in marching bands and have distinctive black markings . The brightly coloured adults move together in cohesive day-flying swarms . In between the two extremes are locusts exhibiting some characteristics of solitary locusts and some gregarious ones ; such locusts are referred to as transient locusts . Shape Scientists have tried to describe the changes in shape which occur by measuring parts of the locust ( Fig. 8 ) . For example , if the length of the front wing or elytron ( E ) is divided by the length of the femur ( F ) of the hind leg the resulting ratio is greater in the case of locusts taken from a swarm than for those locusts living alone . These measurements are called morphometrics . Changes in the shape of the pronotum and sternum of the Desert Locust are shown in Fig. 24 . Unfortunately it is necessary to introduce a note of warning at this point . Morphometric studies do not always give a completely reliable indication of the behaviour phase . One reason is that changes in behaviour and appearance do not always occur at the same rate . In the Desert Locust for example , some swarms comprise locusts whose morphometrics are the same as those of solitary - living ones . The environmental conditions during the development of the hopper can affect the morphometrics of the adults . Nevertheless , it is safe to state , as a general rule , that locusts taken from swarms will have a certain appearance ( and certain morphometrics ) , whilst those of the same species taken from an area where there have been no swarms for several months will have a different appearance ( and different morphometrics ) . Physiology Solitary locusts lay pods containing 95 - 158 eggs each . In the laboratory they have been known to lay more than three pods ; gregarious females lay pods usually containing less than 80 eggs and laying occurs twice , rarely three times . Hoppers in the solitary phase usually develop through six instars before fledging , each moult is indicated by a marked stripe on the eye ( total 7 ) . Gregarious hoppers invariably fledge after five instars and have a total of six eye stripes although sometimes the eye can be a uniform dark brown .","annotations":[{"text":"The male","span":[2088,2095],"token_span":[392,393],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent manipulates an object.

The memo reveals : - The number of refugees was unprecedented - Some refugees were ' demanding ' - Local authorities butted heads with the Department of Defence - Some refugees thought they were going on ' holiday ' The document details how refugees were put up in more and more army camps as the \u201c refugee problem \u201d grew . \u201c Streaming \u201d over the border The memo states that the problem \u201c erupted \u201d when refugees \u201c streamed over the border \u201d from the North in August 1969 . It was decided that the army authorities would house and feed all refugees in two camps , Gormanston and Finner , and other centres would be opened in necessary . The Irish Red Cross was charged with collecting money and relief supplies for the refugees . It also supplied them with pocket money and gave them food , clothing , washing machines , first aid , organised school buses , brought patients to hospital and more . The Red Cross paid for all the transport and the free travel vouchers people were given to return to their homes . Counties \u201c convenient to the border \u201d were alerted to the possibility that if large numbers of refugees continued to arrive , local authorities would have to get involved . \u201c Ominous numbers \u201d of refugees Then in the summer of 1970 , more refugees arrived . While 720 arrived in 1969 , the peak figure in 1970 was 1,558 . In July 1971 , refugees arrived \u201c in somewhat ominous numbers \u201d , but by the second week of August 1971 , they began to arrive in \u201c unprecedented numbers \u201d and the capacity of army refugee centres at Gormanston , Finner , Kilworth , Coolmoney , Kildare , Kilkenny , Waterford , and Tralee were soon greatly exceeded . The Minister had to call on the local authorities for help , and communities and religious leaders put their facilities and services at the refugees ' disposal . - Six hundred refugees were even accommodated for a short time at the training depot in Templemore by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na . - At its peak , 1,695 people were being catered for by the Army , and 2,714 outside of army centres . It was even allowed that civil servants who were members of organisations like the Civil Defence and Irish Red Cross could be granted special leave to give their time voluntarily to help . Local authorities asked to step in Then , in 1972 , it was decided \u201c for military reasons \u201d that the army would not be asked to look after any future refugees , so local authorities were asked to make contingency plans . \u201c Every Local Authority was expected to take a quota of refugees , \u201d says the memo . The Health Boards were asked to help , and the responsibility for general direction and co-ordination of the refugees rested with the Department of Defence 's Civil Defence Branch . The Vote for Defence bore any costs , except transport and \u201c comforts \u201d , which the Irish Red Cross looked after . Nearly 10,000 refugees in 1972 In 1972 , more refugees arrived , and the number did n't go below the 2000 mark until August of that year . \u201c Approximately 9,800 refugees in all were handled during the months of July and August 1972 , \u201d says the memo . The operation was a major one , but was \u201c accomplished with considerable smoothness \u201d . Each year 's influx of refugees brought \u201c with it a number of social problems cases who would be misfits no matter where they were \u201d , says the memo . Another difficulty was \u201c casual people \u201d arriving and declaring themselves refugees . The memo warns that \u201c many who have no good reason to leave their homes in the North inevitably do \u201d . It also says that as long as there was unrest , there was the possibility of refugees . \u201c Ungrateful \u201d refugees The memo notes that the first refugees , from 1969 \u2013 1971 , came due to fears about their personal safety : most of them came on the spur of the moment and in great haste , bringing with them only what they wore . By 1972 , this had changed . \u201c The refugees on this occasion had obviously made preparations in advance for a holiday in the South , \u201d says the memo , adding most of the children had swimming gear , tennis racquets and fishing rods in their possession . It describes how in Waterford , one group reported they were not actually refugees but \u201c had understood that they were being sent down on a holiday to hotels , private houses , etc \u201d \u2013 and there were similar stories coming from Cork and Dublin . It was reported that groups were collecting money for thes \u201c holidays \u201d . There were worries this situation could be \u201c exploited by extremists \u201d or unscrupulous people . Refugees are not always just frightened people who are thankful for the assistance being given them . Some of them can be very demanding and ungrateful , even obstreperous and fractious \u2013 as well as , particularly in the case of teenage boys , destructive . But irrespective of their attitudes , government policy \u201c has been interpreted \u2026 as requiring that they should all be accepted without question and treated to the best of our ability as groups of Irish people in need of help at a very difficult time \u201d . It also notes that due to the \u201c holiday \u201d reports , \u201c the reality of the need of the refugees for a respite from the unnerving atmosphere of the North was not always fully appreciated locally \u201d . The memo details fears that there could be a \u201c major crisis situation arising at any time of the year involving numbers of refugees vastly in excess of anything experienced hitherto \u201d . This situation could even lead to closing all boarding ( and perhaps other ) schools \u2013 it was discussed that powers of compulsory acquisition of accommodation on a temporary basis might become essential . The Minister for Defence drafted a general scheme of a bill to enable legislation to be drafted and held , in case the temporary acquisition of accommodation for refugees was needed . With no legal onus on local authorities to look after refugees , it was \u201c only by the exercise of much persuasion and tact on the part of the Civil Defence controlling staff in the Department of Defence that all County Managers were eventually prevailed upon to undertake responsibility for the accommodation and care of Northern refugees \u201d . \u201c They appear to convey the impression that they are being unduly imposed upon in this matter \u201d , says the document . But the Minister for Defence felt that if any special legislation in relation to Northern refugees was introduced , it should also provide for the imposition on Local Authorities the duty to provide for their accommodation , maintenance and welfare .

By 1972 , this had changed . \u201c The refugees on this occasion had obviously made preparations in advance for a holiday in the South , \u201d says the memo , adding most of the children had swimming gear , tennis racquets and fishing rods in their possession . It describes how in Waterford , one group reported they were not actually refugees but \u201c had understood that they were being sent down on a holiday to hotels , private houses , etc \u201d \u2013 and there were similar stories coming from Cork and Dublin . It was reported that groups were collecting money for thes \u201c holidays \u201d . There were worries this situation could be \u201c exploited by extremists \u201d or unscrupulous people . Refugees are not always just frightened people who are thankful for the assistance being given them . Some of them can be very demanding and ungrateful , even obstreperous and fractious \u2013 as well as , particularly in the case of teenage boys , destructive . But irrespective of their attitudes , government policy \u201c has been interpreted \u2026 as requiring that they should all be accepted without question and treated to the best of our ability as groups of Irish people in need of help at a very difficult time \u201d . It also notes that due to the \u201c holiday \u201d reports , \u201c the reality of the need of the refugees for a respite from the unnerving atmosphere of the North was not always fully appreciated locally \u201d . The memo details fears that there could be a \u201c major crisis situation arising at any time of the year involving numbers of refugees vastly in excess of anything experienced hitherto \u201d . This situation could even lead to closing all boarding ( and perhaps other ) schools \u2013 it was discussed that powers of compulsory acquisition of accommodation on a temporary basis might become essential . The Minister for Defence drafted a general scheme of a bill to enable legislation to be drafted and held , in case the temporary acquisition of accommodation for refugees was needed . With no legal onus on local authorities to look after refugees , it was \u201c only by the exercise of much persuasion and tact on the part of the Civil Defence controlling staff in the Department of Defence that all County Managers were eventually prevailed upon to undertake responsibility for the accommodation and care of Northern refugees \u201d . \u201c They appear to convey the impression that they are being unduly imposed upon in this matter \u201d , says the document . But the Minister for Defence felt that if any special legislation in relation to Northern refugees was introduced , it should also provide for the imposition on Local Authorities the duty to provide for their accommodation , maintenance and welfare .

This is war . It has been war , non-stop , since 1948 . What is happening in Lebanon today is yet another chapter of bloody Middle East events that will last for generations to come , because it is impossible , after so many years of conflict , for the Israelis and Arabs to forgive and forget . In this week 's events in Lebanon , the one set of parties , which include Syria , the Palestinians , Iran , Arab nationalists in the Middle East and North Africa , along with jihadi Muslims in the Muslim World , believe that escalation is the only solution to the Arab -Israeli conflict . They claim that the Arabs tried to talk peace with the Israelis after the Palestinians signed a peace agreement with Israel in 1993 , and ended up with nothing . They say that war is correct , justified morally , politically and religiously . To them , it is legitimate self -defense . They back this argument by saying that Israel still controls the Sheba Farms , which are part of Lebanon , and still has Lebanese prisoners in Israeli jails . Also , they add that the Israeli tank destroyed by Hezbollah , and the soldiers captured and killed on July 12 , had trespassed into Lebanon 's side of the border with Israel . They argue that if the Arab world cannot fight Israel , then the least Arab countries can do is permit - or facilitate - a proxy war with Israel through the Hezbollah resistance in Lebanon . US President George W Bush , who commented on Lebanon from Germany 24 hours after violence had spiraled out of control , described the situation as \" pathetic \" . He also expressed concern that Israel 's offensive into Lebanon could destabilize or even topple a Lebanese government that Washington supports . He made things worse and further infuriated the Arab street by expressing Israel 's \" right to defend herself \" . The other party ( centered mainly in Lebanon ) argues that Lebanon is paying a high price for a war that does not concern all Lebanese . The Christians of Lebanon , along with a majority of the Sunni Muslims , want a war- free Westernized country that thrives on tourism and sound economic policies . The Christians in particular were never too fond of the Shi'ites of Lebanon . They treated them as an underclass in the 1950s and 1960s , allocating no more than 0.7 % of the budget for construction and health care in their districts , waged war against them in the 1970s and 1980s , then tried to mend relations with them from 1990 onwards . The Christians were worldly , well - educated and worked in business , politics , literature and the arts , while the Shi'ites were mainly laborers , farmers and ordinary citizens with limited social mobility . Even their deputies in parliament were feudal landlords who cared little for the community 's welfare . These Christians today - despite all the unity talk heard in Lebanon - do not feel that the Hezbollah prisoners in Israeli jails concern them . Nor do the Sheba Farms . They dislike the Shi'ite south of the country in as much as the Shi'ite leaders dislike the Christian districts of Lebanon . Therefore , they feel indifferent to the plight of Hezbollah . They do not want Lebanon to become the \" Che Guevara \" of Arab politics . They argue that all this military escalation does is wreck plans for Lebanon 's rebirth . On July 13 - as the Christians feared - tourism suffered tremendously after the Israelis struck at Beirut Airport . In one day , over 15,000 tourists fled Lebanon by land to Syria . Both pro and anti-Hezbollah arguments are valid , depending on where one stands today in the Arab world . It all started on July 12 when Israel troops were ambushed on Lebanon 's side of the border with Israel . Hezbollah , which commands the Lebanese south , immediately seized on their crossing . They arrested two Israeli soldiers , killed eight Israelis and wounded over 20 in attacks inside Israeli territory . This unleashed hell in Israel , and Olmert immediately responded by mounting a war on Lebanon . A sea , air and ground blockade was enforced on Lebanon , and a systematic destruction of Lebanon 's infrastructure was began . Hezbollah responded by wounding 11 Israelis with Katyusha - style rockets fired on the town of Safad in northern Israel . Hezbollah secretary general Hassan Nasrallah gave a press conference hours after the hostilities started . He was confident , articulate , strong and very defiant , as usual , saying that this operation aimed at getting the Israelis to release Lebanese prisoners from their jails . Counter-operations would not release the two abducted Israeli soldiers , he pointed out . Statements by Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad al - Siniora , who wanted to distance himself from the attacks , said that his government had not authorized the Hezbollah operation . His claim , however , fell on deaf ears in Israel . Damaging his credibility was a statement by Lebanon 's ambassador to the United States , Farid Abbud , who spoke on CNN and demanded a prisoner exchange between Hezbollah and Israel , adding that Israel must return the occupied Sheba Farms to Lebanon . His statements gave the impression that the Lebanese government , which he was officially representing , approved of the kidnapping and was echoing the demands of Nasrallah . As a result , he was recalled to Lebanon . Undaunted by Siniora distancing himself from the Hezbollah operation , Israel responded by bombing Rafik al - Harriri International Airport in Beirut , bringing all aviation to a halt , and bombing two other airports in northern and southern Lebanon . These airports , Israel claimed , were being used to channel money and arms to Hezbollah . One of the party 's offices in the suburb of Beirut was bombed , and so was a post in the ancient city of Baalbak . And Israel battered roads , flyovers and fuel tanks in Lebanon early on Friday . A division of 12,000 troops has been stationed on the Lebanese - Israeli border . The Israeli Ministry of Defense has threatened to bomb the Damascus - Beirut highway . If this happens , Lebanon would become completely isolated , with no ground route to Syria , and its other outlets by sea and air blocked by the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) . Hezbollah threatened that if more attacks ensued , it would target Haifa , the third - largest city inside Israel ( which it then did ) , but Israel military commanders said that no targets in Lebanon were safe from reprisal attacks so long as the two Israeli soldiers were still held hostage in Lebanon . Israeli chief - of - staff Dan Halutz said that the operations would continue \" to restore calm to northern Israel \" . These responsibilities , he added \" particularly bombings by air and artillery , target Lebanon itself and Hezbollah . They will continue as long as necessary until our objectives are reached . \" Israel military commanders have pledged to plunge Lebanon back 20 years if hostilities did not end immediately . Bridges inside Lebanon , near the city of Sidon and throughout the south , were also destroyed . The death toll , at the time of writing , is over 50 Lebanese killed . Another 103 have been wounded . Meanwhile , according to the IDF , 90 people had been injured inside Israel . This is the largest Israeli offensive in Lebanon since the IDF invaded and occupied Beirut to defeat the Palestinian Army of Yasser Arafat in 1982 . Apart from all of these facts , everything gets muddled in Lebanon . Israel announced on July 13 that two rockets had landed on Haifa from Lebanon , as Hezbollah had promised , but Hezbollah denied the accusation . If Hezbollah did not fire the rockets , however , who did ? Is it a fabricated story being used by Israel to launch more offensives into Lebanon , because minutes after the story was revealed , and despite Hezbollah 's denial , Israel jets raided fuel tanks at Beirut airport . The question on everybody 's mind is : why is all of this happening now ? Apart from the soaring emotions and reminders of trumpeting Arab nationalism of the 1960s , it is sheer madness for anyone to believe that Hezbollah would be able to defeat , or even inflict maximum pain , on Israel - and get away with it . Too much is at stake inside Israel for Olmert to let the offensive pass without transforming it into all - out war . In October 2000 , right at the outbreak of the second Palestinian uprising in Jerusalem , Hezbollah did a similar stunt by kidnapping Israelis in Lebanon . At the time , prime minister Ehud Barak refused to seriously push for their release , fearing that opening another front against Lebanon , while the Israelis were busy combating the Palestinians at home , would only endanger Israeli lives . Five months later , Barak was voted out of office , in March 2001 , for a variety of reasons , prime among them being his passive response to Hezbollah . So , is anybody influencing Hezbollah to dramatically escalate the conflict ? Has Hezbollah coordinated these attacks with Hamas inside Palestine , believing that the time was ripe since relatively new and inexperienced leaders were now in power in Israel ( in reference to Defense Minister Amir Peretz and Olmert ) ? Never before has Hezbollah carried out such a massive offensive , not even during the heydays of the Syrian presence in Lebanon in the 1990s when most of south Lebanon was still occupied . What makes it believe that this time - with the tense international situation - it can get away with it ? Ultra-nationalists in Hamas , like the Damascus - based Khaled Meshal , have certainly supported the Lebanese group , injecting them with confidence and prompting them into \" defiance \" mode . Meshal , who leads the anti-pragmatism fold in Hamas that still wants to destroy the Jewish state , is not satisfied by the overtures of Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyya towards Israel . Haniyya , voted into office early this year , wants to run a country and is suffering from an international boycott on food , medicine and money into the Palestinian territories . Wages have not been paid in Palestine since February . Haniyya made several gestures of goodwill toward Israel ( much to the displeasure of Meshal ) , to prove that he was not in power to combat Israel but to improve the livelihood of the Palestinians . Meshal had other plans for the Hamas- led government , which contradicted with what Haniyya was seeing on the ground in Palestine . The two men drifted apart on how to lead the government , and split when three resistance groups in Palestine , apparently coordinating with Meshal 's team , kidnapped the 19 - year old Israeli soldier on June 25 . This sent shockwaves throughout Israel , and Olmert responded with grand force , re-occupying Gaza and killing , to date , an estimated 75 Palestinians in revenge . Electricity was destroyed in Gaza , and currently 1.5 million inhabitants live in darkness . Israel struck at buildings , an Islamic university and official buildings , including that of Haniyya and his Foreign Minister Mahmud al - Zahhar ( which was destroyed on July 13 ) . Ministers have been arrested , along with parliamentary deputies , and brought before military courts clad in chains to their feet and hands . Haniyya , who sees the state he is heading crumbling before his very eyes , wanted to solve the crisis politically , claiming that all the Palestinians living under his control were suffering from Israel 's military response . The resistance groups demanded a prisoner swap where 1,000 Palestinians would be released from Israeli jails , in exchange for the young Israeli soldier . Israel has refused . Haniyya is closer to a solution that releases the Israeli soldier in exchange for Israel releasing Palestinian funds ( frozen since Hamas came to power in January , and its authorization to bring clean drinking water , food and medicine into the Occupied Territories . Both solutions have not yet materialized , and in the middle of all the chaos and war , came the Hezbollah operation . Men of war This is where the Meshal - Nasrallah connection comes into play . Both leaders are clearly not interested in peace with Israel . Their views are mirrored with their two allies in Tehran and Damascus . Both leaders are unimpressed by Arab regimes that call for peace and dialogue - prime on the list being Mahmud Abbas in Palestine . They are being aggressive with Israel so Israel can respond with similar aggressiveness - killing whatever dreams Arabs peacemakers have in mind . The same formula applies inside Israel , where many do not want room for moderation in Israeli - Arab relations . They want to root out the moderates to justify aggression against the Palestinians and Lebanese . Meshal would very much love to see Hamas out of the political process . It would then be restored to the fold of the resistance , and freed from the burden of government , able to focus on military operations once again . The same applies to Nasrallah . If Israeli leaves the Sheba Farms and frees all Lebanese prisoners from its jails , there would no longer be a need for Hezbollah . The reason behind such calculations , however , and the dramatic side- effects such adventures have on Palestinian and Lebanese lives , are colossal . They believe , however , that war on two fronts would achieve one of two things . Either it would get Israel to show aggression , justifying their own aggression against the Israelis . Or a best - case scenario would be that a two - side war would break Israel . Either outcome , Hezbollah and Hamas are the victors . The final argument - based on conspiracy theories - in the war of Lebanon is that somebody convinced Hezbollah of this offensive with the purpose of destroying Hezbollah , forcing them to commit \" political suicide \" . This \" somebody \" has given Hezbollah enough rope to hang itself , making it believe that it could turn the tables on Israel by capturing two Israeli soldiers . The reason for this argument is that Hezbollah , for the past two years , has been a topic of international concern . Everybody wants Hezbollah to disarm ( except Syria and Iran ) but do not have the means to make them lay down their weapons . It certainly is not working by dialogue - because Hezbollah would not hear a word of it , and , therefore , has to be done by force through a foreign power . The only power able and willing to inflict a deadly blow on Hezbollah is Israel . Having the Americans pressure Hezbollah to disarm would be considered aggression on the Shi'ite community as whole . It would enrage Iran and alienate whatever support the Americans still had left among the Shi'ite community in Iraq . The leaders of Lebanon , who came to power after the Syrian troop withdrawal in April 2005 , wanted to court Hezbollah . They believed that by making them shoulder responsibility for government , Hezbollah would show more reason in dealing with Israel . The same reasoning applied to the Americans when they brought the Sunnis to power in Iraq , hoping that this would help end the Sunni insurgency . The Lebanese , headed by Siniora , reasoned that with seats in parliament and government ministries allocated to Hezbollah , the resistance group would not possibly engage in war with Israel . Apparently , they were wrong . Many wrongly believed that once the Syrian army left Lebanon , Hezbollah would be weakened , gradually losing its influence in the country . This turned out to be nonsense , since contrary to what is commonly portrayed in the Western media , Hezbollah is a party that is totally independent in Lebanon from control of the Syrians . They used to work under Syria 's umbrella under former Syrian president Hafez al - Assad in the 1990s , needing his support to keep their arms in the post - war era , but since their victory in liberating south Lebanon in 2000 , they have become independent of Syrian control . They still confer with the Syrians , seek their advice and coordinate with Syria but they do not take orders , money or arms from Damascus . For example , they had four parliamentary seats in 1992 , and four for their allies , a total of only eight , and this in the heyday of Syrian hegemony in Lebanon . Today , with Syria out , they have 14 seats . This explains why Hezbollah remained pro-Syrian until curtain - fall . Nasrallah never relied on the Syrians for his power base , nor did any member of Hezbollah . Also in Hezbollah 's favor now is the victory of Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad , who has shown strong support for the Shi'ite Lebanese resistance . Ahmadinejad clearly believes in the vision of Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , to promote Shi'ite Islam and help emancipate the Shi'ites of Lebanon . Ahmadinejad said on Thursday any Israeli strike on Syria would be considered an attack on the whole Islamic world that would bring a \" fierce response \" , state television reported . Relevant to all that is happening in Lebanon today is the degree of support Hezbollah and Nasrallah have in the Shi'ite community - and the amount of animosity in non- Shi'ite districts . One reason the Shi'ites support Hezbollah is religion . It is not the only one , however , because a study conducted by Dr Judith Harik , a professor at the American University of Beirut in 1996 , showed that 70 % of Hezbollah 's supporters saw themselves only as moderately religious , and 23 % said they were religious only out of obligation . Pragmatism , nationalism and charity networks , rather than Muslim ideology , are the secrets of Hezbollah 's success . Hezbollah enjoys authority and commands unwavering loyalty among Shi'ites because it always appears to be a confident political party that is doing an honorable job in fighting Israel . Adding to the nationalist aspect is the social one , which is that many people in the Shi'ite community , mainly at the grass - root level , rely on Hezbollah for charity and welfare . Hezbollah has succeeded in promoting itself through the media , igniting confidence , safety and security among the 10 million viewers of al - Manar television , for example . Many of those viewers are Shi'ites . Not once does al - Manar , for example , show viewers a member of Hezbollah defeated . Rather , it shows pictures of dead Israelis , real footage of Hezbollah operations and programs highlighting Hezbollah 's charity organizations . Hezbollah is a movement inspired by nationalism rather than religiousness . Precisely for these reasons it would be difficult for anyone to tackle Hezbollah . The only way to disarm is for the Shi'ite group to wait until the Israelis leave Sheba , then free all prisoners . They would then have to modify their agenda , after quiet discussions with everybody in Lebanon , and transform themselves from a military party into a political one . That would have been the logical response , but Nasrallah proved otherwise . What he has done in the past few days is show the world that if he so wishes , he can create havoc in Lebanon and the entire Middle East . Nasrallah is sending a message to the world - and to his opponents inside Lebanon - that he is still strong and a force to be reckoned with . He is also sending a message to the United States , Israel and the Lebanese that the Shi'ites are still there - still strong , still a force and still visible to the rest of the world .","annotations":[{"text":"A division of 12,000 troops","span":[6005,6031],"token_span":[1090,1094],"role":"Force","label":"Force","role_definition":"The Force carries out the operation.

In October 2000 , right at the outbreak of the second Palestinian uprising in Jerusalem , Hezbollah did a similar stunt by kidnapping Israelis in Lebanon . At the time , prime minister Ehud Barak refused to seriously push for their release , fearing that opening another front against Lebanon , while the Israelis were busy combating the Palestinians at home , would only endanger Israeli lives . Five months later , Barak was voted out of office , in March 2001 , for a variety of reasons , prime among them being his passive response to Hezbollah . So , is anybody influencing Hezbollah to dramatically escalate the conflict ? Has Hezbollah coordinated these attacks with Hamas inside Palestine , believing that the time was ripe since relatively new and inexperienced leaders were now in power in Israel ( in reference to Defense Minister Amir Peretz and Olmert ) ? Never before has Hezbollah carried out such a massive offensive , not even during the heydays of the Syrian presence in Lebanon in the 1990s when most of south Lebanon was still occupied . What makes it believe that this time - with the tense international situation - it can get away with it ? Ultra-nationalists in Hamas , like the Damascus - based Khaled Meshal , have certainly supported the Lebanese group , injecting them with confidence and prompting them into \" defiance \" mode . Meshal , who leads the anti-pragmatism fold in Hamas that still wants to destroy the Jewish state , is not satisfied by the overtures of Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyya towards Israel . Haniyya , voted into office early this year , wants to run a country and is suffering from an international boycott on food , medicine and money into the Palestinian territories . Wages have not been paid in Palestine since February . Haniyya made several gestures of goodwill toward Israel ( much to the displeasure of Meshal ) , to prove that he was not in power to combat Israel but to improve the livelihood of the Palestinians . Meshal had other plans for the Hamas- led government , which contradicted with what Haniyya was seeing on the ground in Palestine . The two men drifted apart on how to lead the government , and split when three resistance groups in Palestine , apparently coordinating with Meshal 's team , kidnapped the 19 - year old Israeli soldier on June 25 . This sent shockwaves throughout Israel , and Olmert responded with grand force , re-occupying Gaza and killing , to date , an estimated 75 Palestinians in revenge . Electricity was destroyed in Gaza , and currently 1.5 million inhabitants live in darkness . Israel struck at buildings , an Islamic university and official buildings , including that of Haniyya and his Foreign Minister Mahmud al - Zahhar ( which was destroyed on July 13 ) . Ministers have been arrested , along with parliamentary deputies , and brought before military courts clad in chains to their feet and hands . Haniyya , who sees the state he is heading crumbling before his very eyes , wanted to solve the crisis politically , claiming that all the Palestinians living under his control were suffering from Israel 's military response . The resistance groups demanded a prisoner swap where 1,000 Palestinians would be released from Israeli jails , in exchange for the young Israeli soldier . Israel has refused . Haniyya is closer to a solution that releases the Israeli soldier in exchange for Israel releasing Palestinian funds ( frozen since Hamas came to power in January , and its authorization to bring clean drinking water , food and medicine into the Occupied Territories . Both solutions have not yet materialized , and in the middle of all the chaos and war , came the Hezbollah operation . Men of war This is where the Meshal - Nasrallah connection comes into play . Both leaders are clearly not interested in peace with Israel . Their views are mirrored with their two allies in Tehran and Damascus . Both leaders are unimpressed by Arab regimes that call for peace and dialogue - prime on the list being Mahmud Abbas in Palestine . They are being aggressive with Israel so Israel can respond with similar aggressiveness - killing whatever dreams Arabs peacemakers have in mind . The same formula applies inside Israel , where many do not want room for moderation in Israeli - Arab relations . They want to root out the moderates to justify aggression against the Palestinians and Lebanese . Meshal would very much love to see Hamas out of the political process . It would then be restored to the fold of the resistance , and freed from the burden of government , able to focus on military operations once again . The same applies to Nasrallah . If Israeli leaves the Sheba Farms and frees all Lebanese prisoners from its jails , there would no longer be a need for Hezbollah . The reason behind such calculations , however , and the dramatic side- effects such adventures have on Palestinian and Lebanese lives , are colossal . They believe , however , that war on two fronts would achieve one of two things . Either it would get Israel to show aggression , justifying their own aggression against the Israelis . Or a best - case scenario would be that a two - side war would break Israel . Either outcome , Hezbollah and Hamas are the victors . The final argument - based on conspiracy theories - in the war of Lebanon is that somebody convinced Hezbollah of this offensive with the purpose of destroying Hezbollah , forcing them to commit \" political suicide \" . This \" somebody \" has given Hezbollah enough rope to hang itself , making it believe that it could turn the tables on Israel by capturing two Israeli soldiers . The reason for this argument is that Hezbollah , for the past two years , has been a topic of international concern . Everybody wants Hezbollah to disarm ( except Syria and Iran ) but do not have the means to make them lay down their weapons . It certainly is not working by dialogue - because Hezbollah would not hear a word of it , and , therefore , has to be done by force through a foreign power . The only power able and willing to inflict a deadly blow on Hezbollah is Israel . Having the Americans pressure Hezbollah to disarm would be considered aggression on the Shi'ite community as whole . It would enrage Iran and alienate whatever support the Americans still had left among the Shi'ite community in Iraq . The leaders of Lebanon , who came to power after the Syrian troop withdrawal in April 2005 , wanted to court Hezbollah . They believed that by making them shoulder responsibility for government , Hezbollah would show more reason in dealing with Israel . The same reasoning applied to the Americans when they brought the Sunnis to power in Iraq , hoping that this would help end the Sunni insurgency . The Lebanese , headed by Siniora , reasoned that with seats in parliament and government ministries allocated to Hezbollah , the resistance group would not possibly engage in war with Israel . Apparently , they were wrong . Many wrongly believed that once the Syrian army left Lebanon , Hezbollah would be weakened , gradually losing its influence in the country . This turned out to be nonsense , since contrary to what is commonly portrayed in the Western media , Hezbollah is a party that is totally independent in Lebanon from control of the Syrians . They used to work under Syria 's umbrella under former Syrian president Hafez al - Assad in the 1990s , needing his support to keep their arms in the post - war era , but since their victory in liberating south Lebanon in 2000 , they have become independent of Syrian control . They still confer with the Syrians , seek their advice and coordinate with Syria but they do not take orders , money or arms from Damascus . For example , they had four parliamentary seats in 1992 , and four for their allies , a total of only eight , and this in the heyday of Syrian hegemony in Lebanon . Today , with Syria out , they have 14 seats . This explains why Hezbollah remained pro-Syrian until curtain - fall . Nasrallah never relied on the Syrians for his power base , nor did any member of Hezbollah . Also in Hezbollah 's favor now is the victory of Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad , who has shown strong support for the Shi'ite Lebanese resistance . Ahmadinejad clearly believes in the vision of Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , to promote Shi'ite Islam and help emancipate the Shi'ites of Lebanon . Ahmadinejad said on Thursday any Israeli strike on Syria would be considered an attack on the whole Islamic world that would bring a \" fierce response \" , state television reported . Relevant to all that is happening in Lebanon today is the degree of support Hezbollah and Nasrallah have in the Shi'ite community - and the amount of animosity in non- Shi'ite districts . One reason the Shi'ites support Hezbollah is religion . It is not the only one , however , because a study conducted by Dr Judith Harik , a professor at the American University of Beirut in 1996 , showed that 70 % of Hezbollah 's supporters saw themselves only as moderately religious , and 23 % said they were religious only out of obligation . Pragmatism , nationalism and charity networks , rather than Muslim ideology , are the secrets of Hezbollah 's success . Hezbollah enjoys authority and commands unwavering loyalty among Shi'ites because it always appears to be a confident political party that is doing an honorable job in fighting Israel . Adding to the nationalist aspect is the social one , which is that many people in the Shi'ite community , mainly at the grass - root level , rely on Hezbollah for charity and welfare . Hezbollah has succeeded in promoting itself through the media , igniting confidence , safety and security among the 10 million viewers of al - Manar television , for example . Many of those viewers are Shi'ites . Not once does al - Manar , for example , show viewers a member of Hezbollah defeated . Rather , it shows pictures of dead Israelis , real footage of Hezbollah operations and programs highlighting Hezbollah 's charity organizations . Hezbollah is a movement inspired by nationalism rather than religiousness . Precisely for these reasons it would be difficult for anyone to tackle Hezbollah . The only way to disarm is for the Shi'ite group to wait until the Israelis leave Sheba , then free all prisoners . They would then have to modify their agenda , after quiet discussions with everybody in Lebanon , and transform themselves from a military party into a political one . That would have been the logical response , but Nasrallah proved otherwise . What he has done in the past few days is show the world that if he so wishes , he can create havoc in Lebanon and the entire Middle East . Nasrallah is sending a message to the world - and to his opponents inside Lebanon - that he is still strong and a force to be reckoned with . He is also sending a message to the United States , Israel and the Lebanese that the Shi'ites are still there - still strong , still a force and still visible to the rest of the world .","annotations":[{"text":"A division of 12,000 troops","span":[6005,6031],"token_span":[1090,1094],"role":"Force","label":"Force","role_definition":"The Force carries out the operation.

At the end of the war , in 1945 , Hersey was in Japan writing about the reconstruction of the devastated country when he happened across an account written by a Jesuit priest who had survived the Hiroshima destruction . It was he who introduced the reporter to other survivors . From these , Hersey chose six individuals : two doctors , a minister , a widowed seamstress , a young woman who worked in a factory , and the priest himself . These became the principal characters in an account that melded nonfiction reportage with the stylistic devices of the novel , all expressed through the plainest of styles . \u201c On some undressed bodies , the burns had made patterns . . . the shapes of flowers they had had on their kimonos . \u201d A would - be rescuer took a victim by the hands \u201c but her skin slipped off in huge , glove - like pieces . \u201d One observer found 20 soldiers , \u201c their faces were wholly burned , their eye sockets were hollow , the fluid from their melted eyes had run down their cheeks . ( They must have had their faces upturned when the bomb went off ; perhaps they were anti-aircraft personnel . ) \u201d As one critic remarked : \u201c If ever there was a subject calculated to make a writer overwrought and a piece overwritten , it was the bombing of Hiroshima , yet Hersey 's reporting was so meticulous , his sentences and paragraphs were so clear , calm and restrained , that the horror the story had to tell comes through all the more chillingly , \u201d as in the passage , \u201c a great number sat and lay on the pavement , vomited , waited for death , and died . \u201d Later Hersey would say of this now celebrated style : \u201c I was right to adopt it . A high literary manner , or a show of passion , would have brought me into the story as a mediator . I wanted to avoid such mediation , so the reader 's experience would be as direct as possible . \u201d I certainly remember my experience , reading it in a battered ( and forbidden ) copy of \u201c The New Yorker . \u201d The magazine had been discouraged by the occupation authorities but a copy or two still circulated , samizdat -style , when I read it in Tokyo in January 1947 . The experience was direct ; the plainness of the style and the horror of the account both moved and shocked . Among those also experiencing shock were the top brass of American Gen. Douglas MacArthur 's SCAP ( the offices of the occupation ) . The supreme commander of the allied powers had strictly prohibited dissemination of any reports on the consequences of the bombings , and now look at what Hersey had done \u2014 spread it all over . The ban had extended to photos and movies \u2014 all copies were gotten out of the country and sent direct to Washington . Such censorship included scientific writings as well . Reports concerning the effect of the blast could not be made public until the closing months of the occupation . Thus for over six years , Japanese scientists were denied assess to data that might have assisted them in helping atomic-bomb victims . And when Takashi Nagai 's elegiac \u201c Bells of Nagasaki \u201d was first published in Japan , General Willoughby insisted that an American - constructed appendix on \u201c The Sack of Manila \u201d be included . ( Though its inclusion could easily be taken as suggesting that Nagasaki and Manila were comparable atrocities \u2014 hardly , as historian John Dower has noted , what the Americans intended . ) John Hersey 's \u201c Hiroshima \u201d did not appear in Japanese translation until 1949 . But it was never again out of print . In 1985 , the American edition added a new chapter , \u201c The Aftermath , \u201d which tells readers what became of the six survivors Hersey wrote about . It is this edition that is here reissued in this new Penguin version , making again available what has been called \u201c the most celebrated piece of journalism to come out of World War II \u201d and one in which we find the most compassionate answer to that war 's most notorious atrocity .

At the end of the war , in 1945 , Hersey was in Japan writing about the reconstruction of the devastated country when he happened across an account written by a Jesuit priest who had survived the Hiroshima destruction . It was he who introduced the reporter to other survivors . From these , Hersey chose six individuals : two doctors , a minister , a widowed seamstress , a young woman who worked in a factory , and the priest himself . These became the principal characters in an account that melded nonfiction reportage with the stylistic devices of the novel , all expressed through the plainest of styles . \u201c On some undressed bodies , the burns had made patterns . . . the shapes of flowers they had had on their kimonos . \u201d A would - be rescuer took a victim by the hands \u201c but her skin slipped off in huge , glove - like pieces . \u201d One observer found 20 soldiers , \u201c their faces were wholly burned , their eye sockets were hollow , the fluid from their melted eyes had run down their cheeks . ( They must have had their faces upturned when the bomb went off ; perhaps they were anti-aircraft personnel . ) \u201d As one critic remarked : \u201c If ever there was a subject calculated to make a writer overwrought and a piece overwritten , it was the bombing of Hiroshima , yet Hersey 's reporting was so meticulous , his sentences and paragraphs were so clear , calm and restrained , that the horror the story had to tell comes through all the more chillingly , \u201d as in the passage , \u201c a great number sat and lay on the pavement , vomited , waited for death , and died . \u201d Later Hersey would say of this now celebrated style : \u201c I was right to adopt it . A high literary manner , or a show of passion , would have brought me into the story as a mediator . I wanted to avoid such mediation , so the reader 's experience would be as direct as possible . \u201d I certainly remember my experience , reading it in a battered ( and forbidden ) copy of \u201c The New Yorker . \u201d The magazine had been discouraged by the occupation authorities but a copy or two still circulated , samizdat -style , when I read it in Tokyo in January 1947 . The experience was direct ; the plainness of the style and the horror of the account both moved and shocked . Among those also experiencing shock were the top brass of American Gen. Douglas MacArthur 's SCAP ( the offices of the occupation ) . The supreme commander of the allied powers had strictly prohibited dissemination of any reports on the consequences of the bombings , and now look at what Hersey had done \u2014 spread it all over . The ban had extended to photos and movies \u2014 all copies were gotten out of the country and sent direct to Washington . Such censorship included scientific writings as well . Reports concerning the effect of the blast could not be made public until the closing months of the occupation . Thus for over six years , Japanese scientists were denied assess to data that might have assisted them in helping atomic-bomb victims . And when Takashi Nagai 's elegiac \u201c Bells of Nagasaki \u201d was first published in Japan , General Willoughby insisted that an American - constructed appendix on \u201c The Sack of Manila \u201d be included . ( Though its inclusion could easily be taken as suggesting that Nagasaki and Manila were comparable atrocities \u2014 hardly , as historian John Dower has noted , what the Americans intended . ) John Hersey 's \u201c Hiroshima \u201d did not appear in Japanese translation until 1949 . But it was never again out of print . In 1985 , the American edition added a new chapter , \u201c The Aftermath , \u201d which tells readers what became of the six survivors Hersey wrote about . It is this edition that is here reissued in this new Penguin version , making again available what has been called \u201c the most celebrated piece of journalism to come out of World War II \u201d and one in which we find the most compassionate answer to that war 's most notorious atrocity .

Kupe Legendary Polynesian navigator Kupe 's early exploration of New Zealand is commemorated in many ancient place names . Kupe landed at Whanganui , known as Te Kaihau - o - Kupe , or ' Kupe 's wind - eating ' , because of the constant winds there . He then took his canoe upriver in search of inhabitants , paddling as far as Kauarap\u0101oa . This was named for one of his men , Arap\u0101oa , who drowned swimming across the river in flood . It is told that although Kupe heard the bird calls of weka , k\u014dkako and p\u012bwakawaka ( fantail ) , he did not find people . He returned to the river mouth and then made his way to P\u0101tea in south Taranaki , where he planted karaka seed in its sweet soils . Turi and Ng\u0101 Paerangi On returning to Hawaiki in Polynesia , Kupe described his explorations to his people . Some time later , Turi , captain of the Aotea canoe , sailed to P\u0101tea , where he made his home . According to tradition , his descendants who spread into the region discovered the original people of the land , Ng\u0101 Paerangi . The chief Paerangi , from whom they took their name , is said to have preceded Turi by five generations . The collective name for the people of the river , Ng\u0101ti Hau , is in some versions said to have come from Haupipi . He sailed with Turi on the Aotea after his original canoe , the Kuruhaup\u014d , was wrecked . In other versions the name is a contraction of Te \u0100ti Haunui-a- P\u0101p\u0101rangi ( the people of Haunui-a- P\u0101p\u0101rangi ) . Haunui-a- P\u0101p\u0101rangi also arrived with Turi , and his descendants settled among the people of Ng\u0101 Paerangi . Tamatea Another significant ancestor is Tamatea - p\u014dkai - whenua , captain of the T\u0101kitimu canoe and explorer of the Whanganui River . When entering the river Tamatea sent his servant ashore to find flax for a topknot ( p\u016btiki ) . The place where flax was found became known as Te P\u016btiki-wharanui- a- Tamatea - p\u014dkai - whenua . Turi came to visit Tamatea , and his daughter T\u0101neroa fell in love and married Tamatea 's brother , Uenga-ariki . How the Whanganui River was formed In ancient times three mountains , Ruapehu , Tongariro and Taranaki , lived together in the centre of the North Island , the fish which M\u0101ui hauled from the sea . One day Taranaki attempted to carry off P\u012bhanga , the wife of Tongariro . In the ensuing battle Taranaki was defeated and escaped down to Whanganui . As he fled , he carved out the deep furrow of the river . The place where he eventually stopped in loneliness is the site of Mt Taranaki today . Tamatea then built a canoe , and left his servant at the mouth of the river , while he explored upriver . According to some , this event gave rise to its name , Whanganui ( from ' whanga nui ' , meaning ' long wait ' ) . Others say the name came from Haunui-a- P\u0101p\u0101rangi , and meant ' great harbour ' . Children of Tamakehu and Ruaka Tamakehu , a Te \u0100ti Haunui- a- P\u0101p\u0101rangi chief , and his first wife Ruaka had three children : Hineng\u0101kau of the upper river , Tama \u016apoko , who settled in the middle reaches , and T\u016bpoho , associated with the lower Whanganui . Their names are regularly invoked to express the basic unity of the people . This is also emphasised by certain sayings , such as 'te taura whiri a Hineng\u0101kau ' ( ' the plaited rope of Hineng\u0101kau ' ) which refers to the ties between the people of the river . Other canoes Because the river 's path from the central North Island 's volcanic plateau is gradual and navigable over about 230 km , not only were some 80 p\u0101 and village sites built along its banks and cliffs , it also became one of the great arterial routes through the central North Island . This has ensured that other tribes , such as those of the Tainui confederation , Ng\u0101ti Raukawa and Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto , as well as Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu of the T\u0101kitimu canoe and Ng\u0101ti T\u016bwharetoa of the Arawa canoe , also contribute to the genealogical history of the river .","annotations":[{"text":"New Zealand","span":[239,249],"token_span":[52,53],"role":"Goal","label":"Goal","role_definition":"Any expression which tells where the moving object(s) ends up as a result of the motion expresses the frame element Goal.

Tamatea Another significant ancestor is Tamatea - p\u014dkai - whenua , captain of the T\u0101kitimu canoe and explorer of the Whanganui River . When entering the river Tamatea sent his servant ashore to find flax for a topknot ( p\u016btiki ) . The place where flax was found became known as Te P\u016btiki-wharanui- a- Tamatea - p\u014dkai - whenua . Turi came to visit Tamatea , and his daughter T\u0101neroa fell in love and married Tamatea 's brother , Uenga-ariki . How the Whanganui River was formed In ancient times three mountains , Ruapehu , Tongariro and Taranaki , lived together in the centre of the North Island , the fish which M\u0101ui hauled from the sea . One day Taranaki attempted to carry off P\u012bhanga , the wife of Tongariro . In the ensuing battle Taranaki was defeated and escaped down to Whanganui . As he fled , he carved out the deep furrow of the river . The place where he eventually stopped in loneliness is the site of Mt Taranaki today . Tamatea then built a canoe , and left his servant at the mouth of the river , while he explored upriver . According to some , this event gave rise to its name , Whanganui ( from ' whanga nui ' , meaning ' long wait ' ) . Others say the name came from Haunui-a- P\u0101p\u0101rangi , and meant ' great harbour ' . Children of Tamakehu and Ruaka Tamakehu , a Te \u0100ti Haunui- a- P\u0101p\u0101rangi chief , and his first wife Ruaka had three children : Hineng\u0101kau of the upper river , Tama \u016apoko , who settled in the middle reaches , and T\u016bpoho , associated with the lower Whanganui . Their names are regularly invoked to express the basic unity of the people . This is also emphasised by certain sayings , such as 'te taura whiri a Hineng\u0101kau ' ( ' the plaited rope of Hineng\u0101kau ' ) which refers to the ties between the people of the river . Other canoes Because the river 's path from the central North Island 's volcanic plateau is gradual and navigable over about 230 km , not only were some 80 p\u0101 and village sites built along its banks and cliffs , it also became one of the great arterial routes through the central North Island . This has ensured that other tribes , such as those of the Tainui confederation , Ng\u0101ti Raukawa and Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto , as well as Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu of the T\u0101kitimu canoe and Ng\u0101ti T\u016bwharetoa of the Arawa canoe , also contribute to the genealogical history of the river .","annotations":[{"text":"Haupipi","span":[1409,1415],"token_span":[288,288],"role":"Driver","label":"Driver","role_definition":"This is the being, typically human, that controls the Vehicle as it moves."},{"text":"the Aotea","span":[1442,1450],"token_span":[295,296],"role":"Vehicle","label":"Vehicle","role_definition":"This is the means of conveyance controlled by the Driver.

It probably says more about the film than anything else I 'm about to write that , despite all those previous viewings , I still clutched UK Anime 's review copy of Manga Entertainment 's Evangelion 2.22 release to my chest upon its arrival and simply refused to let it out of my sight until everyone else backed down and let me take up reviewing duties for it . If the first movie in this four film series that reboots the franchise , Evangelion 1.11 : You Are ( Not ) Alone , suggested that the entire project was going to be little more than an attempt to give the classic anime TV series a 21st century makeover for a new generation , then this second film dismisses any such thoughts utterly within moments of its introduction . Indeed , Evangelion 2.22 wastes no time at all in introducing us to a brand - new Evangelion pilot whose name is n't even mentioned to the viewer until her name crops up in the end credits - you 'll be wanting to make a mental note of her particulars however , for her sporadic appearances throughout the film punctuate some of its most important moments . It is n't just a new pilot that Evangelion 2.22 throws into the mix instantly , as the opening to the film also delivers a swift one - two punch of action set pieces ; the first featuring our mystery girl pitted against an Angel in a clunky prototype Evangelion unit , before we switch back to Japan and the appearance of the seventh Angel before its speedy dispatch by a certain Asuka Langley Shikinami . Yes , her surname might have changed but Asuka is back in the thick of things here , and as conceited as ever to boot - although that said , she is n't quite the character you might remember from her television outings , as we 'll discuss later . After thrilling the viewer with that sublime double - whammy of Angel -fighting action , the movie finally finds some time to take a breather and explore its characters and environment - Asuka 's appearance naturally features heavily here as she bounces off Shinji , Rei and Misato , while Ryoji Kagi also makes himself known throughout the movie as his efforts are sold to the highest bidder when he is n't ploughing his own furrow . These developments are whisked along on waves of alternating bouts of comedy and character interaction , and punctuated by another breath - taking effort to stop an Angel from wiping out humanity as we know it , this time via an opponent who is rather more familiar to fans of the TV show . We really have to stop and discuss character development at this point however , as it serves as arguably the biggest departure from the Evangelion of the 1990s . While the original shows main characters ( and particularly its roster of pilots ) were memorable in their own right , their characters remained broadly static as the series progresses , with revelations about their circumstances and pasts only serving to reinforce the motivations of each individual . In this regard , and following the trend touched upon in the first movie , You Can ( Not ) Advance is hugely different - all of its characters grow noticeably during the duration of the film as its subtitle alludes to , and this in turn works wonders in terms of making its individuals feel both more human and easier to empathise with . Yes , Shinji can still be a spoiled brat but his reasons for doing so feel utterly valid ; Rei is still a \" doll \" but one who is learning the importance of human emotion and the simple pleasures which come from being around others ; Asuka is feisty , arrogant and rude but allows others to close the emotional distance she exhibits towards them far more readily . Put more simply - Evangelion 2.22 's pilots feel more like real teenagers than caricatures of one . After a first half where things almost seem too relaxed on occasion , the second half of Evangelion 2.22 is where things really kick up a gear , complete with all of the political and organisational machinations that you might expect from the franchise with NERV at their centre . Against this backdrop , the film hits the viewer with everything that it has in its arsenal - visceral action , uncompromisingly horrific scenarios that send a shiver down your spine and an overflowing of emotion all lead up to a final half hour which almost delights in destroying everything from the viewer 's expectations through to their sense of sanity . You did n't really think Hideaki Anno was going to waste another opportunity to mess with your head , did you ? It 's really the second half of Evangelion 2.22 that showcases what this new series of films is all about - it 's a relentless and incredible spectacle , pure and simple , and it 's one that simply does n't get anything wrong in those terms . Never mind sitting on the edge of your seat , as the end credits roll you 'll realise that your fists are clenched , your eyes wide ; you 've just forgotten to breath or blink for the past hour , it seems . If the visuals of the first movie impressed you , then You Can ( Not ) Advance will drop your jaw to the floor with its almost perfect melding of CG and traditional animation techniques - it 's clear that this film was denied nothing in the pursuit of animated perfection , and given the time and money afforded it this is undoubtedly the best animated spectacle you will ever have seen as it builds up Tokyo III and then systemically destroys it in a riot of blood , guts and giant bio-mechanical creatures . This is backed up by an equally terrific soundtrack - Shiro Sagisu again works his magic and creates background music that feels both fresh and fitting ( even if some of it is lifted directly from His and Her Circumstances and given a dust - off ) , while Studio Khara do a number on the viewer by outfitting the film 's two most intense scenes with light , emotional songs about friendship and progress . The first will make you recoil in horror as it sharpens the knives on what is already a shocking scene ; the second will move you close to tears even if you are n't entirely sure what on earth is going on . Of course , music and visuals will only take you so far , so we really have to explicitly mention that this movie is a fantastic work in its own right via a script that knows when to ease off the throttle and when to put it hard to the floor , timing everything it does almost perfectly for the maximum impact - its slow , personal moments only serve to increase our discomfort when the characters we 've been close to are pushed into unbelievable peril , yet those moments of threatening apocalypse are necessarily lightened by those occasional moments of cheerful goofiness . This sense of light and shade rarely puts a foot wrong across the course of the film to create a viewing experience that is as equally satisfying cerebrally as it is a feast for your eyes and ears . In terms of Manga Entertainment 's UK release , we were lucky enough to check out the Blu-Ray version of the movie , and even more luckily for me I can sum it up in a single word - beautiful . Given the care and attention lavished upon the film itself by its creators , this digital transfer similarly gives the movie the love it deserves , and it absolutely looks the part from beginning to end coupled with a Dolby True HD 6.1 audio track that threatens to shake your house down during its more destructive moments ( or , as my next - door neighbour put it , \" there was a lot of screaming \" ) . As per the first film , the original TV anime 's English dub cast is reassembled to decent effect , although the dub felt a little too stilted in places for my liking at times . Even in terms of extras we can find little to complain about in this UK release - the omitted scenes included on the disk are very rough early cuts but interesting nonetheless ( one cut scene in particular paints an interesting picture of Rei and Ritsuko that is missing from the final film ) , the US dub team 's commentary is an exhaustive affair , and the \" making of \" feature gives some wonderful insight into the animation 's creative process . Throw in a shed - load of trailers and the hardcore Evangelion fans have more than enough to coo over . As an anime fan that was finally dragged outright into the wonders of Japanese animation and what it can do as a story - telling medium by Neon Genesis Evangelion , I am admittedly biased in my thoughts towards the franchise - something which can be a blessing or a curse when a series you love gets \" rebooted \" . I have to confess that my first viewing of Evangelion 2.0 left me with a slightly unsteady opinion of the film - it leaves the viewer ( and particularly those who have seen the TV anime ) with so much to take in and digest it 's difficult to know where to start . It 's this initial response and how my feelings towards the film have changed over time to the point where I ca n't help but regard it reverentially as a borderline work of genius that leads me to say that Evangelion 2.22 is not a film to watch once and then allow to gather dust on a shelf . Come back to it a few months later , watch it again and chew over what you 've just seen a little more - I almost guarantee you 'll find new things to like or ponder , and discover new aspects to this visually and emotionally busy movie that you perhaps missed the first time around . Thankfully , this top-notch presentation of You Can ( Not ) Advance for a UK audience makes watching the movie over and over again nothing short of an outright pleasure . Go out and buy it ( on Blu - Ray if you can , this is one film that absolutely deserves a High Definition treatment ) , watch it over and over , prepare yourself for the third movie with it 's as - yet unannounced release date - oh , and whatever you do , do n't hit the \" stop \" button until after the films end credits have finished rolling ...","annotations":[{"text":"I","span":[35,35],"token_span":[8,8],"role":"Experiencer","label":"Experiencer","role_definition":"The Experiencer is the person or sentient entity that experiences or feels the emotions."},{"text":"all of its characters grow noticeably","span":[3366,3402],"token_span":[622,627],"role":"Situation","label":"Situation","role_definition":"The Situation is the circumstances or topic about which the Experiencer feels an emotion."},{"text":"Asuka","span":[3817,3821],"token_span":[709,709],"role":"Other","label":"Other","role_definition":"The Other is the person that evokes the emotional response in the Experiencer."},{"text":"for the past hour","span":[5220,5236],"token_span":[968,971],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time when the Experiencer feels for the Other."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"The Fandom Post found the character neglected by Anno 's script , given the lesser space devoted to her and Mari 's introduction , while Renan Fontes ( Comic Book Resources ) judged Asuka Shikinami significantly less interesting than Langley .

Even in terms of extras we can find little to complain about in this UK release - the omitted scenes included on the disk are very rough early cuts but interesting nonetheless ( one cut scene in particular paints an interesting picture of Rei and Ritsuko that is missing from the final film ) , the US dub team 's commentary is an exhaustive affair , and the \" making of \" feature gives some wonderful insight into the animation 's creative process . Throw in a shed - load of trailers and the hardcore Evangelion fans have more than enough to coo over . As an anime fan that was finally dragged outright into the wonders of Japanese animation and what it can do as a story - telling medium by Neon Genesis Evangelion , I am admittedly biased in my thoughts towards the franchise - something which can be a blessing or a curse when a series you love gets \" rebooted \" . I have to confess that my first viewing of Evangelion 2.0 left me with a slightly unsteady opinion of the film - it leaves the viewer ( and particularly those who have seen the TV anime ) with so much to take in and digest it 's difficult to know where to start . It 's this initial response and how my feelings towards the film have changed over time to the point where I ca n't help but regard it reverentially as a borderline work of genius that leads me to say that Evangelion 2.22 is not a film to watch once and then allow to gather dust on a shelf . Come back to it a few months later , watch it again and chew over what you 've just seen a little more - I almost guarantee you 'll find new things to like or ponder , and discover new aspects to this visually and emotionally busy movie that you perhaps missed the first time around . Thankfully , this top-notch presentation of You Can ( Not ) Advance for a UK audience makes watching the movie over and over again nothing short of an outright pleasure . Go out and buy it ( on Blu - Ray if you can , this is one film that absolutely deserves a High Definition treatment ) , watch it over and over , prepare yourself for the third movie with it 's as - yet unannounced release date - oh , and whatever you do , do n't hit the \" stop \" button until after the films end credits have finished rolling ...","annotations":[{"text":"I","span":[35,35],"token_span":[8,8],"role":"Experiencer","label":"Experiencer","role_definition":"The Experiencer is the person or sentient entity that experiences or feels the emotions."},{"text":"Asuka","span":[3817,3821],"token_span":[709,709],"role":"Other","label":"Other","role_definition":"The Other is the person that evokes the emotional response in the Experiencer."},{"text":"all of its characters grow noticeably","span":[3366,3402],"token_span":[622,627],"role":"Situation","label":"Situation","role_definition":"The Situation is the circumstances or topic about which the Experiencer feels an emotion."},{"text":"for the past hour","span":[5220,5236],"token_span":[968,971],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time when the Experiencer feels for the Other."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-0470-816-frame-Pardon","frame":"Pardon","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Authority excuses an Offense that an Offender has committed, with the effect of ending or preventing any punishment.","frame_ancestors":["Clemency","Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"After a review , BYU administration will eventually decide to grant Honor Code amnesty to rape victims .","annotations":[{"text":"After a review","span":[0,13],"token_span":[0,2],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role denotes the time when the pardon is given"},{"text":"BYU administration","span":[17,34],"token_span":[4,5],"role":"Authority","label":"Authority","role_definition":"Authority is the organization or person taht grants the pardon."},{"text":"BYU","span":[17,19],"token_span":[4,4],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location at which the pardoning takes place."},{"text":"rape victims","span":[90,101],"token_span":[15,16],"role":"Offender","label":"Offender","role_definition":"This role denotes the offender that seeks or gets the pardon."}],"trigger":{"text":"amnesty","start_char":79,"end_char":85,"start_token":13,"end_token":13,"frame":"Pardon"}},"source":{"text":"This is an archived article that was published on sltrib.com in 2016 , and information in the article may be outdated .

Dozens of Bay Area schools , including 12 in San Francisco , landed on the state 's 5 percent lowest - achieving schools list - a ranking required by the federal government . The schools on the list serve predominantly low-income students and , therefore , receive or are eligible for Title I funds . The formula used to rank them was primarily based on standardized test scores . Each school on the list will be eligible for up to $ 2 million in federal funding annually for the next three years to help the schools improve - but only if they initiate one of four major reform strategies starting in the 2010 - 11 school year . The grant money is separate from Title I funding . Reform choice The reform choices are : -- A turnaround model : Replace the principal and retain no more than half the existing staff , giving the new principal flexibility to hire and to set the school calendar and the budget . -- A restart model : Convert to a charter school . -- School closure model : Shut down and send the students to a higher - achieving school . -- A transformation model : Replace the principal , reform instruction , increase learning time and provide operational flexibility . State law allows schools to hold off on choosing a reform strategy , but they must choose one by this fall or they will be ineligible for the Title I School Improvement Grant money - part of the Obama administration 's stimulus funding .

A special board , called a sandboard , is used to ski on sandy terrains , although sand slates are also sometimes used . While still niche activities and hardly recognized as \u201c official \u201d sports , both sand boarding and sand sledding have gained much popularity over the past couple of decades and have now become a tourist attraction for desert locations worldwide , with sandboarding spots also being artificially created on beach destinations and inside of cities away from deserted areas . Popular sandboarding destinations are Peru , Australia and South Africa , while specialized facilities or \u201c sandboarding parks \u201d have been built in Florence , Oregon and Hirschau , Germany . There are also a handful of sandboarding sport events and competitions held every year . As part of the Amazon Associate and eBay Partner Programme , we earn from qualifying purchases . How to sandboard Sandboarding does not require much in terms of training nor equipment , but the location and type of dune will make a great difference on your experience and ability to join the ride . Sandboarding at the beach is generally less demanding than sandboarding in the desert , and what you really need is just a good board and plenty of wax . Desert dunes are generally higher and steeper and offer the best rides , not to mention the most spectacular landscapes , but you will also need special equipment and appropriate clothing as to make sure everything goes smoothly . Sandboards are similar to snowboards but have a thicker laminate base which is made specifically to slide on dunes and resist abrasion from sand . Sandboarding equipment : Also recommended : - Sandboarding Insurance - Closed - toe shoes - Goggles - Elbow and Knee Pads - Helmet - Mouth Scarf - Sunscreen - Lots of water Getting started Once you get your sandboarding gear and clothing ready , it 's time to head to the dunes . Walk up hill until you find a good sliding spot \u2013 a steep dune with dry , thin sand and no obstructions is ideal \u2013 then place your board on the ground , back up , so you can wax it thoroughly . Make sure to test that the surface of your board is slippery by applying sand to it until it 's no longer sticky . You are now ready to slide down \u2013 either standing up \u201c surfing the sand \u201d ( make sure your sand board has foot bindings ! ) or either sitting or lying down on your belly ( also known as sand sledding , which is best performed with a smaller sand sled or toboggan ) . The former position will give you more adrenaline and allow you to do tricks , somewhat akin to snowboarding , but will also increase your chances to fall down . Depending on the type of terrain and weather , you may need to wear protective gear to avoid injuries . That said , falling on sand is part of the game and so are the following weeks that you will spend scooping out sands from your clothes and belongings ! Sliding down When you are ready to slide , position your board on the edge of the dune and your legs on it so that your dominant foot is in front of the board , and tightly strap both of your feet into the bindings . You should be able to push the board forward by slightly bending your knees and using your body weight to advance . If you are sledding on your belly , you can use your arms to push yourself off the dune , making sure to keep your chin and legs up to maintain balance . Whatever position you are in , your goal is to try and keep your weight centered as you slide . If you have experience sliding on snow , you 'll find yourself having less control on your movements when doing this on sand , and you will not be able to significantly change the direction you are going to once you are sliding . But sand surfing can be an incredibly fun and thrilling experience , and once you are downhill , the first thing you 'll want to do is climb back up and do it again ! Take the adequate precautions Sandboarding is an extreme action sport and as such , it can be dangerous and in some cases even deadly . All beginner sandboarders are advised to take some minimum safety precautions , bearing in mind that even though the sand looks soft , falling at high speed can be much more painful than it seems . Wearing protection gear such as a helmet , elbow pads and knee pads while riding very tall dunes is a must , and it is also recommended to always wear comfortable and adequate clothing as a form of protection from scorching . Barefoot / barechest sandboarding should only be practiced on small , coastal dunes in beach areas and not in the desert . You are planning to go sandboarding , you better make sure that your health insurance covers sandboarding \u2013 most do not . Sandboarding vs Snowboarding Is sandboarding similar to snowboarding ? While both sports share the same concept of gliding down a hill while riding a piece of wood , sandboarding differs from snowboarding in many ways . Compared to snow , sand has very high friction , which makes sliding on sand much slower than sliding on snowy surfaces , and also making it much harder to turn . Because of this , sandboarding can also be practiced while sitting or laying down on the board . That sad , going down very steep dunes allows one to build up velocity in a way similar with snowboarding , and falling down can be painful \u2013 especially on warm days with scorching hot sands . The majority of sandboarding locations are also not equipped with anything similar to ski lifts , which means sandboarders have to walk back up a dune after gliding to the bottom . Is sandboarding difficult ? Sand surfing per se is not difficult , but people who are used to snowboarding will likely find themselves having less control of their movements while sliding on sand .

How to sandboard Sandboarding does not require much in terms of training nor equipment , but the location and type of dune will make a great difference on your experience and ability to join the ride . Sandboarding at the beach is generally less demanding than sandboarding in the desert , and what you really need is just a good board and plenty of wax . Desert dunes are generally higher and steeper and offer the best rides , not to mention the most spectacular landscapes , but you will also need special equipment and appropriate clothing as to make sure everything goes smoothly . Sandboards are similar to snowboards but have a thicker laminate base which is made specifically to slide on dunes and resist abrasion from sand . Sandboarding equipment : Also recommended : - Sandboarding Insurance - Closed - toe shoes - Goggles - Elbow and Knee Pads - Helmet - Mouth Scarf - Sunscreen - Lots of water Getting started Once you get your sandboarding gear and clothing ready , it 's time to head to the dunes . Walk up hill until you find a good sliding spot \u2013 a steep dune with dry , thin sand and no obstructions is ideal \u2013 then place your board on the ground , back up , so you can wax it thoroughly . Make sure to test that the surface of your board is slippery by applying sand to it until it 's no longer sticky . You are now ready to slide down \u2013 either standing up \u201c surfing the sand \u201d ( make sure your sand board has foot bindings ! ) or either sitting or lying down on your belly ( also known as sand sledding , which is best performed with a smaller sand sled or toboggan ) . The former position will give you more adrenaline and allow you to do tricks , somewhat akin to snowboarding , but will also increase your chances to fall down . Depending on the type of terrain and weather , you may need to wear protective gear to avoid injuries . That said , falling on sand is part of the game and so are the following weeks that you will spend scooping out sands from your clothes and belongings ! Sliding down When you are ready to slide , position your board on the edge of the dune and your legs on it so that your dominant foot is in front of the board , and tightly strap both of your feet into the bindings . You should be able to push the board forward by slightly bending your knees and using your body weight to advance . If you are sledding on your belly , you can use your arms to push yourself off the dune , making sure to keep your chin and legs up to maintain balance . Whatever position you are in , your goal is to try and keep your weight centered as you slide . If you have experience sliding on snow , you 'll find yourself having less control on your movements when doing this on sand , and you will not be able to significantly change the direction you are going to once you are sliding . But sand surfing can be an incredibly fun and thrilling experience , and once you are downhill , the first thing you 'll want to do is climb back up and do it again ! Take the adequate precautions Sandboarding is an extreme action sport and as such , it can be dangerous and in some cases even deadly . All beginner sandboarders are advised to take some minimum safety precautions , bearing in mind that even though the sand looks soft , falling at high speed can be much more painful than it seems . Wearing protection gear such as a helmet , elbow pads and knee pads while riding very tall dunes is a must , and it is also recommended to always wear comfortable and adequate clothing as a form of protection from scorching . Barefoot / barechest sandboarding should only be practiced on small , coastal dunes in beach areas and not in the desert . You are planning to go sandboarding , you better make sure that your health insurance covers sandboarding \u2013 most do not . Sandboarding vs Snowboarding Is sandboarding similar to snowboarding ? While both sports share the same concept of gliding down a hill while riding a piece of wood , sandboarding differs from snowboarding in many ways .

Because of this , sandboarding can also be practiced while sitting or laying down on the board . That sad , going down very steep dunes allows one to build up velocity in a way similar with snowboarding , and falling down can be painful \u2013 especially on warm days with scorching hot sands . The majority of sandboarding locations are also not equipped with anything similar to ski lifts , which means sandboarders have to walk back up a dune after gliding to the bottom . Is sandboarding difficult ? Sand surfing per se is not difficult , but people who are used to snowboarding will likely find themselves having less control of their movements while sliding on sand . How easy it is to maneauver a sandboard depends on the type , shape and size of the board as well as the type of terrain , wetness of the sand and steepness of the dune .

The Federation is not seeking funding or other assistance from donors for this operation at this time . Activities undertaken are aligned with the International Federation 's Global Agenda , which sets out four broad goals to meet the Federation 's mission to \" improve the lives of vulnerable people by mobilizing the power of humanity \" . Global Agenda Goals : Reduce the numbers of deaths , injuries and impact from disasters . Reduce the number of deaths , illnesses and impact from diseases and public health emergencies . Increase local community , civil society and Red Cross / Red Crescent capacity to address the most urgent situations of vulnerability . Reduce intolerance , discrimination and social exclusion and promote respect for diversity and human dignity . The Situation Cyclone Indlala hit the north- eastern coast of the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar on Thursday , 15 March 2007 . With strong winds up to 165 km /h , the cyclone is still ravaging the country and is expected to last until Sunday , 18 March . It is moving on a path towards the south west of Madagascar and has left considerable damage on the north east coastline . Roofs have been blown away and around 40 % of property in the town of Antalaha has been destroyed . About 90 % of the buildings at the town 's police station and CARE International offices have been damaged . Infrastructure such as water and electricity has also been affected . Displaced and affected people from Maroantsetra have gathered at the town 's municipal council hall . In Mananara North , rising water level in the river is threatening to cut off the area . Communication has been affected , denying small communities access to weather reports since the national radio has been off -air , in some areas , for the last two days . Authorities have considered closing schools in the area . Cyclone Indlala is the fifth cyclone that has hit / affected the country within the past three months : Cyclone Bondo made landfall on 25 December 2006 ; Cyclone Clovis on 3 January 2007 ; Cyclone Favio on 18 January 2007 ; and Cyclone Gamede on 26 February 2007 . This is the first time that the island has been struck by so many cyclones in such a short period . Seasonal rains have been made worse by the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) moving slightly south , resulting in continuous rains from the end of December 2006 to the present moment . The accumulated impact of all these cyclones is damage to infrastructure and crops , flooding , landslides and displacement of communities . The Government of Malagasy estimates that 293,000 people have been affected by the floods , with 32,000 displaced . More than 150,000 farming families have lost a total of 90,000 hectares of crop . Immediate needs include targeted food distribution to prevent malnutrition , essential drugs , water and sanitation . On 20 February 2007 , the Malagasy Government launched a US $ 242 million appeal . On 15 March 2007 , the United Nations and its humanitarian partners launched a Flash Appeal requesting nearly USD 9.6 million to provide aid to people affected by floods and cyclones for a period up to six months . Red Cross Action The Malagasy Red Cross Society ( MRCS ) has indicated that there are humanitarian needs arising from the recent storms and has proposed pre-positioning of stocks which could be released upon demand . The National Society has also highlighted the need to address the damage to livelihoods and the possibility of future storms during the current season . In order to have a more conclusive assessment of the humanitarian situation arising from the storms and to determine the capacity of the National Society to address existing and future gaps , a decision has been taken to place a disaster management ( DM ) specialist selected from the Regional Disaster Response Team ( RDRT ) with the MRCS for a period of 6 weeks . The DM specialist , who arrived on Wednesday 14 March , is expected to work closely with the MRCS and the International Federation staff in Madagascar . No full assessment of the impact of Cyclone Indlala can begin before Monday , 19 March , given the prevailing weather and road conditions . The Federation Indian Ocean Islands sub-regional office is in close contact with the French Red Cross - through the Indian Ocean Regional Disaster Response Platform ( PIROI ) ( 1 ) - who would be the first to intervene , should the Malagasy Red Cross Society request for assistance in carrying out an assessment . In the event that back up assessment resources would be required , an RDRT alert has been issued . There are plans to reactivate links with the West and Central Africa regional delegation as the majority of RDRT members from the latter delegation are French speaking . Should there not be an appropriate response to the RDRT alert , a Field Assessment and Co-ordination Team ( FACT ) could be deployed . Coordination The Malagasy Red Cross Society is working closely with the World Food Programme ( WFP ) which is intending to do food distributions targeting 2,348 families .

The Federation is not seeking funding or other assistance from donors for this operation at this time . Activities undertaken are aligned with the International Federation 's Global Agenda , which sets out four broad goals to meet the Federation 's mission to \" improve the lives of vulnerable people by mobilizing the power of humanity \" . Global Agenda Goals : Reduce the numbers of deaths , injuries and impact from disasters . Reduce the number of deaths , illnesses and impact from diseases and public health emergencies . Increase local community , civil society and Red Cross / Red Crescent capacity to address the most urgent situations of vulnerability . Reduce intolerance , discrimination and social exclusion and promote respect for diversity and human dignity . The Situation Cyclone Indlala hit the north- eastern coast of the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar on Thursday , 15 March 2007 . With strong winds up to 165 km /h , the cyclone is still ravaging the country and is expected to last until Sunday , 18 March . It is moving on a path towards the south west of Madagascar and has left considerable damage on the north east coastline . Roofs have been blown away and around 40 % of property in the town of Antalaha has been destroyed . About 90 % of the buildings at the town 's police station and CARE International offices have been damaged . Infrastructure such as water and electricity has also been affected . Displaced and affected people from Maroantsetra have gathered at the town 's municipal council hall . In Mananara North , rising water level in the river is threatening to cut off the area . Communication has been affected , denying small communities access to weather reports since the national radio has been off -air , in some areas , for the last two days . Authorities have considered closing schools in the area . Cyclone Indlala is the fifth cyclone that has hit / affected the country within the past three months : Cyclone Bondo made landfall on 25 December 2006 ; Cyclone Clovis on 3 January 2007 ; Cyclone Favio on 18 January 2007 ; and Cyclone Gamede on 26 February 2007 . This is the first time that the island has been struck by so many cyclones in such a short period . Seasonal rains have been made worse by the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) moving slightly south , resulting in continuous rains from the end of December 2006 to the present moment . The accumulated impact of all these cyclones is damage to infrastructure and crops , flooding , landslides and displacement of communities . The Government of Malagasy estimates that 293,000 people have been affected by the floods , with 32,000 displaced . More than 150,000 farming families have lost a total of 90,000 hectares of crop . Immediate needs include targeted food distribution to prevent malnutrition , essential drugs , water and sanitation . On 20 February 2007 , the Malagasy Government launched a US $ 242 million appeal . On 15 March 2007 , the United Nations and its humanitarian partners launched a Flash Appeal requesting nearly USD 9.6 million to provide aid to people affected by floods and cyclones for a period up to six months . Red Cross Action The Malagasy Red Cross Society ( MRCS ) has indicated that there are humanitarian needs arising from the recent storms and has proposed pre-positioning of stocks which could be released upon demand . The National Society has also highlighted the need to address the damage to livelihoods and the possibility of future storms during the current season . In order to have a more conclusive assessment of the humanitarian situation arising from the storms and to determine the capacity of the National Society to address existing and future gaps , a decision has been taken to place a disaster management ( DM ) specialist selected from the Regional Disaster Response Team ( RDRT ) with the MRCS for a period of 6 weeks . The DM specialist , who arrived on Wednesday 14 March , is expected to work closely with the MRCS and the International Federation staff in Madagascar . No full assessment of the impact of Cyclone Indlala can begin before Monday , 19 March , given the prevailing weather and road conditions . The Federation Indian Ocean Islands sub-regional office is in close contact with the French Red Cross - through the Indian Ocean Regional Disaster Response Platform ( PIROI ) ( 1 ) - who would be the first to intervene , should the Malagasy Red Cross Society request for assistance in carrying out an assessment . In the event that back up assessment resources would be required , an RDRT alert has been issued . There are plans to reactivate links with the West and Central Africa regional delegation as the majority of RDRT members from the latter delegation are French speaking . Should there not be an appropriate response to the RDRT alert , a Field Assessment and Co-ordination Team ( FACT ) could be deployed . Coordination The Malagasy Red Cross Society is working closely with the World Food Programme ( WFP ) which is intending to do food distributions targeting 2,348 families . Further co-ordination mechanisms are currently being explored with local actors and partners . As mentioned above , an assessment will be carried on the ground on Monday 19 March 2007 , after the cyclone passes .

From there , Tony Rosato took his zany writing and performing style to the small screen , winning fame on SCTV and later on Saturday Night Live . His off - the - wall characters ranged from fictional TV chef Marcello Sebastiano to Lou Costello , Captain Kangaroo and Yasser Arafat . Industry buzz pegged him as the next John Belushi . Rosato went on to perform in a variety of TV shows and movies . In 1989 he was nominated for the best-supporting - actor Gemini for his role as police informant Whitey in Night Heat . Then suddenly , two years ago , Rosato disappeared . Since then , the actor has been behind bars , with no trial , at the maximum - security Quinte Detention Centre in Napanee , 30 kilometres west of Kingston , on charges of criminally harassing his wife during their marriage . It 's alleged that his \" reckless \" behaviour led his spouse , Leah , with whom he has a now - 2 - year - old daughter , to be afraid for her own safety or others ' . According to his Toronto lawyer , Daniel Brodsky , Rosato was arrested after repeatedly complaining to police that , in a scenario reminiscent of the film Invasion of the Body Snatchers , the actor 's wife and their infant daughter had gone missing , having been replaced by imposters . The Italian -born , Toronto - based actor , now 53 , has had a bail hearing and a preliminary inquiry . Both of them are subject to publication bans . Arraignment documents show Rosato was denied bail almost three months after his arrest , after undergoing a mental fitness assessment . He has never had a bail review , and his trial ( by judge alone ) is n't scheduled until Nov. 13 . Rosato steadfastly maintains that he is sane , and innocent . \" I 'm not pleading guilty \u2013 I 'm fighting injustice \" has been his mantra in phone calls with show business friends . \" The situation is unbelievable , \" says Brodsky , who notes his client does n't have a criminal record and has never threatened to hurt anyone . \" It 's shocking . \" Rosato 's situation raises troubling questions . Why must he wait so long for a trial ? And if he is suffering from mental illness , why is n't he in a hospital room instead of a jail cell ? \" On the date of his trial Tony Rosato will have spent more time in custody on a harassment charge than any other convicted prisoner in Canada has ever spent on the same charges , \" says Brodsky , who took on Rosato 's case in March . \" On average , someone convicted of criminal harassment spends one day in jail and two years on probation . \" On the first day of Rosato 's trial , Brodsky \u2013 a founding member of the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted \u2013 plans to apply to have the case dismissed because of unreasonable delay and abuse of process in failing to get Rosato into a hospital . Brodsky explains that the Crown 's expert prison psychiatrist , Dr. Duncan Scott , has told him and the Crown \" that Tony Rosato is certifiable . \" Scott 's diagnosis , says Brodsky , is a mental illness called Capgras syndrome . Named for its discoverer , French psychiatrist Jean Marie Joseph Capgras , the syndrome is characterized by the delusion that a person or people have been replaced by doubles or impostors . The rare condition is most commonly associated with schizophrenia , but according to Dr. Graham Glancy , a forensic psychiatrist with Metro West Detention Centre and Maplehurst Correctional Complex , it can also be caused by metabolic diseases , delirium , brain injury or drugs such as cocaine . Kingston assistant Crown attorney Priscilla Christie has declined to talk about Rosato and referred questions to the Ministry of the Attorney General . It 's a \" complex \" case , says ministry spokesperson Brendan Crawley . Rosato , he continues , is viewed by the Crown as \" an allegedly dangerous person with mental health issues who has been charged with a crime . \" But if the Crown sees Rosato as mentally ill , then why has he been languishing in jail for two years instead of being moved to a hospital ? \" People who the Crown believes have mental disorders deserve much better , \" says Brodsky , a director of the Mental Health Legal Committee who has fought the criminalization of the mentally ill . But Crawley says \" the Criminal Code provides for a limited number of circumstances in which the court can order an accused person transferred from custody to a psychiatric facility . \" And , he continues , the Crown has taken \" every available step to ensure the fair treatment and placement of the accused , including taking steps to facilitate the transfer of the accused to a psychiatric hospital if possible . \" However , lawyer Anita Szigeti , former chair of the Mental Health Legal Committee , contends that the Crown could instead have hospitalized him under civil legislation . \" Criminal lawyers and Crowns in the traditional system are often unaware of the varied mechanisms under the Mental Health Act that can be employed for the hospitalization of individuals with mental health problems ... including people in jail , \" says Szigeti , co-author of A Guide to Consent and Capacity Law in Ontario , a book focusing on mental health and the law . Meanwhile , Crawley says the trial has been delayed \" to accommodate Rosato 's change of counsel . \" In fact , Rosato did go through six lawyers \u2013 he fired some and others quit \u2013 before hiring Brodsky . Crawley also observes that none of Rosato 's lawyers has requested a bail review , so that their client might wait for trial as a free man . Once he receives all the required documentation , Brodsky intends to apply for a bail review for Rosato . If his client is released on bail , says Brodsky , \" he will walk out the front door of the jail into the waiting arms of hospital psychiatric staff , where he 'll be detained until trial . \" Also puzzling to some in the legal profession is why Rosato 's case is being heard not in provincial court , where virtually all harassment cases are heard , but in Superior Court , where only the most serious cases go . \" It takes six to eight months longer , not including the trial , \" says Brodsky , \" and it costs at least three times more . \" \" I do n't think I 've ever known a criminal harassment case to be tried in Superior Court , \" says Felicity Hawthorn , an assistant Crown attorney in Lindsay , Ont. , and one of Rosato 's former lawyers who represented him at his preliminary inquiry last year and has since moved to the Crown 's office . \" It 's very odd ... \" Rosato 's friends in show business are appalled at the actor 's situation . \" It 's a travesty , \" says Andrew Alexander , the Chicago - based owner and CEO of Second City and producer of SCTV , who hired Rosato for stage and TV back in the late 1970s . \" It 's quite extraordinary that in the system he is just falling through the cracks ... Where he is now legally is obviously terrible . \" Even Rosato 's estranged wife , who says she was and is afraid of him , told the Star she 's \" shocked that it ( Rosato 's case ) has taken this long ... I want him to get mental help ... in a psychiatric hospital . \" Rosato 's legal woes began after his wife left him on Jan. 17 , 2005 , fleeing their Broadview Ave. apartment with their daughter , who was born the previous September , and eventually returning to her hometown of Kingston . \" She left him a note , \" says Tony 's devoted mother , 77- year - old Maria Rosato . \" Tony phoned me crying and sobbing . He thought maybe she 'd been kidnapped . \" But Leah Rosato told the Star that she had fled their home out of fear . \" I thought he was dangerous \u2013 that 's why I left him , \" she says softly . A couple of weeks after she left , on Feb. 3 , 2005 , Leah was granted an emergency motion for sole custody of their baby . An only child , Tony had immigrated to Canada from Naples with his parents when he was 4 ( his father subsequently returned to Italy for medical reasons ) . First , the family lived in Halifax , then Ottawa , and finally in Toronto , where he completed Grade 13 at Oakwood Collegiate and later studied sciences at the Scarborough campus of University of Toronto . ( As a young man he also worked part-time at the Star as a classified ad taker . ) At one point , recalls his mother , her son aspired to become a chiropractor . But he dropped out of university before graduating , having caught the acting bug after a night out at Second City . He 'd later perform onstage there , and on television with SCTV and Saturday Night Live . After Rosato 's SNL stint ( 1981 - 82 ) , he divided his time between Toronto and Los Angeles , until settling here four years ago . He met his wife to be , Leah Murray , who is 22 years his junior , in a Danforth Ave. coffee shop when she was visiting from Kingston . Leah , now 31 , told the Star in an interview that she fell \" deeply in love with him . \" After a whirlwind , three - month courtship straddling Toronto and the eastern Ontario city , they got married at Toronto City Hall on New Year 's Eve , 2003 . Friends say they found their witnesses outside , at the public skating rink . According to the actor 's widowed mother , Leah wanted to get into acting , and her son was on board to try and make that happen in L.A. After the marriage , the couple kept their separate residences in Toronto and Kingston . According to friend Adrian Truss , an actor ( the troupe Illustrated Men ) and writer , Tony was short of cash and was living with his mother . The couple spent weekends together . Leah was studying Catholicism at her husband 's request . Just before their baby 's birth , in September 2004 , Leah moved into a Broadview Ave. apartment with Tony . The actor 's friends say he behaved strangely once he and Leah were living together . Tony would n't allow anyone to come to their apartment . He made Leah give out a post-office - box address . Family and friends were told not to call ; he would call them . Tony told friends he was connected to higher energies and had \" information to save the planet , \" says his long - time friend Derek McGrath , who plays Rev. Magee in Little Mosque on the Prairie . Rosato believes he is \" the guardian of light , \" adds McGrath , who worked with Rosato at Second City and has supported the beleaguered actor through his legal travails , attending most of his court appearances with Tony 's cousin Lena DeCaria , a Mississauga banker . A letter Rosato wrote from jail on June 5 , 2005 , a month after his arrest , gives his version of what happened after the departure of Leah and the baby . It documents what he perceived as evidence that he was the victim of a \" fraudulent hoax \" \u2013 that his wife and daughter had been replaced by doubles . The CD wedding photos Leah left behind , Rosato wrote , proved the woman in the pictures was not his real wife but a \" twin . \" His real wife had obviously been replaced by a duplicate who was \" dressed identically \" to his wife . Rosato wrote that he went to Toronto and then Kingston police to tell them that his wife had been switched with an imposter . Kingston Det. Const. Jeff Smith told him to stay away from Leah . Rosato 's letter indicated that he visited Kingston police again after supervised visits with his baby in March and April 2005 . The first visit led him to complain in the letter that his daughter was \" clearly suffering from emotional and physical abuse , \" while during the second , he protested , he was presented with the wrong baby . As evidence , he brought police a photo of a \" wife look alike \" and of the baby from the second visit . The letter also indicates that , in desperation to find his wife , Rosato went on Citytv's Speaker 's Corner and consulted with Toronto \" spiritual channeler \" David Watson . Over the years , say Rosato 's friends , he frequently sought out spiritual and native healers . Contacted by the Star , Watson recalls that in spring 2005 , Rosato came to him for help . Watson says he found Rosato 's \" energies \" during this consultation \" far too disruptive , \" and refused to work with him again . Rosato 's letter details a series of phone calls with Det. Const . Smith , who asked him to go to Kingston \" to discuss the case . \" Arriving at the police station there , he was arrested and charged with public mischief and harassment , \" supposedly for dragging the police force into looking for my wife . \" Brodsky says those charges were eventually dropped , and instead Rosato was charged with criminally harassing his wife . Once in jail , Rosato phoned his mother and asked her to go to his apartment to feed his two cats , Feather and Krishna , she told the Star . She has kept them with her since her son 's arrest . A person with mental illness who gets arrested is often caught in a Catch - 22 . \" If you 're mentally ill in jail you 're likely to spend on average three times as long on remand and in some cases obviously it can go on longer and longer , \" says prison psychiatrist Glancy . \" You have to have assessments to see if you 're fit to stand trial . People do n't know where to put you afterwards . Mental hospitals wo n't readily take you ... so you get stuck in the system . \" Making things worse , says Glancy , is the fact that accused persons who suffer from mental illness are \" often difficult clients for lawyers , so they fire the lawyers . They represent themselves , and the whole thing gets to be a mess . \" He says jail is no place for someone with Capgras who gets in trouble with the law but is n't violent . Such a person \" should certainly be moved along to a mental hospital . \" Glancy , who has treated patients with Capgras syndrome , says that \" most cases would not be violent , but some would , \" depending on individual risk factors . Drug abuse , he says , would increase the \" potential violence . \" Rosato at one time admitted to being into hard drugs , says his friend Truss . But Rosato told him he 'd managed to kick the habit after leaving SNL , adds Truss , who met Rosato more than 20 years ago when the two were doing comedy auditions around the city . Rosato 's friends and colleagues in the entertainment industry want to know why he 's been in jail so long , and why he is n't in a hospital close to Toronto , where he 'd be close to his family and friends . \" Ca n't Canada do something for this troubled man , \" wonders screenwriter / actor Tim Kazurinsky , who was on Saturday Night Live with Rosato , and who co-wrote the movie About Last Night . \" Down here ( in the U.S ) people think , ` Canada : socialized medicine \u2013 they really care . ' I just thought that the Canadian system would be more understanding , particularly to one of Canada 's own who was a wonderful actor , wonderful performer who did Canada proud . \" He remembers Rosato as an enthusiastic performer and a loyal friend . Rosato once refused to do a sketch on Saturday Night Live that slammed the Blues Brothers ( John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd ) , the same night that Belushi was to host , Kazurinsky recalls . \" He was a very giving and sharing performer and person ... a moveable feast of a man . \" Comedian Andrea Martin , who worked with Rosato at Second City and on SCTV ( where her characters included station manager Edith Prickley ) , found him \" charming and funny and kind and full of comedic energy , \" she wrote to the Star in an email from L.A . \" It sickens me that Tony 's been lost in the judicial system ... \" Back in the late 1970s and early ' 80s , Rosato was a hot property , says Second City 's Andrew Alexander . \" He had a lot of early success . It happened pretty rapidly for him ... Tony had a real presence about him . \" There was a lot of chatter about him becoming the new John Belushi . \" In 1981 Rosato was picked up by Saturday Night Live , but he was fired after two seasons , at a time when the show was going through turmoil . Comedian Mary Gross told the Star that she protested Rosato 's firing to management , because she found Rosato \" sweet , very sensitive , very talented . \" She says she still uses a SNL clip of their parody of Mary Tyler Moore , with her as Mary Richards opposite Rosato 's Lou Grant , when interviewing for new jobs . Rosato went on to appear in numerous TV productions for seven years , including two Canadian series : Night Heat , where he played a police informer for five years , and Diamonds , where he had a two - year gig as a detective . Reached in his New York office , Sonny Grosso , executive producer of both series , said he considered Rosato \" a genius . \" Rosato was one of two people he would allow to change the dialogue in a script . \" Tony was just marvellous ... He always made it better ... He took a scene and made it real ... His facial attitudes , his body movements , he made you laugh . \" He was in the top echelons of actors in Canada . \" Rosato 's close friends say his personality started changing in the ' 90s while he was living in Los Angeles . That 's about the time Milton , Ont . - based screenwriter / actor Jeffrey Knight ( he played Dr. Sandor Winkler in Dan Aykroyd 's Psi Factor ) , a long - time friend , saw \" the seeds of Tony 's unravelling . \" Shortly after Rosato moved to back to Toronto four years ago , he phoned Knight in L.A. and begged him to find some crystals he 'd left behind in his former Studio City apartment . Rosato explained he needed the obelisk - shaped crystals \" to build a spiritual computer ... based on the theory of quantum physics , \" which could be a weapon for the CIA , he told Knight . \" There must have been 50 of them , easily weighing 100 pounds , \" says Knight , who sent them to Canada . While Rosato was still living in the United States , he suddenly became convinced his close friend , life coach Kit Wilkins , was \" poisoning his mind , \" Wilkins said from L.A. So Rosato told him he had made 13 phone calls \u2013 to the FBI , the IRS and the CIA . \" He said if I did n't start getting out of his mind he 'd turn me over to the authorities . \" At other times , recalls Wilkins , Rosato would \" tell me , crying and sobbing , that he met with the devil and the devil was whispering horrible things to him and that Christ had appeared and talked to him . \" At one point , Wilkins and another friend showed up at Rosato 's apartment to try to get him on a plane to Canada , where they thought \" medical service would be available . \" But Rosato believed it was a plot \" to do him in \" and would n't go with them . He left the next day on his own , says Wilkins . Grosso noticed a change in Rosato 's behaviour when the actor started phoning him after he appeared in the TV movie You Belong to Me ( out in 2002 ) . \" It was not Tony any more , \" he says . \" Something else had a grip on him ... People were following him ... they kidnapped his kid ... mystical nonsense . \" About three years ago , while doing some promotions for an SCTV DVD , Alexander , too , \" noticed something a little different \" about Rosato . But Rosato had work right up until he was jailed , on an animated series called Get Ed . The producer even held the part for him for two months , says Rosato 's agent , Larry Goldhar of The Characters Talent Agency . Both Goldhar and Fred Levy , Rosato 's accountant , have established Rosato hot lines in their offices so he can phone from jail whenever he wants . Although McGrath , Knight and Truss , Rosato 's closest friends , see Rosato as troubled , they also regard him as highly talented and a man of principle . Rosato always had \" this thing about how society has a responsibility to look after its clowns , \" Knight says . He was troubled by deaths of actors John Candy and John Belushi and felt they were n't looked after . In the letter from his cell , Rosato wrote , \" Please , I beg of you , look into this before I become like Jessica Lange , in Frances , \" referring to the film made about actress Frances Farmer , who was placed in a psychiatric institution after assaulting her hairdresser .

From there , Tony Rosato took his zany writing and performing style to the small screen , winning fame on SCTV and later on Saturday Night Live . His off - the - wall characters ranged from fictional TV chef Marcello Sebastiano to Lou Costello , Captain Kangaroo and Yasser Arafat . Industry buzz pegged him as the next John Belushi . Rosato went on to perform in a variety of TV shows and movies . In 1989 he was nominated for the best-supporting - actor Gemini for his role as police informant Whitey in Night Heat . Then suddenly , two years ago , Rosato disappeared . Since then , the actor has been behind bars , with no trial , at the maximum - security Quinte Detention Centre in Napanee , 30 kilometres west of Kingston , on charges of criminally harassing his wife during their marriage . It 's alleged that his \" reckless \" behaviour led his spouse , Leah , with whom he has a now - 2 - year - old daughter , to be afraid for her own safety or others ' . According to his Toronto lawyer , Daniel Brodsky , Rosato was arrested after repeatedly complaining to police that , in a scenario reminiscent of the film Invasion of the Body Snatchers , the actor 's wife and their infant daughter had gone missing , having been replaced by imposters . The Italian -born , Toronto - based actor , now 53 , has had a bail hearing and a preliminary inquiry . Both of them are subject to publication bans . Arraignment documents show Rosato was denied bail almost three months after his arrest , after undergoing a mental fitness assessment . He has never had a bail review , and his trial ( by judge alone ) is n't scheduled until Nov. 13 . Rosato steadfastly maintains that he is sane , and innocent . \" I 'm not pleading guilty \u2013 I 'm fighting injustice \" has been his mantra in phone calls with show business friends . \" The situation is unbelievable , \" says Brodsky , who notes his client does n't have a criminal record and has never threatened to hurt anyone . \" It 's shocking . \" Rosato 's situation raises troubling questions . Why must he wait so long for a trial ? And if he is suffering from mental illness , why is n't he in a hospital room instead of a jail cell ? \" On the date of his trial Tony Rosato will have spent more time in custody on a harassment charge than any other convicted prisoner in Canada has ever spent on the same charges , \" says Brodsky , who took on Rosato 's case in March . \" On average , someone convicted of criminal harassment spends one day in jail and two years on probation . \" On the first day of Rosato 's trial , Brodsky \u2013 a founding member of the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted \u2013 plans to apply to have the case dismissed because of unreasonable delay and abuse of process in failing to get Rosato into a hospital . Brodsky explains that the Crown 's expert prison psychiatrist , Dr. Duncan Scott , has told him and the Crown \" that Tony Rosato is certifiable . \" Scott 's diagnosis , says Brodsky , is a mental illness called Capgras syndrome . Named for its discoverer , French psychiatrist Jean Marie Joseph Capgras , the syndrome is characterized by the delusion that a person or people have been replaced by doubles or impostors . The rare condition is most commonly associated with schizophrenia , but according to Dr. Graham Glancy , a forensic psychiatrist with Metro West Detention Centre and Maplehurst Correctional Complex , it can also be caused by metabolic diseases , delirium , brain injury or drugs such as cocaine . Kingston assistant Crown attorney Priscilla Christie has declined to talk about Rosato and referred questions to the Ministry of the Attorney General . It 's a \" complex \" case , says ministry spokesperson Brendan Crawley . Rosato , he continues , is viewed by the Crown as \" an allegedly dangerous person with mental health issues who has been charged with a crime . \" But if the Crown sees Rosato as mentally ill , then why has he been languishing in jail for two years instead of being moved to a hospital ? \" People who the Crown believes have mental disorders deserve much better , \" says Brodsky , a director of the Mental Health Legal Committee who has fought the criminalization of the mentally ill . But Crawley says \" the Criminal Code provides for a limited number of circumstances in which the court can order an accused person transferred from custody to a psychiatric facility . \" And , he continues , the Crown has taken \" every available step to ensure the fair treatment and placement of the accused , including taking steps to facilitate the transfer of the accused to a psychiatric hospital if possible . \" However , lawyer Anita Szigeti , former chair of the Mental Health Legal Committee , contends that the Crown could instead have hospitalized him under civil legislation . \" Criminal lawyers and Crowns in the traditional system are often unaware of the varied mechanisms under the Mental Health Act that can be employed for the hospitalization of individuals with mental health problems ... including people in jail , \" says Szigeti , co-author of A Guide to Consent and Capacity Law in Ontario , a book focusing on mental health and the law . Meanwhile , Crawley says the trial has been delayed \" to accommodate Rosato 's change of counsel . \" In fact , Rosato did go through six lawyers \u2013 he fired some and others quit \u2013 before hiring Brodsky . Crawley also observes that none of Rosato 's lawyers has requested a bail review , so that their client might wait for trial as a free man . Once he receives all the required documentation , Brodsky intends to apply for a bail review for Rosato . If his client is released on bail , says Brodsky , \" he will walk out the front door of the jail into the waiting arms of hospital psychiatric staff , where he 'll be detained until trial . \" Also puzzling to some in the legal profession is why Rosato 's case is being heard not in provincial court , where virtually all harassment cases are heard , but in Superior Court , where only the most serious cases go . \" It takes six to eight months longer , not including the trial , \" says Brodsky , \" and it costs at least three times more . \" \" I do n't think I 've ever known a criminal harassment case to be tried in Superior Court , \" says Felicity Hawthorn , an assistant Crown attorney in Lindsay , Ont. , and one of Rosato 's former lawyers who represented him at his preliminary inquiry last year and has since moved to the Crown 's office . \" It 's very odd ... \" Rosato 's friends in show business are appalled at the actor 's situation . \" It 's a travesty , \" says Andrew Alexander , the Chicago - based owner and CEO of Second City and producer of SCTV , who hired Rosato for stage and TV back in the late 1970s . \" It 's quite extraordinary that in the system he is just falling through the cracks ... Where he is now legally is obviously terrible . \" Even Rosato 's estranged wife , who says she was and is afraid of him , told the Star she 's \" shocked that it ( Rosato 's case ) has taken this long ... I want him to get mental help ... in a psychiatric hospital . \" Rosato 's legal woes began after his wife left him on Jan. 17 , 2005 , fleeing their Broadview Ave. apartment with their daughter , who was born the previous September , and eventually returning to her hometown of Kingston . \" She left him a note , \" says Tony 's devoted mother , 77- year - old Maria Rosato . \" Tony phoned me crying and sobbing . He thought maybe she 'd been kidnapped . \" But Leah Rosato told the Star that she had fled their home out of fear . \" I thought he was dangerous \u2013 that 's why I left him , \" she says softly . A couple of weeks after she left , on Feb. 3 , 2005 , Leah was granted an emergency motion for sole custody of their baby . An only child , Tony had immigrated to Canada from Naples with his parents when he was 4 ( his father subsequently returned to Italy for medical reasons ) . First , the family lived in Halifax , then Ottawa , and finally in Toronto , where he completed Grade 13 at Oakwood Collegiate and later studied sciences at the Scarborough campus of University of Toronto . ( As a young man he also worked part-time at the Star as a classified ad taker . ) At one point , recalls his mother , her son aspired to become a chiropractor . But he dropped out of university before graduating , having caught the acting bug after a night out at Second City . He 'd later perform onstage there , and on television with SCTV and Saturday Night Live . After Rosato 's SNL stint ( 1981 - 82 ) , he divided his time between Toronto and Los Angeles , until settling here four years ago . He met his wife to be , Leah Murray , who is 22 years his junior , in a Danforth Ave. coffee shop when she was visiting from Kingston . Leah , now 31 , told the Star in an interview that she fell \" deeply in love with him . \" After a whirlwind , three - month courtship straddling Toronto and the eastern Ontario city , they got married at Toronto City Hall on New Year 's Eve , 2003 . Friends say they found their witnesses outside , at the public skating rink . According to the actor 's widowed mother , Leah wanted to get into acting , and her son was on board to try and make that happen in L.A. After the marriage , the couple kept their separate residences in Toronto and Kingston . According to friend Adrian Truss , an actor ( the troupe Illustrated Men ) and writer , Tony was short of cash and was living with his mother . The couple spent weekends together . Leah was studying Catholicism at her husband 's request . Just before their baby 's birth , in September 2004 , Leah moved into a Broadview Ave. apartment with Tony . The actor 's friends say he behaved strangely once he and Leah were living together . Tony would n't allow anyone to come to their apartment . He made Leah give out a post-office - box address . Family and friends were told not to call ; he would call them . Tony told friends he was connected to higher energies and had \" information to save the planet , \" says his long - time friend Derek McGrath , who plays Rev. Magee in Little Mosque on the Prairie . Rosato believes he is \" the guardian of light , \" adds McGrath , who worked with Rosato at Second City and has supported the beleaguered actor through his legal travails , attending most of his court appearances with Tony 's cousin Lena DeCaria , a Mississauga banker . A letter Rosato wrote from jail on June 5 , 2005 , a month after his arrest , gives his version of what happened after the departure of Leah and the baby . It documents what he perceived as evidence that he was the victim of a \" fraudulent hoax \" \u2013 that his wife and daughter had been replaced by doubles . The CD wedding photos Leah left behind , Rosato wrote , proved the woman in the pictures was not his real wife but a \" twin . \" His real wife had obviously been replaced by a duplicate who was \" dressed identically \" to his wife . Rosato wrote that he went to Toronto and then Kingston police to tell them that his wife had been switched with an imposter . Kingston Det. Const. Jeff Smith told him to stay away from Leah . Rosato 's letter indicated that he visited Kingston police again after supervised visits with his baby in March and April 2005 . The first visit led him to complain in the letter that his daughter was \" clearly suffering from emotional and physical abuse , \" while during the second , he protested , he was presented with the wrong baby . As evidence , he brought police a photo of a \" wife look alike \" and of the baby from the second visit . The letter also indicates that , in desperation to find his wife , Rosato went on Citytv's Speaker 's Corner and consulted with Toronto \" spiritual channeler \" David Watson . Over the years , say Rosato 's friends , he frequently sought out spiritual and native healers . Contacted by the Star , Watson recalls that in spring 2005 , Rosato came to him for help . Watson says he found Rosato 's \" energies \" during this consultation \" far too disruptive , \" and refused to work with him again . Rosato 's letter details a series of phone calls with Det. Const . Smith , who asked him to go to Kingston \" to discuss the case . \" Arriving at the police station there , he was arrested and charged with public mischief and harassment , \" supposedly for dragging the police force into looking for my wife . \" Brodsky says those charges were eventually dropped , and instead Rosato was charged with criminally harassing his wife . Once in jail , Rosato phoned his mother and asked her to go to his apartment to feed his two cats , Feather and Krishna , she told the Star . She has kept them with her since her son 's arrest . A person with mental illness who gets arrested is often caught in a Catch - 22 . \" If you 're mentally ill in jail you 're likely to spend on average three times as long on remand and in some cases obviously it can go on longer and longer , \" says prison psychiatrist Glancy . \" You have to have assessments to see if you 're fit to stand trial . People do n't know where to put you afterwards . Mental hospitals wo n't readily take you ... so you get stuck in the system . \" Making things worse , says Glancy , is the fact that accused persons who suffer from mental illness are \" often difficult clients for lawyers , so they fire the lawyers . They represent themselves , and the whole thing gets to be a mess . \" He says jail is no place for someone with Capgras who gets in trouble with the law but is n't violent . Such a person \" should certainly be moved along to a mental hospital . \" Glancy , who has treated patients with Capgras syndrome , says that \" most cases would not be violent , but some would , \" depending on individual risk factors . Drug abuse , he says , would increase the \" potential violence . \" Rosato at one time admitted to being into hard drugs , says his friend Truss . But Rosato told him he 'd managed to kick the habit after leaving SNL , adds Truss , who met Rosato more than 20 years ago when the two were doing comedy auditions around the city . Rosato 's friends and colleagues in the entertainment industry want to know why he 's been in jail so long , and why he is n't in a hospital close to Toronto , where he 'd be close to his family and friends . \" Ca n't Canada do something for this troubled man , \" wonders screenwriter / actor Tim Kazurinsky , who was on Saturday Night Live with Rosato , and who co-wrote the movie About Last Night . \" Down here ( in the U.S ) people think , ` Canada : socialized medicine \u2013 they really care . ' I just thought that the Canadian system would be more understanding , particularly to one of Canada 's own who was a wonderful actor , wonderful performer who did Canada proud . \" He remembers Rosato as an enthusiastic performer and a loyal friend . Rosato once refused to do a sketch on Saturday Night Live that slammed the Blues Brothers ( John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd ) , the same night that Belushi was to host , Kazurinsky recalls . \" He was a very giving and sharing performer and person ... a moveable feast of a man . \" Comedian Andrea Martin , who worked with Rosato at Second City and on SCTV ( where her characters included station manager Edith Prickley ) , found him \" charming and funny and kind and full of comedic energy , \" she wrote to the Star in an email from L.A . \" It sickens me that Tony 's been lost in the judicial system ... \" Back in the late 1970s and early ' 80s , Rosato was a hot property , says Second City 's Andrew Alexander . \" He had a lot of early success . It happened pretty rapidly for him ... Tony had a real presence about him . \" There was a lot of chatter about him becoming the new John Belushi . \" In 1981 Rosato was picked up by Saturday Night Live , but he was fired after two seasons , at a time when the show was going through turmoil . Comedian Mary Gross told the Star that she protested Rosato 's firing to management , because she found Rosato \" sweet , very sensitive , very talented . \" She says she still uses a SNL clip of their parody of Mary Tyler Moore , with her as Mary Richards opposite Rosato 's Lou Grant , when interviewing for new jobs . Rosato went on to appear in numerous TV productions for seven years , including two Canadian series : Night Heat , where he played a police informer for five years , and Diamonds , where he had a two - year gig as a detective . Reached in his New York office , Sonny Grosso , executive producer of both series , said he considered Rosato \" a genius . \" Rosato was one of two people he would allow to change the dialogue in a script . \" Tony was just marvellous ... He always made it better ... He took a scene and made it real ... His facial attitudes , his body movements , he made you laugh . \" He was in the top echelons of actors in Canada . \" Rosato 's close friends say his personality started changing in the ' 90s while he was living in Los Angeles . That 's about the time Milton , Ont . - based screenwriter / actor Jeffrey Knight ( he played Dr. Sandor Winkler in Dan Aykroyd 's Psi Factor ) , a long - time friend , saw \" the seeds of Tony 's unravelling . \" Shortly after Rosato moved to back to Toronto four years ago , he phoned Knight in L.A. and begged him to find some crystals he 'd left behind in his former Studio City apartment . Rosato explained he needed the obelisk - shaped crystals \" to build a spiritual computer ... based on the theory of quantum physics , \" which could be a weapon for the CIA , he told Knight . \" There must have been 50 of them , easily weighing 100 pounds , \" says Knight , who sent them to Canada . While Rosato was still living in the United States , he suddenly became convinced his close friend , life coach Kit Wilkins , was \" poisoning his mind , \" Wilkins said from L.A. So Rosato told him he had made 13 phone calls \u2013 to the FBI , the IRS and the CIA . \" He said if I did n't start getting out of his mind he 'd turn me over to the authorities . \" At other times , recalls Wilkins , Rosato would \" tell me , crying and sobbing , that he met with the devil and the devil was whispering horrible things to him and that Christ had appeared and talked to him . \" At one point , Wilkins and another friend showed up at Rosato 's apartment to try to get him on a plane to Canada , where they thought \" medical service would be available . \" But Rosato believed it was a plot \" to do him in \" and would n't go with them . He left the next day on his own , says Wilkins . Grosso noticed a change in Rosato 's behaviour when the actor started phoning him after he appeared in the TV movie You Belong to Me ( out in 2002 ) . \" It was not Tony any more , \" he says . \" Something else had a grip on him ... People were following him ... they kidnapped his kid ... mystical nonsense . \" About three years ago , while doing some promotions for an SCTV DVD , Alexander , too , \" noticed something a little different \" about Rosato . But Rosato had work right up until he was jailed , on an animated series called Get Ed . The producer even held the part for him for two months , says Rosato 's agent , Larry Goldhar of The Characters Talent Agency . Both Goldhar and Fred Levy , Rosato 's accountant , have established Rosato hot lines in their offices so he can phone from jail whenever he wants . Although McGrath , Knight and Truss , Rosato 's closest friends , see Rosato as troubled , they also regard him as highly talented and a man of principle . Rosato always had \" this thing about how society has a responsibility to look after its clowns , \" Knight says . He was troubled by deaths of actors John Candy and John Belushi and felt they were n't looked after . In the letter from his cell , Rosato wrote , \" Please , I beg of you , look into this before I become like Jessica Lange , in Frances , \" referring to the film made about actress Frances Farmer , who was placed in a psychiatric institution after assaulting her hairdresser . His friends tell him not to give up hope , and say his ordeal would make a great screenplay . In fact , Rosato has told Brodsky : \" I 'm already working on it . It 's a docudrama . But I have to tone it down . No one will believe it . \"","annotations":[{"text":"Tony Rosato","span":[81,91],"token_span":[17,18],"role":"Experiencer","label":"Experiencer","role_definition":"The Experiencer is in an undesirable Situation."},{"text":"trouble","span":[13535,13541],"token_span":[2640,2640],"role":"Situation","label":"Situation","role_definition":"This role identifies the undesirable Situation the Experiencer is in."},{"text":"two years ago","span":[603,615],"token_span":[115,117],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"Thiis role identifies the Time when the Situation is in effect."},{"text":"the police station","span":[12275,12292],"token_span":[2388,2390],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the Situation occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-2705-764-frame-Presence","frame":"Presence","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Entity exists at a particular Location, at a particular Time, as observed by an implicit observer.","frame_ancestors":["Being_located","State"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"In 1989 , a Swedish version of the song \u2013 titled \" En g\u00e5ng i livet \" ( \" Once in a Lifetime \" ) \u2013 had been released as the title track to a studio album by singer- songwriter Niklas Str\u00f6mstedt .

Lars - Erik , Thomas , Judith , Colin & Paul gathered in the virtual TDR newsroom to write up this special review on Roxette 's brand - new album ! It 's been a long , long time ( It 's been a while and lots of miles \u2026 ) coming but here we are \u2026 a brand new studio album from Roxette . Years of speculation on Roxette 's future have ended with the release of Charm School and the upcoming World Tour . As for the album itself , it has so many trademark Roxette sounds , yet is totally new and it feels great to have real instruments again on some of the songs . Most fans we 're sure will love it , but obviously there will always be some who wo n't . Our review is quite lengthy , but it 's been 10 years since we 've had a chance to do one of these . Anyway , song by song review time : \u201c WAY OUT \u201d Colin : A Roxette album that starts with a mouth harp \u2013 that must be a first ! The first verse really has that Aerosol Grey Machine studio sound and then at the catchy chorus the heavier guitars kick in . The song has a really positive vibe to it and to me it feels like a sequel to \u201c June Afternoon \u201d \u2013 awesome ! Thomas : \u201c We will we will rock you ! \u201d drums . Love those guitars . And it must be Per playing that first weee - wah - wah - wah - wa after the first chorus ! They also used a mouth harp in \u201c I Remember You \u201d if you remember . Colin : Oh I do remember ! That was my first Roxette song \u2013 loved it ! Paul : This song reminds me more of \u201c Stupid \u201d from The World According To Gessle . The drum beat is very similar indeed . Lars - Erik : You know you 're right ! I thought this had a familiar sound to it and that was it ! Paul : Not a typical Rox-album -opener really . I was expecting something along the lines of \u201c Crush On You \u201d or \u201c Real Sugar \u201d , so this came as a surprise \u2026 a nice surprise . The song , as with a few others on the album , is too short though . A Marie middle -8 would have fixed that problem Mr G! Thomas : 2.46 ?? That 's barely longer than \u201c H\u00e4r kommer alla k\u00e4nslorna \u201d . Judith : Now that you mention this song , I keep having this one in mind when I listen to some of the tracks on this album . It must be the happy mood . This album has a lot of the Roxette sound we know , but yet we get to hear some new sounds we never heard with Roxette before . This is one example . Great guitars and opener ! I am glad that Per realized he can use and experiment with his voice a lot more than he used to ! I must say both sing wonderfully on this album . I think this is a wonderful album so you wo n't get much negative points from my side , I am afraid . The only one is that the album is too short ! I want more !! 2 - 3 more songs would have done it . Thomas : Yes , what else is there to add ? This is one of my favorites as well , maybe even \u201c The Favorite \u201d and I had hoped the whole album had been a bit more like this song . Colin : Definitely one of my favorites too , after listening to the albums a few times this is the chorus that really keeps hanging around in my head ! Lars - Erik : Nobody 's mentioned the ending \u2026 I really like it ! I think the distorted guitar there is cool ! Thomas : Yes we did ! We all felt it came way too soon ! \u201c NO ONE MAKES IT ON HER OWN \u201d Paul : Roxette is the only band who can do these types of songs , and do them well . Thomas : Yes , it 's like Per says , only he can do a Per Gessle -song ( like it should sound ) . Others have tried and I guess we all know how that turned out \u2026 Paul : Marie 's vocals on this are great , I love the way her voice sounds a little different to previous albums . To me , it sounds more natural and ' live ' , just like Pearls of Passion recordings . I think there are parts of the song which may refer to her illness . Judith : I agree with Paul , Marie sounds like on the live album and tour last year . Very touching song and Marie is top notch ! Actually , after having heard these two songs , you know you are in for a treat : vocals , music , production . Thomas : I have to say even though Marie sings beautifully and the lyrics are nice , this song does n't move me as much I thought it would . It 's not that I do n't like it , but already at track 2 it feels , to me , like an album filler . The piano and the bass is very Lennon & McCartney and so is the guitar solo . Colin : I agree . the song has a laid back feeling and surely it has a strong message but honestly I this is a track I 'll skip most of the time . It might grow on me though over time . Lars - Erik : Filler ?!? I do n't think too many people will agree with you on that . Thomas : I 'm sure I 'll get some flak over it , I 'm used to that . Lars - Erik : This is definitely a strong song with stand - alone qualities . I love the way the lyrics transition from \u201c her own \u201d at the beginning of the song to \u201c their own \u201d at the end \u2026 from a personal reflection to a generic , universal truth . I think the song resonates , long after the music is over . Paul : I did n't notice that transition . Well spotted ! \u201c SHE'S GOT NOTHING ON ( BUT THE RADIO ) \u201d Lars - Erik : This is n't the first time this famous Marilyn Monroe quote has been used to inspire a song , but of the ones I know about , this one certainly has the most energy . That hook certainly is infectious ! Thomas : Marilyn Monroe ? Lars - Erik : Yeah \u2026 she was asked at a press conference about upcoming photos of her that were to appear in the one of the very first issues of Playboy magazine . A reporter asked what , if anything , she was wearing at the photoshoot . \u201c It 's not true that I had nothing on . I had the radio on , \u201d was her reply ! Paul : From the moment I heard the chorus I knew that Roxette had come back with a great song . This might have worked better as the opening song of the album , seems its in an odd place at number 3 . But it 's a great song , and I ca n't wait to see them perform it live this summer ! Plus , I actually like the video \u2026 Judith : Loved this one from the beginning , different , crazy , but still , Roxettish . My favorite part is the first one with the \u201c really ? \u201d \u2013 this is so much funny teasing Roxette ! And Marie's . Colin : The first time I heard the song 's first few seconds it really reminded me of \u201c Thai With A Twist \u201d , it has that \u201c Spegelboll \u201d disco - like feeling . A good choice for a first single with a fresh Roxette sound but it sounds a bit overproduced . Thomas : The guitars could 've been more prominent . Judith : I have a major problem with all tracks on this album , they are addictive and wo n't leave your head .. found myself humming all the tunes now and then . Thomas : Yes , although so far not a hit in Sweden , and I do n't know if the charts down in Europe are \u201c real \u201d charts or fan voted . I really like this song , especially the catchy chorus . Per obviously sings this and it has a lot of machines , almost like \u201c Crush On You \u201d but more softly produced . Basically nonsense lyrics like \u201c The Look \u201d or \u201c Joyride \u201d but that 's what we want on a Roxette album , no ? There are remixes coming soon , by the way . \u201c SPEAK TO ME \u201d Colin : While the guitar riffs during the verse remind me of \u201c ( Do You Get ) Excited ? \u201d , the overall atmosphere and feeling of this beautiful duet brings back the Pearls of Passion feeling but with a much more modern , grown up sound . Thumbs up for C&C \u2013 great job of getting back some of that ' old Rox sound ' ! Thomas : Yes , this makes me also think about the Pearls of Passion era , but more modern . One of my top three with the pumping bass in the background and the keyboards all over the place . Did anyone else notice the \u201c You Ca n't Put Your Arms Around What 's Already Gone \u201d reference in the last verse / chorus ? Judith : Yes ! I thought ha ! Roxette doing a cameo of themselves ? Paul : No . What reference ? Thomas : \u201c Sank like a stone \u201d , same words , same intonation , same sound ! No ? Paul : * Goes and has a listen * Well , maybe . Just maybe though . Thomas : Yeah I may be over- interpreting it \u2026 Judith : Reminds me of \u201c I 'm sorry \u201d , \u201c ( Do You Get ) Excited ? \u201d . Marie 's ( backing ) vocals \u201c oohh yeah \u201d , \u201c ooh .. \u201d .. you cannot resist that ! Paul : Anyway , who 'd of thought Roxette still had this in them ? C&C&P certainly did a great production on this one . The song is amazing , and it NEEDS to be a single . Maybe the first single release in the UK perhaps ?? This could easily have been on their Crash ! Boom ! Bang ! album and I think this could ( if it was promoted blah blah blah ) have a chance of being their biggest UK single since \u201c Wish I Could Fly . \u201d Wonder what it 'll sound like live ?? Colin : I could n't agree more with you Paul , this is an epic song and needs to be on the radio ! Thomas : I do hope that countries get to choose singles somewhat more freely . Some songs work better in certain territories . Paul : The perception of Roxette in the UK is mainly ballads , and I think that this song will give them their best chance . \u201c Radio \u201d would n't be a success at all , I do n't think . Thomas : By the way , the vinyl version is slowed down . That will be interesting to hear . Lars - Erik : I stopped at this track , and listened to it over and over again \u2026 conjuring up images and directing the music video version in my head . I just love this song , and especially like the way Marie 's voice is introduced with a \u201c zoom \u201d effect . \u201c I'M GLAD YOU CALLED \u201d Lars - Erik : Rain . Thunder . It makes for an effective segue between these two songs . But really , other than Mystic Moods Orchestra , I do n't know of any group with more references to rain on their albums than Roxette . Paul : I loved the Party Crasher version . This is the song that I listen to the least at the moment . Maybe its because its not a brand new song ? It reminds me of \u201c First Girl On The Moon \u201d , and I did n't like that one at first , so maybe this is a grower ? Marie 's vocals are clearly recorded live and left untouched , something which proves how good her voice still is . Judith : I thought we would get the song as we know it from Party Crasher , so when I heard the first words sung by Marie , it simply blew me away , my reaction was \u201c OH \u201d \u2013 ( more ) tears followed . It 's like Marie is singing in your ear , so soft , so touching . St\u00e5p\u00e4ls ! [ Gunde Svan ] Makes me think it would be great to hear Roxette unplugged again . Thomas : I like it , but I like the Crasher version better . This is a soft , acoustic version with Per on the guitar and Marie on very fragile , lovely vocals . Apparently Per et. al. hated the Crasher version \u2026 What 's extra nice about Roxette 's version is the Beatles - esque strings that start sneaking in during the second verse . Very \u201c She 's Leaving Home \u201d and \u201c Eleanor Rigby \u201d I think . A combination of the two versions would be most interesting . Lars - Erik : Yes , \u201c fragile \u201d and \u201c left untouched \u201d are both apt descriptions of Marie 's voice here . I 'm surprised actually at how unpolished it was left to sound at the very beginning . It almost sounds as if she had really been crying just before starting to sing this song . Paul : Gives it a lovely touch though . \u201c ONLY WHEN I DREAM \u201d Colin : For the past few years the demo of this song ( Have A Nice Day era ) has been one of my favorites . the addition of Marie 's voice really makes the song feel complete \u2013 better and stronger than before . Another great duet on this album ! Thomas : I never really liked the demo , it felt like a failed attempt to do an ABBA song . But when I hear this it 's like it 's a different song . Of course , that 's what Per wanted it to be . Also one of my top three songs . Lars - Erik : I did n't like it much on first listen , especially the \u201c One Wish \u201d - like intro , but having played it repeatedly now , I like it a lot . Thomas : Maybe they could 've upped the drums a bit , that 's all . I think Chris mixes drums too low constantly . Great acoustic guitar in the background . Paul : I think it would have been better with more electric guitar in the chorus rather than acoustic ? Thomas : Maybe you 're right . Classic Roxette at any rate . Paul : This is a cracker of a song though . One of my favorites on the album actually . Never knew there was a demo floating round though . Thomas : Ca n't really say it 's ' floating around ' \u2026 Paul : Hmmph ! Anyway . I love the way Marie and Per 's voices combine in this song . Sort of a \u201c Things Will Never Be The Same \u201d vibe going on . And one of the best middle -8 sections that Per has ever written . Maybe could do with a small instrumental section after the middle -8 but that 's just me being picky . Some people are never happy ! Ha Ha ! Judith : I have n't known this song before ( I think ? ) . It 's great to hear both sing in a song together again and again on this album . I love Marie 's longing voice , desperated , which proves once again Marie is simply one of the best singers around . Roxette is back ! Ah , and Per 's voice is top notch ! \u201c DREAM ON \u201d Paul : Son Of A Plumber : The Sequel anyone ? I like it . However , as you know , I am more of a Per-solo fan anyway , and this sounds like it could have been on SOAP . The first of the double A-side together with \u201c After All \u201d ? Beatles -esque , Summery , and very Gessle ! Judith : Typical sweet cute sing - along pop Gessle song . I am glad to get to hear this on a Roxette album as well , with Marie on the bridge . Fantastic . Getting back to the unplugged I mentioned before \u2026 Another great vocal performance of Per. Thomas : Perfect song ! Almost Gyllene Tider sounding . Or Tom Petty if you will . Lots of acoustic and dry electric guitars . Probably not a hit in a million years , but one of the best on the album . Judith : This is where I get the H\u00e4r kommer alla \u2026 feeling again . Colin : Yes , it definitely has a cozy summery Gyllene Tider / SOAP feeling to it . Good stuff ! Lars - Erik : Yeah , I like it a lot also ! It 's got this folksy quality that 's hard to resist . Ca n't say I really understand ( or like ) the gun reference though . Judith : Sing along ! \u201c BIG BLACK CADILLAC \u201d Colin : When I first read the track listing for the new album , I asked myself whether Per had chosen to re-record the early Gyllene Tider song \u201c Cadillac \u201d but ( luckily ) this is a brand new song ! I really like the dirty synth sound . The chorus is really catchy , it has that The World According to Gessle feeling to it ! Thomas : That was of course not a Gyllene Tider song at all , but a Hepstars cover . Paul : \u201c Black-black - black - black - black ! \u201d The 'either Love-it-or - hate - it ' track on the album . The \u201c Stars \u201d or \u201c Make My Head Go Pop \u201c if you will . I 'm not a huge fan of either of those two , but I love \u201c Big Black Cadillac \u201d . If it was n't for Marie singing the chorus , I think it would fall a bit flat , but she brings the life that 's needed into a song like this . Try it loud in car \u2013 it works !! And it actually features the lyrics ' Bubble gum in my hair ' \u2013 what is there not to like !? Thomas : All of it ? Paul : Well , I like it ! It 's a bit of fun . Judith : I could n't stop laughing the first time I heard this song . Craziness reloaded ! I am glad they are still doing these kind of tracks . I would love to see a video for this song ! Thomas : Really do n't like this song !! It does n't fit the album in any way . It 's \u201c Make My Head Go Pop \u201d but gone sour . Paul : Seems I 'm on my own with liking this song then ! Judith : No , your are not . I always liked these crazy tracks they do . I would just like to see some videos of the recordings , must have been fun . Thomas : Brits \u2026 I never really cared for \u201c Stars \u201d either , except on the dance floor . Paul : Do n't mention \u201c Stars \u201d to me . I still have n't forgiven them for it ! ha ha. Colin : I 'm with you Paul ! \u201c IN MY OWN WAY \u201d Colin : Jill Johnson eat your heart out ! A really smooth ballad , it 's great to hear Marie 's voice this strong . If I got goosebumps just listening to the record , I imagine this will be great to hear live . Paul : This hidden gem from 1984 has been reworked and finally found its place on an album . I 'm glad they left it until now as the way Marie sings it gave me goosebumps also the first time I heard it . It sounds like such a classic Roxette ballad and I ca n't wait to hear it sung live this summer . Reminds me of \u201c Crash ! Boom ! Bang ! \u201d ( the song ) and REM 's \u201c Everybody Hurts \u201d . I love it ! Judith : After the first listenings I thought the song does n't really fit to the album . Maybe because the other songs have something new , and this is \u201c just \u201d a classic Roxette ballad . Or maybe it 's in the wrong order . It does n't mean I do n't like the song . I think Marie sings wonderfully , goosebumps all the way ! Thomas : I 'm with you , I love the song , but it does n't fit in , at least not in that spot on the album . One neat thing is the unusual key change at the end of the song ! Of course heard at least in two other versions by fans ; first in Swedish ( \u201c En g\u00e5ng i livet \u201d ) by Niklas Str\u00f6mstedt and then again in English by Jill Johnson , whose version is much more country . Jill 's album is nowhere to be found though . \u201c AFTER ALL \u201d Colin : \u201c Ooh-ooh - ooh \u201d , tambourines and a sixties style guitar make this such a happy song \u2013 it just makes you smile . \u201c Life goes on , after all \u201d indeed ! Paul : The other half of \u201c Dream On \u201d ( see above ) . I actually prefer this one to \u201c Dream On \u201d and I think it 's sits well in between \u201c \u201d In My Own Way \u201d and \u201c Happy On The Outside \u201d . It 's the last bit of fun ' 60s , 12 string pop on the album . Judith : A Beatles tribute . Who does n't like this kind of sound ? A bit The World According to Gessle too , which can only be positive . I think I can hear Christopher on the backing vocals . Thomas : While I 'm not opposed to the song per se , it 's not a favorite of mine . It 's not Roxette enough in my ears . A decent Per-track with lots of Paul McCartney draped all over it . It feels like a discarded SOAP song ( it is n't ) . Judith : On the other hand , it 's nice to hear this sound by Roxette as well . Change . \u201c HAPPY ON THE OUTSIDE \u201d Paul : Before I heard the song I guessed that the lyrics would be ' I 'm happy on the outside , but I 'm sad on the inside ' . Turns out I was pretty close ! Pretty standard mid-tempo track really . Not a favorite of mine . There is always a song on a Roxette album that I do n't like at first and then it grows on me . Maybe this is that one ? Judith : Yeah , I had the same feeling about this one too , but meanwhile I am glad to hear it at the end of the album . Thomas : I think this track or the next is OK by their own , not both in a row . I like hearing one and feel ' yes , decent track ' but when they both come together it 's too much , they are too similar . Then one of them becomes a filler . I do n't want fillers . If I have to choose , \u201c Happy \u201d is my winner . Colin : I totally agree with you , Thomas ! Judith : I think here we are again , the album misses 2 - 3 more tracks . We never have enough , do we ? \u201c SITTING ON TOP OF THE WORLD \u201d Paul : I always love Roxette 's closing tracks . This sits lovely alongside \u201c Perfect Day \u201d , \u201c Queen of Rain \u201d , \u201c Go To Sleep \u201d etc . A nice little middle 8 section as well , and this song just works . It 's quiet , hopeful and Marie sounds great as usual . A nice closer . Judith : Typical album closer for a Roxette album with Marie , just as you mentioned , Paul . Actually I think we get two this time , this one and \u201c Happy on the outside \u201d \u2013 even though the message is totally different . I could of course listen to Marie endlessly , so I wo n't complain . Colin : I feel that \u201c Happy \u201d would 've made a nice closer , honestly this track seems more like a b-side to me . Thomas : I like it , but like I said , two in a row \u2026 CONCLUSION Thomas : Well , Roxette is back , no doubt . Before I conclude I must point out that basically all songs on the album actually have endings !! Almost no fade outs whatsoever . While Expressen 's Nunstedt gives the album 2 out of 5 I think he 's overly negative , which is something he usually is if it is n't H\u00e5kan Hellstr\u00f6m , Robyn or Eurovision . However , he feels this album could have been so much more , and with that I agree . This is , in my opinion a decent album , it is not a Joyride by any stretch . It beats Room Service , but if it had n't beaten that album I do n't know what would have . Paul : I never knew Room Service was so disliked ! Thomas : I wo n't say I disliked it , but it 's not the album I put on first if you know what I mean . Now , Per sings like he always does \u2013 great , Marie is back to her former self and also sings beautifully . It 's the songs and production that I feel lack . Songs are good , but could be even better . The production is professional and slick , but we know this team and sound already \u2013 C&C&P. Remember what you told me Per ? You need to re-shuffle your team once in a while . No more resting on your laurels now , take it to the next level . Even so I think fans will love it , but it wo n't be collecting any new ones . I give it 3/5 . Paul : I agree , Thomas : Roxette is back . It 's a good album , better than I expected actually , but it 's not their best . But I do think that this is the best that they could 've done whilst using the same production team . Thomas : Yes I agree to some extent , fresh blood \u2026 Judith : I also think it 's a nice album , and actually for Roxette a step forward with some new sounds and back to the roots with guitars and real instruments . Maybe in a whole , taking into account all Per solo albums from the past years there is no big change , but I always missed Marie 's input in SOAP or Party Crasher , so for me here it is , finally . Maybe for the next album it will be time to re-shuffle . Paul : Also , an uptempo Marie - led track , \u00e0 la \u201c Sleeping In My Car \u201d is missing . If there is to be another album after the tour , then things needs to be shaken up to make it sound as fresh as Have A Nice Day did back in 1999 . Both Per and Marie sound great on this album though , and there certainly are some real gems on here . My score 4/5 . Judith : Now that you mention it , yes , more Marie up - tempo would have been nice . We get to hear her on \u201c Cadillac \u201d , though . Colin : For me it 's 4 out of 5 as well . Roxette is back with a new and fresh sound , but this time they should n't wait that long to make a new album ! Maybe recording \u00e0 la Tourism during the upcoming world tour might be a good idea ? Maybe it 's not necessarily fresh blood that 's needed but more old blood ? I 'd love to hear Anders Herrlin back in production , as well as MP ! Judith : For me it 's also 4 out of 5 . I think the word is magic . It 's back . As I mentioned , I feel the album is too short for my taste . And if I want to be picky , I would have liked to hear Jonas ( and maybe Anders , as you say ) guitars . And I am all for a Tourism 2 followed by some unplugged shows . On a side note , as much as I disliked Have A Nice Day or Room Service back then , I have been listening to those a lot lately and I like them . Time changes everything . Lars - Erik : I 'm surprised how much of our conversation has been so matter - of - fact . We 've treated this as normal review \u2026 but yet , we all know that this is anything but a normal release . This album to many , many fans represents a miracle \u2026. a wish fulfilled that barely seemed possible at one time . But gradually , our prayers were answered \u2026 and our wishes grew from fleeting fantasies to real possibilities . I 'm simply delighted with this album . I think we all are . PS . The deluxe edition of the album is shipped in an \u201c eco \u201d packaging , while the regular edition comes in a jewel case . The live album that comes with the deluxe album is by no means a crappy bonus . A vibrant Roxette performs on the short summer \u201c tour \u201d last year . If you can , get the deluxe edition .

Lars - Erik , Thomas , Judith , Colin & Paul gathered in the virtual TDR newsroom to write up this special review on Roxette 's brand - new album ! It 's been a long , long time ( It 's been a while and lots of miles \u2026 ) coming but here we are \u2026 a brand new studio album from Roxette . Years of speculation on Roxette 's future have ended with the release of Charm School and the upcoming World Tour . As for the album itself , it has so many trademark Roxette sounds , yet is totally new and it feels great to have real instruments again on some of the songs . Most fans we 're sure will love it , but obviously there will always be some who wo n't . Our review is quite lengthy , but it 's been 10 years since we 've had a chance to do one of these . Anyway , song by song review time : \u201c WAY OUT \u201d Colin : A Roxette album that starts with a mouth harp \u2013 that must be a first ! The first verse really has that Aerosol Grey Machine studio sound and then at the catchy chorus the heavier guitars kick in . The song has a really positive vibe to it and to me it feels like a sequel to \u201c June Afternoon \u201d \u2013 awesome ! Thomas : \u201c We will we will rock you ! \u201d drums . Love those guitars . And it must be Per playing that first weee - wah - wah - wah - wa after the first chorus ! They also used a mouth harp in \u201c I Remember You \u201d if you remember . Colin : Oh I do remember ! That was my first Roxette song \u2013 loved it ! Paul : This song reminds me more of \u201c Stupid \u201d from The World According To Gessle . The drum beat is very similar indeed . Lars - Erik : You know you 're right ! I thought this had a familiar sound to it and that was it ! Paul : Not a typical Rox-album -opener really . I was expecting something along the lines of \u201c Crush On You \u201d or \u201c Real Sugar \u201d , so this came as a surprise \u2026 a nice surprise . The song , as with a few others on the album , is too short though . A Marie middle -8 would have fixed that problem Mr G! Thomas : 2.46 ?? That 's barely longer than \u201c H\u00e4r kommer alla k\u00e4nslorna \u201d . Judith : Now that you mention this song , I keep having this one in mind when I listen to some of the tracks on this album . It must be the happy mood . This album has a lot of the Roxette sound we know , but yet we get to hear some new sounds we never heard with Roxette before . This is one example . Great guitars and opener ! I am glad that Per realized he can use and experiment with his voice a lot more than he used to ! I must say both sing wonderfully on this album . I think this is a wonderful album so you wo n't get much negative points from my side , I am afraid . The only one is that the album is too short ! I want more !! 2 - 3 more songs would have done it . Thomas : Yes , what else is there to add ? This is one of my favorites as well , maybe even \u201c The Favorite \u201d and I had hoped the whole album had been a bit more like this song . Colin : Definitely one of my favorites too , after listening to the albums a few times this is the chorus that really keeps hanging around in my head ! Lars - Erik : Nobody 's mentioned the ending \u2026 I really like it ! I think the distorted guitar there is cool ! Thomas : Yes we did ! We all felt it came way too soon ! \u201c NO ONE MAKES IT ON HER OWN \u201d Paul : Roxette is the only band who can do these types of songs , and do them well . Thomas : Yes , it 's like Per says , only he can do a Per Gessle -song ( like it should sound ) . Others have tried and I guess we all know how that turned out \u2026 Paul : Marie 's vocals on this are great , I love the way her voice sounds a little different to previous albums . To me , it sounds more natural and ' live ' , just like Pearls of Passion recordings . I think there are parts of the song which may refer to her illness . Judith : I agree with Paul , Marie sounds like on the live album and tour last year . Very touching song and Marie is top notch ! Actually , after having heard these two songs , you know you are in for a treat : vocals , music , production . Thomas : I have to say even though Marie sings beautifully and the lyrics are nice , this song does n't move me as much I thought it would . It 's not that I do n't like it , but already at track 2 it feels , to me , like an album filler . The piano and the bass is very Lennon & McCartney and so is the guitar solo . Colin : I agree . the song has a laid back feeling and surely it has a strong message but honestly I this is a track I 'll skip most of the time . It might grow on me though over time . Lars - Erik : Filler ?!? I do n't think too many people will agree with you on that . Thomas : I 'm sure I 'll get some flak over it , I 'm used to that . Lars - Erik : This is definitely a strong song with stand - alone qualities . I love the way the lyrics transition from \u201c her own \u201d at the beginning of the song to \u201c their own \u201d at the end \u2026 from a personal reflection to a generic , universal truth . I think the song resonates , long after the music is over . Paul : I did n't notice that transition . Well spotted ! \u201c SHE'S GOT NOTHING ON ( BUT THE RADIO ) \u201d Lars - Erik : This is n't the first time this famous Marilyn Monroe quote has been used to inspire a song , but of the ones I know about , this one certainly has the most energy . That hook certainly is infectious ! Thomas : Marilyn Monroe ? Lars - Erik : Yeah \u2026 she was asked at a press conference about upcoming photos of her that were to appear in the one of the very first issues of Playboy magazine . A reporter asked what , if anything , she was wearing at the photoshoot . \u201c It 's not true that I had nothing on . I had the radio on , \u201d was her reply ! Paul : From the moment I heard the chorus I knew that Roxette had come back with a great song . This might have worked better as the opening song of the album , seems its in an odd place at number 3 . But it 's a great song , and I ca n't wait to see them perform it live this summer ! Plus , I actually like the video \u2026 Judith : Loved this one from the beginning , different , crazy , but still , Roxettish . My favorite part is the first one with the \u201c really ? \u201d \u2013 this is so much funny teasing Roxette ! And Marie's . Colin : The first time I heard the song 's first few seconds it really reminded me of \u201c Thai With A Twist \u201d , it has that \u201c Spegelboll \u201d disco - like feeling . A good choice for a first single with a fresh Roxette sound but it sounds a bit overproduced . Thomas : The guitars could 've been more prominent . Judith : I have a major problem with all tracks on this album , they are addictive and wo n't leave your head .. found myself humming all the tunes now and then . Thomas : Yes , although so far not a hit in Sweden , and I do n't know if the charts down in Europe are \u201c real \u201d charts or fan voted . I really like this song , especially the catchy chorus . Per obviously sings this and it has a lot of machines , almost like \u201c Crush On You \u201d but more softly produced . Basically nonsense lyrics like \u201c The Look \u201d or \u201c Joyride \u201d but that 's what we want on a Roxette album , no ? There are remixes coming soon , by the way . \u201c SPEAK TO ME \u201d Colin : While the guitar riffs during the verse remind me of \u201c ( Do You Get ) Excited ? \u201d , the overall atmosphere and feeling of this beautiful duet brings back the Pearls of Passion feeling but with a much more modern , grown up sound . Thumbs up for C&C \u2013 great job of getting back some of that ' old Rox sound ' ! Thomas : Yes , this makes me also think about the Pearls of Passion era , but more modern . One of my top three with the pumping bass in the background and the keyboards all over the place . Did anyone else notice the \u201c You Ca n't Put Your Arms Around What 's Already Gone \u201d reference in the last verse / chorus ? Judith : Yes ! I thought ha ! Roxette doing a cameo of themselves ? Paul : No . What reference ? Thomas : \u201c Sank like a stone \u201d , same words , same intonation , same sound ! No ? Paul : * Goes and has a listen * Well , maybe . Just maybe though . Thomas : Yeah I may be over- interpreting it \u2026 Judith : Reminds me of \u201c I 'm sorry \u201d , \u201c ( Do You Get ) Excited ? \u201d . Marie 's ( backing ) vocals \u201c oohh yeah \u201d , \u201c ooh .. \u201d .. you cannot resist that ! Paul : Anyway , who 'd of thought Roxette still had this in them ? C&C&P certainly did a great production on this one . The song is amazing , and it NEEDS to be a single . Maybe the first single release in the UK perhaps ?? This could easily have been on their Crash ! Boom ! Bang ! album and I think this could ( if it was promoted blah blah blah ) have a chance of being their biggest UK single since \u201c Wish I Could Fly . \u201d Wonder what it 'll sound like live ?? Colin : I could n't agree more with you Paul , this is an epic song and needs to be on the radio ! Thomas : I do hope that countries get to choose singles somewhat more freely . Some songs work better in certain territories . Paul : The perception of Roxette in the UK is mainly ballads , and I think that this song will give them their best chance . \u201c Radio \u201d would n't be a success at all , I do n't think . Thomas : By the way , the vinyl version is slowed down . That will be interesting to hear . Lars - Erik : I stopped at this track , and listened to it over and over again \u2026 conjuring up images and directing the music video version in my head . I just love this song , and especially like the way Marie 's voice is introduced with a \u201c zoom \u201d effect . \u201c I'M GLAD YOU CALLED \u201d Lars - Erik : Rain . Thunder . It makes for an effective segue between these two songs . But really , other than Mystic Moods Orchestra , I do n't know of any group with more references to rain on their albums than Roxette . Paul : I loved the Party Crasher version . This is the song that I listen to the least at the moment . Maybe its because its not a brand new song ? It reminds me of \u201c First Girl On The Moon \u201d , and I did n't like that one at first , so maybe this is a grower ? Marie 's vocals are clearly recorded live and left untouched , something which proves how good her voice still is . Judith : I thought we would get the song as we know it from Party Crasher , so when I heard the first words sung by Marie , it simply blew me away , my reaction was \u201c OH \u201d \u2013 ( more ) tears followed . It 's like Marie is singing in your ear , so soft , so touching . St\u00e5p\u00e4ls ! [ Gunde Svan ] Makes me think it would be great to hear Roxette unplugged again . Thomas : I like it , but I like the Crasher version better . This is a soft , acoustic version with Per on the guitar and Marie on very fragile , lovely vocals . Apparently Per et. al. hated the Crasher version \u2026 What 's extra nice about Roxette 's version is the Beatles - esque strings that start sneaking in during the second verse . Very \u201c She 's Leaving Home \u201d and \u201c Eleanor Rigby \u201d I think . A combination of the two versions would be most interesting . Lars - Erik : Yes , \u201c fragile \u201d and \u201c left untouched \u201d are both apt descriptions of Marie 's voice here . I 'm surprised actually at how unpolished it was left to sound at the very beginning . It almost sounds as if she had really been crying just before starting to sing this song . Paul : Gives it a lovely touch though . \u201c ONLY WHEN I DREAM \u201d Colin : For the past few years the demo of this song ( Have A Nice Day era ) has been one of my favorites . the addition of Marie 's voice really makes the song feel complete \u2013 better and stronger than before . Another great duet on this album ! Thomas : I never really liked the demo , it felt like a failed attempt to do an ABBA song . But when I hear this it 's like it 's a different song . Of course , that 's what Per wanted it to be . Also one of my top three songs . Lars - Erik : I did n't like it much on first listen , especially the \u201c One Wish \u201d - like intro , but having played it repeatedly now , I like it a lot . Thomas : Maybe they could 've upped the drums a bit , that 's all . I think Chris mixes drums too low constantly . Great acoustic guitar in the background . Paul : I think it would have been better with more electric guitar in the chorus rather than acoustic ? Thomas : Maybe you 're right . Classic Roxette at any rate . Paul : This is a cracker of a song though . One of my favorites on the album actually . Never knew there was a demo floating round though . Thomas : Ca n't really say it 's ' floating around ' \u2026 Paul : Hmmph ! Anyway . I love the way Marie and Per 's voices combine in this song . Sort of a \u201c Things Will Never Be The Same \u201d vibe going on . And one of the best middle -8 sections that Per has ever written . Maybe could do with a small instrumental section after the middle -8 but that 's just me being picky . Some people are never happy ! Ha Ha ! Judith : I have n't known this song before ( I think ? ) . It 's great to hear both sing in a song together again and again on this album . I love Marie 's longing voice , desperated , which proves once again Marie is simply one of the best singers around . Roxette is back ! Ah , and Per 's voice is top notch ! \u201c DREAM ON \u201d Paul : Son Of A Plumber : The Sequel anyone ? I like it . However , as you know , I am more of a Per-solo fan anyway , and this sounds like it could have been on SOAP . The first of the double A-side together with \u201c After All \u201d ? Beatles -esque , Summery , and very Gessle ! Judith : Typical sweet cute sing - along pop Gessle song . I am glad to get to hear this on a Roxette album as well , with Marie on the bridge . Fantastic . Getting back to the unplugged I mentioned before \u2026 Another great vocal performance of Per. Thomas : Perfect song ! Almost Gyllene Tider sounding . Or Tom Petty if you will . Lots of acoustic and dry electric guitars . Probably not a hit in a million years , but one of the best on the album . Judith : This is where I get the H\u00e4r kommer alla \u2026 feeling again . Colin : Yes , it definitely has a cozy summery Gyllene Tider / SOAP feeling to it . Good stuff ! Lars - Erik : Yeah , I like it a lot also ! It 's got this folksy quality that 's hard to resist . Ca n't say I really understand ( or like ) the gun reference though . Judith : Sing along ! \u201c BIG BLACK CADILLAC \u201d Colin : When I first read the track listing for the new album , I asked myself whether Per had chosen to re-record the early Gyllene Tider song \u201c Cadillac \u201d but ( luckily ) this is a brand new song ! I really like the dirty synth sound . The chorus is really catchy , it has that The World According to Gessle feeling to it ! Thomas : That was of course not a Gyllene Tider song at all , but a Hepstars cover . Paul : \u201c Black-black - black - black - black ! \u201d The 'either Love-it-or - hate - it ' track on the album . The \u201c Stars \u201d or \u201c Make My Head Go Pop \u201c if you will . I 'm not a huge fan of either of those two , but I love \u201c Big Black Cadillac \u201d . If it was n't for Marie singing the chorus , I think it would fall a bit flat , but she brings the life that 's needed into a song like this . Try it loud in car \u2013 it works !! And it actually features the lyrics ' Bubble gum in my hair ' \u2013 what is there not to like !? Thomas : All of it ? Paul : Well , I like it ! It 's a bit of fun . Judith : I could n't stop laughing the first time I heard this song . Craziness reloaded ! I am glad they are still doing these kind of tracks . I would love to see a video for this song ! Thomas : Really do n't like this song !! It does n't fit the album in any way . It 's \u201c Make My Head Go Pop \u201d but gone sour . Paul : Seems I 'm on my own with liking this song then ! Judith : No , your are not . I always liked these crazy tracks they do . I would just like to see some videos of the recordings , must have been fun . Thomas : Brits \u2026 I never really cared for \u201c Stars \u201d either , except on the dance floor . Paul : Do n't mention \u201c Stars \u201d to me . I still have n't forgiven them for it ! ha ha. Colin : I 'm with you Paul ! \u201c IN MY OWN WAY \u201d Colin : Jill Johnson eat your heart out ! A really smooth ballad , it 's great to hear Marie 's voice this strong . If I got goosebumps just listening to the record , I imagine this will be great to hear live . Paul : This hidden gem from 1984 has been reworked and finally found its place on an album . I 'm glad they left it until now as the way Marie sings it gave me goosebumps also the first time I heard it . It sounds like such a classic Roxette ballad and I ca n't wait to hear it sung live this summer . Reminds me of \u201c Crash ! Boom ! Bang ! \u201d ( the song ) and REM 's \u201c Everybody Hurts \u201d . I love it ! Judith : After the first listenings I thought the song does n't really fit to the album . Maybe because the other songs have something new , and this is \u201c just \u201d a classic Roxette ballad . Or maybe it 's in the wrong order . It does n't mean I do n't like the song . I think Marie sings wonderfully , goosebumps all the way ! Thomas : I 'm with you , I love the song , but it does n't fit in , at least not in that spot on the album . One neat thing is the unusual key change at the end of the song ! Of course heard at least in two other versions by fans ; first in Swedish ( \u201c En g\u00e5ng i livet \u201d ) by Niklas Str\u00f6mstedt and then again in English by Jill Johnson , whose version is much more country . Jill 's album is nowhere to be found though . \u201c AFTER ALL \u201d Colin : \u201c Ooh-ooh - ooh \u201d , tambourines and a sixties style guitar make this such a happy song \u2013 it just makes you smile . \u201c Life goes on , after all \u201d indeed ! Paul : The other half of \u201c Dream On \u201d ( see above ) . I actually prefer this one to \u201c Dream On \u201d and I think it 's sits well in between \u201c \u201d In My Own Way \u201d and \u201c Happy On The Outside \u201d . It 's the last bit of fun ' 60s , 12 string pop on the album . Judith : A Beatles tribute . Who does n't like this kind of sound ? A bit The World According to Gessle too , which can only be positive . I think I can hear Christopher on the backing vocals . Thomas : While I 'm not opposed to the song per se , it 's not a favorite of mine . It 's not Roxette enough in my ears . A decent Per-track with lots of Paul McCartney draped all over it . It feels like a discarded SOAP song ( it is n't ) . Judith : On the other hand , it 's nice to hear this sound by Roxette as well . Change . \u201c HAPPY ON THE OUTSIDE \u201d Paul : Before I heard the song I guessed that the lyrics would be ' I 'm happy on the outside , but I 'm sad on the inside ' . Turns out I was pretty close ! Pretty standard mid-tempo track really . Not a favorite of mine . There is always a song on a Roxette album that I do n't like at first and then it grows on me . Maybe this is that one ? Judith : Yeah , I had the same feeling about this one too , but meanwhile I am glad to hear it at the end of the album . Thomas : I think this track or the next is OK by their own , not both in a row . I like hearing one and feel ' yes , decent track ' but when they both come together it 's too much , they are too similar . Then one of them becomes a filler . I do n't want fillers . If I have to choose , \u201c Happy \u201d is my winner . Colin : I totally agree with you , Thomas ! Judith : I think here we are again , the album misses 2 - 3 more tracks . We never have enough , do we ? \u201c SITTING ON TOP OF THE WORLD \u201d Paul : I always love Roxette 's closing tracks . This sits lovely alongside \u201c Perfect Day \u201d , \u201c Queen of Rain \u201d , \u201c Go To Sleep \u201d etc . A nice little middle 8 section as well , and this song just works . It 's quiet , hopeful and Marie sounds great as usual . A nice closer . Judith : Typical album closer for a Roxette album with Marie , just as you mentioned , Paul . Actually I think we get two this time , this one and \u201c Happy on the outside \u201d \u2013 even though the message is totally different . I could of course listen to Marie endlessly , so I wo n't complain . Colin : I feel that \u201c Happy \u201d would 've made a nice closer , honestly this track seems more like a b-side to me . Thomas : I like it , but like I said , two in a row \u2026 CONCLUSION Thomas : Well , Roxette is back , no doubt . Before I conclude I must point out that basically all songs on the album actually have endings !! Almost no fade outs whatsoever . While Expressen 's Nunstedt gives the album 2 out of 5 I think he 's overly negative , which is something he usually is if it is n't H\u00e5kan Hellstr\u00f6m , Robyn or Eurovision . However , he feels this album could have been so much more , and with that I agree . This is , in my opinion a decent album , it is not a Joyride by any stretch . It beats Room Service , but if it had n't beaten that album I do n't know what would have . Paul : I never knew Room Service was so disliked ! Thomas : I wo n't say I disliked it , but it 's not the album I put on first if you know what I mean . Now , Per sings like he always does \u2013 great , Marie is back to her former self and also sings beautifully . It 's the songs and production that I feel lack . Songs are good , but could be even better . The production is professional and slick , but we know this team and sound already \u2013 C&C&P. Remember what you told me Per ? You need to re-shuffle your team once in a while . No more resting on your laurels now , take it to the next level . Even so I think fans will love it , but it wo n't be collecting any new ones . I give it 3/5 . Paul : I agree , Thomas : Roxette is back . It 's a good album , better than I expected actually , but it 's not their best . But I do think that this is the best that they could 've done whilst using the same production team . Thomas : Yes I agree to some extent , fresh blood \u2026 Judith : I also think it 's a nice album , and actually for Roxette a step forward with some new sounds and back to the roots with guitars and real instruments . Maybe in a whole , taking into account all Per solo albums from the past years there is no big change , but I always missed Marie 's input in SOAP or Party Crasher , so for me here it is , finally . Maybe for the next album it will be time to re-shuffle . Paul : Also , an uptempo Marie - led track , \u00e0 la \u201c Sleeping In My Car \u201d is missing . If there is to be another album after the tour , then things needs to be shaken up to make it sound as fresh as Have A Nice Day did back in 1999 . Both Per and Marie sound great on this album though , and there certainly are some real gems on here . My score 4/5 . Judith : Now that you mention it , yes , more Marie up - tempo would have been nice . We get to hear her on \u201c Cadillac \u201d , though . Colin : For me it 's 4 out of 5 as well . Roxette is back with a new and fresh sound , but this time they should n't wait that long to make a new album ! Maybe recording \u00e0 la Tourism during the upcoming world tour might be a good idea ? Maybe it 's not necessarily fresh blood that 's needed but more old blood ? I 'd love to hear Anders Herrlin back in production , as well as MP ! Judith : For me it 's also 4 out of 5 . I think the word is magic . It 's back . As I mentioned , I feel the album is too short for my taste . And if I want to be picky , I would have liked to hear Jonas ( and maybe Anders , as you say ) guitars . And I am all for a Tourism 2 followed by some unplugged shows . On a side note , as much as I disliked Have A Nice Day or Room Service back then , I have been listening to those a lot lately and I like them . Time changes everything . Lars - Erik : I 'm surprised how much of our conversation has been so matter - of - fact . We 've treated this as normal review \u2026 but yet , we all know that this is anything but a normal release . This album to many , many fans represents a miracle \u2026. a wish fulfilled that barely seemed possible at one time . But gradually , our prayers were answered \u2026 and our wishes grew from fleeting fantasies to real possibilities . I 'm simply delighted with this album . I think we all are . PS . The deluxe edition of the album is shipped in an \u201c eco \u201d packaging , while the regular edition comes in a jewel case . The live album that comes with the deluxe album is by no means a crappy bonus . A vibrant Roxette performs on the short summer \u201c tour \u201d last year . If you can , get the deluxe edition .

It appears that ancient Britons invented this skill for themselves - as David Keys explains . A team of archaeologists , led by Dr Mike Parker Pearson of Sheffield University , has recently found the remains of what are believed to be two mummified Bronze Age bodies , buried under the floor of a prehistoric house at Cladh Hallan on the Hebridean Island of South Uist . The house in which the mummy skeletons were buried was part of a unique Bronze Age complex , which is as mysterious as the preserved corpses that were buried there . The skeletons looked very unusual ... like Peruvian mummies The find is the first evidence of deliberate mummification carried out in ancient times ever found in Britain - and is without doubt one of the most important archaeological discoveries made in recent years . No mummified body tissue had survived - so it was not immediately obvious to the excavators what they had found , when they first came across two skeletons at Cladh Hallan . They did , however , think the skeletons looked very unusual , being very highly flexed , like Peruvian mummies . The sinews and skin had been deliberately preserved Several months of detailed scientific tests followed , including radio carbon dating of the bones and of other materials from the site . The first suggestion that the skeletons had actually come from mummified bodies arose when the radio carbon dates came back from the laboratory . To the astonishment of the archaeologists , they saw that one individual ( a male ) had died in around 1,600 BC - but had been buried a full six centuries later , in around 1,000 BC . What is more , a second individual ( a female ) had died in around 1,300 BC - and had had to wait 300 years before being interred . The archaeologists thought this strange . They had never encountered anything like it before . If the skeletons had been left unburied for 600 or 300 years they would have ended up as just a pile of bones . It seemed that perhaps in some way the sinews and skin had been deliberately preserved , to permanently hold the skeletons together . The researchers began to wonder whether they had come across Britain 's first mummies . Next came the second piece of startling evidence . If indeed the uncovered bones had once belonged to mummified bodies , then how had the mummification been carried out ? Bearing in mind the technologies and resources available in Britain during the Bronze Age , there were three main options . Firstly there was the possibility that the bodies had been smoked to preserve them . Certainly people of the Bronze Age had the technology for that procedure , and indeed the archaeologists discovered a smokery on the Clad Hallan site - but it dated from 1100 and 800 years , respectively , after the individuals had died .

Certainly people of the Bronze Age had the technology for that procedure , and indeed the archaeologists discovered a smokery on the Clad Hallan site - but it dated from 1100 and 800 years , respectively , after the individuals had died . Secondly , the bodies could have been wind - dried , and there is certainly prehistoric archaeological evidence that shows that people in some parts of Scotland 's Western Isles did use wind - drying techniques to preserve meat ( especially large sea birds ) , in ancient and in later times . Whether their killers intended ( them to ) be preserved for eternity is not known Thirdly , the South Uist bodies could have been preserved by being placed temporarily in a peat bog . It is known that prehistoric people knew the preservative properties of certain types of peat bog and that they used it , in later prehistory , in Scotland and Ireland to preserve butter and tallow . What 's more , the bodies of sacrificial or ritual murder victims ( mainly from the Iron Age ) have been found preserved in peat bogs in Britain and in continental Europe . Whether their killers intended that their victims should be preserved for eternity , however , is not known . It was this third option that was most easy to test for , using modern forensic techniques . When a body is placed in the right sort of peat bog , its skin and sinews are tanned in much the same way that animal skin is turned into leather . The bone is also altered , and it becomes demineralised . The longer it is kept in the peat bog , the deeper into the bone the demineralisation process penetrates . If a peat bog had been used simply to preserve an individual sufficiently to keep the skeleton permanently in place ( ie to preserve the person 's skin and sinews ) , then the body would only have needed to stay in the bog for between 6 and 18 months , and that would have resulted in the demineralisation of only the outer few millimetres of bone . Extraordinarily , that is precisely what the forensic tests showed had occurred . The scientific analysis revealed that just the outer 2 mm of the bone had been demineralised . Lastly , subsequent forensic tests revealed a third and final piece of evidence for mummification . Lastly , subsequent forensic tests revealed a third and final piece of evidence for mummification . The technique used to reveal this is based on the fact that , after death , the bacteria in the gut start devouring the body and attacking the skeleton . The bacterial onslaught changes the bone by riddling it with tiny holes . The degree of bacterial damage can then be tested to a high degree of accuracy by a forensic procedure known to scientists as mercury porosimetry . The corpses had not been allowed to decompose for long A piece of bone , the volume of which has been very accurately measured , is placed inside a container of known volume . Mercury is then forced into the container under pressure . Some of the mercury enters the tiny holes made by the bacteria - and the scientists can then measure how much mercury has penetrated into the bone and therefore how much bacterial attack took place . In the case of the two South Uist skeletons , the test revealed a very low level of bacterial attack - a level consistent with the body being placed in a peat bog a day or two after death . The test suggested very strongly that the corpses had not been allowed to decompose for long . It indicated that the process of decomposition had been halted at an early stage - presumably when the body was placed in the peat bog , or perhaps if it had been eviscerated prior to immersion in the bog . The archaeologists have now virtually proved that the two South Uist skeletons came from mummified bodies - and that they had remained unburied for 600 and 300 years respectively . But why their contemporaries wanted to mummify them is a complete mystery . The archaeologists have now virtually proved that the two South Uist skeletons came from mummified bodies - and that they had remained unburied for 600 and 300 years respectively . But why their contemporaries wanted to mummify them is a complete mystery . Motives for body preservation vary from place to place and period to period around the world . In ancient Egypt , people were mummified in order to help them attain eternal life . In ancient Peru , the Inca emperors were mummified so that they could continue to play their part in society . Indeed their mummified corpses even attended special state banquets . It is conceivable that the ... mummies were important ancestral figures In the Amazon jungle some tribes ' mummified ' the heads of their enemies and kept them in their own homes - where their identity and spiritual strength could be expropriated by the kin of those who had killed them . In Tibet and Japan holy men were mummified , while in various other areas revered ancestors were preserved for posterity - and no doubt consulted on important tribal matters . In prehistoric Britain there was a tradition of reverence towards ancestors , so it is conceivable that the South Uist mummies were important ancestral figures . As such , the tribe or clan may have seen them as having had protective powers or even the ability to intervene with the gods or cosmic spirits on behalf of their people . It is probable that the preserved bodies were kept over the centuries in some sort of mummy house - a special dwelling to accommodate ancestors , probably both male and female . But in a sense the role the mummies performed is only part of the conundrum of Cladh Hallan . The complex was made up of seven houses arranged as a terrace . The archaeologists have so far excavated three of them - and the dig has revealed that the structures were used not just as dwellings but also as places of ritual activity . The complex was made up of seven houses arranged as a terrace . The archaeologists have so far excavated three of them - and the dig has revealed that the structures were used not just as dwellings but also as places of ritual activity . When the complex was constructed in around 1,000 BC , the two by then rather ancient mummies , along with the body of an entire sheep ( possibly a sacrifice ) , were buried under the floor of the most northerly house . At around the same time an unmummified 13 - year - old girl who had recently died was buried under the floor of the middle house . Underneath the southernmost of the three excavated structures , a three month old child was also interred around 1,000 BC . Also round 1,000 , in the northernmost structure , a ritual was carried out in which large quantities of pottery were deliberately smashed . Over the next few hundred years rituals continued in the northern and middle structures . A few years or decades later the cremated bones of some children were interred in the northern house ( the one with the mummies under the floor ) . Then a couple of decades later still , more cremated children 's bones were deposited in the house , along with several deliberately smashed pots and three smashed quern stones . A group of unfired smashed pots was then stacked up against the inside of the house wall and subsequently the entire house was moved one metre east and rebuilt , with a bronze bracelet being deposited , probably to mark the occasion . At around the same time the southern house was dismantled . Over the next few hundred years rituals continued in the northern and middle structures . In around 900 BC , for instance , a baby was buried in the north house and the building was again moved and rebuilt - this time two metres further west . Over the years , in the two remaining houses , more pottery was deliberately smashed , and antlers , pots and bone tools were buried . More animals were also sacrificed - a sheep and two dogs . After several more deconstruction and reconstruction episodes , the north house was finally abandoned in around 700 BC - but the middle structure continued in ritual use until around 400 BC , making it the longest used house known from British prehistory .

Were they members of some ritual elite , potentially priests or shamans ? The range of ritual activity in the complex is among the broadest known . It raises the question of whether the site was primarily a domestic / residential one or primarily a ritual and religious one . Who were the people that lived there ? Were they ordinary Bronze Age tribes - people - or were they members of some ritual elite , potentially priests or shamans ? And were the people who lived in the complex part of the same ethnic / tribal group whose ancestors had been preserved and been venerated over the centuries ? Or were they new arrivals or settlers , who had displaced the original ' mummy- venerating ' population and had expropriated not only their land but their ancestors as well ? Only future archaeological investigations will stand a chance of answering these tantalising questions . But , for the time being , the discovery of Britain 's first mummies should start to redefine key aspects of life and death in prehistoric Britain .

It appears that ancient Britons invented this skill for themselves - as David Keys explains . A team of archaeologists , led by Dr Mike Parker Pearson of Sheffield University , has recently found the remains of what are believed to be two mummified Bronze Age bodies , buried under the floor of a prehistoric house at Cladh Hallan on the Hebridean Island of South Uist . The house in which the mummy skeletons were buried was part of a unique Bronze Age complex , which is as mysterious as the preserved corpses that were buried there . The skeletons looked very unusual ... like Peruvian mummies The find is the first evidence of deliberate mummification carried out in ancient times ever found in Britain - and is without doubt one of the most important archaeological discoveries made in recent years . No mummified body tissue had survived - so it was not immediately obvious to the excavators what they had found , when they first came across two skeletons at Cladh Hallan . They did , however , think the skeletons looked very unusual , being very highly flexed , like Peruvian mummies . The sinews and skin had been deliberately preserved Several months of detailed scientific tests followed , including radio carbon dating of the bones and of other materials from the site . The first suggestion that the skeletons had actually come from mummified bodies arose when the radio carbon dates came back from the laboratory . To the astonishment of the archaeologists , they saw that one individual ( a male ) had died in around 1,600 BC - but had been buried a full six centuries later , in around 1,000 BC . What is more , a second individual ( a female ) had died in around 1,300 BC - and had had to wait 300 years before being interred . The archaeologists thought this strange . They had never encountered anything like it before . If the skeletons had been left unburied for 600 or 300 years they would have ended up as just a pile of bones . It seemed that perhaps in some way the sinews and skin had been deliberately preserved , to permanently hold the skeletons together . The researchers began to wonder whether they had come across Britain 's first mummies . Next came the second piece of startling evidence . If indeed the uncovered bones had once belonged to mummified bodies , then how had the mummification been carried out ? Bearing in mind the technologies and resources available in Britain during the Bronze Age , there were three main options . Firstly there was the possibility that the bodies had been smoked to preserve them . Certainly people of the Bronze Age had the technology for that procedure , and indeed the archaeologists discovered a smokery on the Clad Hallan site - but it dated from 1100 and 800 years , respectively , after the individuals had died .

Certainly people of the Bronze Age had the technology for that procedure , and indeed the archaeologists discovered a smokery on the Clad Hallan site - but it dated from 1100 and 800 years , respectively , after the individuals had died . Secondly , the bodies could have been wind - dried , and there is certainly prehistoric archaeological evidence that shows that people in some parts of Scotland 's Western Isles did use wind - drying techniques to preserve meat ( especially large sea birds ) , in ancient and in later times . Whether their killers intended ( them to ) be preserved for eternity is not known Thirdly , the South Uist bodies could have been preserved by being placed temporarily in a peat bog . It is known that prehistoric people knew the preservative properties of certain types of peat bog and that they used it , in later prehistory , in Scotland and Ireland to preserve butter and tallow . What 's more , the bodies of sacrificial or ritual murder victims ( mainly from the Iron Age ) have been found preserved in peat bogs in Britain and in continental Europe . Whether their killers intended that their victims should be preserved for eternity , however , is not known . It was this third option that was most easy to test for , using modern forensic techniques . When a body is placed in the right sort of peat bog , its skin and sinews are tanned in much the same way that animal skin is turned into leather . The bone is also altered , and it becomes demineralised . The longer it is kept in the peat bog , the deeper into the bone the demineralisation process penetrates . If a peat bog had been used simply to preserve an individual sufficiently to keep the skeleton permanently in place ( ie to preserve the person 's skin and sinews ) , then the body would only have needed to stay in the bog for between 6 and 18 months , and that would have resulted in the demineralisation of only the outer few millimetres of bone . Extraordinarily , that is precisely what the forensic tests showed had occurred . The scientific analysis revealed that just the outer 2 mm of the bone had been demineralised . Lastly , subsequent forensic tests revealed a third and final piece of evidence for mummification . Lastly , subsequent forensic tests revealed a third and final piece of evidence for mummification . The technique used to reveal this is based on the fact that , after death , the bacteria in the gut start devouring the body and attacking the skeleton . The bacterial onslaught changes the bone by riddling it with tiny holes . The degree of bacterial damage can then be tested to a high degree of accuracy by a forensic procedure known to scientists as mercury porosimetry . The corpses had not been allowed to decompose for long A piece of bone , the volume of which has been very accurately measured , is placed inside a container of known volume . Mercury is then forced into the container under pressure . Some of the mercury enters the tiny holes made by the bacteria - and the scientists can then measure how much mercury has penetrated into the bone and therefore how much bacterial attack took place . In the case of the two South Uist skeletons , the test revealed a very low level of bacterial attack - a level consistent with the body being placed in a peat bog a day or two after death . The test suggested very strongly that the corpses had not been allowed to decompose for long . It indicated that the process of decomposition had been halted at an early stage - presumably when the body was placed in the peat bog , or perhaps if it had been eviscerated prior to immersion in the bog . The archaeologists have now virtually proved that the two South Uist skeletons came from mummified bodies - and that they had remained unburied for 600 and 300 years respectively . But why their contemporaries wanted to mummify them is a complete mystery . The archaeologists have now virtually proved that the two South Uist skeletons came from mummified bodies - and that they had remained unburied for 600 and 300 years respectively . But why their contemporaries wanted to mummify them is a complete mystery . Motives for body preservation vary from place to place and period to period around the world . In ancient Egypt , people were mummified in order to help them attain eternal life . In ancient Peru , the Inca emperors were mummified so that they could continue to play their part in society . Indeed their mummified corpses even attended special state banquets . It is conceivable that the ... mummies were important ancestral figures In the Amazon jungle some tribes ' mummified ' the heads of their enemies and kept them in their own homes - where their identity and spiritual strength could be expropriated by the kin of those who had killed them . In Tibet and Japan holy men were mummified , while in various other areas revered ancestors were preserved for posterity - and no doubt consulted on important tribal matters . In prehistoric Britain there was a tradition of reverence towards ancestors , so it is conceivable that the South Uist mummies were important ancestral figures . As such , the tribe or clan may have seen them as having had protective powers or even the ability to intervene with the gods or cosmic spirits on behalf of their people . It is probable that the preserved bodies were kept over the centuries in some sort of mummy house - a special dwelling to accommodate ancestors , probably both male and female . But in a sense the role the mummies performed is only part of the conundrum of Cladh Hallan . The complex was made up of seven houses arranged as a terrace . The archaeologists have so far excavated three of them - and the dig has revealed that the structures were used not just as dwellings but also as places of ritual activity . The complex was made up of seven houses arranged as a terrace . The archaeologists have so far excavated three of them - and the dig has revealed that the structures were used not just as dwellings but also as places of ritual activity . When the complex was constructed in around 1,000 BC , the two by then rather ancient mummies , along with the body of an entire sheep ( possibly a sacrifice ) , were buried under the floor of the most northerly house . At around the same time an unmummified 13 - year - old girl who had recently died was buried under the floor of the middle house . Underneath the southernmost of the three excavated structures , a three month old child was also interred around 1,000 BC . Also round 1,000 , in the northernmost structure , a ritual was carried out in which large quantities of pottery were deliberately smashed . Over the next few hundred years rituals continued in the northern and middle structures . A few years or decades later the cremated bones of some children were interred in the northern house ( the one with the mummies under the floor ) . Then a couple of decades later still , more cremated children 's bones were deposited in the house , along with several deliberately smashed pots and three smashed quern stones . A group of unfired smashed pots was then stacked up against the inside of the house wall and subsequently the entire house was moved one metre east and rebuilt , with a bronze bracelet being deposited , probably to mark the occasion . At around the same time the southern house was dismantled . Over the next few hundred years rituals continued in the northern and middle structures . In around 900 BC , for instance , a baby was buried in the north house and the building was again moved and rebuilt - this time two metres further west . Over the years , in the two remaining houses , more pottery was deliberately smashed , and antlers , pots and bone tools were buried . More animals were also sacrificed - a sheep and two dogs . After several more deconstruction and reconstruction episodes , the north house was finally abandoned in around 700 BC - but the middle structure continued in ritual use until around 400 BC , making it the longest used house known from British prehistory .

Were they members of some ritual elite , potentially priests or shamans ? The range of ritual activity in the complex is among the broadest known . It raises the question of whether the site was primarily a domestic / residential one or primarily a ritual and religious one . Who were the people that lived there ? Were they ordinary Bronze Age tribes - people - or were they members of some ritual elite , potentially priests or shamans ? And were the people who lived in the complex part of the same ethnic / tribal group whose ancestors had been preserved and been venerated over the centuries ? Or were they new arrivals or settlers , who had displaced the original ' mummy- venerating ' population and had expropriated not only their land but their ancestors as well ? Only future archaeological investigations will stand a chance of answering these tantalising questions . But , for the time being , the discovery of Britain 's first mummies should start to redefine key aspects of life and death in prehistoric Britain .

World Champion van Gerwen had been defeated 4 - 3 by Brendan Dolan in their semi-final Singles contest , only for van Barneveld to whitewash Michael Mansell before the pair teamed up to win the Doubles decider 4 - 0 with an incredible 117.88 average , the highest ever seen in the tournament . They took that form into the final as van Gerwen whitewashed Phil Taylor in the opening Singles game with a 103 average before van Barneveld powered past Lewis without dropping a leg . Van Gerwen then defeated Lewis 4 - 2 in their Singles clash as he secured a 3 - 0 victory for the Netherlands in the final - meaning that their nation holds the World Championship , Premier League Darts and bwin World Cup of Darts titles ! \" This is a very special moment for us , \" said World Champion van Gerwen . \" This is a fantastic title because I 've never won this , and we worked very hard for this . \" I enjoyed every moment of the tournament and to win the final against England is amazing for us and I think we deserved the title because we worked so well as a team . \" We played really well today , especially against Belgium and Ireland in the Doubles games , and then we walked over England in the final with some awesome darts . \" I started off very well against Phil and to win 4 - 0 and for Raymond to beat Adrian 4 - 0 was very good for our confidence , and I knew I had to turn up against Adrian . I did that and we won the title , and we 'll enjoy this moment . \" Van Barneveld , who won the Premier League Darts title last month , added : \" We 're really happy and this win means a lot to us but also means a lot for darts in Holland . This is a fantastic event and we 're over the moon to win this title . \" We had tough battles against Belgium and Ireland but even when Michael lost a couple of Singles games we still believed in each other and in the Doubles games against Belgium and Ireland we were awesome . \" There 's no better player in the world to team up with and I enjoyed every single match in this tournament . \" England had seen off Australia 4 - 0 in their Doubles decider in the semi-finals as they booked a spot in the final , with Taylor having swept aside Simon Whitlock 4 - 1 before Paul Nicholson overcame Lewis 4 - 2 to send the tie all the way . However , their challenge ran out of steam in the final as the Dutch claimed three successive Singles victories to end England 's hopes of claiming a title hat-trick in Hamburg . \" We got to the final and gave ourselves a chance but we were beaten by the better team tonight , \" said Taylor . \" We tried everything but Michael 's finishing was brilliant - I do n't think he missed a thing in the final - and Barney played well too . It 's disappointing for us but we 'll be back next year and hopefully we can win back the title . \" Australia , the 2012 finalists , had to settle for a second semi-final defeat as Whitlock and Nicholson 's bid for glory came up short against England . Northern Irish duo Brendan Dolan and Michael Mansell , meanwhile , reached the last four for the first time in the event 's history after overcoming number three seeds Scotland in the quarter - finals earlier on Sunday . bwin World Cup of Darts Sunday June 8 Evening Session Semi-Finals Netherlands 2 -1 Northern Ireland Singles 1 - Michael van Gerwen 3 - 4 Brendan Dolan Singles 2 - Raymond van Barneveld 4 - 0 Michael Mansell Doubles - van Gerwen / van Barneveld 4 -0 Dolan / Mansell England 2 -1 Australia Singles 1 - Phil Taylor 4 -1 Simon Whitlock Singles 2 - Adrian Lewis 2 -4 Paul Nicholson Doubles - Taylor / Lewis 4-0 Whitlock / Nicholson Final Netherlands 3 - 0 England Singles 1 - Michael van Gerwen 4-0 Phil Taylor Singles 2 - Raymond van Barneveld 4 - 0 Adrian Lewis Singles 3 - Michael van Gerwen 4 - 2 Adrian Lewis Singles 4 - Raymond van Barneveld v Phil Taylor ( not needed ) Doubles - van Gerwen / van Barneveld v Taylor / Lewis ( not needed ) Netherlands Win 3-0 FORMAT Semi-Finals The Semi-Finals will be played as two best of seven leg 501 Singles matches , with both nations nominating the order in which their players play .

The authorities are working to prevent a second explosion at the Fukushima nuclear power station , where there was a huge blast on Saturday . An emergency has also been declared at the Onagawa nuclear plant , after high radiation levels were detected . BBC News looks at what has happened . Friday , 11 March : 1446 local time ( 0546 GMT ) The 8.9 - magnitude earthquake strikes off the coast of Honshu island at a depth of about 24km . The tremor triggers the automatic shutdown of 11 of the nation 's nuclear power reactors , including reactor units 1 ,2 and 3 at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant . Reactor units 4 , 5 and 6 were undergoing routine inspections , so were not operating . The quake causes the power station to be cut off from the national electricity grid . The plant 's operators , Tokyo Electric Power Co ( Tepco ) , find that the diesel - powered emergency generators for units 1 and 2 are not working and notify government officials . 1541 : Tepco reports that the emergency generators for reactor units 1 , 2 and 3 have failed - some reports suggest that the diesel - powered back - up systems are affected by the tsunami . In the following hours , engineers attempt to install mobile power units to replace the diesel systems and manage to stabilise conditions at units 2 and 3 , but not at unit 1 . 1600 : Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency ( Nisa ) sets up an emergency headquarters to gather information on potential damage to the nation 's 55 nuclear reactors . 1930 : Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano announces that Prime Minister Naoto Kan has declared a \" nuclear emergency status \" . Officials reassure people that this is standard procedure in events like this and no radioactive material has been detected in the area surrounding the power station . 2100 : Residents within a 3 km radius of the power station are told to leave their homes , while those within a 10 km radius are told to stay at home in case it is necessary to extend the evacuation area . Following the automatic shutdown of the reactors , and the failure of emergency generators , pressure in the unit builds up as a result of the pumps in the cooling system not working properly . The pressure is the result of the reactor 's residual \" decay \" heat causing the coolant , which is not being circulated , to evaporate . The consequent increase in pressure in the coolant circuit can be controlled by pressure release valves , but this leads to an increase in pressure within the reactor building containment chamber . Tepco says that the pressure inside reactor unit 1 is more than twice normal levels . Saturday , 12 March : 0530 local time In order to release some of the pressure inside the reactor unit , the decision is taken to vent some of the steam , which contains a small amount of radioactive material , into the air . 0819 : An alarm alerts workers that the position of one control rod ( used to halt the reactor ) is unclear ( whether it is fully inserted into the reactor or outside the reactor , allowing it to continue generating heat ) 1009 : Tepco confirms it has released a small amount of vapour into the atmosphere to reduce pressure in reactor unit 1 . 1043 : Control rod alarm stops , and all rods are confirmed as being fully inserted . 1058 : In order to release some of pressure inside reactor unit 2 , some steam was vented into the air . Again , this contains a small amount of radioactive material . 1530 : TV cameras capture a massive explosion at the power station . The pictures appear to show that the outer structure of one of four buildings at the plant has collapsed . Tokyo Electric Power Co says four workers have been injured in the blast . 2000 : Uncertainty surrounds what was the actual cause of the explosion , and what damaged was caused by the blast . Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano confirms that the concrete building surrounding the steel reactor container has collapsed as a result of the blast , but the steel containment chamber itself had not been damaged . 2020 : Tepco begins pumping seawater , mixed with the element boron , into unit 1 's reactor . Boron is used as a shield in nuclear reactors , as it controls the nuclear reaction . Nisa confirms that monitoring systems in the area have detected presence of radioactive elements caesium - 137 and iodine - 131 in the vicinity of unit 1 . It reports an initial increase in levels of radioactivity around the plant , but says these levels have been observed to lessen . 2300 : In its latest update , the plant 's operator says : \" We are preparing to implement a measure to reduce the pressure of [ unit 3 's ] reactor containment vessels under the instruction of the national government . \" Sunday , 13 March : 0122 local time An official at Japan 's nuclear agency rates the incident at 4 on the 0 - 7 international scale of severity . The 1986 Chernobyl disaster was rated 7 , while the 1979 Three Mile Island accident was rated 5 . 0320 : The World Health Organisation says the risk to the public from the radiation leak at Fukushima is \" probably quite low \" . 0523 : The International Atomic Energy Agency says the plant 's operator has confirmed that the containment vessel around unit 1 is intact and levels of radioactivity nearby have fallen in recent hours . 0623 : An official from Nisa says the emergency cooling system at the plant 's unit 3 reactor has failed . 0752 : Tepco say it is preparing to release steam - containing a small amount of radioactive material - from unit 3 in an effort to lower the temperature inside . It is also looking for an alternative way to inject water into the reactor because without a continuous flow of water , there is a danger that the fuel rods will become exposed to the air and could melt . 0826 : Yukio Edano tells state TV the unit 3 reactor was in danger , but attempts are under way to vent steam . Subsequently , it is reported that radiation has again risen above legal safety limits around the plant . 1326 : Mr Edano says venting of unit 3 was completed at 0841 local time , but a partial meltdown in the reactor is still \" highly possible \" . 1538 : The Japanese government warns of the risk of another reactor explosion following the failure in unit 3 . But a spokesman attempts to reassure people by saying the unit is designed to protect the reactor core in the same way as unit 1 , and - so far - the radioactivity released into the environment does not pose a threat to human health . 2005 : In his latest public briefing on the situation , Mr Edano says authorities have begun injecting seawater into the unit 3 reactor to try to lower the temperature - as they did on Saturday with unit 1 . He says the water level inside is thought to be rising to more satisfactory levels , but the gauge , which seems to be broken , is not showing this . 2209 : It is reported that Tepco is planning to pump seawater into reactor number 2 at the plant - this is the first time problems have been reported with this third unit . It is worth noting that using seawater like this is terminal for a nuclear reactor . It is a last-ditch move and renders the reactor permanently unusable . 2241 : UN nuclear watchdog , the IAEA , says a state of emergency has been declared at a second Japanese nuclear power plant , Onagawa . The IAEA says high radiation levels had been found around the plant . A fire broke out in the turbine building of one the reactors at Onagawa on Friday , but was put out . 2350 : Japan 's nuclear safety agency says there is no problem with the cooling systems at the Onagawa plant . It blames the high radiation levels on radioactive releases from the Fukushima Daiichi complex . Monday , 14 March : 0053 local time Malcolm Crick , secretary of the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation , tells Reuters : \" This is not a serious public health issue at the moment . It wo n't be anything like Chernobyl . There the reactor was operating at full power when it exploded and it had no containment . \" 0207 : A cooling pump at the Tokai nuclear power plant , 120 km ( 75 miles ) from Tokyo , has failed , a plant spokesman says . But he says an additional pump is working and is cooling the reactor .

But a spokesman attempts to reassure people by saying the unit is designed to protect the reactor core in the same way as unit 1 , and - so far - the radioactivity released into the environment does not pose a threat to human health . 2005 : In his latest public briefing on the situation , Mr Edano says authorities have begun injecting seawater into the unit 3 reactor to try to lower the temperature - as they did on Saturday with unit 1 . He says the water level inside is thought to be rising to more satisfactory levels , but the gauge , which seems to be broken , is not showing this . 2209 : It is reported that Tepco is planning to pump seawater into reactor number 2 at the plant - this is the first time problems have been reported with this third unit . It is worth noting that using seawater like this is terminal for a nuclear reactor . It is a last-ditch move and renders the reactor permanently unusable . 2241 : UN nuclear watchdog , the IAEA , says a state of emergency has been declared at a second Japanese nuclear power plant , Onagawa . The IAEA says high radiation levels had been found around the plant . A fire broke out in the turbine building of one the reactors at Onagawa on Friday , but was put out . 2350 : Japan 's nuclear safety agency says there is no problem with the cooling systems at the Onagawa plant . It blames the high radiation levels on radioactive releases from the Fukushima Daiichi complex . Monday , 14 March : 0053 local time Malcolm Crick , secretary of the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation , tells Reuters : \" This is not a serious public health issue at the moment . It wo n't be anything like Chernobyl . There the reactor was operating at full power when it exploded and it had no containment . \" 0207 : A cooling pump at the Tokai nuclear power plant , 120 km ( 75 miles ) from Tokyo , has failed , a plant spokesman says . But he says an additional pump is working and is cooling the reactor .

Foucault The Birth of Biopolitics ( note 3 above ) . Indeed , whether Foucault provides us with a coherent theory or concept of biopolitics is debatable . This notwithstanding , biopolitics and biopower continue to hold significant purchase in and for discussions on modern forms of governance and modes of subjectification . However , rather than taking these concepts as standalone and independent theoretical contributions , it is \u2013 as I demonstrate here \u2013 more productive to understand biopolitics and biopower as they function together with some of the other ideas related to power and governmentality which Foucault develops over the same period ( that is , the 1970s ) . Biopolitics and Biopower Let us begin with a brief definition of biopolitics and biopower , before situating these concepts within the broader context of Foucault 's oeuvre . In short , biopolitics can be understood as a political rationality which takes the administration of life and populations as its subject : ' to ensure , sustain , and multiply life , to put this life in order ' . 9 Note 2 above , 138 . Biopower thus names the way in which biopolitics is put to work in society , and involves what Foucault describes as 'a very profound transformation of [ the ] mechanisms of power ' of the Western classic age . 10 Note 2 above , 136 . In The Will to Knowledge , Foucault writes of [ A ] power that exerts a positive influence on life , that endeavours to administer , optimize , and multiply it , subjecting it to precise controls and comprehensive regulations . 11 Note 2 above , 137 . Foucault is speaking here of a power he later designates as \u201c biopower \u201d , a power which \u2013significantly \u2013 has a ' positive influence on life ' ( my italics ) . This new biopower constitutes a ' profound transformation of [ the ] mechanisms of power ' insofar as it differs from what Foucault associates with ' juridico- discursive ' conceptualisations of power as repressive and negative : 12 Note 2 above , 82 . a power whose 'effects take the form of limit and lack ' . 13 Note 2 above , 83 . Indeed , Foucault conducts a lengthy critique of this repressive functioning of power in both The Will to Knowledge14 See particularly Foucault 's critique of the repressive hypothesis , note 2 above . Also discussed in length in HL Dreyfus & P Rabinow Michel Foucault : Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics ( 1982 ) . and Society Must be Defended , 15 See particularly the first two lectures ( note 4 above ) . demonstrating that such power functions to hide other productive or ' positive ' capacities of power that are also at play particularly , for example , within the capitalist governmentality of the 19th century . The new biopower operates instead through dispersed networks \u2013 what in Security , Territory , Population Foucault names the dispositif . 16 Note 5 above . This dispositif of power works from beneath , from the ' level of life ' itself , 17 Note 2 above , 137 . and , as Foucault earlier described it in Society Must Be Defended , ' [ i]t was a type of power that presupposed a closely meshed grid of material coercions rather than the physical existence of a sovereign ' . 18 Note 4 above , 36 . Importantly , biopower did not replace repressive and deductive functions of power , but worked together with such technologies of power . Foucault writes : \u201c Deduction \u201d has tended to be no longer the major form of power but merely one element among others , working to incite , reinforce , control , monitor , optimize , and organize the forces under it : a power bent on generating forces , making them grow , and ordering them , rather than one dedicated to impeding them , making them submit , or destroying them . 19 Note 2 above , 136 . However , significantly too , the structural functioning of biopower , as it operates through the dispositif where lines of power triangulate outwards , enables new kinds of resistance ; resistance which can take place at the multiple points of contact which these lines of power traverse . 20 For an important critique of Foucault 's notion of dispositif see G Deleuze ' What is a Dispositif ? ' in TJ Armstrong Michel Foucault Philosopher ( 1992 ) 159 . Genealogy of Biopower In the last chapter of The Will to Knowledge entitled ' Right of Death and Power over Life ' , Foucault provides a brief genealogy of biopolitics . His opening sentence recalls the Schmittian view on the decisionism which determines sovereignty , 21C Schmitt , Political Theology : Four Chapters on the Concept of Sovereignty ( 1922 ) ( trans . George Schwab , 1985 ) . speaking of how ' [ f ] or a long time , one of the characteristic privileges of sovereign power was the right to decide life and death ' . 22 Note 2 above , 135 . This sovereign power was of a juridical form . It was a power over life which could only be attested ' through the death he was capable of requiring ' . 23 Note 2 above , 136 . Thus , as Foucault notes , sovereign juridical power was in fact only a power to ' take life or let live ' , 24 Note 2 above , 136 . whereas biopower constituted 'a power to foster life or disallow it to the point of death ' . 25 Note 2 above , 138 . In the 17th century the sovereign - juridical form of power began to transform . Foucault traces the evolution of two forms of power which ' were not antithetical ' to each other , constituting ' two poles of development linked together by a whole intermediary cluster of relations ' . 26 Note 2 above , 139 . The first pole was disciplinary power , an analysis of which Foucault had developed in his previous publication Discipline and Punish ( 1975 ) , 27 M Foucault Discipline and Punish : The Birth of the Prison ( 1975 ) ( trans . A Sheridan , 1995 ) . and which took the body as its focus of subjectification . The second pole , Foucault describes as follows : The second , formed somewhat later , focused on the species body , the body imbued with the mechanics of life and serving as the basis of the biological processes : propagation , births and mortality , the level of health , life expectancy and longevity , with all the conditions that can cause these to vary . Their supervision was effected through an entire series of interventions and regulatory controls : a biopolitics of the population . ( Italics in original ) . 28 Note 2 above , 139 . During this period there was , as Foucault recounts , 'an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugation of bodies and the control of populations , marking the beginning of an era of \u201c biopower \u201d ' . 29 Note 2 above , 140 . Foucault 's genealogy continues as he observes that these two poles of power were ' still [ \u2026 ] clearly separate in the 18th century ' , 30 Note 2 above , 140 . before starting to join together ' in the form of concrete arrangements that would go to make up the great technology of power of the nineteenth century ' . 31 Note 2 above , 140 . One of these arrangements he names as the discourse on sexuality . At this point , Foucault states that ' [ t ] his bio -power was without question an indispensable element in the development of capitalism ' which made possible ' the controlled insertion of bodies into the machinery of production and the adjustment of the phenomena of population to economic processes ' . 32 Note 2 above , 140 - 141 . This is a theme Foucault picks up from the Society Must be Defended lecture course of two years earlier , wherein he describes how ' more general powers or economic benefits can slip into the play of these technologies of power , which are at once relatively autonomous and infinitesimal ' . 33 Note 4 above , 31 . He goes on to analyse how the bourgeoisie grasped the disciplinary mechanisms of power \u2013 developed for example by the prison system \u2013 as a technology for the production of docile bodies for capitalist labour , explicitly linking the biopolitical rationality with the development of capitalism . State Racism Biopolitics marks a significant historical transformation from a politics of sovereignty to a politics of society . Hence genealogically , Foucault takes us from a ' sovereign who must be defended ' 34 Note 2 above , 137 . to \u2013 as the name of his earlier lecture series affirms \u2013 a society ( a species , a population ) who must be defended . In The Will to Knowledge Foucault describes how : Wars are no longer waged in the name of a sovereign who must be defended ; they are waged on behalf of the existence of everyone ; entire populations are mobilized for the purpose of wholesale slaughter in the name of life necessity : massacres have become vital . 35 Note 2 above , 137 . In Society Must be Defended Foucault articulates this further : [ A ] battle that has to be waged not between races , but by a race that is portrayed as the one true race , the race that holds power and is entitled to define the norm , and against those who deviate from that norm , against those who pose a threat to the biological heritage . 36 Note 4 above , 61 . It is in this shift from the defence of the sovereign to the defence of society as the overriding political rationality of the state that Foucault 's notion of state racism is born . He describes it as 'a racism that society will direct against itself , against its own elements and its own products [ \u2026 ] the internal racism of permanent purification , and it will become one of the basic dimensions of social normalization ' . 37 Note 4 above , 62 . State racism is thus for Foucault the essential characteristic of the modern biopolitical state : it is both the function of the modern state and that which constitutes it . Beyond Biopolitics Foucault 's work on biopolitics and biopower has not been without criticism , not only insofar as his work in this area appears fleeting and incomplete . Achille Mbembe , for example , notes Foucault 's lack of a theoretical contribution on how biopower is put to work in systems of violence and domination , thus developing his notion of necropolitics which names sovereign decisionism on death : ' the power and the capacity to dictate who may live and who must die ' . 38A Mbembe ' Necropolitics ' in Campbell and Sitze ( note 1 above ) 161 . Another seeming limitation with biopower and biopolitics has been its apparent disregard for subjectivity . In Foucault 's focus on a politics of a population and species , the biopolitical subject is not explicitly conceived within his oeuvre . This seems limiting for understanding the place of biopolitics and biopower within Foucault 's oeuvre particularly given his assertion in 1982 that ' the goal of my work during the last twenty years [ \u2026 ] has been to create a history of the different modes by which , in our culture , human beings are made subjects ' . 39 M Foucault ' The Subject and Power ' ( 1982 ) in M Foucault Power : Essential Works of Foucault 1954 \u2013 1984 Volume 3 ( trans . R Hurley & Others , 2000 ) 326 , 326 . However , it is in this context that biopower and biopolitics must be seen as working together with other technologies of power \u2013 repressive and disciplinary power \u2013 which operate more directly on the body and on subjectivity . Moreover , Mbembe 's creates critical space for a consideration of the biopolitical \u2013 or necropolitical \u2013 subject in his analysis , noted above .

Foucault writes : \u201c Deduction \u201d has tended to be no longer the major form of power but merely one element among others , working to incite , reinforce , control , monitor , optimize , and organize the forces under it : a power bent on generating forces , making them grow , and ordering them , rather than one dedicated to impeding them , making them submit , or destroying them . 19 Note 2 above , 136 . However , significantly too , the structural functioning of biopower , as it operates through the dispositif where lines of power triangulate outwards , enables new kinds of resistance ; resistance which can take place at the multiple points of contact which these lines of power traverse . 20 For an important critique of Foucault 's notion of dispositif see G Deleuze ' What is a Dispositif ? ' in TJ Armstrong Michel Foucault Philosopher ( 1992 ) 159 . Genealogy of Biopower In the last chapter of The Will to Knowledge entitled ' Right of Death and Power over Life ' , Foucault provides a brief genealogy of biopolitics . His opening sentence recalls the Schmittian view on the decisionism which determines sovereignty , 21C Schmitt , Political Theology : Four Chapters on the Concept of Sovereignty ( 1922 ) ( trans . George Schwab , 1985 ) . speaking of how ' [ f ] or a long time , one of the characteristic privileges of sovereign power was the right to decide life and death ' . 22 Note 2 above , 135 . This sovereign power was of a juridical form . It was a power over life which could only be attested ' through the death he was capable of requiring ' . 23 Note 2 above , 136 . Thus , as Foucault notes , sovereign juridical power was in fact only a power to ' take life or let live ' , 24 Note 2 above , 136 . whereas biopower constituted 'a power to foster life or disallow it to the point of death ' . 25 Note 2 above , 138 . In the 17th century the sovereign - juridical form of power began to transform . Foucault traces the evolution of two forms of power which ' were not antithetical ' to each other , constituting ' two poles of development linked together by a whole intermediary cluster of relations ' . 26 Note 2 above , 139 . The first pole was disciplinary power , an analysis of which Foucault had developed in his previous publication Discipline and Punish ( 1975 ) , 27 M Foucault Discipline and Punish : The Birth of the Prison ( 1975 ) ( trans . A Sheridan , 1995 ) . and which took the body as its focus of subjectification . The second pole , Foucault describes as follows : The second , formed somewhat later , focused on the species body , the body imbued with the mechanics of life and serving as the basis of the biological processes : propagation , births and mortality , the level of health , life expectancy and longevity , with all the conditions that can cause these to vary . Their supervision was effected through an entire series of interventions and regulatory controls : a biopolitics of the population . ( Italics in original ) . 28 Note 2 above , 139 . During this period there was , as Foucault recounts , 'an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugation of bodies and the control of populations , marking the beginning of an era of \u201c biopower \u201d ' . 29 Note 2 above , 140 . Foucault 's genealogy continues as he observes that these two poles of power were ' still [ \u2026 ] clearly separate in the 18th century ' , 30 Note 2 above , 140 . before starting to join together ' in the form of concrete arrangements that would go to make up the great technology of power of the nineteenth century ' . 31 Note 2 above , 140 . One of these arrangements he names as the discourse on sexuality . At this point , Foucault states that ' [ t ] his bio -power was without question an indispensable element in the development of capitalism ' which made possible ' the controlled insertion of bodies into the machinery of production and the adjustment of the phenomena of population to economic processes ' . 32 Note 2 above , 140 - 141 . This is a theme Foucault picks up from the Society Must be Defended lecture course of two years earlier , wherein he describes how ' more general powers or economic benefits can slip into the play of these technologies of power , which are at once relatively autonomous and infinitesimal ' . 33 Note 4 above , 31 . He goes on to analyse how the bourgeoisie grasped the disciplinary mechanisms of power \u2013 developed for example by the prison system \u2013 as a technology for the production of docile bodies for capitalist labour , explicitly linking the biopolitical rationality with the development of capitalism . State Racism Biopolitics marks a significant historical transformation from a politics of sovereignty to a politics of society . Hence genealogically , Foucault takes us from a ' sovereign who must be defended ' 34 Note 2 above , 137 . to \u2013 as the name of his earlier lecture series affirms \u2013 a society ( a species , a population ) who must be defended . In The Will to Knowledge Foucault describes how : Wars are no longer waged in the name of a sovereign who must be defended ; they are waged on behalf of the existence of everyone ; entire populations are mobilized for the purpose of wholesale slaughter in the name of life necessity : massacres have become vital . 35 Note 2 above , 137 . In Society Must be Defended Foucault articulates this further : [ A ] battle that has to be waged not between races , but by a race that is portrayed as the one true race , the race that holds power and is entitled to define the norm , and against those who deviate from that norm , against those who pose a threat to the biological heritage . 36 Note 4 above , 61 . It is in this shift from the defence of the sovereign to the defence of society as the overriding political rationality of the state that Foucault 's notion of state racism is born . He describes it as 'a racism that society will direct against itself , against its own elements and its own products [ \u2026 ] the internal racism of permanent purification , and it will become one of the basic dimensions of social normalization ' . 37 Note 4 above , 62 . State racism is thus for Foucault the essential characteristic of the modern biopolitical state : it is both the function of the modern state and that which constitutes it . Beyond Biopolitics Foucault 's work on biopolitics and biopower has not been without criticism , not only insofar as his work in this area appears fleeting and incomplete . Achille Mbembe , for example , notes Foucault 's lack of a theoretical contribution on how biopower is put to work in systems of violence and domination , thus developing his notion of necropolitics which names sovereign decisionism on death : ' the power and the capacity to dictate who may live and who must die ' . 38A Mbembe ' Necropolitics ' in Campbell and Sitze ( note 1 above ) 161 . Another seeming limitation with biopower and biopolitics has been its apparent disregard for subjectivity . In Foucault 's focus on a politics of a population and species , the biopolitical subject is not explicitly conceived within his oeuvre . This seems limiting for understanding the place of biopolitics and biopower within Foucault 's oeuvre particularly given his assertion in 1982 that ' the goal of my work during the last twenty years [ \u2026 ] has been to create a history of the different modes by which , in our culture , human beings are made subjects ' . 39 M Foucault ' The Subject and Power ' ( 1982 ) in M Foucault Power : Essential Works of Foucault 1954 \u2013 1984 Volume 3 ( trans . R Hurley & Others , 2000 ) 326 , 326 . However , it is in this context that biopower and biopolitics must be seen as working together with other technologies of power \u2013 repressive and disciplinary power \u2013 which operate more directly on the body and on subjectivity . Moreover , Mbembe 's creates critical space for a consideration of the biopolitical \u2013 or necropolitical \u2013 subject in his analysis , noted above . Rachel Adams is a Chief Researcher at the Human Sciences Research Council , South Africa Call for contributions to ' Key Concepts ' - 1 See T Campbell & A Sitze Biopolitics : A Reader ( 2013 ) . - 2 M Foucault The Will to Knowledge : The History of Sexuality Volume 1 ( 1976 ) ( trans . R Hurley , 1998 ) . - 3 It is important to note that Foucault does not discuss the relationship between biopolitics , biopower and governmentality . Instead , the link is implicitly made in his lecture courses , particularly The Birth of Biopolitics ( 1978 - 79 ) , in which he states ' I thought I could do a course on biopolitics this year ' , but qualifies this by saying that such a course could not be done without first conducting a genealogy on liberalist governmental reason . M Foucault The Birth of Biopolitics : Lectures at the Coll\u00e8ge De France 1978 - 79 ( trans . G Burchell , 2008 ) 21 - 22 . In a 1982 essay , ' The Subject and Power ' , Foucault defines \u201c governmentality \u201d as follows : ' This word ( government ) must be allowed the very broad meaning it had in the sixteenth century . ' Government ' did not refer only to political structures or to the management of states ; rather , it designated the way in which the conduct of individuals or of groups might be directed \u2013 the government of children , of souls , of communities , of the sick . It covered not only the legitimately constituted forms of political or economic subjection but also modes of action , more or less considered and calculated , that were destined to act upon the possibilities of action of other people . To govern , in this sense , is to control the possible field of action of others . ' [ 1 .

It 's like coming from zero to where we are today . All of that went through my mind . \" Felicita left Tony a phone message , as she has done throughout his football career , on Sunday before he helped lead the Cowboys to a 35 - 14 victory over the Carolina Panthers . \" Tony is a very spiritual person , \" Felicita , 72 , said . \" I always leave him a scripture on his message machine before a game .

Ramiro Romo Sr. was born in Musquis , Coahuila , Mexico , in 1933 , but moved to San Antonio when he was a teenager . He spent about five years in the city before going to live with a brother in Racine , Wis. , where he met his future wife . Ramiro Romo 's only living sibling , sister Socorro Valdez , lives in San Antonio , as do numerous nephews and nieces . Felicita Rios Romo was born in Robstown in 1934 and moved to Racine with her family when she was 12 . Felicita is called \" Phyllis \" by most of her friends in Crockett . Married for 51 years , the Romos lived in San Antonio , where they owned two restaurants on the South Side , from 1986 until they moved to Crockett in 1989 . \" We still have a lot of family and many friends in San Antonio , \" Felicita said . Crockett is about 110 miles north of Houston and 160 miles south of Dallas . The grandparents go to every Cowboys home game . The Romos , who were married in Wisconsin in 1955 and lived in the state until 1980 , are bilingual . They also have an adopted son , Mustafa John , 39 , who lives in Appleton , Wis . That a Mexican immigrant would someday have a grandson quarterbacking one of the most glamorous teams in pro sports , Ramiro and Felicita said , is a testament to the power of the American dream . \" I've always said this is a country of opportunities , \" Ramiro said . \" If you do n't get a job or an education , it 's because you do n't want to . \" His parents ' humble background , Ramiro Romo Jr. said , has made Tony 's success more gratifying . \" Only in America , \" he said . Although Tony speaks very little Spanish \u2014 he can sing \" La Bamba \" with his grandfather accompanying him on the guitar \u2014 his abuelos and father said he takes pride in his ethnicity . \" That 's a topic we 've talked about a number of times , \" Ramiro Jr. said . \" I've told Tony that there are some bad people out there who sometimes judge you , or get a certain perspective of you , by your name . But you should n't be ashamed of who you are . \" Tony is fiercely proud of being an Hispanic and carrying the Romo name . I 've always told him , ' Be who you are and be proud of it .

He 's also a religious man and is very humble . \" Ramiro Jr. , 49 , was born in Racine and played basketball and soccer at St. Bonaventure High School . He and his wife settled in Burlington after he was discharged from the Navy in 1982 . The couple also has two older daughters . Tony , the youngest of the three children , always has done a good job of keeping his priorities in order , his father said . \" Even with all the attention he 's getting now , and being the Cowboys ' quarterback is like playing for the New York Yankees , family and friends are very important to him , \" Ramiro Jr. said .

Ramiro and Felicita Romo knew watching their grandson make his debut as the Dallas Cowboys ' starting quarterback would be emotional , and they wanted to share the moment in solitude . \" There were some tears , \" Felicita Romo said . \" No , a lot of tears . \" It was a like a sue\u00f1o , a dream , for the Romos , who lived in San Antonio for three years before moving to the East Texas town of Crockett in 1989 . But the image of No. 9 walking up to the line of scrimmage to take his first snap confirmed what they had known for days : Their nieto , grandson , was quarterbacking the team with the star on the helmet . \" I thought of how far we 've come , not only as a family , but as a people , \" Ramiro , 73 , said in Spanish this week via phone . \" I remembered the hard times in Mexico and how I struggled when I first got here . It 's like coming from zero to where we are today . All of that went through my mind . \" Felicita left Tony a phone message , as she has done throughout his football career , on Sunday before he helped lead the Cowboys to a 35 - 14 victory over the Carolina Panthers . \" Tony is a very spiritual person , \" Felicita , 72 , said . \" I always leave him a scripture on his message machine before a game . Tony always has been very close to us . He 's always been very attentive , loving . \" Cowboys fans clamoring to learn more about the team 's new starting quarterback , who was christened Antonio Ramiro Romo , may be surprised to learn his paternal grandparents have deep ties to San Antonio and South Texas . Ramiro Romo Sr. was born in Musquis , Coahuila , Mexico , in 1933 , but moved to San Antonio when he was a teenager . He spent about five years in the city before going to live with a brother in Racine , Wis. , where he met his future wife . Ramiro Romo 's only living sibling , sister Socorro Valdez , lives in San Antonio , as do numerous nephews and nieces . Felicita Rios Romo was born in Robstown in 1934 and moved to Racine with her family when she was 12 . Felicita is called \" Phyllis \" by most of her friends in Crockett . Married for 51 years , the Romos lived in San Antonio , where they owned two restaurants on the South Side , from 1986 until they moved to Crockett in 1989 . \" We still have a lot of family and many friends in San Antonio , \" Felicita said . Crockett is about 110 miles north of Houston and 160 miles south of Dallas . The grandparents go to every Cowboys home game . The Romos , who were married in Wisconsin in 1955 and lived in the state until 1980 , are bilingual . They also have an adopted son , Mustafa John , 39 , who lives in Appleton , Wis . That a Mexican immigrant would someday have a grandson quarterbacking one of the most glamorous teams in pro sports , Ramiro and Felicita said , is a testament to the power of the American dream . \" I've always said this is a country of opportunities , \" Ramiro said . \" If you do n't get a job or an education , it 's because you do n't want to . \" His parents ' humble background , Ramiro Romo Jr. said , has made Tony 's success more gratifying . \" Only in America , \" he said . Although Tony speaks very little Spanish \u2014 he can sing \" La Bamba \" with his grandfather accompanying him on the guitar \u2014 his abuelos and father said he takes pride in his ethnicity . \" That 's a topic we 've talked about a number of times , \" Ramiro Jr. said . \" I've told Tony that there are some bad people out there who sometimes judge you , or get a certain perspective of you , by your name . But you should n't be ashamed of who you are . \" Tony is fiercely proud of being an Hispanic and carrying the Romo name . I 've always told him , ' Be who you are and be proud of it . ' \" Tony , 26 , was born in San Diego when his father was in the Navy but grew up in Burlington , Wis . \" I told my son and my nieto never to try to hide their culture , to be proud of who they are , \" Ramiro Sr. said . \" I 'm proud to say that they 've never run away from being Hispanic . \" Tony 's parents \u2014 his mother is named Joan \u2014 live in Burlington , Wis. , where their son was a standout athlete at Burlington High School before going on Eastern Illinois . \" Whatever the sport that was in season , that 's the one he was going to play , \" Ramiro Jr. said . \" He just loved sports and always has been very competitive . He 's also a religious man and is very humble . \" Ramiro Jr. , 49 , was born in Racine and played basketball and soccer at St. Bonaventure High School . He and his wife settled in Burlington after he was discharged from the Navy in 1982 . The couple also has two older daughters . Tony , the youngest of the three children , always has done a good job of keeping his priorities in order , his father said . \" Even with all the attention he 's getting now , and being the Cowboys ' quarterback is like playing for the New York Yankees , family and friends are very important to him , \" Ramiro Jr. said . In Crockett , Ramiro Sr. recalled the advice he gave his grandson when he turned pro . \" I told him , ' Do n't ever get lost and be careful with the temptations of prestige and money .

When Harry shows up out of nowhere to give Cal a pep talk , the stage is set for a \" Rocky \" - style , go-the - distance ending . But if Cal had thought about Harry in terms of pop culture stereotypes , he could have answered his own implied question : How come you 're always there when I need you , even though I barely know you ? Harry seems to stand apart from the rest of the community , even though he 's a familiar and beloved part of it . The only character who speaks to Harry directly is Cal , and their conversations are always about Cal and his well - being . He 's such the benevolent guardian angel figure that the cynical viewer half - expects him to be revealed as a figment of Cal 's imagination . He 's not imaginary . He 's a \" Magical Negro \" : a saintly African - American character who acts as a mentor to a questing white hero , who seems to be disconnected from the community that he adores so much , and who often seems to have an uncanny ability to say and do exactly what needs to be said or done in order to keep the story chugging along in the hero 's favor . We have Spike Lee to thank for popularizing this politically incorrect but very useful term . Lee used it in a 2001 appearances at college campuses . He was blasting a then - recent wave of such characters , played by the likes of Cuba Gooding Jr. , in \" What Dreams May Come \" ( a spirit guide helping Robin Williams rescue his wife from Hell ) , Will Smith in \" The Legend of Bagger Vance \" ( a sherpa - on - the - green , mentoring Matt Damon 's golfer ) , Laurence Fishburne in \" The Matrix \" ( Obi - Wan to Keanu Reeves ' Luke Skywalker ) and Michael Clarke Duncan in \" The Green Mile \" ( a gentle giant on death row whose touch heals white folks ' illnesses ) . The word choice is deliberately anachronistic -- \" negro \" started to fall out of fashion about 40 years ago . But that 's why it 's so devastating . The word \" negro \" was a transitional word that fell between the white - comforting \" colored \" and the more militantly self-determined and oppositional \" black . \" It asked for dignity and autonomy without going that extra step asserting that it existed anyway , with or without white America 's approval . \" Negro \" fits the sorts of characters that incensed Lee . Even though the movies take pains to insist that the African - American character is as much a flesh - and - blood person as the white hero , the relationship is that of a master and servant . And not a real servant , either : one that really , truly lives to serve , has no life to speak of beyond his service to Da Man , and never seems to trouble himself with doubts about the cause to which he 's devoting his time and energy . \" How is it that black people have these powers but they use them for the benefit of white people ? \" Lee asked sarcastically . The Magical Negro character ( or as Lee called him , the \" super-duper magical negro \" ) was n't invented in the 1990s . He 's been around for at least 100 years , accumulating enough examples ( from Uncle Remus in \" Song of the South \" through the clock - keeper played by Bill Cobbs in \" The Hudsucker Proxy \" ) to merit snarky lists , an entry in the urban dictionary and a detailed Wikipedia page ( turns out Stephen King 's fiction has been a magical negro factory ) . The term gained an even wider audience when a candidate to chair the Republican National Committee mailed out a song titled \" Barack the Magic Negro , \" with lyrics to the tune of the Peter , Paul and Mary hit . Outraged liberals focused on the surface racism encoded in the song title , ignoring the possibility that the song , however lead - footed in its humor , was rooted in something real . What got lost in the flap over the song was the phrase 's relevance to Obama 's candidacy : There was ( among Democrats , at least ) a widespread sense that replacing George W. Bush with the Illinois senator would send a definitive signal that everything was different now , that it was time to rebuild , repair , rejuvenate and move forward , not just toward a post - Bush society , but a post-racial one . It was an absurd hope , one that Obama himself seemed to resist endorsing at first , only to relent and begin publicly playing up his pioneer status as the first not-entirely - Caucasian man to pursue and then win the Democratic presidential nomination . Frequent Salon commenter David Ehrenstein tackled this subject in a memorable 2007 Los Angeles Times piece that called Obama a \" magic negro \" almost a year before that RNC ditty appeared . Likening Obama to a spiritual descendant of the noble , kindhearted , often sexless black men portrayed by pioneering leading man Sidney Poitier , he wrote , \" Like a comic -book superhero , Obama is there to help , out of the sheer goodness of a heart we need not know or understand . For as with all Magic Negroes , the less real he seems , the more desirable he becomes . \" Suffice to say Obama 's election triggered a paroxysm of paranoia , insecurity and rage in roughly half the population ( maybe more , if polls on immigration and the Park51 project are to be believed ) . These flare - ups of privilege ( wherein an almost entirely white sector of the populace descended from once- despised immigrants embraces the idea that \" we \" have to protect or reclaim \" our \" country from \" them \" ) cast retrospective light on the Magical Negro resurgence , which flowered in earnest during the last Democratic administration and has been going full -steam ever since . Between demographers ' projections of a 21st - century majority - minority swap , Clinton 's unprecedented ( un-presidented ? ) comfort with African - American culture ( which he made official during the 1992 campaign , in an effective bit of pandering stagecraft , by playing sax on \" The Arsenio Hall Show \" ) , and hip - hop 's supplanting rock as the country 's unofficial national soundtrack , there was a sense , even in the pre-Internet era , that the white man either was n't in control anymore or soon would n't be . Whitey was just going to have to deal . Things have n't played out quite so simply , of course . In every aspect of quality of life that can be measured , nonwhite folks have always tended to be worse off than whites . That has n't changed in the aughts , and the recession / depression has hit black men especially hard . Looking back over the last 20 years worth of cultural and demographic unrest , the M.N. phenomenon seems a form of psychological jujitsu -- one that takes a subject that some white folks find unpleasant or even troubling to ponder ( justifiably resentful black people 's status in a country that , 50 years after the start of the modern civil rights struggle , is still run by , and mostly for , whites ) and turns it into a source of gentle reassurance . Do \" they \" hate us ? Oh , no ! In fact , deep down they want \" us \" to succeed , and are happy to help \" us \" succeed , as long as we listen well and are polite . That 's why Whoopi Goldberg put her life on hold to help Demi Moore get in touch with her dead boyfriend in \" Ghost , \" and Jennifer Hudson lived to serve Sarah Jessica Parker in the first \" Sex and the City \" movie . And it 's why Danny Glover 's character -- one of but a few black men in an otherwise white town -- takes such a keen interest in the life of a bantamweight high school wrestler who has apparently lived in the same town with Harry his entire life and recognizes him as a local eccentric , yet never bothered to get to know him before now . People that enjoyed \" Legendary \" may say I 'm being unfair to Harry , that there 's more to him than Magical Negro-hood . And yes , it 's true , at the end -- spoiler alert ! -- we 're told that he 's not just a gravel - voiced sweetheart who likes to hang out by the local creek , catching fish and dispensing words of wisdom . He 's actually quite influential -- not literally magical , but nevertheless demi-godlike in his influence over the town and its history . But the specifics of Harry 's character do n't refute the label ; quite the contrary . The revelation of Harry 's influence is a nifty trick , one that 's common in nearly all movies featuring nonwhite mentor / sidekick / deus ex machina characters . It seems appealing enough in the abstract . But it 's weak soup when you look at such a character 's role in the totality of the story . Danny Glover , arguably one of cinema 's most versatile and likable character actors , gets to play something close to God ( he even narrates the story and turns out to have had a hand in three generations of local lives ) . But he does n't get a good scene with anybody but the hero , does n't get even the intimation of a private life , and barely speaks to anyone in the town that supposedly adores and respects him . Like the clock - tender in \" The Hudsucker Proxy , \" the HIV - stricken painter / saint from \" In America , \" and Ben Vereen 's characters in \" Pippin \" and \" All That Jazz , \" Harry 's aura of omnipotence is compensation for being shut out of the movie . It 's a screenwriter 's distraction that obscures the character 's detachment from the heart of the narrative -- and the character 's essentially decorative nature . Like the hot-tempered black police captain who demands the maverick white detective 's badge and the stern black woman judge who dresses down the kooky but irresponsible white heroine and warns her to get her life together , the Magical Negro is a glorified walk - on role , a narrative device with a pulse . The M.N. does n't really drive the story , but is a glorified hood ornament attached to the end of a car that 's being driven by white society , vigorously turning a little steering wheel that 's not attached to anything . Which might be a harsh but accurate metaphor for our current president , come to think of it .","annotations":[{"text":"a \" Magical Negro","span":[1093,1109],"token_span":[226,229],"role":"Speaker","label":"Speaker","role_definition":"The sentient entity that uses language in the written or spoken modality to reassure another person."},{"text":"at least 100 years","span":[3327,3344],"token_span":[681,684],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time at which the reassurance takes place."},{"text":"some white folks","span":[6898,6913],"token_span":[1356,1358],"role":"Experiencer","label":"Experiencer","role_definition":"The Experiencer receives reassurance from the Speaker."},{"text":"in a country that , 50 years after the start of the modern civil rights struggle , is still run by , and mostly for , whites","span":[7006,7129],"token_span":[1373,1399],"role":"Situation","label":"Situation","role_definition":"The Situation is the problem plaguing the Experiencer, about which the Speaker reassures them."},{"text":"they want \" us \" to succeed , and are happy to help \" us \" succeed","span":[7236,7301],"token_span":[1427,1443],"role":"Message","label":"Message","role_definition":"The Message is a proposition or set of propositions that the Speaker wants the Experiencer to believe in order to feel reassured."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"The character will also do almost anything , including sacrificing themselves to save the white protagonist , as exemplified in The Defiant Ones , in which Sidney Poitier plays the prototypical Magical Negro .

He 's a \" Magical Negro \" : a saintly African - American character who acts as a mentor to a questing white hero , who seems to be disconnected from the community that he adores so much , and who often seems to have an uncanny ability to say and do exactly what needs to be said or done in order to keep the story chugging along in the hero 's favor . We have Spike Lee to thank for popularizing this politically incorrect but very useful term . Lee used it in a 2001 appearances at college campuses . He was blasting a then - recent wave of such characters , played by the likes of Cuba Gooding Jr. , in \" What Dreams May Come \" ( a spirit guide helping Robin Williams rescue his wife from Hell ) , Will Smith in \" The Legend of Bagger Vance \" ( a sherpa - on - the - green , mentoring Matt Damon 's golfer ) , Laurence Fishburne in \" The Matrix \" ( Obi - Wan to Keanu Reeves ' Luke Skywalker ) and Michael Clarke Duncan in \" The Green Mile \" ( a gentle giant on death row whose touch heals white folks ' illnesses ) . The word choice is deliberately anachronistic -- \" negro \" started to fall out of fashion about 40 years ago . But that 's why it 's so devastating . The word \" negro \" was a transitional word that fell between the white - comforting \" colored \" and the more militantly self-determined and oppositional \" black . \" It asked for dignity and autonomy without going that extra step asserting that it existed anyway , with or without white America 's approval . \" Negro \" fits the sorts of characters that incensed Lee . Even though the movies take pains to insist that the African - American character is as much a flesh - and - blood person as the white hero , the relationship is that of a master and servant . And not a real servant , either : one that really , truly lives to serve , has no life to speak of beyond his service to Da Man , and never seems to trouble himself with doubts about the cause to which he 's devoting his time and energy . \" How is it that black people have these powers but they use them for the benefit of white people ? \" Lee asked sarcastically . The Magical Negro character ( or as Lee called him , the \" super-duper magical negro \" ) was n't invented in the 1990s . He 's been around for at least 100 years , accumulating enough examples ( from Uncle Remus in \" Song of the South \" through the clock - keeper played by Bill Cobbs in \" The Hudsucker Proxy \" ) to merit snarky lists , an entry in the urban dictionary and a detailed Wikipedia page ( turns out Stephen King 's fiction has been a magical negro factory ) . The term gained an even wider audience when a candidate to chair the Republican National Committee mailed out a song titled \" Barack the Magic Negro , \" with lyrics to the tune of the Peter , Paul and Mary hit . Outraged liberals focused on the surface racism encoded in the song title , ignoring the possibility that the song , however lead - footed in its humor , was rooted in something real . What got lost in the flap over the song was the phrase 's relevance to Obama 's candidacy : There was ( among Democrats , at least ) a widespread sense that replacing George W. Bush with the Illinois senator would send a definitive signal that everything was different now , that it was time to rebuild , repair , rejuvenate and move forward , not just toward a post - Bush society , but a post-racial one . It was an absurd hope , one that Obama himself seemed to resist endorsing at first , only to relent and begin publicly playing up his pioneer status as the first not-entirely - Caucasian man to pursue and then win the Democratic presidential nomination . Frequent Salon commenter David Ehrenstein tackled this subject in a memorable 2007 Los Angeles Times piece that called Obama a \" magic negro \" almost a year before that RNC ditty appeared . Likening Obama to a spiritual descendant of the noble , kindhearted , often sexless black men portrayed by pioneering leading man Sidney Poitier , he wrote , \" Like a comic -book superhero , Obama is there to help , out of the sheer goodness of a heart we need not know or understand . For as with all Magic Negroes , the less real he seems , the more desirable he becomes . \" Suffice to say Obama 's election triggered a paroxysm of paranoia , insecurity and rage in roughly half the population ( maybe more , if polls on immigration and the Park51 project are to be believed ) . These flare - ups of privilege ( wherein an almost entirely white sector of the populace descended from once- despised immigrants embraces the idea that \" we \" have to protect or reclaim \" our \" country from \" them \" ) cast retrospective light on the Magical Negro resurgence , which flowered in earnest during the last Democratic administration and has been going full -steam ever since . Between demographers ' projections of a 21st - century majority - minority swap , Clinton 's unprecedented ( un-presidented ? ) comfort with African - American culture ( which he made official during the 1992 campaign , in an effective bit of pandering stagecraft , by playing sax on \" The Arsenio Hall Show \" ) , and hip - hop 's supplanting rock as the country 's unofficial national soundtrack , there was a sense , even in the pre-Internet era , that the white man either was n't in control anymore or soon would n't be . Whitey was just going to have to deal . Things have n't played out quite so simply , of course . In every aspect of quality of life that can be measured , nonwhite folks have always tended to be worse off than whites . That has n't changed in the aughts , and the recession / depression has hit black men especially hard . Looking back over the last 20 years worth of cultural and demographic unrest , the M.N. phenomenon seems a form of psychological jujitsu -- one that takes a subject that some white folks find unpleasant or even troubling to ponder ( justifiably resentful black people 's status in a country that , 50 years after the start of the modern civil rights struggle , is still run by , and mostly for , whites ) and turns it into a source of gentle reassurance . Do \" they \" hate us ? Oh , no ! In fact , deep down they want \" us \" to succeed , and are happy to help \" us \" succeed , as long as we listen well and are polite . That 's why Whoopi Goldberg put her life on hold to help Demi Moore get in touch with her dead boyfriend in \" Ghost , \" and Jennifer Hudson lived to serve Sarah Jessica Parker in the first \" Sex and the City \" movie . And it 's why Danny Glover 's character -- one of but a few black men in an otherwise white town -- takes such a keen interest in the life of a bantamweight high school wrestler who has apparently lived in the same town with Harry his entire life and recognizes him as a local eccentric , yet never bothered to get to know him before now . People that enjoyed \" Legendary \" may say I 'm being unfair to Harry , that there 's more to him than Magical Negro-hood . And yes , it 's true , at the end -- spoiler alert ! -- we 're told that he 's not just a gravel - voiced sweetheart who likes to hang out by the local creek , catching fish and dispensing words of wisdom . He 's actually quite influential -- not literally magical , but nevertheless demi-godlike in his influence over the town and its history . But the specifics of Harry 's character do n't refute the label ; quite the contrary . The revelation of Harry 's influence is a nifty trick , one that 's common in nearly all movies featuring nonwhite mentor / sidekick / deus ex machina characters . It seems appealing enough in the abstract . But it 's weak soup when you look at such a character 's role in the totality of the story . Danny Glover , arguably one of cinema 's most versatile and likable character actors , gets to play something close to God ( he even narrates the story and turns out to have had a hand in three generations of local lives ) . But he does n't get a good scene with anybody but the hero , does n't get even the intimation of a private life , and barely speaks to anyone in the town that supposedly adores and respects him . Like the clock - tender in \" The Hudsucker Proxy , \" the HIV - stricken painter / saint from \" In America , \" and Ben Vereen 's characters in \" Pippin \" and \" All That Jazz , \" Harry 's aura of omnipotence is compensation for being shut out of the movie . It 's a screenwriter 's distraction that obscures the character 's detachment from the heart of the narrative -- and the character 's essentially decorative nature . Like the hot-tempered black police captain who demands the maverick white detective 's badge and the stern black woman judge who dresses down the kooky but irresponsible white heroine and warns her to get her life together , the Magical Negro is a glorified walk - on role , a narrative device with a pulse . The M.N. does n't really drive the story , but is a glorified hood ornament attached to the end of a car that 's being driven by white society , vigorously turning a little steering wheel that 's not attached to anything . Which might be a harsh but accurate metaphor for our current president , come to think of it .","annotations":[{"text":"a \" Magical Negro","span":[1093,1109],"token_span":[226,229],"role":"Speaker","label":"Speaker","role_definition":"The sentient entity that uses language in the written or spoken modality to reassure another person."},{"text":"some white folks","span":[6898,6913],"token_span":[1356,1358],"role":"Experiencer","label":"Experiencer","role_definition":"The Experiencer receives reassurance from the Speaker."},{"text":"they want \" us \" to succeed , and are happy to help \" us \" succeed","span":[7236,7301],"token_span":[1427,1443],"role":"Message","label":"Message","role_definition":"The Message is a proposition or set of propositions that the Speaker wants the Experiencer to believe in order to feel reassured."},{"text":"in a country that , 50 years after the start of the modern civil rights struggle , is still run by , and mostly for , whites","span":[7006,7129],"token_span":[1373,1399],"role":"Situation","label":"Situation","role_definition":"The Situation is the problem plaguing the Experiencer, about which the Speaker reassures them."},{"text":"at least 100 years","span":[3327,3344],"token_span":[681,684],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time at which the reassurance takes place."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-2925-230-frame-Receiving","frame":"Receiving","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Recipient comes into possession of the Theme as a result of the joint action of the Donor and the Recipient.","frame_ancestors":["Getting","Event"],"frame_descendants":["Borrowing"],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"These messages often take the form of email marketing , although other media can also be used .

Unlike a leaky faucet , drip marketing is no accident . Successful drip marketing involves a carefully planned and thoughtfully targeted series of communications that will get your message across to customers and keep your company 's name in their minds . As prospects move through the early stages of the sell cycle , drip marketing helps ensure that those potential customers become your actual customers . Advantages Building awareness is one of the most important advantages of drip marketing . It fixes your company name and message in the potential customer 's mind . Education is another important function . Drip marketing can inform prospects about your products and your industry by giving useful information while building trust in your company . Who It 's Good For Drip marketing is ideal for high - value products with a long sell cycle , especially high - ticket items which are purchased at infrequent intervals . For example , mortgage companies and real estate agencies are big on drip marketing . So are health and life insurance agents . IT vendors whose products are purchased at infrequent intervals are also a rich market for drip marketers . Drip marketing is especially effective if you have some insight into the prospect 's buying cycle . Some kinds of goods , such as business computers and automobiles , tend to have a definite lifespan and are replaced every few years . Aim Your Drips Drip marketing needs careful planning for maximum effect . You must decide on a basic theme or themes that you want your campaign to drive home . But the same message endlessly repeated loses effectiveness . Even though the themes remain the same , drip marketing requires variation in the way you present the message . Kissing the Minimum Number of Frogs On a percentage basis , drip marketing is not very efficient . It requires you to contact a number of people a number of times to drive sales . This does n't mean drip marketing ca n't generate a lot of sales . Properly done , it can turn up many good prospects . But it does mean that you need to carefully focus your drip-marketing efforts . Paradoxically , while drip marketing uses mass - marketing techniques like email and direct mail , it becomes most effective when the messages are customized for specific audiences . Once you 've decided on your basic themes , you need to analyze your prospect list to determine which presentations are likely to be most effective with different groups . For example , a real estate agency will have some potential clients who are buying their first homes , some who are retiring and looking to downsize and some who are moving into the area . Each of these groups will benefit from a different approach . First- time buyers are likely to be interested in affordability . Older prospects looking to downsize will probably be more concerned about issues like tax implications and how to handle the sale of their existing home . By segmenting your prospects , you can provide them with the appropriate series of messages . Drip Systems Fortunately , drip marketing lends itself to a high degree of automation . Equally fortunately , there are a number of tools to help you run a drip- marketing campaign , or alternatively a number of companies who will run your campaign for you . Many drip-marketing products are specialized for particular industries . For example Norvax Inc. 's Lead Miner is designed for insurance agencies selling health insurance . Agent 360 from RENWare Inc. is designed for real estate agents . Other software programs , such as Swiftpage , are more general and will work for many kinds of businesses . Beyond the industries they serve , drip products vary enormously in what they do . In fact , drip marketing is more a buzzword than a product description . One must look beyond the term to see what a product actually offers . The most basic drip marketing products are email auto-responders . These simply send a reply , or a series of replies , to queries emailed to your business . Even within this category there is variation . Some of these products , like Swiftpage , automatically assemble a leads database in addition to sending out email messages . Others , such as TriggerTouch , will start with visitor information from your Web site . Most of these programs will send a series of messages , spaced over a period of weeks or months , in response to an initial query . In effect , they automatically launch a drip marketing campaign aimed at the potential customer . The more sophisticated programs allow you to vary the content of the messages as well as their timing depending on your evaluation of the contact . Some of them even have advanced features : LeadMiner can automatically generate current quotes to be included in the emails . But drip marketing can be much more than just email . It can also include direct mail contact , newsletters , telephone calls or on - site visits . In fact , just about any form of customer communication can be integrated into a drip-marketing campaign . Some drip-marketing software will also automatically remind you to call the lead or send out mailings . Some CRM programs , such as ACT4 Advisors , which is built on Sage Software Inc. 's ACT ! CRM program , come with features that let you set up a drip-marketing program . In the case of ACT ! that includes a series of sample letters on various topics . Finally , there are a number of companies that specialize in running drip-marketing campaigns , such as MyMarketing Partner Inc . They can help you create your message and analyze your prospects , and can provide you with prewritten or customizable materials aimed at the various target groups . You work out the basics and they do the rest . Avoid the Spam Trap Badly done drip marketing is Chinese water torture for prospects . They may remember you , but they 're unlikely to deal with you . Bombarding prospects with uninteresting or irrelevant messages is a great way to end up being ignored . In this day of spam filters and floods of junk mail , it 's all too easy to wind up as part of the background noise rather than a signal . Email marketing is a particularly tricky business because of spam 's current choke hold on email campaigns . In fact , most people who get a message from a company with whom they 're not familiar are likely to assume it 's spam . Another problem with email marketing is that malicious emails have made people wary of opening attachments such as newsletters or reports . The basic way around this problem is content combined with trust . To overcome the spam barrier you need an interesting message . You have to say something in which your potential customers are likely to be interested . Often that means giving them tips or other useful information . Second , you need to build trust . Your prospects must trust you to give them something they want and not send them viruses . This is one limit for sending newsletters as attachments to emails . Personalization also builds trust , both in your emails and in your company . As much as possible , include your prospects ' names and other information \u2014 correct information \u2014 showing that they 're not just a name on a mailing list . Also include information about who you are . For example , an email signed by the sales rep who will handle the account is more effective , especially if the email is from that rep 's own email account . Customizing on the Cheap The big advantage of drip marketing is that it gives you a relatively low-cost , low- effort way of maintaining regular contact with leads who have n't yet made the critical buying decision . You can do this by other means , of course , but drip marketing lets you touch a lot more people effectively without wasting a lot of work . With drip marketing you can have more contact with more prospects without overloading your sales force or breaking your budget .

When he was five , his father 's business failed and the family moved to Zhitomir , the capital of Volhynia . Two years later his father died and his mother , unable to support the family , handed the children over to other relatives . Early Years Bialik was raised by his grandfather , a wealthy businessman and religious Jew who imposed a strict Jewish education on his wild and undisciplined grandchild . By the age of 13 , Bialik had the reputation of an ilui\u2013an intellectual prodigy \u2013and was consulted on questions of Jewish law . At 17 , he left to attend the famous yeshiva at Volozhin . There , he wrote his first poems and became attracted to the secular- nationalist writings of Ahad Ha'am . Bialik soon became a full - fledged Zionist and \u2013without telling his grandfather\u2013left the yeshiva in the hopes of attending university or a modern rabbinical seminary . Bialik traveled to Odessa \u2013 the center of the new , secular Jewish culture . There he met Ahad Ha'am , Moshe Leib Lilienblum , and other cultural Zionist leaders . He began publishing\u2013one of his first poems was El Ha-Tzippor ( \" To the Bird \" ) , a lyric of longing for Zion\u2013and was soon recognized as his generation 's most promising Hebrew poet . In 1893 , Bialik returned to Zhitomir to marry Manya Averbuch and work for his father - in - law as a timber merchant . Alone in the forest for days on end , Bialik wrote prolifically . Alongside poems with pronounced nationalist themes , such as \" Blessing of the Nation , \" he produced \" Ha -Matmid , \" a depiction of a yeshiva student , in which Bialik worked through the theme of self - denial in pursuit of a higher ideal . In 1897 , after the collapse of the family business , Bialik moved to Sosnowiec , a town on the Prussian border , and from there , in 1900 , back to Odessa . After working as a teacher and a merchant , in 1903 Bialik was appointed the joint editor of Ha-Shiloah , a Hebrew periodical founded by Ahad Ha'am . Following the first Zionist Congress of 1897 , Hebrew poetry took on new importance , and despite the fact that most of his poems articulated not hope but grief and despair , Bialik was hailed as a prophet of Jewish nationalism . City of Slaughter In 1903 , Bialik was commissioned by the Jewish Historical Society of Odessa to travel to Kishinev , a town in Bessarabia ( now Moldova ) where in the course of a three day pogrom 47 Jews had been murdered . His experience interviewing the survivors led him to write the epic \" City of Slaughter , \" which reflects the poet 's bitterness at the absence of justice and the indifference of nature , but also attacks the Jews who had done nothing to defend themselves in the face of the violence . The poem reads : To the graveyard , beggars ! Dig up the bones of martyred father and brother , fill your sacks , sling them on backs And hit the road to do business at all the fairs ; advertise yourselves at the crossroads so everyone sees , in the sunshine on filthy rags spread the bones and sing your hoarse beggar song , beg the decency of the world ! Beg the pity of goyim ! Eternal beggars ! Bialik 's criticism resonated with the Zionist goal of effecting a revolutionary transformation of the Jews into a proud , even warlike , nation . The poem circulated in Hebrew and Yiddish versions , as well as in a Russian translation by Revisionist Zionist leader Vladimir Jabotinsky . In these years , Bialik realized his full power as a poet , raising Hebrew lyric to the level of the great European romantic poets . Alongside \" City of Slaughter \" and other \" poems of wrath , \" whose inflammatory tones influenced not only Zionists but a generation of Jewish Communist revolutionaries , Bialik composed poems about nature and lost love . Yet even his love poetry was marked by disgust and despair at the failure of passion : I was innocent , no storm of lust had fouled me Till you came . I , foolish boy , cast down at your feet , mercilessly , my purity of heart and soul , the tender flowers of my youth . ( From Hungry Eyes , 1897 ) Confession of Loss In 1905 , Bialik published \" Scroll of Fire , \" a nine section experimental prose poem . The poem weaves Talmudic legends into a romantic allegory of national and personal trauma . \" Scroll of Fire \" begins with a powerful depiction of the destruction of the ancient Temple , yet the poem was also inspired by the burning of Odessa in 1905 , the memory of childhood fires , and an intense extramarital relationship . Drawing on a Talmudic legend and the Song of Songs , Bialik describes the words of the last surviving boy\u2013a character representing Hope\u2013to the only girl not to commit suicide in the wake of the catastrophe : All my life my soul cried out to you in a thousand voices , and in tens of thousands of ways , crooked and invisible , fled from you to you Even as a baby in the black of night , I saw your beauty and covered your hidden light \u2026 With the sorrow of a mother the golden light of your eye rested on me \u2026 at night like a weaned child on his mother 's lap I made my love known and I waited . \" Scroll of Fire \" is a confession of loss , and reflects Bialik 's ambivalence about his public role . It begins with a national catastrophe but uses this event to address deeply personal issues , and articulates the poet 's guilt about subordinating a greater issue to a merely \u2013 but more powerfully \u2013 personal event . Bialik 's writing was influenced by many factors happening around him : the ambiance of the Russian Pale of Settlement , the new traditions of hasidism and haskalah ( Jewish Enlightenment ) , the Romantic Movement , ongoing anti-Semitism , and growing Zionism . His poetry was marked , perhaps above all , by the use of a sweeping array of Jewish sources , from the Bible , through Talmud and Midrash , to medieval and modern poetry . These sources were quoted and paraphrased , often ironically or in a misplaced context , to achieve artistic richness and to thrill an audience itself imbued with a deep knowledge of the tradition . Bialik 's primary literary influence was the pioneer of Hebrew and Yiddish fiction , Mendele Mokher Sefarim ( S.J. Abramowitz ) . The older writer shared Bialik 's experience of orphanhood and abandonment by his mother , and the two developed a close emotional bond . On the ideological front , Bialik was decisively inspired by Ahad Ha'am and his calls for a Jewish cultural renaissance . Some have argued that the poet 's creativity was stunted by Ahad Ha'am 's didactic , ideological approach to art . Forays into Publishing Bialik 's poetic output dropped off in 1906 as he focused on his publishing business . He began to collaborate with Y.H. Ravnitzky on Sefer Ha-Aggadah , a comprehensive compilation of legends culled from Talmudic and midrashic literature . The book was part of Bialik 's project of kinnus , or ingathering , an attempt to collect the fragments of Jewish literature from all countries of Diaspora . He believed they would bring about an emergent Jewish national consciousness . But Bialik 's conflicted preference for the personal over the public found expression again during a visit to Israel in 1909 . He tried to give readings of his more personal work , but audiences insisted on hearing his poetry of hope and national revival . The acclaim he received aroused the same bitter feelings evident in many of his poems . As he wrote to his wife from Jaffa , \" The people regard me as someone worthy of respect , but I know that I am a nothing , a nobody . \" Bialik 's despair grew . As he wrote to a friend in 1909 , \" Sometimes I think I 'm going mad . I lack nothing , it seems , but I have no peace of mind . What is it ? I do n't know . Big and little sins gnaw at me like worms . At night I do n't sleep . I 'm worn out by ugly idleness , and I feel that I 'm wallowing in a filthy pit . \" In \" A Twig Fell \u201d ( 1911 ) , the poet is obsessed with death , seeing himself as a broken , useless twig , hanging from a branch . Dramatic historical events of 1917 - 1920 \u2013 the Bolshevik revolution , the Balfour Declaration , and pogroms that swept Eastern Europe in the wake of the First World War\u2013prompted Bialik to leave Russia . He traveled to Berlin and in 1924 settled in Palestine . Lasting Legacy In Tel Aviv , Bialik reorganized his life . He reestablished the publishing house he had started in Odessa , served on the board of the Hebrew University and as the honorary president of the Hebrew Writers ' Union , and traveled to the United States as an emissary for the World Zionist Organization . He edited collections by the medieval Hebrew poets Moses ibn Ezra and Solomon ibn Gabirol , and he published poems , songs , and reworkings of biblical stories for children . Bialik has influenced entire generations of Zionists , including tens of thousands who were exposed to his poetry as part of the Israeli school curriculum . He wrote Hebrew poetry at a time when it was far from clear that Hebrew would become the spoken language of the Jewish community in Israel . His experiments in rhyme and meter \u2013he pioneered free verse and prose poetry in Modern Hebrew\u2013opened up possibilities for the future development of Hebrew literature , and his impact is felt in the work of almost every subsequent writer , from Agnon and Joseph Hayim Brenner through to Uri Zvi Greenberg , Natan Zach and Yehuda Amichai . Although many of Bialik 's personal poems have been misinterpreted in the light of nationalist preoccupations , his power as a poet comes from the force of personal trauma that underlies his poetry 's national themes . He speaks for his exiled , traumatized people out of his own personal biography of abandonment and separation . In 1934 , Bialik published Orphanhood , a four - part recreation of his life 's greatest trauma : the loss of his mother and father .

When he was five , his father 's business failed and the family moved to Zhitomir , the capital of Volhynia . Two years later his father died and his mother , unable to support the family , handed the children over to other relatives . Early Years Bialik was raised by his grandfather , a wealthy businessman and religious Jew who imposed a strict Jewish education on his wild and undisciplined grandchild . By the age of 13 , Bialik had the reputation of an ilui\u2013an intellectual prodigy \u2013and was consulted on questions of Jewish law . At 17 , he left to attend the famous yeshiva at Volozhin . There , he wrote his first poems and became attracted to the secular- nationalist writings of Ahad Ha'am . Bialik soon became a full - fledged Zionist and \u2013without telling his grandfather\u2013left the yeshiva in the hopes of attending university or a modern rabbinical seminary . Bialik traveled to Odessa \u2013 the center of the new , secular Jewish culture . There he met Ahad Ha'am , Moshe Leib Lilienblum , and other cultural Zionist leaders . He began publishing\u2013one of his first poems was El Ha-Tzippor ( \" To the Bird \" ) , a lyric of longing for Zion\u2013and was soon recognized as his generation 's most promising Hebrew poet . In 1893 , Bialik returned to Zhitomir to marry Manya Averbuch and work for his father - in - law as a timber merchant . Alone in the forest for days on end , Bialik wrote prolifically .

After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation , then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive . Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party , and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assembly 's suspension in 2002 . John Reginald Gorman was born on February 1 1923 at Mullaghmore House , Co Tyrone . Both sides of his family were Catholics and Unionists . His father , an RUC district inspector , had won an MC while serving in Palestine during the First World War and , as a member of the Royal Irish Constabulary , had handed over the Phoenix Park barracks to Michael Collins after the 1921 Anglo - Irish treaty \u2014 after which he moved north . Having been educated by Loretto nuns at Omagh , John was sent to the Imperial Service College at Windsor . After war broke out in 1939 he attended Portrora Royal School , Enniskillen , which was then a firmly Anglican establishment and the Province 's leading public school . Despite the school 's religious ethos , Gorman never found his Catholicism a source of trouble or comment . Commissioned into the Irish Guards in 1942 , Gorman first experienced action as a tank commander during Operation Goodwood on July 18 1944 . At Cagny , five miles from Caen , Gorman 's troop was confronted by four enemy tanks , among them a King Tiger whose gun was aimed at one of Gorman 's tanks . He had previously told his driver , Corporal James Baron , that if they were to encounter any of the feared Tigers , \u201c The only thing we can do is to use naval tactics \u2014 if the 88 mm gun is pointing away from us , we shall have to use the speed of the Sherman and ram it . \u201d The Sherman duly crashed through a hedge and careered down the slope at 40mph towards the King Tiger . With 75 yards to go before impact , the Sherman 's gunner , Guardsman Scholes , fired a high - explosive shell at the King Tiger , but it failed to penetrate the armour . Sir John Gorman 's autobiography , published in 2002 The British tank struck the King Tiger hard on its right track , and both crews bailed out . The Sherman 's front gunner , Guardsman Agnew , mistakenly took refuge in a ditch with the German crew ; on realising his error , he saluted smartly and disappeared into a cornfield to rejoin his comrades . Having led his men to safety behind a hedge , Gorman raced 400 yards to leap into a lone Firefly tank , where one crew member had been decapitated and two others were in shock . The vehicle was still workable so , after removing the body and wiping the blood from the gun sights , Gorman fired its gun to disable the Tiger and his own tank , before driving behind three more Tigers to score two hits . He then carried three burning men from another Sherman to an aid post . For this action , Gorman was recommended for an Immediate MC and Baron for a Military Medal . Both men were presented with their medals in the field by General Montgomery . Outside Brussels the regiment was greeted by jubilant crowds , and an elderly woman presented Gorman with a copy of Some Experiences of an Irish RM , which had been left at her parents ' house by another Irish Guardsman in 1914 . But the war was not yet over , and Gorman , by now a captain , attended the briefing on the impending Arnhem campaign given by Lieutenant - General Sir Brian Horrocks , the Corps Commander . When Horrocks announced that the \u201c honour of leading this great dash which may end the war \u201d would be given to the Irish Guards , Gorman expostulated : \u201c Oh , my God , not again ! \u201d Gorman and his troop crossed the Nijmegen bridge before the advance was called off . Having left the Army in the rank of captain in 1946 , Gorman joined the RUC and became a district inspector in Antrim . There , in 1947 , he came into conflict with the young Ian Paisley , who had objected to a proposed Roman Catholic pilgrimage to a holy well at Rasharkin . Gorman gave the procession an RUC guard on the Feast of the Assumption . In 1955 he was moved , as district inspector , to Armagh where , shortly after his arrival , he and an Army officer , Major Brian Clark , helped to disarm a young fusilier who had gone berserk . Gorman suggested to Clark that their exploit was worth a medal \u2014 but only one . They tossed a coin for the honour and in due course Clark , on Gorman 's recommendation , was awarded the George Medal . Later , with the approval of the Archbishop of Armagh , Cardinal D'Alton , Gorman uncovered an IRA bomb -making factory in the Catholic Cathedral , which led to the arrest of three armed gunmen hiding in the confessionals . During the IRA 's border campaign in the 1950s Gorman acted as a liaison officer with MI5 and MI6 , and in 1960 his security contacts put his name forward for the position of chief of security at BOAC . One of his first duties was to supervise the security arrangements for the royal tour of Pakistan , Nepal and Iran in 1961 , at the end of which he was appointed CVO . He was later promoted the airline 's head of personnel , with a seat on the board . In 1968 he moved to become the airline 's manager in Canada , and , from 1975 , in India , Bangladesh and Sri Lanka . In 1979 Gorman returned to his native province to become deputy chairman and chief executive of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive , the country 's largest owner of public housing . He succeeded in cleaning up corruption and selling off council houses , and in 1986 became part-time director of the Institute of Directors in Northern Ireland , an office he held until 1995 . In 1990 he aroused controversy when he invited the Irish Taoiseach , Charles Haughey , to address an IoD meeting in Belfast , in Haughey 's capacity as President of the European Union . Prominent among opponents of the visit was the Unionist politician David Trimble . None the less , after Trimble 's election as Ulster Unionist leader in 1995 , Gorman joined the UUP , and in 1996 was nominated by his party as a member of the Northern Ireland Forum for Political Dialogue , a body which had been set up in parallel with inter-party talks . He was subsequently chairman of the Forum , a position which he held until its last session in April 1998 . Following the Belfast Agreement of the same year , Gorman was elected as member for North Down in the new Northern Ireland Assembly , and served as a Deputy Speaker of the assembly from 2000 until its suspension in 2002 .

After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation , then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive . Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party , and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assembly 's suspension in 2002 . John Reginald Gorman was born on February 1 1923 at Mullaghmore House , Co Tyrone . Both sides of his family were Catholics and Unionists . His father , an RUC district inspector , had won an MC while serving in Palestine during the First World War and , as a member of the Royal Irish Constabulary , had handed over the Phoenix Park barracks to Michael Collins after the 1921 Anglo - Irish treaty \u2014 after which he moved north . Having been educated by Loretto nuns at Omagh , John was sent to the Imperial Service College at Windsor . After war broke out in 1939 he attended Portrora Royal School , Enniskillen , which was then a firmly Anglican establishment and the Province 's leading public school . Despite the school 's religious ethos , Gorman never found his Catholicism a source of trouble or comment . Commissioned into the Irish Guards in 1942 , Gorman first experienced action as a tank commander during Operation Goodwood on July 18 1944 . At Cagny , five miles from Caen , Gorman 's troop was confronted by four enemy tanks , among them a King Tiger whose gun was aimed at one of Gorman 's tanks . He had previously told his driver , Corporal James Baron , that if they were to encounter any of the feared Tigers , \u201c The only thing we can do is to use naval tactics \u2014 if the 88 mm gun is pointing away from us , we shall have to use the speed of the Sherman and ram it . \u201d The Sherman duly crashed through a hedge and careered down the slope at 40mph towards the King Tiger . With 75 yards to go before impact , the Sherman 's gunner , Guardsman Scholes , fired a high - explosive shell at the King Tiger , but it failed to penetrate the armour . Sir John Gorman 's autobiography , published in 2002 The British tank struck the King Tiger hard on its right track , and both crews bailed out . The Sherman 's front gunner , Guardsman Agnew , mistakenly took refuge in a ditch with the German crew ; on realising his error , he saluted smartly and disappeared into a cornfield to rejoin his comrades . Having led his men to safety behind a hedge , Gorman raced 400 yards to leap into a lone Firefly tank , where one crew member had been decapitated and two others were in shock . The vehicle was still workable so , after removing the body and wiping the blood from the gun sights , Gorman fired its gun to disable the Tiger and his own tank , before driving behind three more Tigers to score two hits . He then carried three burning men from another Sherman to an aid post . For this action , Gorman was recommended for an Immediate MC and Baron for a Military Medal . Both men were presented with their medals in the field by General Montgomery . Outside Brussels the regiment was greeted by jubilant crowds , and an elderly woman presented Gorman with a copy of Some Experiences of an Irish RM , which had been left at her parents ' house by another Irish Guardsman in 1914 . But the war was not yet over , and Gorman , by now a captain , attended the briefing on the impending Arnhem campaign given by Lieutenant - General Sir Brian Horrocks , the Corps Commander . When Horrocks announced that the \u201c honour of leading this great dash which may end the war \u201d would be given to the Irish Guards , Gorman expostulated : \u201c Oh , my God , not again ! \u201d Gorman and his troop crossed the Nijmegen bridge before the advance was called off . Having left the Army in the rank of captain in 1946 , Gorman joined the RUC and became a district inspector in Antrim . There , in 1947 , he came into conflict with the young Ian Paisley , who had objected to a proposed Roman Catholic pilgrimage to a holy well at Rasharkin . Gorman gave the procession an RUC guard on the Feast of the Assumption . In 1955 he was moved , as district inspector , to Armagh where , shortly after his arrival , he and an Army officer , Major Brian Clark , helped to disarm a young fusilier who had gone berserk . Gorman suggested to Clark that their exploit was worth a medal \u2014 but only one . They tossed a coin for the honour and in due course Clark , on Gorman 's recommendation , was awarded the George Medal . Later , with the approval of the Archbishop of Armagh , Cardinal D'Alton , Gorman uncovered an IRA bomb -making factory in the Catholic Cathedral , which led to the arrest of three armed gunmen hiding in the confessionals . During the IRA 's border campaign in the 1950s Gorman acted as a liaison officer with MI5 and MI6 , and in 1960 his security contacts put his name forward for the position of chief of security at BOAC . One of his first duties was to supervise the security arrangements for the royal tour of Pakistan , Nepal and Iran in 1961 , at the end of which he was appointed CVO . He was later promoted the airline 's head of personnel , with a seat on the board . In 1968 he moved to become the airline 's manager in Canada , and , from 1975 , in India , Bangladesh and Sri Lanka . In 1979 Gorman returned to his native province to become deputy chairman and chief executive of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive , the country 's largest owner of public housing . He succeeded in cleaning up corruption and selling off council houses , and in 1986 became part-time director of the Institute of Directors in Northern Ireland , an office he held until 1995 .

' \u201d Eagle tells me . \u201c And he said ' Yes , he did realise that ' , still offered me the job , and I thought on that basis : ' OK , he knows that , he 's not going to be surprised by my views . ' \u201d Eagle , who was elected in 1997 to represent Liverpool Garston ( now Garston and Hallwood ) , adds : \u201c He wanted to know whether I was willing to undertake a review and I said ' Yes ' , obviously . We need to have a debate about these things . And on that basis he offered me the job and on that basis I took it . \u201d For Eagle , the debate over Trident renewal is one that Labour has avoided for too long . \u201c I think there 's a mood out there for more transparency , not just in the Labour Party but in society as a whole . It 's not just in the Labour Party that the issue of defence spending is an issue . The Lib Dems had a big debate at their conference , the SNP obviously debate it all the time . \u201c I think at a time when you 've got austerity and big cuts in public expenditure it 's reasonable for people to ask whether or not the money that we 're spending on defence generally and on a successor submarine , in particular , is properly spent . \u201d The review , she pledges , will examine Trident \u201c with a completely open mind \u201d on \u201c the basis of facts and figures \u201d . Of the possibility that it could endorse unilateral disarmament , she says : \u201c I 'm not ruling it out . \u201d Eagle refuses to say whether Corbyn should grant a free vote on the issue but denounces the Conservatives as \u201c despicable \u201d for \u201c seeking to play party politics \u201d by potentially bringing forward the Commons decision to December . \u201c For a start - off , they do n't have to have a vote on this , they 've got a mandate . Since when did they decide it was necessary to have parliamentary votes on whether or not they should sign big contracts ? I do n't remember them doing it about whether or not we should get the Chinese to build nuclear power stations in Somerset . I do n't remember them doing it on whether or not we should give Virgin the East Coast franchise . \u201c If they bring that vote forward , before Christmas , that is a despicable attempt to play politics with this issue and , quite disgracefully , with our national defence at a time of increased tension abroad . . . Their cover for it is that we do n't want it to be an issue in the Scottish elections . It 's going to be an issue in the Scottish elections whether there 's a vote before or not . \u201d She adds : \u201c They 're here to exploit differences in the Labour Party . Well , we 're going to have a genuine debate about whether or not this is the right way for us to spend a significant amount of money over a significant number of years . We will have that debate properly . That kind of behaviour will be seen for what is . \u201d Labour conference delegates voted not to debate Trident at the party 's conference ( \u201c Delegates decided . . . you ca n't say that it 's been kept off the agenda , \u201d Eagle notes ) but the issue dominated the final day after Corbyn told the Today programme that there were no circumstances in which he would press the nuclear button . \u201c For a potential prime minister to answer that question in the way he did is n't helpful , it is n't helpful , \u201d Eagle says . \u201c Now , I do n't have any problem with somebody who says , ' Deterrence does n't work . ' But not everybody in the Labour Party believes that deterrence does n't work : I think it works . I think it certainly does n't work if you tell your potential enemies precisely what you are or are n't going to do in given circumstances . I did n't think it was necessary for him to answer that question . \u201d Would she press the button ? \u201c I think the key thing for deterrence is not to tell your potential enemies what you 'd do . It has to be an option , that is how deterrence works , \u201d she replies . David Cameron used his Conservative conference speech to denounce Corbyn memorably as \u201c security - threatening , terrorist - sympathising , Britain -hating \u201d . \u201c It 's conference - speech rhetoric , is n't it ? That 's what it was , it was a personal attack , \u201d says Eagle when I ask her to respond . \u201c That 's what he does , he likes personal attacks . \u201d She refuses to defend Corbyn 's statement that the assassination of Osama Bin Laden was \u201c a tragedy \u201d , which partly inspired Cameron 's attack . \u201c I 'm not here to say that Jeremy was right or wrong about anything he 's ever said ; you have to ask Jeremy to justify what he 's said about things . But I do n't think it helps to take comments out of context , is all I 'd say , I do n't think it helps . Jeremy has said many things over the years from his perspectives . There 's no point asking me whether Jeremy 's saying the right things or not . He 's saying what he thinks and that 's fair enough . \u201d Of Corbyn 's own conference speech , which MPs criticised as addressed to the hall , rather than the country , Eagle says diplomatically : \u201c He was only elected a couple of weeks before he had to make that speech . He made it in the way in which he wanted to make it and that 's fine . I 'm not interested in criticising him about what he said . \u201d Eagle tells me that she supports the 2 per cent Nato defence spending target , which the Tories have pledged to meet . \u201c I think it 's a good thing . As anybody who 's ever been a minister will tell you , one of the jobs of a cabinet minister is to fight your corner for your share of the resource . \u201d She goes on to charge the government with encouraging Russian expansionism through its defence cuts . \u201c What 's happened is not unconnected : Russian spending going up in real terms , Nato spending going down . It 's not unconnected with , ca n't be unconnected , with what we 're seeing the Russians do . \u201d Eagle and her sister , Angela , were the first twins to sit in the Commons together . After being linked with the post of shadow chancellor , Angela became shadow business secretary in the reshuffle and was hurriedly given the additional post of shadow first secretary of state after criticism of the absence of women from the four great offices of state ( leader , chancellor , home secretary , foreign secretary ) on the Labour benches . \u201c I think my sister 's brilliant . Give her the biggest job going and she 'll do it and do it well , \u201d Eagle says when I ask her about the imbroglio . \u201c Obviously it would have been easier if she 'd been shadow chancellor : I 'd have got a good settlement , \u201d she quips . \u201c Her experience and perspective on things has always been helpful to me , always . We 're very close and so that 's good , that 's good . We can be mutually supportive and we are . Without any concerns or worries about any downside . It 's pretty good being a twin , I 've always thought so . I 'd recommend it . \u201d On the day we meet there is much unease among Labour MPs about the launch of the new Corbyn-aligned group Momentum , which they fear could be used as a vehicle for the deselection of critics . \u201c It 's not clear to me precisely what it 's meant to be , so let 's see how things go , \u201d Eagle says in response . \u201c I think anything that is used in that way is n't helpful . We need to focus on the real enemy : that 's the Tories . We 're going to try and win the next election . We do n't do that by fighting each other , however that ends up happening . \u201d And does she believe Labour can win the election ? \u201c I think it 's tough . But politics is changing , there 's a lot of churn going on , there 's a lot of things happening . We 're in a time of flux . There are opportunities . The Tories may fall apart over Europe . We do n't know what 's going to happen next week , next year . Let 's not write ourselves off . Let 's turn ourselves into a fighting force to sort them out .

I 'm not interested in criticising him about what he said . \u201d Eagle tells me that she supports the 2 per cent Nato defence spending target , which the Tories have pledged to meet . \u201c I think it 's a good thing . As anybody who 's ever been a minister will tell you , one of the jobs of a cabinet minister is to fight your corner for your share of the resource . \u201d She goes on to charge the government with encouraging Russian expansionism through its defence cuts . \u201c What 's happened is not unconnected : Russian spending going up in real terms , Nato spending going down . It 's not unconnected with , ca n't be unconnected , with what we 're seeing the Russians do . \u201d Eagle and her sister , Angela , were the first twins to sit in the Commons together . After being linked with the post of shadow chancellor , Angela became shadow business secretary in the reshuffle and was hurriedly given the additional post of shadow first secretary of state after criticism of the absence of women from the four great offices of state ( leader , chancellor , home secretary , foreign secretary ) on the Labour benches . \u201c I think my sister 's brilliant . Give her the biggest job going and she 'll do it and do it well , \u201d Eagle says when I ask her about the imbroglio . \u201c Obviously it would have been easier if she 'd been shadow chancellor : I 'd have got a good settlement , \u201d she quips . \u201c Her experience and perspective on things has always been helpful to me , always . We 're very close and so that 's good , that 's good . We can be mutually supportive and we are . Without any concerns or worries about any downside . It 's pretty good being a twin , I 've always thought so . I 'd recommend it . \u201d On the day we meet there is much unease among Labour MPs about the launch of the new Corbyn-aligned group Momentum , which they fear could be used as a vehicle for the deselection of critics . \u201c It 's not clear to me precisely what it 's meant to be , so let 's see how things go , \u201d Eagle says in response . \u201c I think anything that is used in that way is n't helpful . We need to focus on the real enemy : that 's the Tories . We 're going to try and win the next election . We do n't do that by fighting each other , however that ends up happening . \u201d And does she believe Labour can win the election ? \u201c I think it 's tough . But politics is changing , there 's a lot of churn going on , there 's a lot of things happening . We 're in a time of flux . There are opportunities . The Tories may fall apart over Europe . We do n't know what 's going to happen next week , next year . Let 's not write ourselves off . Let 's turn ourselves into a fighting force to sort them out . That 's what my constituents in Liverpool want to see us doing . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"Jeremy Corbyn","span":[613,625],"token_span":[117,118],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The sentient entity causes the Artifact to not function."},{"text":"nuclear weapons","span":[555,569],"token_span":[107,108],"role":"Artifact","label":"Artifact","role_definition":"The device that no longer works."},{"text":"UK","span":[549,550],"token_span":[105,105],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The place at which the event takes place."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-2455-628-frame-Renting","frame":"Renting","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Lessee gains the use of Goods owned by a Lessor by payment to the Lessor.","frame_ancestors":["Commerce_buy","Getting","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"In October 2021 former owner John Tetley and Tony Quinn signed a pact under which the Quinn took the lease , management and operations of Queensland Raceway .","annotations":[{"text":"October 2021","span":[3,14],"token_span":[1,2],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the event occurs."},{"text":"Tony Quinn","span":[45,54],"token_span":[8,9],"role":"Lessee","label":"Lessee","role_definition":"The individual that gains temporary use of the Goods by paying the Lessor"},{"text":"Queensland Raceway","span":[138,155],"token_span":[25,26],"role":"Goods","label":"Goods","role_definition":"The role Goods is an item which is temporarily exchanged for Money in a transaction."}],"trigger":{"text":"lease","start_char":101,"end_char":105,"start_token":19,"end_token":19,"frame":"Renting"}},"source":{"text":"QUINN TAKES OVER QUEENSLAND RACEWAY Triple Eight Race Engineering co-owner Tony Quinn will take over the lease , management and operations of Queensland Raceway .

In 1807 , the Crown granted the East India Company the First Charter of Justice , which set up a Court of Judicature in Penang . - In 1825 , Statute 6 Geo IV c 85 was passed by the British Parliament , enabling the King to make provision for the administration of justice in the British colonies of Singapore and Malacca . These , together with the Prince of Wales ' Island ( now known as ' Penang ' ) formed the Straits Settlements . The Second Charter of Justice was issued on 27 November 1826 . This Charter abolished the Recorder 's Court , which served only the Prince of Wales ' Island , and established the Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales ' Island , Singapore and Malaya . In criminal proceedings , the court was \" to administer criminal justice in such \u00a1 Manner and Form \" as the courts in England , with \" due attention being ( given ) to the several Religions , Manners and Usages of the native Inhabitants \" . The court was to \" give and pass Judgment and Sentence according to Justice and Right \" in civil proceedings . The Governor and the Resident Councillor acted as two judges of the court . The third judge was the Recorder , who was based on the Prince of Wales ' Island and had to travel on circuit to Malacca and Singapore from his home base . He was assisted in his duties by the Resident Councillors and the Governor , who sat as lay Judges . - The Third Charter of Justice of 12 August 1855 was granted to cope with the increase in the judicial workload which resulted from Singapore 's rapid development . Under the Third Charter of Justice , the Court of Judicature was reorganised into two divisions . The first division had jurisdiction over Singapore and Malacca and comprised the Recorder of Singapore , the Governor and the Resident Councillors of Singapore and Malacca . The second division had jurisdiction over the Prince of Wales ' Island and Province Wellesley , and comprised the Recorder of Prince of Wales ' Island , the Governor and the Resident Councillor of the Prince of Wales ' Island . - The Judicial Duties Act of 1867 brought about further changes to our judicial system . The Governor of the Straits Settlements ceased to be a Judge of the Court of Judicature , although the Resident Councillors continued to sit under their new title of Lieutenant - Governors . This Act also changed the titles of other officers : the \" Recorder of Singapore \" became the \" Chief Justice of the Straits Settlements \" while the \" Recorder of Prince of Wales ' Island became the \" Judge of Prince of Wales ' Island \" . Sir Peter Benson Maxwell , then the Recorder of Singapore , became the first Chief Justice of The Straits Settlements in 1867 . The Supreme Court Ordinance 1868 abolished the Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales ' Island , Singapore and Malacca , replacing it with the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements . In turn , the Courts Ordinance of 1873 reconstituted the Court , so that it now consisted of the Chief Justice , the Judge of Penang , a Senior and a Junior Puisne Judge . One division of the Court sat in Singapore and Malacca , whilst another sat in Penang . In addition , the Ordinance conferred on the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements the jurisdiction to sit as a Court of Appeal , with final appeals lying to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council . Previously , appeals had lain only to the King -in-Council . Further changes to the structure of the judicial system were brought by the Courts Ordinance of 1878 . This Ordinance was passed in response to the United Kingdom Judicature Acts of 1873 - 75 , which modified the court structure in England . Under the Ordinance , the jurisdiction for the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements was brought in line with that of the new English High Court . The Courts Ordinance of 1907 allowed Judicial Commissioners of the Federated Malay States to be appointed from time to time to perform the duties of a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements . The Court of Criminal Appeal Ordinance came into force on 1 September 1934 to provide for the establishment of a Court of Criminal Appeal . This was necessary as , up till then , the Court of Appeal had exercised only appellate civil jurisdiction . - Our courts ceased to function when the Japanese invaded Singapore in 1942 and established a Military Court of Justice to administer Military Ordinances and the laws of the Japanese army . The courts were re-opened by a Proclamation dated 27 May 1942 , which stated that the courts were to follow the former system of laws insofar as they did not interfere with the Military Administration . The Syonan Supreme Court or \" Syonan Koto -Hoin \" was opened on 29 May 1942 . A court of appeal was also created , but it never sat . - Following the surrender of the Japanese on 12 September 1945 , Singapore was temporarily administered by the British Military Administration . The British Military Administration proclaimed that all Japanese Proclamations and Decrees ceased to have effect , and that \" all laws and customs existing immediately prior to the Japanese occupation will be respected \" . The British Military Administration came to an end on 31 March 1946 . The Straits Settlements were disbanded and Singapore was made a separate Crown Colony on 1 April 1946 . The Supreme Court , consisting of a High Court and a Court of Appeal , was constituted by the Singapore Colony Order in Council . The Court of Criminal Appeal continued to function . Final appeals lay to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in England . On 2 May 1955 , Mr Tan Ah Tah became the first local - born person to be appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court . Mr Frederick Arthur Chua ( appointed on 15 February 1957 ) and Mr Wee Chong Jin ( appointed on 15 August 1957 ) were appointed thereafter . Mr Wee Chong Jin was also the first local - born member of the Singapore Bar to be appointed to the Supreme Court Bench . Mr Tan Ah Tah and Mr Frederick Arthur Chua were both from the Colonial Legal Service . On 5 January 1963 , Mr Wee Chong Jin became the first Asian to be appointed the Chief Justice of the State of Singapore . His appointment marked a break in the long - standing tradition ( since 1867 ) of appointing British Chief Justices for Singapore , the last of whom was Sir Alan Rose . Singapore 's judicial system was altered once again following her merger with Malaysia on 16 September 1963 . The Federation of Malaya Act came into force on 16 September 1963 , establishing the Federal Court of Malaysia and the structure of the Malaysian judicial system . The Malaysian Courts of Judicature Act 1964 repealed the provisions relating to the Singapore Supreme Court in Singapore 's Courts Ordinance as well as the whole of the Singapore 's Court of Criminal Appeal Ordinance . The Supreme Court of the Colony of Singapore was replaced by the High Court of Malaysia in Singapore , while the Court of Appeal was assimilated into the Federal Court . The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council continued to be the final appellate court . - Although Singapore became independent on 9 August 1965 , the ties between the judicial systems of Singapore and Malaysia were not severed until 1969 . The Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 , re-established the Supreme Court of Singapore , comprising the High Court , the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal . Jury trials were abolished in 1969 , by an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code which provided for trials of capital offences to be heard by two judges . This arrangement continued until 18 April 1992 , when the Criminal Procedure Code was amended to allow for trials of capital offences to be heard before a single Judge . The next important milestone for Singapore 's judicial system was the introduction of Judicial Commissioners to the Supreme Court Bench , with the first Judicial Commissioner , Mr Chan Sek Keong , being appointed on 1 July 1986 . A Judicial Commissioner is appointed for specific periods of time and may exercise the powers and perform the functions of a Judge . In this capacity , he enjoys the same immunities as a Judge . On 28 September 1990 , Mr Wee Chong Jin retired as Chief Justice , and Mr Yong Pung How , took over as the head of the Judiciary . The first female to be appointed to the Supreme Court Bench was Ms Lai Siu Chiu , who was appointed a Judicial Commissioner on 2 May 1991 . Thereafter , Ms Judith Prakash was appointed a Judicial Commissioner on 1 April 1992 . They were appointed Judges of the High Court on 2 May 1994 and 1 April 1995 respectively . In 1993 , the existing appellate court , which comprised the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal , was reconstituted into a single Court of Appeal for both civil and criminal appeals . The present Court of Appeal normally comprises the Chief Justice and the Judges of Appeal , who rank above the High Court judges . A Judge of the High Court may also , on the request of the Chief Justice , sit as a Judge of the Court of Appeal . The first Judges of Appeal to be appointed were Justice M Karthigesu and Justice L P Thean , both of whom were appointed as Judges of Appeal on 1 July 1993 . The physical buildings which have represented Singapore 's legal system since the founding of Singapore in 1819 , form an important part of the country 's legal heritage . These include the former Parliament House , the Empress Place Building , the old Supreme Court Building and the City Hall . The former Parliament House , the oldest government building in Singapore , was the original courthouse used by the British from 1827 . It was designed by George Coleman and was meant as a residence for a merchant named John Argyle Maxwell . Work commenced in 1826 and the building was completed in 1827 . Maxwell then leased the building to the colonial government for 15 years at a rent of 500 rupees a month . The ownership of the courthouse was finally transferred to Governor S G Bonham and the East India Company on 10 October 1842 for 15,600 Spanish dollars . The first court session was held in the central room on the first floor at the front of the building facing High Street . In 1839 , a single storey annexe was erected on an adjacent site to serve as a new courthouse so that the whole of the old courthouse could be used to house government offices . As the new court premises lay next to a shipbuilding yard , the noise from the yard frequently drowned the addresses of the Judge or the evidence of the witnesses . In November 1854 , the Grand Jury condemned the annexe as being totally unsuitable for a Court of Justice due to the incessant clamour from the adjoining shipbuilding yard . However , nothing was done until July 1864 , when the foundation stone for a new courthouse at the Empress Place Building was laid . The new courthouse was completed in 1865 , and now forms the centre portion of the Empress Place Building . The Empress Place Building was , in fact , a conglomerate of buildings built at various different times . The centre wing is the oldest part of the building and was built from 1864 to 1865 . This wing was designed by Major FA McNair and functioned as a courthouse for Singapore until 1875 . Court proceedings were carried out at the Empress Place Building until 1875 when renovations to the former Parliament House were completed . The Courts moved back into the former Parliament House and remained there until 1939 , when they moved into the Supreme Court building . The old Supreme Court building was built between 1937 and 1939 on the site of the former Grand Hotel de L'Europe . The Chief Architect of the Public Works Department , Frank Dorrington Ward , came up with no fewer than eight variations on the design of the old Supreme Court building . This building was Ward 's last and greatest work , and was acknowledged by many as his most significant creation . The old Supreme Court building was declared open by Sir Thomas Shenton Whitelegge Thomas , Governor of the Straits Settlements , and handed over to the then Chief Justice , Sir Percy McElwaine , on 3 August 1939 . The foundation stone of the Supreme Court building was laid by Sir Shenton Thomas on 1 April 1937 , and was , at that time , the biggest foundation stone in the whole of Malaya . A \" time capsule \" containing six Singapore newspapers dated 31 March 1937 , as well as a handful of Straits Settlements coins , was buried beneath the foundation stone . The time capsule is slated to be retrieved in the year 3000 . The imposing Corinthian and Ionic columns , as well as the tympanum sculpture fronting the Supreme Court Building , were the work of Cavalieri Rudolfo Nolli , a Milanese sculptor . The central figure in the tympanum is that of Justice , with a figure immediately to its left representing the lost soul begging for protection from it . Next to this figure are two legislators with books in hand , representing the law . To the right of Justice , a figure bows in gratitude , followed by a man with a bull , representing riches and prosperity . Two young children holding a sheaf of wheat represent abundance from law and justice . Another point of interest for visitors is that the old Supreme Court building actually features two domes : the main copper- coloured dome which dominates Singapore 's skyline , and a smaller dome which is hardly visible at street level , but which originally used to house a beautifully designed library . The old Supreme Court Building was originally constructed to house just four courts . Due to an increasing workload , additional courtrooms were constructed in the adjacent City Hall in November 1986 . Designed by municipal architect F D Meadows , the City Hall building was built between 1926 and 1929 , and was originally known as the Municipal Building . It used to house the offices of the Municipal Council , later known as City Council , which was responsible for the provision of water , electricity , gas , roads and bridges and street lighting . Over time , other government bodies absorbed the functions of the City Council . Extensive renovations were carried out on the City Hall building between November 1987 and May 1991 to build 12 additional courtrooms . In addition , the City Hall building has also housed other government departments such as the Public Service Commission and the Industrial Arbitration Court . The City Hall was also the scene of many important events in the history of Singapore . On 12 September 1945 , when Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten accepted the surrender of the Japanese forces on behalf of the allied forces , the signing of the surrender papers took place in the City Hall Chamber . The first Prime Minister of independent Singapore , Mr Lee Kuan Yew ( now Minister Mentor ) and members of his Cabinet , took their Oaths of Allegiance and Oaths of Office on 5 June 1959 in the City Hall Chamber .

In 1807 , the Crown granted the East India Company the First Charter of Justice , which set up a Court of Judicature in Penang . - In 1825 , Statute 6 Geo IV c 85 was passed by the British Parliament , enabling the King to make provision for the administration of justice in the British colonies of Singapore and Malacca . These , together with the Prince of Wales ' Island ( now known as ' Penang ' ) formed the Straits Settlements . The Second Charter of Justice was issued on 27 November 1826 . This Charter abolished the Recorder 's Court , which served only the Prince of Wales ' Island , and established the Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales ' Island , Singapore and Malaya . In criminal proceedings , the court was \" to administer criminal justice in such \u00a1 Manner and Form \" as the courts in England , with \" due attention being ( given ) to the several Religions , Manners and Usages of the native Inhabitants \" . The court was to \" give and pass Judgment and Sentence according to Justice and Right \" in civil proceedings . The Governor and the Resident Councillor acted as two judges of the court . The third judge was the Recorder , who was based on the Prince of Wales ' Island and had to travel on circuit to Malacca and Singapore from his home base . He was assisted in his duties by the Resident Councillors and the Governor , who sat as lay Judges . - The Third Charter of Justice of 12 August 1855 was granted to cope with the increase in the judicial workload which resulted from Singapore 's rapid development . Under the Third Charter of Justice , the Court of Judicature was reorganised into two divisions . The first division had jurisdiction over Singapore and Malacca and comprised the Recorder of Singapore , the Governor and the Resident Councillors of Singapore and Malacca . The second division had jurisdiction over the Prince of Wales ' Island and Province Wellesley , and comprised the Recorder of Prince of Wales ' Island , the Governor and the Resident Councillor of the Prince of Wales ' Island . - The Judicial Duties Act of 1867 brought about further changes to our judicial system . The Governor of the Straits Settlements ceased to be a Judge of the Court of Judicature , although the Resident Councillors continued to sit under their new title of Lieutenant - Governors . This Act also changed the titles of other officers : the \" Recorder of Singapore \" became the \" Chief Justice of the Straits Settlements \" while the \" Recorder of Prince of Wales ' Island became the \" Judge of Prince of Wales ' Island \" . Sir Peter Benson Maxwell , then the Recorder of Singapore , became the first Chief Justice of The Straits Settlements in 1867 . The Supreme Court Ordinance 1868 abolished the Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales ' Island , Singapore and Malacca , replacing it with the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements . In turn , the Courts Ordinance of 1873 reconstituted the Court , so that it now consisted of the Chief Justice , the Judge of Penang , a Senior and a Junior Puisne Judge . One division of the Court sat in Singapore and Malacca , whilst another sat in Penang . In addition , the Ordinance conferred on the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements the jurisdiction to sit as a Court of Appeal , with final appeals lying to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council . Previously , appeals had lain only to the King -in-Council . Further changes to the structure of the judicial system were brought by the Courts Ordinance of 1878 . This Ordinance was passed in response to the United Kingdom Judicature Acts of 1873 - 75 , which modified the court structure in England . Under the Ordinance , the jurisdiction for the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements was brought in line with that of the new English High Court . The Courts Ordinance of 1907 allowed Judicial Commissioners of the Federated Malay States to be appointed from time to time to perform the duties of a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements . The Court of Criminal Appeal Ordinance came into force on 1 September 1934 to provide for the establishment of a Court of Criminal Appeal . This was necessary as , up till then , the Court of Appeal had exercised only appellate civil jurisdiction . - Our courts ceased to function when the Japanese invaded Singapore in 1942 and established a Military Court of Justice to administer Military Ordinances and the laws of the Japanese army . The courts were re-opened by a Proclamation dated 27 May 1942 , which stated that the courts were to follow the former system of laws insofar as they did not interfere with the Military Administration . The Syonan Supreme Court or \" Syonan Koto -Hoin \" was opened on 29 May 1942 . A court of appeal was also created , but it never sat . - Following the surrender of the Japanese on 12 September 1945 , Singapore was temporarily administered by the British Military Administration . The British Military Administration proclaimed that all Japanese Proclamations and Decrees ceased to have effect , and that \" all laws and customs existing immediately prior to the Japanese occupation will be respected \" . The British Military Administration came to an end on 31 March 1946 . The Straits Settlements were disbanded and Singapore was made a separate Crown Colony on 1 April 1946 . The Supreme Court , consisting of a High Court and a Court of Appeal , was constituted by the Singapore Colony Order in Council . The Court of Criminal Appeal continued to function . Final appeals lay to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in England . On 2 May 1955 , Mr Tan Ah Tah became the first local - born person to be appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court . Mr Frederick Arthur Chua ( appointed on 15 February 1957 ) and Mr Wee Chong Jin ( appointed on 15 August 1957 ) were appointed thereafter . Mr Wee Chong Jin was also the first local - born member of the Singapore Bar to be appointed to the Supreme Court Bench . Mr Tan Ah Tah and Mr Frederick Arthur Chua were both from the Colonial Legal Service . On 5 January 1963 , Mr Wee Chong Jin became the first Asian to be appointed the Chief Justice of the State of Singapore . His appointment marked a break in the long - standing tradition ( since 1867 ) of appointing British Chief Justices for Singapore , the last of whom was Sir Alan Rose . Singapore 's judicial system was altered once again following her merger with Malaysia on 16 September 1963 . The Federation of Malaya Act came into force on 16 September 1963 , establishing the Federal Court of Malaysia and the structure of the Malaysian judicial system . The Malaysian Courts of Judicature Act 1964 repealed the provisions relating to the Singapore Supreme Court in Singapore 's Courts Ordinance as well as the whole of the Singapore 's Court of Criminal Appeal Ordinance . The Supreme Court of the Colony of Singapore was replaced by the High Court of Malaysia in Singapore , while the Court of Appeal was assimilated into the Federal Court . The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council continued to be the final appellate court . - Although Singapore became independent on 9 August 1965 , the ties between the judicial systems of Singapore and Malaysia were not severed until 1969 . The Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 , re-established the Supreme Court of Singapore , comprising the High Court , the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal . Jury trials were abolished in 1969 , by an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code which provided for trials of capital offences to be heard by two judges . This arrangement continued until 18 April 1992 , when the Criminal Procedure Code was amended to allow for trials of capital offences to be heard before a single Judge . The next important milestone for Singapore 's judicial system was the introduction of Judicial Commissioners to the Supreme Court Bench , with the first Judicial Commissioner , Mr Chan Sek Keong , being appointed on 1 July 1986 . A Judicial Commissioner is appointed for specific periods of time and may exercise the powers and perform the functions of a Judge . In this capacity , he enjoys the same immunities as a Judge . On 28 September 1990 , Mr Wee Chong Jin retired as Chief Justice , and Mr Yong Pung How , took over as the head of the Judiciary . The first female to be appointed to the Supreme Court Bench was Ms Lai Siu Chiu , who was appointed a Judicial Commissioner on 2 May 1991 . Thereafter , Ms Judith Prakash was appointed a Judicial Commissioner on 1 April 1992 . They were appointed Judges of the High Court on 2 May 1994 and 1 April 1995 respectively . In 1993 , the existing appellate court , which comprised the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal , was reconstituted into a single Court of Appeal for both civil and criminal appeals . The present Court of Appeal normally comprises the Chief Justice and the Judges of Appeal , who rank above the High Court judges . A Judge of the High Court may also , on the request of the Chief Justice , sit as a Judge of the Court of Appeal . The first Judges of Appeal to be appointed were Justice M Karthigesu and Justice L P Thean , both of whom were appointed as Judges of Appeal on 1 July 1993 . The physical buildings which have represented Singapore 's legal system since the founding of Singapore in 1819 , form an important part of the country 's legal heritage . These include the former Parliament House , the Empress Place Building , the old Supreme Court Building and the City Hall . The former Parliament House , the oldest government building in Singapore , was the original courthouse used by the British from 1827 . It was designed by George Coleman and was meant as a residence for a merchant named John Argyle Maxwell . Work commenced in 1826 and the building was completed in 1827 . Maxwell then leased the building to the colonial government for 15 years at a rent of 500 rupees a month . The ownership of the courthouse was finally transferred to Governor S G Bonham and the East India Company on 10 October 1842 for 15,600 Spanish dollars . The first court session was held in the central room on the first floor at the front of the building facing High Street . In 1839 , a single storey annexe was erected on an adjacent site to serve as a new courthouse so that the whole of the old courthouse could be used to house government offices . As the new court premises lay next to a shipbuilding yard , the noise from the yard frequently drowned the addresses of the Judge or the evidence of the witnesses . In November 1854 , the Grand Jury condemned the annexe as being totally unsuitable for a Court of Justice due to the incessant clamour from the adjoining shipbuilding yard . However , nothing was done until July 1864 , when the foundation stone for a new courthouse at the Empress Place Building was laid . The new courthouse was completed in 1865 , and now forms the centre portion of the Empress Place Building . The Empress Place Building was , in fact , a conglomerate of buildings built at various different times . The centre wing is the oldest part of the building and was built from 1864 to 1865 . This wing was designed by Major FA McNair and functioned as a courthouse for Singapore until 1875 . Court proceedings were carried out at the Empress Place Building until 1875 when renovations to the former Parliament House were completed . The Courts moved back into the former Parliament House and remained there until 1939 , when they moved into the Supreme Court building . The old Supreme Court building was built between 1937 and 1939 on the site of the former Grand Hotel de L'Europe . The Chief Architect of the Public Works Department , Frank Dorrington Ward , came up with no fewer than eight variations on the design of the old Supreme Court building . This building was Ward 's last and greatest work , and was acknowledged by many as his most significant creation . The old Supreme Court building was declared open by Sir Thomas Shenton Whitelegge Thomas , Governor of the Straits Settlements , and handed over to the then Chief Justice , Sir Percy McElwaine , on 3 August 1939 . The foundation stone of the Supreme Court building was laid by Sir Shenton Thomas on 1 April 1937 , and was , at that time , the biggest foundation stone in the whole of Malaya . A \" time capsule \" containing six Singapore newspapers dated 31 March 1937 , as well as a handful of Straits Settlements coins , was buried beneath the foundation stone . The time capsule is slated to be retrieved in the year 3000 . The imposing Corinthian and Ionic columns , as well as the tympanum sculpture fronting the Supreme Court Building , were the work of Cavalieri Rudolfo Nolli , a Milanese sculptor . The central figure in the tympanum is that of Justice , with a figure immediately to its left representing the lost soul begging for protection from it . Next to this figure are two legislators with books in hand , representing the law . To the right of Justice , a figure bows in gratitude , followed by a man with a bull , representing riches and prosperity . Two young children holding a sheaf of wheat represent abundance from law and justice . Another point of interest for visitors is that the old Supreme Court building actually features two domes : the main copper- coloured dome which dominates Singapore 's skyline , and a smaller dome which is hardly visible at street level , but which originally used to house a beautifully designed library . The old Supreme Court Building was originally constructed to house just four courts . Due to an increasing workload , additional courtrooms were constructed in the adjacent City Hall in November 1986 . Designed by municipal architect F D Meadows , the City Hall building was built between 1926 and 1929 , and was originally known as the Municipal Building . It used to house the offices of the Municipal Council , later known as City Council , which was responsible for the provision of water , electricity , gas , roads and bridges and street lighting . Over time , other government bodies absorbed the functions of the City Council . Extensive renovations were carried out on the City Hall building between November 1987 and May 1991 to build 12 additional courtrooms . In addition , the City Hall building has also housed other government departments such as the Public Service Commission and the Industrial Arbitration Court . The City Hall was also the scene of many important events in the history of Singapore . On 12 September 1945 , when Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten accepted the surrender of the Japanese forces on behalf of the allied forces , the signing of the surrender papers took place in the City Hall Chamber . The first Prime Minister of independent Singapore , Mr Lee Kuan Yew ( now Minister Mentor ) and members of his Cabinet , took their Oaths of Allegiance and Oaths of Office on 5 June 1959 in the City Hall Chamber . Singapore 's second Prime Minister , Mr Goh Chok Tong ( now Senior Minister ) and members of his Cabinet also took their Oaths of Allegiance and Oaths of Office in the City Hall Chamber , on 28 November 1990 . Several National Day Parades have also been carried out in front of the building 's steps .","annotations":[{"text":"to the colonial government","span":[10092,10117],"token_span":[1853,1856],"role":"Lessee","label":"Lessee","role_definition":"The Lessee has Money and wants the Goods."},{"text":"The former Parliament House","span":[9753,9779],"token_span":[1793,1796],"role":"Goods","label":"Goods","role_definition":"The role Goods is the item which is temporarily exchanged for Money."},{"text":"John Argyle Maxwell","span":[9973,9991],"token_span":[1832,1834],"role":"Lessor","label":"Lessor","role_definition":"The Lessor has possession of the Goods and temporarily exchanges them for Money from a Lessee."},{"text":"1827","span":[10052,10055],"token_span":[1846,1846],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the renting takes place."},{"text":"Singapore","span":[9817,9825],"token_span":[1803,1803],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the leasing takes place."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-4376-591-frame-Replacing","frame":"Replacing","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Agent changes the filler of a Role by placing a New filler in the position after the Old filler ceases to occupy the position.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Hardware CPU : 533 - MHz Eden-N FSB : 133 - MHZ Video card : 200 - MHz S3 Graphics UniChrome Pro IGP RAM : 128MB DDR266 SDRAM Hard drive : 1.8 \" 20 GB capable of 133MB /s VIA Vinyl Audio , supporting six channels .

He once wrote that \u201c a man 's unavoidable contradictions are his purgatory . \u201d He embodied several intriguing dualities : An ethnic Pole born and raised in Lithuania , Mi\u0142osz was a Polish Catholic who attended mass but decried Poland 's fervent and often nationalistic Catholicism , a Gnostic who greedily seized on life 's pleasures instead of renouncing them , a sensual Manichean , a doubter who once said \u201c all my intellectual impulses are religious , \u201d an exile not leftist enough for postwar Paris but too leftist for Cold War America . An odd coincidence , barely noted in the Polish press , linked Mi\u0142osz in death with a man whose path had crossed his before World War II \u2014 a man with glaring contradictions of his own , though he officially bypassed purgatory for paradise . The day that Mi\u0142osz died , August 14 , is a holiday honoring the popular but controversial Polish saint Maximilian Kolbe . The Franciscan priest , widely accused of anti-Semitism , nevertheless died in Auschwitz . Before his arrest , his monastery had sheltered several thousand Jews . The little - known connection between the two men helps illuminate one small but fascinating aspect of the life and work \u2014 the complexities and contradictions \u2014 of Mi\u0142osz , whom the exiled Russian poet Joseph Brodsky , a Nobel laureate himself , called \u201c one of the greatest poets of our time , perhaps the greatest . \u201d Born in 1911 in Lithuania , then part of the Russian empire , Mi\u0142osz was a member of the Polish -speaking gentry , the son of a civil engineer . As a young man he cofounded a literary group , \u017bagary , nicknamed \u201c The Catastrophists \u201d for their bleak view of the future and prescient sense of approaching disaster . He took a law degree in 1934 , and in 1936 , at the age of 25 , went to work for Polish National Radio 's regional station in Vilnius as a literary programmer , his first real job . Mi\u0142osz 's leftist views soon got him into trouble . In his autobiography , Native Realm : A Search for Self -Definition , published in Polish in 1959 , he describes the \u201c whisper campaign \u201d mounted against him by right - wingers , culminating in an editorial denouncing him in the enormously popular Polish newspaper Ma\u0142y Dziennik ( The Little Daily ) . \u201c [ It ] declared to the whole country that a Communist cell was operating within the Wilno [ Vilnius ] radio station , and that this cell was responsible for a Jew being entrusted with the religious programs . . . . \u201d The Little Daily and another newspaper , Rycerz Niepokalane ( The Knight of the Immaculata ) , were the publications of a religious community founded by the influential Polish priest Maximilian Kolbe . Kolbe 's brand of nationalistic religion represented everything Mi\u0142osz loathed about the politically powerful state church , which conflated Catholicism and Polish patriotism , leavening both with xenophobia and anti-Semitism . Kolbe 's defenders note that he had little control over the general editorial policy of his newspapers . He was traveling back and forth from his monastery outside Warsaw to Nagasaki , Japan , where he had established a mission , and he was in ill health besides . But there was no denying his newspapers ' anti-Semitism . He had , though , urged his editor in a memo to exhibit greater charity towards Jews : \u201c Speaking of the Jews , I would devote great attention not to stir up accidentally nor to intensify to a greater degree the hatred of our readers against them . \u201d Still , one of the references to Jews he made in the 1930s included mention of a \u201c Jewish - Masonic conspiracy \u201d and a \u201c cruel clique of Jews . \u201d Mi\u0142osz was sacked in 1937 , but hardly desolate . He recalls having had mixed feelings about his job anyway , describing it as provincial , bureaucratic , and suffocating : \u201c I swore vengeance against the nationalists , but I was basking in the sudden change of my routine , \u201d he writes in Native Realm . \u201c Once more I was master of my own time , I could lounge in bed until late , read , write , and I had the unknown before me \u2014 they had done me a good turn . \u201d He headed south for a Venetian spring , then went to work for Polish National Radio in Warsaw . In 1944 he would marry a woman he met there , Janina D\u0142uska , another happy consequence of getting fired in Vilnius . The Warsaw radio job ended with the 1939 Nazi occupation . During the early months of the war , Mi\u0142osz crossed the borders several times between Soviet-occupied Lithuania and Nazi-occupied Poland before deciding to cast his lot with Poland , predicting , correctly , that the Nazi regime was likely to end before the Soviet occupation did . He spent the rest of the war as a janitor in the Warsaw University library , reading copiously and publishing poems in the underground press \u2014 a courageous act , considering the penalties if he had been caught . But Mi\u0142osz hardly considered himself a hero . Brodsky wrote of Mi\u0142osz 's wartime experiences , \u201c Out of these ashes emerged poetry which did not so much sing of outrage and grief as whisper of the guilt of the survivor . \u201d Guilt haunts his 1943 poem \u201c Campo dei Fiori , \u201d which describes a carnival ride outside the burning Jewish Ghetto , destroyed after its inhabitants mounted an armed rebellion . In it , the poet is a bystander , a helpless , frightened , accidental witness to terrible events . The bright melody drowned Later , in Conversations with Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz , the poet called it an \u201c immoral \u201d and dishonest poem , \u201c because it was written from the point of view of an observer about people who were dying . \u201d It was too easy , he seemed to be saying : the poet observes an atrocity , writes a poem in protest , and is pleased at having written a beautiful poem ; conscience slackens . Nonetheless , such witnessing was necessary in a time when so many were silent or voiceless ; during the years of the Warsaw Ghetto , from 1941 to 1943 , about 400,000 Jews perished from disease , random executions , and deportation to death camps . \u201c To write of the tragedy of the Warsaw ghetto , to which I was an eyewitness , is hard for me , \u201d Mi\u0142osz writes in The Captive Mind , his landmark critique of totalitarianism , published in 1953 . \u201c The vision of the burning ghetto is too welded into all I lived through in my adult years for me to speak of it quietly . \u201d the salvos from the ghetto wall , and couples were flying high in the cloudless sky . At times wind from the burning would drift dark kites along and riders on the carousel caught petals in midair . That same hot wind blew open the skirts of girls and the crowds were laughing on that beautiful Warsaw Sunday . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Those dying here , the lonely forgotten by the world , our tongue becomes for them the language of an ancient planet . The carousel in \u201c Campo dei Fiori \u201d has become famous as a metaphor for human indifference . But an image from another poem of the same period , \u201c A Poor Christian Looks at the Ghetto , \u201d may capture a deeper psychological truth . Fear of judgment and damnation permeates the poem , which moves underground to the image of a \u201c guardian mole \u201d who \u201c distinguishes human ashes by their luminous vapor . \u201d I am afraid , so afraid of the guardian mole . Again , the poet is looking rather than acting . \u201c To live with one 's cowardice is bitter , \u201d Mi\u0142osz writes in Native Realm . \u201c There would be no point today in trying to convince myself or others that I had any sort of talent for heroism . I admit it openly : I turned cold with fear even at home if I happened to meet our apartment manager 's eyes with their veiled threat , know that he suspected one of our guests was a Jew . \u201d He has swollen eyelids , like a Patriarch Who has sat much in the light of candles reading the great book of the species . What will I tell him , I , a Jew of the New Testament , Waiting two thousand years for the second coming of Jesus ? My broken body will deliver me to his sight And he will count me among the helpers of death : The uncircumcised . A year after the destruction of the city 's Jewry , the Poles made a valiant but doomed attempt to free the city in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 . In retaliation , the Germans bombed or burned the ancient capital , block by block , and murdered its citizenry while the Soviet army , watching on the other side of the Vistula , waited for the spoils . Mi\u0142osz was caught on the outskirts of the city , where the streets were under artillery fire . Hitler 's soldiers detained him in an ad hoc transit camp when he tried to return to his demolished home . He was rescued that night by a \u201c majestic , \u201d \u201c authoritative \u201d nun who insisted to the German authorities that she was his aunt . He never learned her name . Over 63 days , 18,000 Polish soldiers and as many as 200,000 civilians died . By the end of World War II , 85 percent of the elegant baroque city was destroyed . Much of Mi\u0142osz 's poetry was written \u2014 during the war , and after \u2014 expressly for \u201c you whom I could not save , \u201d the war victims he addresses in the 1945 poem \u201c Dedication \u201d : You whom I could not save In Polish , the \u201c You \u201d \u2014 the very first word of the poem \u2014 is singular , not plural , a distinction lost in English . The singular \u201c you \u201d means that Mi\u0142osz is addressing a particular person , not speaking rhetorically to a crowd . He is speaking to someone frustratingly beyond the reach of his words , about whom he feels guilt for not saving : \u201c I swear , there is in me no wizardry of words . / I speak to you with silence like a cloud or a tree \u201d \u2014 a lie , of course , because this poem is written in words . They , in fact , are his millet seeds to propitiate the dead : Listen to me . Try to understand this simple speech as I would be ashamed of another . I swear , there is in me no wizardry of words . I speak to you with silence like a cloud or a tree . What strengthened me , for you was lethal . You mixed up farewell to an epoch with the beginning of a new one , Inspiration of hatred with lyrical beauty , Blind force with accomplished shape . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . What is poetry which does not save Nations or people ? A connivance with official lies , A song of drunkards whose throats will be cut in a moment , Readings for sophomore girls . That I wanted good poetry without knowing it , That I discovered , late , its salutary aim , In this and only this I find salvation . They used to pour millet on graves or poppy seeds Where was the saint- to - be during the war ? Whatever his newspapers might have said , when the Germans occupied Poland in 1939 , Maximilian Kolbe sheltered as many as 2,000 Jews in his monastery outside Warsaw . Kolbe would probably have agreed with the poet 's conclusions about man 's unavoidable contradictions . In the final issue of The Knight of the Immaculata , in December 1940 \u2014 the Nazis had allowed him to keep publishing in hopes that he would incriminate himself \u2014 Kolbe wrote : \u201c The real conflict is inner conflict . Beyond armies of occupation and the catacombs of concentration camps , there are two irreconcilable enemies in the depth of every soul : good and evil , sin and love . And what use are victories on the battlefield if we ourselves are defeated in our innermost personal selves ? \u201d To feed the dead who would come disguised as birds . I put this book here for you , who once lived So that you should visit us no more . Arrested by the Gestapo the following February on charges of subversive activities , Kolbe was sent to Auschwitz . When a prisoner from his barracks vanished , the camp commander ordered that ten men would be starved to death as a warning against future escape attempts . ( The missing man was later found drowned in the latrine . ) Kolbe volunteered to take the place of one of the men , a sergeant in the Polish army . \u201c I am old . . . . \u201d said Kolbe , who was 47 . \u201c He has a wife and children . \u201d In an airless underground bunker , he led the dying men in songs and prayer . After two weeks , only Kolbe and three others were left alive . Kolbe offered his arm to the executioner , and was killed with a shot of carbolic acid on August 14 , 1941 . The man whom he replaced lived to tell of Kolbe 's sacrifice . ( So did a number of other prisoners who remembered his offer , and one of the guards from his last days . ) Mi\u0142osz emerged from the war and the Soviet occupation of Poland tormented with spiritual doubt . \u201c I should confess that I do not understand the notion of Providence and am very much on the side of Simone Weil who preferred to leave as much as possible to necessity ruling the world , \u201d he wrote to his friend Thomas Merton , the American Trappist monk , in May 1959 . Mi\u0142osz was haunted , and would remain so . In The Captive Mind , he writes that whenever he is \u201c drunk with the beauty of being alive amidst living human beings , \u201d one image obstinately returns to him : I see before my eyes always the same young Jewish girl . She was probably about twenty years old . Her body was full , splendid , exultant . She was running down the street , her hands raised , her chest thrust forward . She cried piercingly , \u201c No ! No ! No ! \u201d The necessity to die was beyond her comprehension \u2014 a necessity that came from outside , having nothing in common with her unprepared body . The bullets of the SS guards ' automatic pistols reached her in her cry . After the war , Mi\u0142osz served in the communist regime as a cultural attach\u00e9 in New York , Washington , D.C. , and Paris . He never joined the party , however , so the authorities always viewed him with suspicion . When his passport was confiscated during a visit to Warsaw , he knew his days were numbered . After maneuvering its return , he resumed his Paris position and defected within weeks . Mi\u0142osz was befriended by neither the right nor the left . The United States mistrusted him for his erstwhile communist affiliations , even after he wrote Captive Mind . European leftists felt he had betrayed the promise of a glorious future . Pablo Neruda upbraided him in an essay called \u201c The Man Who Ran Away . \u201d The years of Parisian isolation ended in 1960 , when he joined the faculty of the University of California , Berkeley . A different kind of alienation ensued : His poetry was unknown and untranslated in the West , and banned in his homeland . He was famous , if at all , as a political commentator , the author of Captive Mind \u2014 and a campus curmudgeon , the relic of a bygone era . \u201c Once a crowd of students was barricading a path , \u201d he recounted to Polish journalist Adam Michnik , \u201c and I went up to them and said in my best Slav accent , ' Be gone , you spoiled children of the bourgeoisie . ' They were completely taken aback . \u201d Did Mi\u0142osz ever think of Kolbe ? An incident related by the California poet Morton Marcus , in his memoir Striking Through the Masks , suggests that he did . He writes that at a 1970 reception that Mi\u0142osz hosted for the visiting Serbian poet Vasko Popa , the poet encountered several Berkeley students , wearing white armbands , en route to a protest against the U.S. invasion of Cambodia . After some belligerent inquiries from a slightly drunken Mi\u0142osz , the students made the mistake of saying that they were protesting for peace and love . \u201c Love , love , love ! \u201d mocked Mi\u0142osz , his voice rising to a shout . \u201c Talk to me about love when they come into your cell one morning , line you all up , and say ' You and you , step forward . It 's your time to die \u2014 unless any of your friends loves you so much he wants to take your place ! ' \u201d Not long after this outburst , Mi\u0142osz received a telephone call from a Polish priest in Paris , Zenon Modzelewski , who was preparing a tribute for Kolbe 's 1971 beatification . The priest wanted permission to excerpt some psalms Mi\u0142osz had translated . \u201c No , I wo n't allow it , \u201d Mi\u0142osz roared . \u201c It was Kolbe 's fault that I lost the job with the radio . \u201d Why was he so touchy , almost 35 years after his firing ? Mi\u0142osz relented and granted permission . He turned his angry reaction into a joke , according to a 2004 article written by Father Adam Boniecki , the well - known editor of the Polish journal Tygodnik Powszechny . In the article , Mi\u0142osz again decried Catholic nationalism of the kind Kolbe represented . \u201c A collective body , a human society , cannot be the Saviour , \u201d he had written in an earlier letter to Merton . \u201c A dream about collective purity achieved thanks to collective suffering is just a dream and in practice it leads to bestiality . \u201d Winning the 1980 Nobel Prize in Literature thrust Mi\u0142osz , an obscure poet writing in \u201c an unheard - of tongue , \u201d into the international spotlight . Two years later , Kolbe was canonized as a \u201c martyr of charity \u201d by Mi\u0142osz 's friend and fellow Pole , John Paul II . In Year of the Hunter , his published diary from 1987 to 1988 , Mi\u0142osz declared himself for \u201c the Catholicism of leftist philosopher Jacques Maritain as opposed to the hideous Catholicism of The Knight of the Immaculate Virgin , The Little Daily , and the other publications devoted to vilifying Jews and Freemasons . I was kicked out of Polish Radio in Wilno because of a denunciation in The Little Daily . \u201d Apparently the firing still rankled \u2014 but Mi\u0142osz finally strove to be fair . \u201c Not long ago , someone in America asked me about Father Kolbe 's responsibility . I answered honestly , I hope , and without concealing his views , but also without making him responsible for everything that appeared in his paper . \u201d Despite his \u201c hideous Catholicism , \u201d Kolbe was able to cross a line that Mi\u0142osz could not . Kolbe became more than a bystander , a witness to atrocities . Had Mi\u0142osz played the hero , of course , he would have been among the millions annihilated , his early work a little - read chapter in the obscure annals of Polish poetry . Had he played the hero , we would n't have the astonishing miracle of poems , essays , novels , journals , and translations that poured out from this spiritually troubled man . His anguish and ambivalence allowed him to speak for generations that have been paralyzed and helpless before a century of holocausts \u2014 from the killing fields of Cambodia to the slaughter in Darfur . A century in which reason and experience argue with faith has been brought into focus by the conscience of a man who humbly experienced himself as a moral and spiritual washout \u2014 even as the West hailed him as a moral giant . To focus on Mi\u0142osz 's guilt and anguish is to overlook another recurring theme in his work \u2014 his quest for a searing , altruistic love , of the sort that Kolbe came to embody when he was named a \u201c martyr of charity . \u201d His spiritual hunger for \u201c the love that moves the sun and other stars \u201d ( Dant\u00e9 , Canto XXXIII , Paradiso ) is evident in his deliberate choice of \u201c You \u201d as the first word in the poem \u201c Dedication , \u201d and in the final words of his autobiography , Native Realm : \u201c when ambition counsels us to lift ourselves above simple moral rules guarded by the poor in spirit , rather than to choose them as our compass needle amid the uncertainties of change , we stifle the only thing that can redeem our follies and mistakes : love . \u201d Perhaps his ire toward Kolbe was simply a wish to be a hero of the inner battles of which they both wrote . From Mi\u0142osz 's 1985 poem \u201c A Confession \u201d : So what kind of prophet am I ? Why should the spirit By 1997 , a quarter - century after the Modzelewski incident , Mi\u0142osz seems to have mellowed in his view of Kolbe . \u201c I am old now , \u201d Mi\u0142osz wrote in a Polish article , \u201c and should soften up . I must remember that humans are only human , and what they have inside their heads does not necessarily translate into actions . St. Maximilian Kolbe and his publishing house represent the resurrection of the Saxon-era superstitions in a contemporary packaging , yet he became a saint . \u201d Have visited such a man ? Many others Were justly called , and trustworthy . Who would have trusted me ? For they saw How I empty glasses , throw myself on food , And glance greedily at the waitress 's neck . Flawed and aware of it . Desiring greatness , Able to recognize greatness wherever it is , And yet not quite , only in part , clairvoyant , I knew what was left for smaller men like me : A feast of brief hopes , a rally of the proud , A tournament of hunchbacks , literature . By the time of his death , on the day consecrated to St. Maximilian Kolbe , Mi\u0142osz seems to have made a kind of peace with \u201c unavoidable contradictions . \u201d He became reconciled to serving humanity through offering poetry of witness rather than through martyrdom . In a short prose piece , \u201c Awakened , \u201d from one of his final collections , he writes , In advanced age , my health worsening , I woke up in the middle of the night , and experienced a feeling of happiness so intense and perfect that in all my life I had only felt its premonition . . . . As if a voice were repeating : \u201c You can stop worrying now ; everything happened just as it had to . You did what was assigned to you , and you are not required anymore to think of what happened long ago . \u201d . . . The happiness on this side was like an announcement of the other side . I realized that this was an undeserved gift and I could not grasp by what grace it was bestowed on me .

In 1944 he would marry a woman he met there , Janina D\u0142uska , another happy consequence of getting fired in Vilnius . The Warsaw radio job ended with the 1939 Nazi occupation . During the early months of the war , Mi\u0142osz crossed the borders several times between Soviet-occupied Lithuania and Nazi-occupied Poland before deciding to cast his lot with Poland , predicting , correctly , that the Nazi regime was likely to end before the Soviet occupation did . He spent the rest of the war as a janitor in the Warsaw University library , reading copiously and publishing poems in the underground press \u2014 a courageous act , considering the penalties if he had been caught . But Mi\u0142osz hardly considered himself a hero . Brodsky wrote of Mi\u0142osz 's wartime experiences , \u201c Out of these ashes emerged poetry which did not so much sing of outrage and grief as whisper of the guilt of the survivor . \u201d Guilt haunts his 1943 poem \u201c Campo dei Fiori , \u201d which describes a carnival ride outside the burning Jewish Ghetto , destroyed after its inhabitants mounted an armed rebellion . In it , the poet is a bystander , a helpless , frightened , accidental witness to terrible events . The bright melody drowned Later , in Conversations with Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz , the poet called it an \u201c immoral \u201d and dishonest poem , \u201c because it was written from the point of view of an observer about people who were dying . \u201d It was too easy , he seemed to be saying : the poet observes an atrocity , writes a poem in protest , and is pleased at having written a beautiful poem ; conscience slackens . Nonetheless , such witnessing was necessary in a time when so many were silent or voiceless ; during the years of the Warsaw Ghetto , from 1941 to 1943 , about 400,000 Jews perished from disease , random executions , and deportation to death camps . \u201c To write of the tragedy of the Warsaw ghetto , to which I was an eyewitness , is hard for me , \u201d Mi\u0142osz writes in The Captive Mind , his landmark critique of totalitarianism , published in 1953 . \u201c The vision of the burning ghetto is too welded into all I lived through in my adult years for me to speak of it quietly . \u201d the salvos from the ghetto wall , and couples were flying high in the cloudless sky . At times wind from the burning would drift dark kites along and riders on the carousel caught petals in midair . That same hot wind blew open the skirts of girls and the crowds were laughing on that beautiful Warsaw Sunday . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Those dying here , the lonely forgotten by the world , our tongue becomes for them the language of an ancient planet . The carousel in \u201c Campo dei Fiori \u201d has become famous as a metaphor for human indifference . But an image from another poem of the same period , \u201c A Poor Christian Looks at the Ghetto , \u201d may capture a deeper psychological truth . Fear of judgment and damnation permeates the poem , which moves underground to the image of a \u201c guardian mole \u201d who \u201c distinguishes human ashes by their luminous vapor . \u201d I am afraid , so afraid of the guardian mole . Again , the poet is looking rather than acting . \u201c To live with one 's cowardice is bitter , \u201d Mi\u0142osz writes in Native Realm . \u201c There would be no point today in trying to convince myself or others that I had any sort of talent for heroism . I admit it openly : I turned cold with fear even at home if I happened to meet our apartment manager 's eyes with their veiled threat , know that he suspected one of our guests was a Jew . \u201d He has swollen eyelids , like a Patriarch Who has sat much in the light of candles reading the great book of the species . What will I tell him , I , a Jew of the New Testament , Waiting two thousand years for the second coming of Jesus ? My broken body will deliver me to his sight And he will count me among the helpers of death : The uncircumcised . A year after the destruction of the city 's Jewry , the Poles made a valiant but doomed attempt to free the city in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 . In retaliation , the Germans bombed or burned the ancient capital , block by block , and murdered its citizenry while the Soviet army , watching on the other side of the Vistula , waited for the spoils . Mi\u0142osz was caught on the outskirts of the city , where the streets were under artillery fire . Hitler 's soldiers detained him in an ad hoc transit camp when he tried to return to his demolished home . He was rescued that night by a \u201c majestic , \u201d \u201c authoritative \u201d nun who insisted to the German authorities that she was his aunt . He never learned her name . Over 63 days , 18,000 Polish soldiers and as many as 200,000 civilians died . By the end of World War II , 85 percent of the elegant baroque city was destroyed . Much of Mi\u0142osz 's poetry was written \u2014 during the war , and after \u2014 expressly for \u201c you whom I could not save , \u201d the war victims he addresses in the 1945 poem \u201c Dedication \u201d : You whom I could not save In Polish , the \u201c You \u201d \u2014 the very first word of the poem \u2014 is singular , not plural , a distinction lost in English . The singular \u201c you \u201d means that Mi\u0142osz is addressing a particular person , not speaking rhetorically to a crowd . He is speaking to someone frustratingly beyond the reach of his words , about whom he feels guilt for not saving : \u201c I swear , there is in me no wizardry of words . / I speak to you with silence like a cloud or a tree \u201d \u2014 a lie , of course , because this poem is written in words . They , in fact , are his millet seeds to propitiate the dead : Listen to me . Try to understand this simple speech as I would be ashamed of another . I swear , there is in me no wizardry of words . I speak to you with silence like a cloud or a tree . What strengthened me , for you was lethal . You mixed up farewell to an epoch with the beginning of a new one , Inspiration of hatred with lyrical beauty , Blind force with accomplished shape . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . What is poetry which does not save Nations or people ? A connivance with official lies , A song of drunkards whose throats will be cut in a moment , Readings for sophomore girls . That I wanted good poetry without knowing it , That I discovered , late , its salutary aim , In this and only this I find salvation . They used to pour millet on graves or poppy seeds Where was the saint- to - be during the war ? Whatever his newspapers might have said , when the Germans occupied Poland in 1939 , Maximilian Kolbe sheltered as many as 2,000 Jews in his monastery outside Warsaw . Kolbe would probably have agreed with the poet 's conclusions about man 's unavoidable contradictions . In the final issue of The Knight of the Immaculata , in December 1940 \u2014 the Nazis had allowed him to keep publishing in hopes that he would incriminate himself \u2014 Kolbe wrote : \u201c The real conflict is inner conflict . Beyond armies of occupation and the catacombs of concentration camps , there are two irreconcilable enemies in the depth of every soul : good and evil , sin and love . And what use are victories on the battlefield if we ourselves are defeated in our innermost personal selves ? \u201d To feed the dead who would come disguised as birds . I put this book here for you , who once lived So that you should visit us no more . Arrested by the Gestapo the following February on charges of subversive activities , Kolbe was sent to Auschwitz . When a prisoner from his barracks vanished , the camp commander ordered that ten men would be starved to death as a warning against future escape attempts . ( The missing man was later found drowned in the latrine . ) Kolbe volunteered to take the place of one of the men , a sergeant in the Polish army . \u201c I am old . . . . \u201d said Kolbe , who was 47 . \u201c He has a wife and children . \u201d In an airless underground bunker , he led the dying men in songs and prayer . After two weeks , only Kolbe and three others were left alive . Kolbe offered his arm to the executioner , and was killed with a shot of carbolic acid on August 14 , 1941 . The man whom he replaced lived to tell of Kolbe 's sacrifice . ( So did a number of other prisoners who remembered his offer , and one of the guards from his last days . ) Mi\u0142osz emerged from the war and the Soviet occupation of Poland tormented with spiritual doubt . \u201c I should confess that I do not understand the notion of Providence and am very much on the side of Simone Weil who preferred to leave as much as possible to necessity ruling the world , \u201d he wrote to his friend Thomas Merton , the American Trappist monk , in May 1959 . Mi\u0142osz was haunted , and would remain so . In The Captive Mind , he writes that whenever he is \u201c drunk with the beauty of being alive amidst living human beings , \u201d one image obstinately returns to him : I see before my eyes always the same young Jewish girl . She was probably about twenty years old . Her body was full , splendid , exultant . She was running down the street , her hands raised , her chest thrust forward . She cried piercingly , \u201c No ! No ! No ! \u201d The necessity to die was beyond her comprehension \u2014 a necessity that came from outside , having nothing in common with her unprepared body . The bullets of the SS guards ' automatic pistols reached her in her cry . After the war , Mi\u0142osz served in the communist regime as a cultural attach\u00e9 in New York , Washington , D.C. , and Paris . He never joined the party , however , so the authorities always viewed him with suspicion . When his passport was confiscated during a visit to Warsaw , he knew his days were numbered . After maneuvering its return , he resumed his Paris position and defected within weeks . Mi\u0142osz was befriended by neither the right nor the left . The United States mistrusted him for his erstwhile communist affiliations , even after he wrote Captive Mind . European leftists felt he had betrayed the promise of a glorious future . Pablo Neruda upbraided him in an essay called \u201c The Man Who Ran Away . \u201d The years of Parisian isolation ended in 1960 , when he joined the faculty of the University of California , Berkeley . A different kind of alienation ensued : His poetry was unknown and untranslated in the West , and banned in his homeland . He was famous , if at all , as a political commentator , the author of Captive Mind \u2014 and a campus curmudgeon , the relic of a bygone era . \u201c Once a crowd of students was barricading a path , \u201d he recounted to Polish journalist Adam Michnik , \u201c and I went up to them and said in my best Slav accent , ' Be gone , you spoiled children of the bourgeoisie . ' They were completely taken aback . \u201d Did Mi\u0142osz ever think of Kolbe ? An incident related by the California poet Morton Marcus , in his memoir Striking Through the Masks , suggests that he did . He writes that at a 1970 reception that Mi\u0142osz hosted for the visiting Serbian poet Vasko Popa , the poet encountered several Berkeley students , wearing white armbands , en route to a protest against the U.S. invasion of Cambodia . After some belligerent inquiries from a slightly drunken Mi\u0142osz , the students made the mistake of saying that they were protesting for peace and love . \u201c Love , love , love ! \u201d mocked Mi\u0142osz , his voice rising to a shout . \u201c Talk to me about love when they come into your cell one morning , line you all up , and say ' You and you , step forward . It 's your time to die \u2014 unless any of your friends loves you so much he wants to take your place ! ' \u201d Not long after this outburst , Mi\u0142osz received a telephone call from a Polish priest in Paris , Zenon Modzelewski , who was preparing a tribute for Kolbe 's 1971 beatification . The priest wanted permission to excerpt some psalms Mi\u0142osz had translated . \u201c No , I wo n't allow it , \u201d Mi\u0142osz roared . \u201c It was Kolbe 's fault that I lost the job with the radio . \u201d Why was he so touchy , almost 35 years after his firing ? Mi\u0142osz relented and granted permission . He turned his angry reaction into a joke , according to a 2004 article written by Father Adam Boniecki , the well - known editor of the Polish journal Tygodnik Powszechny . In the article , Mi\u0142osz again decried Catholic nationalism of the kind Kolbe represented . \u201c A collective body , a human society , cannot be the Saviour , \u201d he had written in an earlier letter to Merton . \u201c A dream about collective purity achieved thanks to collective suffering is just a dream and in practice it leads to bestiality . \u201d Winning the 1980 Nobel Prize in Literature thrust Mi\u0142osz , an obscure poet writing in \u201c an unheard - of tongue , \u201d into the international spotlight . Two years later , Kolbe was canonized as a \u201c martyr of charity \u201d by Mi\u0142osz 's friend and fellow Pole , John Paul II . In Year of the Hunter , his published diary from 1987 to 1988 , Mi\u0142osz declared himself for \u201c the Catholicism of leftist philosopher Jacques Maritain as opposed to the hideous Catholicism of The Knight of the Immaculate Virgin , The Little Daily , and the other publications devoted to vilifying Jews and Freemasons . I was kicked out of Polish Radio in Wilno because of a denunciation in The Little Daily . \u201d Apparently the firing still rankled \u2014 but Mi\u0142osz finally strove to be fair . \u201c Not long ago , someone in America asked me about Father Kolbe 's responsibility . I answered honestly , I hope , and without concealing his views , but also without making him responsible for everything that appeared in his paper . \u201d Despite his \u201c hideous Catholicism , \u201d Kolbe was able to cross a line that Mi\u0142osz could not . Kolbe became more than a bystander , a witness to atrocities . Had Mi\u0142osz played the hero , of course , he would have been among the millions annihilated , his early work a little - read chapter in the obscure annals of Polish poetry . Had he played the hero , we would n't have the astonishing miracle of poems , essays , novels , journals , and translations that poured out from this spiritually troubled man . His anguish and ambivalence allowed him to speak for generations that have been paralyzed and helpless before a century of holocausts \u2014 from the killing fields of Cambodia to the slaughter in Darfur . A century in which reason and experience argue with faith has been brought into focus by the conscience of a man who humbly experienced himself as a moral and spiritual washout \u2014 even as the West hailed him as a moral giant . To focus on Mi\u0142osz 's guilt and anguish is to overlook another recurring theme in his work \u2014 his quest for a searing , altruistic love , of the sort that Kolbe came to embody when he was named a \u201c martyr of charity . \u201d His spiritual hunger for \u201c the love that moves the sun and other stars \u201d ( Dant\u00e9 , Canto XXXIII , Paradiso ) is evident in his deliberate choice of \u201c You \u201d as the first word in the poem \u201c Dedication , \u201d and in the final words of his autobiography , Native Realm : \u201c when ambition counsels us to lift ourselves above simple moral rules guarded by the poor in spirit , rather than to choose them as our compass needle amid the uncertainties of change , we stifle the only thing that can redeem our follies and mistakes : love . \u201d Perhaps his ire toward Kolbe was simply a wish to be a hero of the inner battles of which they both wrote . From Mi\u0142osz 's 1985 poem \u201c A Confession \u201d : So what kind of prophet am I ? Why should the spirit By 1997 , a quarter - century after the Modzelewski incident , Mi\u0142osz seems to have mellowed in his view of Kolbe . \u201c I am old now , \u201d Mi\u0142osz wrote in a Polish article , \u201c and should soften up . I must remember that humans are only human , and what they have inside their heads does not necessarily translate into actions . St. Maximilian Kolbe and his publishing house represent the resurrection of the Saxon-era superstitions in a contemporary packaging , yet he became a saint . \u201d Have visited such a man ? Many others Were justly called , and trustworthy . Who would have trusted me ? For they saw How I empty glasses , throw myself on food , And glance greedily at the waitress 's neck . Flawed and aware of it . Desiring greatness , Able to recognize greatness wherever it is , And yet not quite , only in part , clairvoyant , I knew what was left for smaller men like me : A feast of brief hopes , a rally of the proud , A tournament of hunchbacks , literature . By the time of his death , on the day consecrated to St. Maximilian Kolbe , Mi\u0142osz seems to have made a kind of peace with \u201c unavoidable contradictions . \u201d He became reconciled to serving humanity through offering poetry of witness rather than through martyrdom . In a short prose piece , \u201c Awakened , \u201d from one of his final collections , he writes , In advanced age , my health worsening , I woke up in the middle of the night , and experienced a feeling of happiness so intense and perfect that in all my life I had only felt its premonition . . . . As if a voice were repeating : \u201c You can stop worrying now ; everything happened just as it had to . You did what was assigned to you , and you are not required anymore to think of what happened long ago . \u201d . . . The happiness on this side was like an announcement of the other side . I realized that this was an undeserved gift and I could not grasp by what grace it was bestowed on me .

With J.J. Abrams ' series , the method to the madness usually starts to emerge more clearly in the second season , which is certainly the case with Fringe , airing Thursdays on FOX at 9/8c. Olivia ( Anna Torv ) returns from the parallel universe , and must battle shapeshifters bent on destroying one universe . William Bell ( Leonard Nimoy ) , the mysterious chairman of Massive Dynamic , returns as a key to understanding the meaning of the two universes . \" Obviously we had a few challenges with moving the production from New York to Vancouver , as well as a new writing staff , for the most part , \" offers Jay Worth , the overall visual effects supervisor . \" Jeff Pinker stayed on as the show runner and J.J. and Bob [ Orci ] and Alex [ Kurtzman ] and [ producer ] Bryan Burke are the over arching figure heads . But we have a whole new slew of writers and a new production team in Vancouver . When you do that , you get some continuity . But , to be honest , it was all new people once again . So in some ways , it was starting over from that standpoint . However , because I was able to keep the continuity going with our vendors [ including Zoic and Eden FX ] , I do think that that has helped the show not feel as a big of a bump from one season to the next , particularly with different crews and a different vibe a little bit . \" We 've always strived to be Cronenberg - esque in our delivery of things and have these amazingly insane things going on but also have these simple things in terms of camera and environments and be naturalistic . And that 's where the visual effects come to play . One of the privileges is that because we 're so involved with the producers and the writing of everything that we get to infuse that temperament and creative through line . So we 're all on the same page in terms of tone and story . Sometimes they even write treatments where they 'll describe someone dying in ' The Fringy way , ' and we all know what that means : ' How do you want to kill someone ? ' But because they come to us , we get to come up with ideas and creatures , even before a story point goes to the studio , which makes the creative process infinitely more fun and fulfilling . \" Andrew Orloff , Zoic 's visual effects supervisor , echoes that it has to look real -- like you really photographed it . \" What it means is that we just do n't have any shots that seemed staged for the camera or any hint of being a visual effect . One of the big effects , like the parasite that crawls out of the guy 's mouth , are interacting with actor 's performances and they 're shot with a very loose camera style and we have to have the tentacles of this creature coming out of the guy 's mouth and all the deformations that are in his stomach and in his throat and in his chest . \" And we had to create a proprietary workflow here of what we 're calling performance transfer of tracking 2D points , and putting those 2D tracked points onto the formation of 3D inter-geometry . So we 're transferring not just the camera motion but also the performance of the actors on set onto 3D pieces of geometry so we can deform them and warp them and have our effects interact with them because the mandate is all about making it look as natural as possible , so that means a lot of optical tricks and atmosphere put in as seamlessly as possible . \" Worth adds that one of the benefits this season \" is having Todd Masters of Todd Masters FX being on the practical side , which has really opened us up to doing more hands - on creature and body work , where you just know that the corpse and creatures work seamlessly with what we 're doing . That 's what I like most about episode nine with the parasite that came out of the body . We had such a good parasite to work with that we were able to design and execute a [ better result ] . \" So , aside from new twists on the trademark creepy deaths , what are some of the new wrinkles this season ? How about someone turning to ash , inspired by Worth holding the remains of his wife 's grandmother in his hands at her funeral ? \" The Ash Man definitely had its own set of challenges , \" Worth says , \" because we wanted to utilize a lot of real elements , and because we did n't have the time to do all the simulation and particle work needed to make it look real . The thing that sold The Ash Man more than anything was the aftermath shot : This half - disintegrated body with a pile of ash for the head on the ground . It ended up being a layering , compositing , tweaking challenge beyond belief . I got to shoot the elements myself and had more control over them . \" The Ash Man was arguably the most daunting effect for Zoic so far this season . \" Originally , it was supposed to be a practical effect but they could n't get it to fall in a natural way , so what we had to do was shoot the practical elements in pieces and we put them all together and timed all those plates and ended up rebuilding a significant part of it and tying it all together in CG , \" Orloff explains . \" So we took a cyberscan of the guy 's body , and on top of all the practical elements we used as a base , we had a matte painting , a reveal matte painting of the cracks that ran through the body , 3D particles of large chunks of ash falling out , 3D particles of small ash bits floating down , residual dust flying off of it and , at one point , his head falls off and crashes to the ground as ash . So we had to do a full - CG head and tumble it down the body . That was pretty complicated and entailed lots of R&D : there was 2D work in After Effects , tracking , retiming , we did a lot of CG lighting for the body parts in Maya / mental ray and all of the particles were a combination of Maya software , and rendered in Maya / mental ray . Then there was the effect of turning Bell and Bishop ( John Noble ) younger . \" The guys at Zoic had to walk a fine line between too plasticky , stretched , morph effects and something that naturalistically looks younger , \" Worth suggests . \" And we 're looking to do again in the future , but that 's all I can say . \" For Zoic , the \" youngify \" effect is a compositing approach using After Effects to lift out some of the higher frequency details from the plates . \" We 're pulling those out and doing a softened pass and then we 're using some selective roto to blend that back in and also some tracked warp to change the shape of the face to make it look younger , \" Orloff explains .

With J.J. Abrams ' series , the method to the madness usually starts to emerge more clearly in the second season , which is certainly the case with Fringe , airing Thursdays on FOX at 9/8c. Olivia ( Anna Torv ) returns from the parallel universe , and must battle shapeshifters bent on destroying one universe . William Bell ( Leonard Nimoy ) , the mysterious chairman of Massive Dynamic , returns as a key to understanding the meaning of the two universes . \" Obviously we had a few challenges with moving the production from New York to Vancouver , as well as a new writing staff , for the most part , \" offers Jay Worth , the overall visual effects supervisor . \" Jeff Pinker stayed on as the show runner and J.J. and Bob [ Orci ] and Alex [ Kurtzman ] and [ producer ] Bryan Burke are the over arching figure heads . But we have a whole new slew of writers and a new production team in Vancouver . When you do that , you get some continuity . But , to be honest , it was all new people once again . So in some ways , it was starting over from that standpoint . However , because I was able to keep the continuity going with our vendors [ including Zoic and Eden FX ] , I do think that that has helped the show not feel as a big of a bump from one season to the next , particularly with different crews and a different vibe a little bit . \" We 've always strived to be Cronenberg - esque in our delivery of things and have these amazingly insane things going on but also have these simple things in terms of camera and environments and be naturalistic . And that 's where the visual effects come to play . One of the privileges is that because we 're so involved with the producers and the writing of everything that we get to infuse that temperament and creative through line . So we 're all on the same page in terms of tone and story . Sometimes they even write treatments where they 'll describe someone dying in ' The Fringy way , ' and we all know what that means : ' How do you want to kill someone ? ' But because they come to us , we get to come up with ideas and creatures , even before a story point goes to the studio , which makes the creative process infinitely more fun and fulfilling . \" Andrew Orloff , Zoic 's visual effects supervisor , echoes that it has to look real -- like you really photographed it . \" What it means is that we just do n't have any shots that seemed staged for the camera or any hint of being a visual effect . One of the big effects , like the parasite that crawls out of the guy 's mouth , are interacting with actor 's performances and they 're shot with a very loose camera style and we have to have the tentacles of this creature coming out of the guy 's mouth and all the deformations that are in his stomach and in his throat and in his chest . \" And we had to create a proprietary workflow here of what we 're calling performance transfer of tracking 2D points , and putting those 2D tracked points onto the formation of 3D inter-geometry . So we 're transferring not just the camera motion but also the performance of the actors on set onto 3D pieces of geometry so we can deform them and warp them and have our effects interact with them because the mandate is all about making it look as natural as possible , so that means a lot of optical tricks and atmosphere put in as seamlessly as possible . \" Worth adds that one of the benefits this season \" is having Todd Masters of Todd Masters FX being on the practical side , which has really opened us up to doing more hands - on creature and body work , where you just know that the corpse and creatures work seamlessly with what we 're doing . That 's what I like most about episode nine with the parasite that came out of the body . We had such a good parasite to work with that we were able to design and execute a [ better result ] . \" So , aside from new twists on the trademark creepy deaths , what are some of the new wrinkles this season ? How about someone turning to ash , inspired by Worth holding the remains of his wife 's grandmother in his hands at her funeral ? \" The Ash Man definitely had its own set of challenges , \" Worth says , \" because we wanted to utilize a lot of real elements , and because we did n't have the time to do all the simulation and particle work needed to make it look real . The thing that sold The Ash Man more than anything was the aftermath shot : This half - disintegrated body with a pile of ash for the head on the ground . It ended up being a layering , compositing , tweaking challenge beyond belief . I got to shoot the elements myself and had more control over them . \" The Ash Man was arguably the most daunting effect for Zoic so far this season . \" Originally , it was supposed to be a practical effect but they could n't get it to fall in a natural way , so what we had to do was shoot the practical elements in pieces and we put them all together and timed all those plates and ended up rebuilding a significant part of it and tying it all together in CG , \" Orloff explains . \" So we took a cyberscan of the guy 's body , and on top of all the practical elements we used as a base , we had a matte painting , a reveal matte painting of the cracks that ran through the body , 3D particles of large chunks of ash falling out , 3D particles of small ash bits floating down , residual dust flying off of it and , at one point , his head falls off and crashes to the ground as ash . So we had to do a full - CG head and tumble it down the body . That was pretty complicated and entailed lots of R&D : there was 2D work in After Effects , tracking , retiming , we did a lot of CG lighting for the body parts in Maya / mental ray and all of the particles were a combination of Maya software , and rendered in Maya / mental ray . Then there was the effect of turning Bell and Bishop ( John Noble ) younger . \" The guys at Zoic had to walk a fine line between too plasticky , stretched , morph effects and something that naturalistically looks younger , \" Worth suggests . \" And we 're looking to do again in the future , but that 's all I can say . \" For Zoic , the \" youngify \" effect is a compositing approach using After Effects to lift out some of the higher frequency details from the plates . \" We 're pulling those out and doing a softened pass and then we 're using some selective roto to blend that back in and also some tracked warp to change the shape of the face to make it look younger , \" Orloff explains . Meanwhile , they 're getting very adept at their trademark effects , according to Worth . \" Now when we have to design a creature and how to ripple under someone 's skin and come out , we know what exactly what we 're doing : The efficiencies that we have this year are amazing in terms of the pipeline we have at Zoic , and the creative pipeline we have with the writers and them just trusting us . \" Bill Desowitz is senior editor of AWN & VFXWorld .","annotations":[{"text":"Andrew Orloff","span":[2304,2316],"token_span":[460,461],"role":"Deformer","label":"Deformer","role_definition":"The Deformer is the one who does the reshaping."},{"text":"we","span":[2729,2730],"token_span":[546,546],"role":"Deformer","label":"Deformer","role_definition":"The Deformer is the one who does the reshaping."},{"text":"our vendors","span":[1225,1235],"token_span":[243,244],"role":"Deformer","label":"Deformer","role_definition":"The Deformer is the one who does the reshaping."},{"text":"Zoic","span":[1249,1252],"token_span":[247,247],"role":"Deformer","label":"Deformer","role_definition":"The Deformer is the one who does the reshaping."},{"text":"Eden FX","span":[1258,1264],"token_span":[249,250],"role":"Deformer","label":"Deformer","role_definition":"The Deformer is the one who does the reshaping."},{"text":"3D pieces of geometry","span":[3191,3211],"token_span":[634,637],"role":"Patient","label":"Patient","role_definition":"The Patient is the entity acted on and that undergoes a change."},{"text":"making it look as natural as possible","span":[3322,3358],"token_span":[659,665],"role":"Configuration","label":"Configuration","role_definition":"A state that holds of the Patient or a relation that holds among the constituent parts of the Patient as a result of the arranging action."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-0712-177-frame-Resolve_problem","frame":"Resolve_problem","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Agent resolves an outstanding Problem by finding its solution, explanation, answer, etc.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"These can include sensory perception , motor functions , attention , memory , auditory and visual processing , language , problem solving , planning , organization , speed of processing , and many others .

In high security space \u2014 and only in high security space \u2014 they bring inevitable consequences to anyone breaking the law . In EVE 's lore , CONCORD is a regulation and policing organisation that arose from the NPC empires , but now operates independently of them . In EVE 's game mechanics , CONCORD ships will destroy player ships that carry out any aggressive actions on other players in high security space . CONCORD does not , however , exist to defend players : they simply enforce the consequences of law-breaking .

The game 's looting and consequence mechanics help serve as a self - regulatory risk-versus - reward system , which makes players consider how much ISK they fit on a ship . Some modules are incredibly powerful , but also incredibly valuable and attractive to gankers . You can drastically reduce the chances of someone suicide - ganking you by not fitting too many costly modules . The guarantee of CONCORD consequences invites both gankers and their potential victims to calculate risk . Contents CONCORD mechanics CONCORD is triggered by illegal aggression in high - sec . This means that if a ship activates an offensive module on an innocent player in high - sec , a countdown timer will begin . At the end of this countdown timer , CONCORD cruisers will appear on grid and apply EWAR and capacitor warfare to the offender . A few seconds later , a CONCORD battleship will enter the grid and instantly kill any criminals . CONCORD ships do not shoot capsules , but if a criminal then boards another ship in space , CONCORD will appear and destroy that ship . The time it takes for CONCORD to react varies . The higher the security status of a star system , the lower CONCORD 's reaction time . If CONCORD units have already been triggered in the system , the reaction time also increases . Prohibited actions CONCORD will respond to the following list of player activities . - Aggressing a player who is not a legal target in high - sec - See the Timers page for details - Remote repairing NPC Ships - Activating any Remote Assistance module on a player with the Criminal flag . This includes ECCM , tracking enhancers , and remote repair modules - Attacking CONCORD & Faction Police vessels , as well as some NPCs - Having a criminal flag and jumping into High Security Space - Having low security status and jumping into a High Security System in the Sanctum Constellation ( Dotlan ) - Shooting another player 's loot ( yellow wreck ) while in high sec - See the Wreck Ownership support article for details - Shooting structures ( Upwell Structures , Starbases , etc ) unless engaged in a war with the structure owner Response details If a player performs one of the prohibited actions , as above , two CONCORD cruisers and a CONCORD battleship will warp to the location . The two cruisers have a lock time of about 2 seconds . Both cruisers will warp-scramble , web , ECM jam , sensor-damp , tracking - disrupt , and energy - neutralize any players who have taken hostile action . The cruisers will also reduce their target 's drone bandwidth to 0 . The tracking disruption means that guns can no longer be fired , though area-of - effect modules such as smartbombs and ECM bursts can still be activated while the capacitor retains sufficient energy ; a capacitor booster can inject more energy in between neut cycles . The cruisers will also shoot at the offender and each will deal about 1,000 damage every volley . 15 seconds after CONCORD has warped in , the CONCORD battleship will lock the offender and immediately destroy it unless the cruisers have done so already . Response times The CONCORD response time depends on the displayed security status ( not the real sec ) of the system and the status of CONCORD presence in the system . It is possible that CONCORD has yet to spawn in the system , has already spawned elsewhere in the system , or is already present on grid . The lock time of the CONCORD ships appears not to depend on the signature radius of the offender 's ship . The following list gives the time in seconds between the offending action and the first felt action of a CONCORD ship when CONCORD has just spawned in a system . - 0.5 : Roughly 19 seconds - 0.6 : Roughly 14 seconds - 0.7 : Roughly 10 seconds - 0.8 : Roughly 7 seconds - 0.9 and 1.0 : Roughly 6 seconds When CONCORD is already on grid , the response time is severely reduced . The response time appears to drop between 2 seconds in 1.0 security to about 8 seconds in 0.6 and 9 seconds in 0.5 . When CONCORD has already spawned elsewhere in the system but is not yet on grid , the response time is significantly increased . In this case , it will take about 19 seconds for them to arrive and start firing in a 0.6 system , and 24 seconds in a 0.5 system . If CONCORD has already spawned in the system and is not on grid , suicide gankers will have more time to apply damage . In these circumstances , it 's possible for a Thrasher to do 3,000 EHP damage in a 0.6 system . All methods of delaying CONCORD 's response are considered an exploit by CCP .

I wo n't be contesting a riding in the 2015 general election or any other . \" Mr. Smitherman 's exit from politics likely favours the candidacy of Ms. Freeland , who has the support of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau 's inner circle in her pursuit of the Liberal nomination in Bob Rae 's old riding . Ms. Freeland has written extensively about income disparities and the financial squeeze facing the middle class , and worked with Mr. Trudeau to develop his leadership platform . Ms. Freeland is currently moving from New York City to Toronto , having recently quit her management position at Thomson Reuters . Mr. Trudeau has insisted that all Liberal candidates in by-elections and in the next general election will be selected through an open nomination process .

This can free vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , Dr Susan Page of Leicester University , UK , said . The peatlands , which contain up to 21 % of global land - based stores of carbon , could be destroyed by 2040 , she added . It has been calculated that in 1997 , 2.67 billion tonnes of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide were released through burning of these peatlands . This is equivalent to 40 % of one year 's global fossil fuel combustion , Dr Page says .

He was raised in Denver , Colorado , and when he was age 13 , he and his older brother , Paul , taught themselves to play guitar . At 19 , he was studying at Colorado State College , majoring in music education . He won a national talent contest sponsored by Columbia Records and Chicago radio station WHN ( home of the Barn Dance ) , the price being a recording contract with Epic Records .

He studied under maestros Graciano and Renata Tarrago at a conservatory in Barcelona . On returning to the U.S. , Michael played for a short while with the Back Porch Majority , who sprung out of the New Christy Minstrels . In 1967 and 1968 , he toured with the Chad Mitchell Trio , alongside another newcomer , John Denver . Michael and John wrote the song Circus together , which was recorded by both Denver and Mary Travis , from Peter , Paul and Mary .

He followed these with the 1979 Top 20 Pop hit This Night Wo n't Last Forever . This song was found on his next album , Dialogue . The following year , Michael had his last Pop chart hit with the low- level single You Can Call Me Blue . In 1985 , Michael recorded a duet with Sylvia entitled I Love You By Heart and it reached the Country chart Top 10 . As a result , Joe Galante signed Michael to a deal with RCA .

They say it was launched from near the coastal city of Sirte and aimed at Brega - currently held by rebels - but landed harmlessly in the desert . Pro-Gaddafi forces are believed to have more than 200 Scuds in their arsenal . The move comes as the rebels continue a push towards the capital , Tripoli . On Monday they advanced into two strategically important towns controlling access to the capital , from the west and the south . Fighting was reported in both Zawiya , 50 km ( 30 miles ) west of Tripoli , and Gharyan , 80 km ( 50 miles ) to the south . Medics outside Zawiya told Reuters news agency that sniper and mortar fire from government troops had left three civilians dead . ' Days numbered ' Col Gaddafi 's forces are still thought to control the Zawiya oil refinery - the only one in western Libya - where they get most of their fuel . Earlier , the rebels said they had seized Gharyan - a town in the Nafusa Mountains that straddles the road connecting Tripoli with Sabha , Sorman - west along the road from Zawiya to Tunisia - and Tiji , although this has not been confirmed by residents .

Benjamin Barber , a Libya expert and fellow at the think tank Demos , said such claims were \" wishful thinking \" . \" I do n't think there 's any particular reason for hope unless they 're willing to do a negotiated settlement , but neither the opposition council , nor Nato , nor the United States seem very interested in that right now , \" he told the BBC World Service . \" There are a great many tribes and groups in and around Tripoli whose future depends on the survival of Gaddafi , \" he added . \" I think this is more wishful thinking to cover the fact that the West , Europe , Nato , and the United States have been unwilling to make the sort of deals that were on the table that would have allowed Gaddafi to step away from power but stay in Libya . \" In an audio message broadcast on Libyan state TV on Monday , Col Gaddafi was defiant . \" The end of the coloniser is close and the end of the rats is close , \" he said . He appealed to his supporters to \" prepare for the battle to liberate \" Libya . Tunisia talks ? The Scud launch was detected by US forces , who say the missile was fired on Sunday morning and landed in the desert about 80 km ( 50 miles ) outside the strategic port of Brega . There was no word from Libyan authorities . The two sides have battled over Brega , with control swinging back and forth . Scud missiles have a range of up to about 800 km ( 500 miles ) and can carry a warhead of up to about one tonne . Earlier in the conflict the Nato-led coalition targeted rocket launchers and Scud missile containers near Sirte , saying the weapons could be used against civilians or on areas beyond Col Gaddafi 's control . Rebels denied that their National Transitional Council ( NTC ) has held talks with representatives of Col Gaddafi in Tunisia . \" There are no negotiations or talks between the Gaddafi regime and the NTC in Tunisia or anywhere else , \" Abdel Hafiz Ghoga , NTC vice - chairman , told AFP news agency . A UN special envoy , Abdul Ilah al - Khatib , whose role is to negotiate a ceasefire , has arrived in Tunis , and sources in the Tunisian security services said the two sides had met at a hotel on the Mediterranean resort island of Djerba on Sunday . A UN spokesman said he had \" no concrete information \" on any such talks .

Benjamin Barber , a Libya expert and fellow at the think tank Demos , said such claims were \" wishful thinking \" . \" I do n't think there 's any particular reason for hope unless they 're willing to do a negotiated settlement , but neither the opposition council , nor Nato , nor the United States seem very interested in that right now , \" he told the BBC World Service . \" There are a great many tribes and groups in and around Tripoli whose future depends on the survival of Gaddafi , \" he added . \" I think this is more wishful thinking to cover the fact that the West , Europe , Nato , and the United States have been unwilling to make the sort of deals that were on the table that would have allowed Gaddafi to step away from power but stay in Libya . \" In an audio message broadcast on Libyan state TV on Monday , Col Gaddafi was defiant . \" The end of the coloniser is close and the end of the rats is close , \" he said . He appealed to his supporters to \" prepare for the battle to liberate \" Libya . Tunisia talks ? The Scud launch was detected by US forces , who say the missile was fired on Sunday morning and landed in the desert about 80 km ( 50 miles ) outside the strategic port of Brega . There was no word from Libyan authorities . The two sides have battled over Brega , with control swinging back and forth . Scud missiles have a range of up to about 800 km ( 500 miles ) and can carry a warhead of up to about one tonne . Earlier in the conflict the Nato-led coalition targeted rocket launchers and Scud missile containers near Sirte , saying the weapons could be used against civilians or on areas beyond Col Gaddafi 's control . Rebels denied that their National Transitional Council ( NTC ) has held talks with representatives of Col Gaddafi in Tunisia . \" There are no negotiations or talks between the Gaddafi regime and the NTC in Tunisia or anywhere else , \" Abdel Hafiz Ghoga , NTC vice - chairman , told AFP news agency . A UN special envoy , Abdul Ilah al - Khatib , whose role is to negotiate a ceasefire , has arrived in Tunis , and sources in the Tunisian security services said the two sides had met at a hotel on the Mediterranean resort island of Djerba on Sunday . A UN spokesman said he had \" no concrete information \" on any such talks . Meanwhile , the Netherlands on Monday unfroze $ 143 m ( 100 m euros ; \u00c2 \u00a3 87 m ) in seized Libyan assets and gave the funds to the World Health Organization . A spokesman for the Dutch government said the funds would be used to provide medicines and surgical equipment in areas held by rebels .","annotations":[{"text":"a Scud missile","span":[140,153],"token_span":[23,25],"role":"Projectile","label":"Projectile","role_definition":"The entity whose rapid, dangerous motion is caused by the Agent and/or Firearm."},{"text":"Military forces loyal to Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi","span":[70,127],"token_span":[12,20],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent is the person performing the intentional act causing the motion of the Projectile."},{"text":"the country 's six-month conflict","span":[177,209],"token_span":[31,35],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time when the shooting event takes place."},{"text":"near the coastal city of Sirte","span":[270,299],"token_span":[48,53],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location in which the shooting event takes place."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-1277-1054-frame-Shopping","frame":"Shopping","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Shopper looks for Goods in order to purchase them.","frame_ancestors":["Seeking","Seeking_to_achieve","Work","Attempt","Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"It is the 10th largest on the East Coast and is the 28th largest in the United States .

Wino arc fin. , and who against , the Opium War ? These are ques - tions to which a third , of infinitely greater importance \u00e2 Why should there be an Opium War ? \u00e2has this week been made sub- ordinate . The Opium War party is strong , as every war party is in this country until a succession of disasters has alarmed and dis - gusted an overwhelming majority . For note how numerous and influential are the chief gainers by war . The aristocracy\u00e2the predominant interest\u00e2the class which crowds the Church and the Bar with younger sons and needy cousins\u00e2find a vent for family hangers - on in the augmented Army and Navy . The veterans in both services rejoice in the recurrence of active employment ; and many youngsters are eager to exchange dull parades and garrison - duty for the \" rapture of the strife \" : their motives are not all sordid . The dealers in clothing , arms , and provisions , who specu- late upon profitable contracts\u00e2shipowners , who have transports ready to be hired\u00e2capitalists , who foresee the need of loans\u00e2all are ready to drive the country into a war , by which they hope to gain at the public expense . And all these parties reckon , not without cause , on the easily - excited pugnacity of the multitude . The voice of the general mercantile community ought to be for peace : but it happens that in this quarrel with China a powerful diversion in thvour of war is created by peculiar circumstances . Compensation for the opium delivered up to destruction \" for her Majesty 's service \" \u00e2valued , without interest , at about two millions and a half sterling\u00e2can only be obtained by war : so the Govern - ment assures the opium-smugglers and their agents .

Wino arc fin. , and who against , the Opium War ? These are ques - tions to which a third , of infinitely greater importance \u00e2 Why should there be an Opium War ? \u00e2has this week been made sub- ordinate . The Opium War party is strong , as every war party is in this country until a succession of disasters has alarmed and dis - gusted an overwhelming majority .

The aristocracy\u00e2the predominant interest\u00e2the class which crowds the Church and the Bar with younger sons and needy cousins\u00e2find a vent for family hangers - on in the augmented Army and Navy .

Kosher foods are permitted to be eaten , and can be used as ingredients in the production of additional food items . The basic laws are of Biblical origin ( Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 17 ) . For thousands of years , Rabbinic scholars have interpreted these laws and applied them to contemporary situations . In addition , Rabbinic bodies enacted protective legislation to safeguard the integrity of kosher laws . Kosher Dietary Rules and Regulations . The laws of kosher are complex and extensive . The intention of this guide is to acquaint the reader with some of the fundamentals of kashrut and provide insight into its practical application . Given the complex nature of the laws of kosher , one should consult an Orthodox Rabbi whenever an issue arises . Though an ancillary hygienic benefit has been attributed to the observance of kashrut , the ultimate purpose and rationale is to conform to the Divine Will , as expressed in the Torah . Not too long ago , most food products were made in the family kitchen , or in a small factory or store in the local community . It was relatively easy to ascertain if the product was reliably kosher . If Rabbinical supervision was required , it was attended to by the Rabbi of the community , who was known to all . Today , industrialization , transcontinental shipping and mass production have created a situation where most of the foods we eat are treated , processed , cooked , canned or boxed commercially in industrial settings , which can be located hundreds or thousands of miles away from home . What adds further complication is that it is generally not possible to judge the kosher status of an item on the basis of the information provided in the ingredient declaration for a variety of reasons . First , the product may be made from kosher ingredients , but processed on non-kosher equipment . Second , the USDA does not require the listing of certain processing aids , such as pan liners and oils that serve as release agents . Though not legally classified as ingredients , these items could nonetheless render the product non-kosher . Third , many ingredients can be kosher or non-kosher , depending on their source of origin . For example , glycerin and emulsifiers are made from either vegetable ( most likely kosher ) or animal oils ( most likely non -kosher ) . Finally , many ingredients are listed only in broad terms , with no breakdown of the many complex components that make up the actual item . For example , a chocolate flavor may contain 50 ingredients , but the ingredient declaration will list this entire complex of ingredients as \u201c flavors \u201d . Unless a person is an expert in food production , the average consumer cannot possibly make an evaluation of the kosher status , which is why it is important to purchase only those products that have the endorsement of a reliable kashruth agency . Want to Apply for Kosher Certification ? Find out how to get certified here Kosher Food Kosher Meat and Non-Kosher Meat , Poultry , and Fish Meat : The Torah states that kosher mammals are those that chew their cud ( ruminants ) and are cloven-hoofed . The following animal species are among those considered to be kosher : addax , antelope , bison , cow , deer , gazelle , giraffe , goat , ibex and sheep . In addition , kosher meat and poultry require special preparation , which will be discussed below . Poultry : The Torah does not enumerate specific characteristics to distinguish permitted and forbidden birds . Instead , it enumerates 24 forbidden species of fowl , while all other birds are considered to be kosher . Nonetheless , for various reasons , in practice we eat only those birds which have an established tradition that the species is kosher . In the United States , the only poultry accepted by mainstream kashrut organizations as kosher are chicken , turkey , duck and goose . Fish : The Torah establishes two criteria to determine which fish are kosher . The fish must have fins and scales . The scales must be easily removable without damaging the skin . [ Generally , scales on kosher fish are either thin , rounded and smooth-edged ( cycloid ) or narrow segments that are similar to teeth of a comb ( ctenoid ) ] . All shellfish are prohibited . Unlike meat and poultry , fish requires no special preparation . Nonetheless , the fish scales must be visible to the consumer in order to establish the kosher status of the fish . Therefore , filleted or ground fish should not be purchased unless properly supervised , or the fillet should have a skin tab with scales attached to the flesh . Furthermore , purchasing fish in a non-kosher fish store is problematic \u2013 even if the scales are intact \u2013 because the knives and tables are not kosher , and Rabbinic guidance should therefore be sought . Fish and meat may not be eaten together , but they may be consumed as one course after the other , even at the same meal . To avoid eating them together , one should not use the same dishes or cutlery without washing them clean before one course and the next . In addition , one should eat some solid food and drink water or a beverage in between to cleanse one 's mouth of residue . Processed and smoked fish products require reliable rabbinic supervision , as do all processed foods . Meat & Poultry Processing Shechita ( Slaughter ) : The Torah requires that meat and poultry be slaughtered in a prescribed manner known as shechita . The trachea and esophagus of the animal are severed with a special razor-sharp , perfectly smooth blade , causing instantaneous death with no pain to the animal . Only a trained kosher slaughterer ( shochet ) , whose piety and expertise have been attested to by rabbinic authorities , is qualified to slaughter an animal for kosher consumption . Bedika ( Inspection ) : After the animal has been properly slaughtered , a trained inspector ( bodek ) inspects the internal organs for any physiological abnormalities that may render the animal non-kosher ( treif ) . The lungs , in particular , must be examined in order to determine that there are no adhesions ( sirchot ) , which may be indicative of a puncture in the lungs . If an adhesion is found , the bodek must further examine it carefully to determine its kosher status . It should be noted that in addition to fulfilling the requirements of halacha ( Jewish law ) , the bedika of internal organs insures a standard of quality that exceeds government requirements . Glatt Kosher : Though not all adhesions render an animal non-kosher , some Jewish communities or individuals only eat meat of an animal that has been found to be free of all adhesions on its lungs . \u201c Glatt \u201d literally means \u201c smooth \u201d , indicating that the meat comes from an animal whose lungs have been found to be free of all adhesions . Recently , the term \u201c glatt kosher \u201d is increasingly used more broadly as a generic phrase , implying that the product is kosher without question . Nikkur ( Excising ) : In some kosher animal species , many blood vessels , nerves and lobes of fat are forbidden and must be removed . There are special cutting procedures for beef , veal and lamb known as nikkur ( Hebrew word for \u201c excising \u201d ) , which must be performed by a specially trained individual . Koshering Meat : The Torah forbids the consumption of the blood of an animal . The two accepted methods of extracting blood from meat , a process referred to as \u201c kashering \u201d , are either salting or broiling . Meat should not be placed in warm water before it has been \u201c kashered \u201d . Once meat is cooked prior to kashering , it cannot be made kosher . 1 . Salting Meat : The meat must first be soaked for a half hour in cool ( not ice ) water in a utensil designated only for that purpose . After allowing for excess water to drip off the meat , the meat is thoroughly salted so that the entire surface is covered with a thin layer of salt . Only coarse salt should be used . Both sides of meat and poultry must be salted . All loose inside sections of poultry must be removed before the kashering process begins . Each part must be soaked and salted individually . If the meat or poultry was sliced during the salting process , the newly exposed surfaces of the cut must now be soaked for a half hour and salted as well . The salted meat is left for an hour on an inclined or perforated surface to allow the blood to flow down freely . The cavity of the poultry should be placed open , in a downward direction . After the salting , the meat must be thoroughly soaked , and then thoroughly washed to remove all of the applied salt . According to Jewish law , meat must be kashered within 72 hours after slaughter so as not to allow the blood to congeal . If meat has been thoroughly soaked prior to the 72 hours limit , an additional seventy - two hours time stay is granted to complete the first step of the salting process . 2 . Broiling : An alternate means of \u201c kashering \u201d meat is through broiling . Liver may only be kashered through broiling , because of the preponderance of blood in it . Both the liver and meat must first be thoroughly washed to remove all surface blood . They are then salted slightly on all sides . Subsequently , they are broiled specifically on a designated liver - broiling perforated grate over an open fire , which draws out the internal blood . When kashering liver , slits must be made in the liver prior to broiling . The meat or liver must be broiled on both sides until the outer surface appears to be dry and brown . After broiling , the meat or the liver is rinsed off . The Kosher Butcher : Years ago , salting of meat and poultry was performed in the home of the consumer . More recently , the kosher butcher performed salting in the butcher shop . Today , the entire process of slaughtering , bedika , nikkur and salting has shifted to the slaughterhouse . This allows for uniform consistency of high standards . Nonetheless , the kosher butcher plays a critical role in distributing the product . The butcher must be a person of integrity and the store should be under reliable Rabbinic supervision . Packaging : From the time of slaughter , kosher meat and poultry must be properly supervised until it reaches the consumer . A metal tag called a plumba , bearing the kosher symbol is often clamped on the meat or fowl to serve as an identifying seal of supervision . Alternatively , the meat or fowl is packed in tamper - proof packaging with the kosher logo prominently displayed . Kosher Costs : Because kosher meat and poultry have many processing requirements ( shechita , bedika nikkur and salting ) , which must be performed by specially trained individuals , the labor costs associated with kosher meat and poultry are significantly greater . This accounts for the higher cost of kosher meat and poultry . Kosher Caterers , Kosher Restaurants & Hotels : Caterers , restaurants , and hotels must be supervised by a reputable Orthodox Rabbinic authority . It cannot be assumed that kashrut is maintained simply because a kosher impression is created by an advertisement or by a statement , such as , \u201c we serve a kosher clientele . \u201d Too often , ' vegetarian ' or ' dairy ' restaurants are assumed to be kosher and beyond the need for supervision . Unfortunately , this is a prevalent misconception . Fish , baked goods , cheese , shortening , oil , eggs , margarine , dressings , and condiments are among the many foodstuffs requiring supervision in ' vegetarian ' and ' dairy ' restaurants . Even those food items that are kosher in their raw states could be rendered non-kosher when prepared on equipment used for non-kosher food . For these reasons , reputable kosher supervision is required . Meat and Milk in the Kosher Kitchen The Torah forbids : 1 ) cooking meat and milk together in any form ; 2 ) eating such cooked products , or 3 ) deriving benefit from them . As a safeguard , the Rabbis extended this prohibition to disallow the eating of meat and dairy products at the same meal or preparing them on the same utensils . Furthermore , milk products cannot be consumed after eating meat , for a period of time . There are different traditions for how long to wait between meat and dairy , but the most prevalent custom is to wait six hours . Meat may be eaten following dairy products with the one exception of hard cheese that is aged 6 months or more , which requires the same waiting time as that of dairy after meat . Prior to eating meat after dairy , one must eat a solid food , either drink a liquid or thoroughly rinse one 's mouth , and check the cleanliness of ones hands . A. Utensils : Unless one is a vegetarian and meat is totally excluded from his kitchen , a kosher kitchen must have two different sets of utensils , one for meat and poultry and the other for dairy foods . There must be separate , distinct sets of pots , pans , plates and silverware . B. Washing Dishes : Ideally , it is best to have two kitchen sinks , one for meat and the other for dairy . If this is not feasible , and one uses one sink for both meat and dairy , dishes and utensils should be placed and washed on a rack , so as not to touch the sink . Separate racks are to be used for meat and dairy use . Care must be taken to make sure that the water should not be allowed to rise to reach the level of the rack , and dishes cannot be soaked in a sink used for both dairy and meat . Eggs The eggs ( or other by-products ) of non-kosher birds or fish are not kosher . Caviar , therefore , must come from a kosher fish and this requires reliable supervision . Commercial liquid eggs also require supervision . Eggs of kosher fowl that contain a blood spots must be discarded , and therefore eggs should be checked before use . Shortening and Oil : Government regulations concerning the labeling of food ingredients have undergone strict changes . Not only must the label specify the type of shortening , i.e. , vegetable or animal , but it must declare the actual source as well . Thus , it is commonplace to find mention of cottonseed oil , lard , coconut oil , and other oil sources . The result of this explicit label display is that the consumer can easily detect what is blatantly non-kosher . However , it is important to be aware that the kosher status of a product containing even pure vegetable shortening can only be verified by reliable kosher certification . The reason for this is that manufacturers of vegetable shortening often process animal fats on common equipment . Pure vegetable products may satisfy USDA guidelines for purity , however , in terms of Jewish law , vegetable oil may be non-kosher because it is processed on non-kosher equipment . Emulsifiers : Emulsifiers are complex substances that are used in many types of food production . They can perform a number of critical functions , among them acting as a surfactant ( reducing the surface tension of a liquid ) thus making oil and water soluble . Emulsifiers are critical components in many food items , such as margarine , shortenings , cream fillings , toppings , coffee creamers , whiteners , prepared cake mixes , donuts , puddings , ice cream , frozen desserts , instant mashed potatoes , peanut butter , breakfast cereals , chocolates and candies . Emulsifiers may be listed on the ingredient label as polysorbates , glycerides , mono and diglycerides , sorbitan monostearates , etc . Emulsifiers are produced from either animal or vegetable oil , and emulsifiers require reliable kosher supervision . Flavors : A critical sector of the food industry is manufacturers of flavors . Flavors , whether artificial or natural , are components of nearly every product . Flavor production is highly complex and uses raw materials from every imaginable source . Some common kosher sensitive ingredients used in flavors are fusel oil ( which may be extracted from grape juice ) , glycerin and castorium ( a beaver extract ) . Since the ingredient declaration never includes a breakdown of ingredients used in flavors , food items containing natural or artificial flavors require reliable supervision . Fillings and Cremes : All fillings , cremes , and fudge bases must be certified kosher because they may contain fats , emulsifiers , gelatin stabilizers and flavors . Breads , Rolls , Challah , Bagels and Bialys : These basic household staples present several kosher problems and require kosher certification . Many types of bread are made with oils and shortenings . Basic ingredients of specially prepared dough mixes and dough conditioners are shortenings and di-glycerides . In bakeries , pans and troughs in which the dough is placed to rise and to bake are coated with grease or divider oils , which may be non-kosher . These oils often do not appear on the label . There may also be an issue of other non-kosher products prepared and baked on the same equipment . These are some of the reasons that bread requires kosher supervision . It is Rabbinically prohibited to produce bread utilizing dairy ingredients . Since bread is frequently eaten at all meals , the Rabbis were concerned that one might inadvertently eat dairy bread with a meat meal . There are two exceptions \u2013 if the bread is baked in an unusual shape or design indicating that it is dairy , or if the loaf is so small that it would be consumed at one meal . Jewish law requires that a portion of batter or finished baked product be set aside for what is known as \u201c challah \u201d ' . While any size portion is adequate for challah , it is customary to separate a portion the size of an olive . After separation , the challah is burned . This ritual is obligatory only when the owner of the dough at the time of its preparation is Jewish , and the dough is made from flour of any of the following five grains : wheat , oats , rye , spelt , and barley . In addition , there is no requirement to separate challah if the batter contains less than 2 - 1/2 pounds of flour . If the batter contains at least 5 pounds of flour , a blessing is recited before separating challah . If this mitzvah has not been performed in the bakery , it may be performed in the home by placing all the baked goods in one room , breaking open all sealed packaged material , and taking a small piece from any of the baked goods and burning it . Cake , Pastries and Doughnuts These products generally contain shortening , emulsifiers , flavors and other kosher sensitive ingredients , and therefore reliable supervision is necessary . Dairy Products A. Milk : Rabbinic law requires that there be supervision during the milking process to ensure that the source of the milk is from a kosher animal . Following the opinion of many rabbinic authorities , OU policy is that in the United States , the Department of Agriculture 's regulations and controls are sufficiently stringent to ensure that only cow 's milk is sold commercially . These government requirements fulfill the Rabbinical requirement for supervision . However , some individuals are more stringent and only consume milk that was produced with full - time supervision . This is known as cholov yisroel . B. Cheese : All cheeses require kosher certification , including hard cheeses ( Swiss , cheddar , etc. ) and soft cheeses ( cottage , farmer , pot , and cream cheese ) . Rennet , processed from the stomachs of unweaned calves , is often used in the production of hard cheese as a curdling and coagulating agent . Kosher hard cheese is produced with microbial rennet , which is derived from kosher sources . Because hard cheese is typically made with animal rennet , the Rabbinic sages decreed that even when animal rennet is not used , a full - time supervisor must be present to guarantee the kosher integrity of the product . Hard cheese produced with kosher ingredients and a full - time supervisor is known as gevinat yisroel . Soft cheeses may contain cultures and flavors that are not kosher . Since these products are pasteurized , the integrity of the equipment is an issue as well . Pareve Foods : The adjective ' pareve ' means that the food item does not contain dairy or meat ingredients , and it was not processed with heat on dairy or meat equipment . Pareve foods are neutral and may be eaten with meat or dairy foods . Labeling : OU policy is that dairy or meat items are labeled OU - D and OU Dairy or OU Meat respectively . An item that is labeled OU without a suffix can be assumed to be pareve . Nonetheless , we recommend checking the ingredients listed on the label , since on rare occasions , the OU-D is inadvertently omitted . Sherbets : According to government standards , any product labeled ' sherbet ' or ' fruit sherbet ' must contain milk and is , therefore , not pareve . Water ices may be pareve or dairy , which will be reflected in the OU designation . Margarine : Margarine contains oils and glycerides and requires rabbinic certification . Additionally , margarine may contain up to 12 % dairy ingredients , and therefore some margarine are OU Dairy while others are pareve . Non Dairy Creamers : Many non-dairy creamers are , in fact , dairy and bear an OU -D . The government requires that creamers be labeled \u201c non-dairy \u201d if milk derivatives are used instead of whole milk . Natural and Health Foods With the proliferation of so -called \u201c Natural \u201d or \u201c Pure \u201d and similarly promoted health food products in the United States , some clarification is in order with regards to their kashrut status . There is a mistaken notion that natural products are inherently kosher . In fact , all non-kosher food items are natural , and therefore natural has no bearing on the kosher status . Wines and Grape Products All grape juice , grape wines or brandies must be prepared under strict Orthodox Rabbinic supervision . Once the kosher wine has been cooked , no restrictions are attached to its handling . Such products are generally labeled \u201c mevushal \u201d . Grape jam ( produced from grape pulp ) as well as all varieties of jam and jelly require supervision because they may be processed on non-kosher equipment and may contain non-kosher additives . Grape jelly is produced from grape juice and can be used only when produced from kosher grape juice under proper supervision . Natural and artificial grape flavors may not be used unless they are kosher endorsed . Many grape flavors contain natural grape extracts and are labeled artificial or imitation because other flavoring additives are used in the formula . Liqueurs require supervision because of the flavorings used in these products . In addition , the alcohol base may be wine derived . Traveling For the businessperson or tourist traveling across the United States , kosher certified products are available almost everywhere , even in the smallest groceries in the most remote towns . However , it is much more difficult to obtain reliably kosher certified products in most foreign countries . A traveler bringing along frozen ( TV ) dinners where only non-kosher ovens are available for reheating , may use the ovens by covering the frozen package with two layers of aluminum foil . If a microwave will be utilized , then the food must also be double wrapped . Kosher meals should be ordered in advance when traveling by plane , train or ship . These meals are also heated in non-kosher ovens . The employees of the carrier are instructed to heat these meals in the same manner that they were received ; totally wrapped in double foil with the caterer 's seal and the Rabbinic certification seal intact . The traveler can ascertain by the intact seals that the dinners have not been tampered . Any dinner , which is not properly sealed , should not be eaten . The kosher certification only applies to the food in the sealed package . Any other food ( rolls , wines or liqueurs , cheeses , and coffee creamers or snacks ) served loose by the carrier is not included in the kosher endorsement , unless it is sealed and bears its own separate endorsement .","annotations":[{"text":"the meat","span":[7903,7910],"token_span":[1448,1449],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The Theme is the entity that changes location."},{"text":"salted","span":[8384,8389],"token_span":[1541,1541],"role":"Medium","label":"Medium","role_definition":"Medium is the substance in which the Theme is submerged."},{"text":"an hour","span":[8408,8414],"token_span":[1546,1547],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time when the Agent soaks the Theme."},{"text":"an inclined or perforated surface","span":[8419,8451],"token_span":[1549,1553],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place where the submerging occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"The meat is typically soaked in cool water and drained and then completely covered with a thin layer of salt \u2014 and then allowed to stand on a rack or board for an hour or more .

Kosher foods are permitted to be eaten , and can be used as ingredients in the production of additional food items . The basic laws are of Biblical origin ( Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 17 ) . For thousands of years , Rabbinic scholars have interpreted these laws and applied them to contemporary situations . In addition , Rabbinic bodies enacted protective legislation to safeguard the integrity of kosher laws . Kosher Dietary Rules and Regulations . The laws of kosher are complex and extensive . The intention of this guide is to acquaint the reader with some of the fundamentals of kashrut and provide insight into its practical application . Given the complex nature of the laws of kosher , one should consult an Orthodox Rabbi whenever an issue arises . Though an ancillary hygienic benefit has been attributed to the observance of kashrut , the ultimate purpose and rationale is to conform to the Divine Will , as expressed in the Torah . Not too long ago , most food products were made in the family kitchen , or in a small factory or store in the local community . It was relatively easy to ascertain if the product was reliably kosher . If Rabbinical supervision was required , it was attended to by the Rabbi of the community , who was known to all . Today , industrialization , transcontinental shipping and mass production have created a situation where most of the foods we eat are treated , processed , cooked , canned or boxed commercially in industrial settings , which can be located hundreds or thousands of miles away from home . What adds further complication is that it is generally not possible to judge the kosher status of an item on the basis of the information provided in the ingredient declaration for a variety of reasons . First , the product may be made from kosher ingredients , but processed on non-kosher equipment . Second , the USDA does not require the listing of certain processing aids , such as pan liners and oils that serve as release agents . Though not legally classified as ingredients , these items could nonetheless render the product non-kosher . Third , many ingredients can be kosher or non-kosher , depending on their source of origin . For example , glycerin and emulsifiers are made from either vegetable ( most likely kosher ) or animal oils ( most likely non -kosher ) . Finally , many ingredients are listed only in broad terms , with no breakdown of the many complex components that make up the actual item . For example , a chocolate flavor may contain 50 ingredients , but the ingredient declaration will list this entire complex of ingredients as \u201c flavors \u201d . Unless a person is an expert in food production , the average consumer cannot possibly make an evaluation of the kosher status , which is why it is important to purchase only those products that have the endorsement of a reliable kashruth agency . Want to Apply for Kosher Certification ? Find out how to get certified here Kosher Food Kosher Meat and Non-Kosher Meat , Poultry , and Fish Meat : The Torah states that kosher mammals are those that chew their cud ( ruminants ) and are cloven-hoofed . The following animal species are among those considered to be kosher : addax , antelope , bison , cow , deer , gazelle , giraffe , goat , ibex and sheep . In addition , kosher meat and poultry require special preparation , which will be discussed below . Poultry : The Torah does not enumerate specific characteristics to distinguish permitted and forbidden birds . Instead , it enumerates 24 forbidden species of fowl , while all other birds are considered to be kosher . Nonetheless , for various reasons , in practice we eat only those birds which have an established tradition that the species is kosher . In the United States , the only poultry accepted by mainstream kashrut organizations as kosher are chicken , turkey , duck and goose . Fish : The Torah establishes two criteria to determine which fish are kosher . The fish must have fins and scales . The scales must be easily removable without damaging the skin . [ Generally , scales on kosher fish are either thin , rounded and smooth-edged ( cycloid ) or narrow segments that are similar to teeth of a comb ( ctenoid ) ] . All shellfish are prohibited . Unlike meat and poultry , fish requires no special preparation . Nonetheless , the fish scales must be visible to the consumer in order to establish the kosher status of the fish . Therefore , filleted or ground fish should not be purchased unless properly supervised , or the fillet should have a skin tab with scales attached to the flesh . Furthermore , purchasing fish in a non-kosher fish store is problematic \u2013 even if the scales are intact \u2013 because the knives and tables are not kosher , and Rabbinic guidance should therefore be sought . Fish and meat may not be eaten together , but they may be consumed as one course after the other , even at the same meal . To avoid eating them together , one should not use the same dishes or cutlery without washing them clean before one course and the next . In addition , one should eat some solid food and drink water or a beverage in between to cleanse one 's mouth of residue . Processed and smoked fish products require reliable rabbinic supervision , as do all processed foods . Meat & Poultry Processing Shechita ( Slaughter ) : The Torah requires that meat and poultry be slaughtered in a prescribed manner known as shechita . The trachea and esophagus of the animal are severed with a special razor-sharp , perfectly smooth blade , causing instantaneous death with no pain to the animal . Only a trained kosher slaughterer ( shochet ) , whose piety and expertise have been attested to by rabbinic authorities , is qualified to slaughter an animal for kosher consumption . Bedika ( Inspection ) : After the animal has been properly slaughtered , a trained inspector ( bodek ) inspects the internal organs for any physiological abnormalities that may render the animal non-kosher ( treif ) . The lungs , in particular , must be examined in order to determine that there are no adhesions ( sirchot ) , which may be indicative of a puncture in the lungs . If an adhesion is found , the bodek must further examine it carefully to determine its kosher status . It should be noted that in addition to fulfilling the requirements of halacha ( Jewish law ) , the bedika of internal organs insures a standard of quality that exceeds government requirements . Glatt Kosher : Though not all adhesions render an animal non-kosher , some Jewish communities or individuals only eat meat of an animal that has been found to be free of all adhesions on its lungs . \u201c Glatt \u201d literally means \u201c smooth \u201d , indicating that the meat comes from an animal whose lungs have been found to be free of all adhesions . Recently , the term \u201c glatt kosher \u201d is increasingly used more broadly as a generic phrase , implying that the product is kosher without question . Nikkur ( Excising ) : In some kosher animal species , many blood vessels , nerves and lobes of fat are forbidden and must be removed . There are special cutting procedures for beef , veal and lamb known as nikkur ( Hebrew word for \u201c excising \u201d ) , which must be performed by a specially trained individual . Koshering Meat : The Torah forbids the consumption of the blood of an animal . The two accepted methods of extracting blood from meat , a process referred to as \u201c kashering \u201d , are either salting or broiling . Meat should not be placed in warm water before it has been \u201c kashered \u201d . Once meat is cooked prior to kashering , it cannot be made kosher . 1 . Salting Meat : The meat must first be soaked for a half hour in cool ( not ice ) water in a utensil designated only for that purpose . After allowing for excess water to drip off the meat , the meat is thoroughly salted so that the entire surface is covered with a thin layer of salt . Only coarse salt should be used . Both sides of meat and poultry must be salted . All loose inside sections of poultry must be removed before the kashering process begins . Each part must be soaked and salted individually . If the meat or poultry was sliced during the salting process , the newly exposed surfaces of the cut must now be soaked for a half hour and salted as well . The salted meat is left for an hour on an inclined or perforated surface to allow the blood to flow down freely . The cavity of the poultry should be placed open , in a downward direction . After the salting , the meat must be thoroughly soaked , and then thoroughly washed to remove all of the applied salt . According to Jewish law , meat must be kashered within 72 hours after slaughter so as not to allow the blood to congeal . If meat has been thoroughly soaked prior to the 72 hours limit , an additional seventy - two hours time stay is granted to complete the first step of the salting process . 2 . Broiling : An alternate means of \u201c kashering \u201d meat is through broiling . Liver may only be kashered through broiling , because of the preponderance of blood in it . Both the liver and meat must first be thoroughly washed to remove all surface blood . They are then salted slightly on all sides . Subsequently , they are broiled specifically on a designated liver - broiling perforated grate over an open fire , which draws out the internal blood . When kashering liver , slits must be made in the liver prior to broiling . The meat or liver must be broiled on both sides until the outer surface appears to be dry and brown . After broiling , the meat or the liver is rinsed off . The Kosher Butcher : Years ago , salting of meat and poultry was performed in the home of the consumer . More recently , the kosher butcher performed salting in the butcher shop . Today , the entire process of slaughtering , bedika , nikkur and salting has shifted to the slaughterhouse . This allows for uniform consistency of high standards . Nonetheless , the kosher butcher plays a critical role in distributing the product . The butcher must be a person of integrity and the store should be under reliable Rabbinic supervision . Packaging : From the time of slaughter , kosher meat and poultry must be properly supervised until it reaches the consumer . A metal tag called a plumba , bearing the kosher symbol is often clamped on the meat or fowl to serve as an identifying seal of supervision . Alternatively , the meat or fowl is packed in tamper - proof packaging with the kosher logo prominently displayed . Kosher Costs : Because kosher meat and poultry have many processing requirements ( shechita , bedika nikkur and salting ) , which must be performed by specially trained individuals , the labor costs associated with kosher meat and poultry are significantly greater . This accounts for the higher cost of kosher meat and poultry . Kosher Caterers , Kosher Restaurants & Hotels : Caterers , restaurants , and hotels must be supervised by a reputable Orthodox Rabbinic authority . It cannot be assumed that kashrut is maintained simply because a kosher impression is created by an advertisement or by a statement , such as , \u201c we serve a kosher clientele . \u201d Too often , ' vegetarian ' or ' dairy ' restaurants are assumed to be kosher and beyond the need for supervision . Unfortunately , this is a prevalent misconception . Fish , baked goods , cheese , shortening , oil , eggs , margarine , dressings , and condiments are among the many foodstuffs requiring supervision in ' vegetarian ' and ' dairy ' restaurants . Even those food items that are kosher in their raw states could be rendered non-kosher when prepared on equipment used for non-kosher food . For these reasons , reputable kosher supervision is required . Meat and Milk in the Kosher Kitchen The Torah forbids : 1 ) cooking meat and milk together in any form ; 2 ) eating such cooked products , or 3 ) deriving benefit from them . As a safeguard , the Rabbis extended this prohibition to disallow the eating of meat and dairy products at the same meal or preparing them on the same utensils . Furthermore , milk products cannot be consumed after eating meat , for a period of time . There are different traditions for how long to wait between meat and dairy , but the most prevalent custom is to wait six hours . Meat may be eaten following dairy products with the one exception of hard cheese that is aged 6 months or more , which requires the same waiting time as that of dairy after meat . Prior to eating meat after dairy , one must eat a solid food , either drink a liquid or thoroughly rinse one 's mouth , and check the cleanliness of ones hands . A. Utensils : Unless one is a vegetarian and meat is totally excluded from his kitchen , a kosher kitchen must have two different sets of utensils , one for meat and poultry and the other for dairy foods . There must be separate , distinct sets of pots , pans , plates and silverware . B. Washing Dishes : Ideally , it is best to have two kitchen sinks , one for meat and the other for dairy . If this is not feasible , and one uses one sink for both meat and dairy , dishes and utensils should be placed and washed on a rack , so as not to touch the sink . Separate racks are to be used for meat and dairy use . Care must be taken to make sure that the water should not be allowed to rise to reach the level of the rack , and dishes cannot be soaked in a sink used for both dairy and meat . Eggs The eggs ( or other by-products ) of non-kosher birds or fish are not kosher . Caviar , therefore , must come from a kosher fish and this requires reliable supervision . Commercial liquid eggs also require supervision . Eggs of kosher fowl that contain a blood spots must be discarded , and therefore eggs should be checked before use . Shortening and Oil : Government regulations concerning the labeling of food ingredients have undergone strict changes . Not only must the label specify the type of shortening , i.e. , vegetable or animal , but it must declare the actual source as well . Thus , it is commonplace to find mention of cottonseed oil , lard , coconut oil , and other oil sources . The result of this explicit label display is that the consumer can easily detect what is blatantly non-kosher . However , it is important to be aware that the kosher status of a product containing even pure vegetable shortening can only be verified by reliable kosher certification . The reason for this is that manufacturers of vegetable shortening often process animal fats on common equipment . Pure vegetable products may satisfy USDA guidelines for purity , however , in terms of Jewish law , vegetable oil may be non-kosher because it is processed on non-kosher equipment . Emulsifiers : Emulsifiers are complex substances that are used in many types of food production . They can perform a number of critical functions , among them acting as a surfactant ( reducing the surface tension of a liquid ) thus making oil and water soluble . Emulsifiers are critical components in many food items , such as margarine , shortenings , cream fillings , toppings , coffee creamers , whiteners , prepared cake mixes , donuts , puddings , ice cream , frozen desserts , instant mashed potatoes , peanut butter , breakfast cereals , chocolates and candies . Emulsifiers may be listed on the ingredient label as polysorbates , glycerides , mono and diglycerides , sorbitan monostearates , etc . Emulsifiers are produced from either animal or vegetable oil , and emulsifiers require reliable kosher supervision . Flavors : A critical sector of the food industry is manufacturers of flavors . Flavors , whether artificial or natural , are components of nearly every product . Flavor production is highly complex and uses raw materials from every imaginable source . Some common kosher sensitive ingredients used in flavors are fusel oil ( which may be extracted from grape juice ) , glycerin and castorium ( a beaver extract ) . Since the ingredient declaration never includes a breakdown of ingredients used in flavors , food items containing natural or artificial flavors require reliable supervision . Fillings and Cremes : All fillings , cremes , and fudge bases must be certified kosher because they may contain fats , emulsifiers , gelatin stabilizers and flavors . Breads , Rolls , Challah , Bagels and Bialys : These basic household staples present several kosher problems and require kosher certification . Many types of bread are made with oils and shortenings . Basic ingredients of specially prepared dough mixes and dough conditioners are shortenings and di-glycerides . In bakeries , pans and troughs in which the dough is placed to rise and to bake are coated with grease or divider oils , which may be non-kosher . These oils often do not appear on the label . There may also be an issue of other non-kosher products prepared and baked on the same equipment . These are some of the reasons that bread requires kosher supervision . It is Rabbinically prohibited to produce bread utilizing dairy ingredients . Since bread is frequently eaten at all meals , the Rabbis were concerned that one might inadvertently eat dairy bread with a meat meal . There are two exceptions \u2013 if the bread is baked in an unusual shape or design indicating that it is dairy , or if the loaf is so small that it would be consumed at one meal . Jewish law requires that a portion of batter or finished baked product be set aside for what is known as \u201c challah \u201d ' . While any size portion is adequate for challah , it is customary to separate a portion the size of an olive . After separation , the challah is burned . This ritual is obligatory only when the owner of the dough at the time of its preparation is Jewish , and the dough is made from flour of any of the following five grains : wheat , oats , rye , spelt , and barley . In addition , there is no requirement to separate challah if the batter contains less than 2 - 1/2 pounds of flour . If the batter contains at least 5 pounds of flour , a blessing is recited before separating challah . If this mitzvah has not been performed in the bakery , it may be performed in the home by placing all the baked goods in one room , breaking open all sealed packaged material , and taking a small piece from any of the baked goods and burning it . Cake , Pastries and Doughnuts These products generally contain shortening , emulsifiers , flavors and other kosher sensitive ingredients , and therefore reliable supervision is necessary . Dairy Products A. Milk : Rabbinic law requires that there be supervision during the milking process to ensure that the source of the milk is from a kosher animal .

Since these products are pasteurized , the integrity of the equipment is an issue as well . Pareve Foods : The adjective ' pareve ' means that the food item does not contain dairy or meat ingredients , and it was not processed with heat on dairy or meat equipment . Pareve foods are neutral and may be eaten with meat or dairy foods . Labeling : OU policy is that dairy or meat items are labeled OU - D and OU Dairy or OU Meat respectively . An item that is labeled OU without a suffix can be assumed to be pareve . Nonetheless , we recommend checking the ingredients listed on the label , since on rare occasions , the OU-D is inadvertently omitted . Sherbets : According to government standards , any product labeled ' sherbet ' or ' fruit sherbet ' must contain milk and is , therefore , not pareve . Water ices may be pareve or dairy , which will be reflected in the OU designation . Margarine : Margarine contains oils and glycerides and requires rabbinic certification . Additionally , margarine may contain up to 12 % dairy ingredients , and therefore some margarine are OU Dairy while others are pareve . Non Dairy Creamers : Many non-dairy creamers are , in fact , dairy and bear an OU -D . The government requires that creamers be labeled \u201c non-dairy \u201d if milk derivatives are used instead of whole milk .

There is a mistaken notion that natural products are inherently kosher . In fact , all non-kosher food items are natural , and therefore natural has no bearing on the kosher status . Wines and Grape Products All grape juice , grape wines or brandies must be prepared under strict Orthodox Rabbinic supervision . Once the kosher wine has been cooked , no restrictions are attached to its handling . Such products are generally labeled \u201c mevushal \u201d . Grape jam ( produced from grape pulp ) as well as all varieties of jam and jelly require supervision because they may be processed on non-kosher equipment and may contain non-kosher additives . Grape jelly is produced from grape juice and can be used only when produced from kosher grape juice under proper supervision . Natural and artificial grape flavors may not be used unless they are kosher endorsed . Many grape flavors contain natural grape extracts and are labeled artificial or imitation because other flavoring additives are used in the formula . Liqueurs require supervision because of the flavorings used in these products . In addition , the alcohol base may be wine derived .

However , the benefits of proper maintenance , using cooling tower microbial control , allow the cooler tower system to operate more efficiently and have a longer lifecycle . Make Delta your cooling tower manufacturer of choice today ! Cooling Towers Are Susceptible to Legionnaires ' Disease Cooling tower systems are a concern because they contain pools of warm water that are open to the atmosphere and present perfect breeding grounds for legionella bacteria , if they are not properly cleaned , disinfected , and maintained . Therefore , the responsibility of cooling tower legionella risk assessment belongs to the facility owners or manager . There are many risk factors that can lead to hazards and the presence of legionella bacteria . Below , we list our top six and identify the measures required for prevention . Top 6 Legionnaires ' Disease Risk Factors Risk : Make - up water usually comes from a municipal or well supply but can sometimes come from a holding tank , which can contain sludge , rust , and sediment . Less commonly used , surface water that comes from lakes , rivers , or reservoirs could be full of microorganisms and nutrients from the environment . Prevention : Twice a year , the cooling tower system should be cleaned and disinfected focusing on the entire tower and any holding tank by removing any rust , sludge , and sediment . If the water is coming from a lake , river , or reservoir , antimicrobial treatments should be used before the water enters the cooling system to prevent fouling . Risk : The temperature , environmental factors , and flow velocities of cooling tower water vary as well as other parameters affecting water treatment . Prevention : The industrial or HVAC system design allows for water to circulate throughout the system whenever it is operating . System operation should be coordinated with a full chemical treatment of the water . Also , keep the system clean by removing all dirt and debris . If the cooling tower needs to be shut down for more than three days , the entire system should be drained . For metal cooling tower systems , use extra caution to ensure the free flow of water to prevent the proliferation of microorganisms responsible for corrosion and degradation . This is one reason to consider HPDE engineered plastic cooling towers from Delta Cooling Towers , which come with a 50 - year life expectancy and a 20 - year warranty . So , you do n't need to worry about replacements . Disinfection Risk : Because cooling towers are open to the environment , the system can rapidly become recolonized with microorganisms , like cooling tower legionella , even after chemicals or other agents were added to achieve sterilization . Prevention : Vary the antimicrobial stresses applied in the cooling tower microbial control program by alternating between two non-oxidizing biocides as a single dose or alternate an oxidizing antimicrobial with a non-oxidizing antimicrobial . Biofilms Risk : Dirt , dust , and other particles enter the cooling tower water during the cooling tower process . Depending on where the cooling tower is located , the amount of material can be extensive . The presence of biofilms is important for cooling tower legionella survival and growth - providing nutrients in water systems . Prevention : It is strongly advised to use a compatible and environmentally acceptable dispersant and / or detergent to penetrate biofilm and sediments . Make sure to follow proper cleaning and maintenance for your cooling tower system to ensure top performance and to minimize the risk of Legionnaires ' disease . Design & Material Used Risk : Areas of stagnant water prevent proper chemical treatment of the towers and allow legionella and their hosts to flourish . Prevention : Your cooling tower system should be designed for easy cleaning and maintenance to avoid buildup of sludge and deposits . While cooling tower conditions are often dependent on the water treatment chemicals being used , poor piping designs can create an environment where pathogens , like legionella , can thrive . On the plus side , Delta Cooling Towers ' antimicrobial technology is designed to minimize the risk of cooling tower legionella . Spray Drifts Risk : Even under normal operation , water droplets can leave the drift eliminator . Prevention : It is for this reason that cooling tower systems should never be installed next to air intakes or windows that may be opened . Also , every six months or so , inspect the conditions of the drift eliminators making sure there are no gaps to allow free flow of dirt . For best results , install the best drift eliminators available with drift rates as low as 0.0005 % of the circulating water flow . There are many innovative technologies available that can help prevent the growth of cooling tower legionella . One of the most effective is an anti-microbial cooling tower from Delta Cooling Towers . It contains an anti-microbial resin that 's compounded into the plastic material , so it will not fade or wash away . Furthermore , this product has the only lab-tested anti-microbial efficacy against legionella bacteria out of all the common cooling tower materials .

The discoveries made that year heralded the beginnings of whole new industries and the founding of many new companies . One company , in particular , was founded in Brooklyn , New York , by Arthur B. Harrison . It would later come to be known as the Minwax Company . At the exact moment , Wilbur and Orville Wright were struggling to keep their new invention in the air over Kitty Hawk , NC , Arthur B. Harrison was at work in New York City testing his new waterproofing and damp-resistant materials to see if they would keep the air 's moisture out of homes and buildings . In 1904 , Arthur B. Harrison persuaded his employer at Clifford I. Miller Company , a plaster manufacturer , that a plant producing his materials could be a profitable venture . Mr. Miller agreed , though little realizing that someday Mr. Harrison 's enterprise would produce the Rolls - Royce of wood finishing products . In 1910 , Mr. Harrison purchased the Miller interests , and four years later he incorporated his business under the name Minwax\u00ae . Arthur B. Harrison manufactures his first line of waterproofing materials with the Clifford I. Miller Company . Arthur B. Harrison purchases business interests from his partner , Clifford I. Miller . Arthur B. Harrison Incorporates his business under the name of Minwax\u00ae . Minwax \u00ae develops a liquid , brush - on , paraffin formula to seal stone , which is later adapted for use on wood floors . Minwax \u00ae Wood Finish\u2122 formula is redesigned for homeowner use , becoming the first modern \" quick - drying \" product . Minwax \u00ae Wood Finish\u2122 is the leading brand of interior wood stains in the United States . By 1916 , the company had expanded and moved across the Hudson River to larger plant facilities in Clifton , NJ . Mr. Harrison was , by that time , the acknowledged expert in the field of waterproofing . In fact , membrane waterproofing , still in use today , was among his early innovations . In addition to general architectural and engineering projects , the Minwax Company was often asked to engineer waterproofing projects of significant historical importance . Cleopatra 's Needle , the Egyptian obelisk in Central Park , was thousands of years old when it arrived in New York . However , archaeologists soon realized the climatic change from the desert to North America was accelerating the deterioration of the monument . To help preserve it , the waterproofing techniques of the Minwax Company were called upon . At that point in time , stone structures were waterproofed by burning paraffin wax into the stone itself . Cleopatra 's Needle was too delicate for this . Burning paraffin would blacken the stone and destroy the hieroglyphic markings on it . To avoid this , Mr. Harrison developed a liquefied formula containing paraffin that would penetrate and seal the stone with a brush application . A wood scaffold was erected around the monument for the project . While brushing on the preparation , the workers noticed that drips and spills on the scaffolding beautified the wood . In fact , the scaffold looked like it had been treated to a paste wax finish , yet it was not slippery to walk on . The formula was refined and introduced to architects who began to specify it for wide use on floors and woodwork in public buildings and fine homes . In the late 1940s and early ' 50s , Minwax \u00ae moved into the consumer market . According to R. W. Harrison , Jr. , a grandson of Arthur B. Harrison who also served as President of Minwax \u00ae from 1962 - 1978 , this growth came with the realization we had a product the average person could use successfully . The product itself was redesigned and improved for homeowner use , and the wax in the finish was replaced by varnish gums , making the new Wood Finish \u2122 the first modern \" quick - drying \" product .

[ 1 ] Shortly thereafter , U.S. President Jimmy Carter ordered a complete embargo of Iranian oil ; stronger economic embargoes followed . On April 8 , 1980 , Carter severed diplomatic relations with Iran after negotiations for the hostages ' release failed . Later that month , Carter authorized a top-secret mission , named Operation Eagle Claw , to free the hostages . Helicopters were to carry Delta Force commandos from a carrier in the Persian Gulf to a point outside Tehran , where they were to spend the night and begin the rescue the next morning . The complicated mission , which involved refueling the helicopters at a spot in the Iranian desert labeled \" Desert One , \" was aborted April 25 after three of the eight helicopters suffered mechanical failure . Eight U.S. servicemen were killed when one of the helicopters collided with a refueling plane . The hostages were finally released just hours after Ronald Reagan 's presidential inauguration on Jan. 20 , 1981 . They had spent 444 days in captivity . May 1981 | Threats from Libya | | | When intelligence reports surfaced that Libyan leader Muammar el - Qaddafi had plans to assassinate American diplomats in Rome and Paris , President Reagan expelled all Libyan diplomats from the U.S. ( May 6 , 1981 ) and closed Libya 's diplomatic mission in Washington , D.C. Three months later , Reagan ordered U.S. Navy jets to shoot down Libyan fighters if they ventured inside what was known as the \" line of death . \" ( This was the line created by Qaddafi to demarcate Libya 's territorial waters , which he said extended more than 100 miles off the country 's shoreline ; the U.S. and other maritime nations recognized Libyan territorial waters as extending only 12 miles from shore . ) As expected , the Libyan Air Force counter - attacked and Navy jets shot down two SU - 22 warplanes about 60 miles off the Libyan coast . Some alleged that the U.S. exaggerated the terrorist threat from Libya , in part because Libya was an easy target . The small country -- Libya is about one - fifth the physical size of the U.S. , and its entire population at that time was only 3 million or so -- was and still is considered a minor player in the Middle East with no steadfast allies . U.S. officials denied Libya was used as a scapegoat , maintaining that it posed a credible terrorist threat against U.S. targets and that Libya had sufficient oil funds to mount a significant attack on U.S. interests . April 18 , 1983 | Bombing of U.S. Embassy in Beirut | | | A suicide bomber in a pickup truck loaded with explosives rammed into the U.S. Embassy in Beirut , Lebanon . Sixty - three people were killed , including 17 Americans , eight of whom were employees of the Central Intelligence Agency , including chief Middle East analyst Robert C. Ames and station chief Kenneth Haas . Reagan administration officials said that the attack was carried out by Hezbollah operatives , a Lebanese militant Islamic group whose anti-U.S. sentiments were sparked in part by the revolution in Iran . The Hezbollah operatives who carried out the attack on the embassy reportedly were receiving financial and logistical support from both Iran and Syria . [ For more on how and why Iran and Syria were helping to direct attacks on the U.S. , see FRONTLINE 's interviews with Robert Oakley and Robert C. McFarlane . ] The U.S. government took no military action in response to the embassy bombing , although , according to retired Marine Lt. Col. Bill Cowan , a covert military team entered Beirut in order to gather intelligence in preparation for retaliatory strikes . Oct. 23 , 1983 | Bombing of Marine barracks in Beirut | | | A suicide bomber detonated a truck full of explosives at a U.S. Marine barracks located at Beirut International Airport ; 241 U.S. Marines were killed and more than 100 others wounded . They were part of a contingent of 1,800 Marines that had been sent to Lebanon as part of a multinational force to help separate the warring Lebanese factions . ( Twice during the early 1980s the U.S. had deployed troops to Lebanon to deal with the fall - out from the 1982 Israeli invasion . In the first deployment , Marines helped oversee the peaceful withdrawal of the PLO from Beirut . In mid-September 1982 -- after the U.S. troops had left -- Israel 's Lebanese allies massacred an estimated 800 unarmed Palestinian civilians remaining in refugee camps . Following this , 1,800 Marines had been ordered back into Lebanon . ) In his September 2001 FRONTLINE interview , Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger said the U.S. still lacks \" actual knowledge of who did the bombing \" of the Marine barracks . But it suspected Hezbollah , believed to be supported in part by Iran and Syria . Hezbollah denied its involvement . The president assembled his national security team to devise a plan of military action . The planned target was the Sheik Abdullah barracks in Baalbek , Lebanon , which housed Iranian Revolutionary Guards believed to be training Hezbollah fighters . Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger aborted the mission , reportedly because of his concerns that it would harm U.S. relations with other Arab nations . Instead , President Reagan ordered the battleship USS New Jersey , stationed off the coast of Lebanon , to the hills near Beirut . The move was seen as largely ineffective . Four months after the Marine barracks bombing , U.S. Marines were ordered to start pulling out of Lebanon . Dec. 12 , 1983 | Bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait | | | The American embassy in Kuwait was bombed in a series of attacks whose targets also included the French embassy , the control tower at the airport , the country 's main oil refinery , and a residential area for employees of the American corporation Raytheon . Six people were killed , including a suicide truck bomber , and more than 80 others were injured . The suspects were thought to be members of Al Dawa , or \" The Call , \" an Iranian - backed group and one of the principal Shiite groups operating against Saddam Hussein in Iraq . The U.S. military took no action in retaliation . In Kuwait , 17 people were arrested and convicted for participating in the attacks . One of those convicted was Mustafa Youssef Badreddin , a cousin and brother - in - law of one of Hezbollah 's senior officers , Imad Mughniyah . After a six - week trial in Kuwait , Badreddin was sentenced to death for his role in the bombings . Over the following years , the arrest and imprisonment of the \" Kuwait 17 \" ( also known as the \" Al Dawa 17 \" ) , became one of the most consistent demands of the kidnappers of Western hostages in Lebanon and plane hijackers . Ironically , when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 , the Iraqis unwittingly released the imprisoned Badreddin and the remaining members of the Kuwait 17 . Press reports vary about Badreddin 's current whereabouts . March 16 , 1984 | CIA Station Chief William Buckley kidnapped | | | Buckley was the fourth person to be kidnapped by militant Islamic extremists in Lebanon . The first American hostage , American University of Beirut President David Dodge , had been kidnapped in July 1982 . Eventually , 30 Westerners would be kidnapped during the 10- year- long Lebanese hostage - taking crisis ( 1982 - 1992 ) . Americans who were kidnapped included journalist Terry Anderson , American University of Beirut librarian Peter Kilburn , and Benjamin Weir , a Presbyterian minister . While some of the prisoners lived through captivity -- Anderson spent the longest time as a hostage , 2,454 days -- some , including Buckley , died in captivity or were killed by their kidnappers . U.S. officials believed that the Iranian - backed Hezbollah was behind most of the kidnappings and the Reagan administration devised a covert plan . Iran was desperately running out of military supplies in its war with Iraq , but Congress had banned the sale of American arms to countries like Iran that sponsored terrorism . Reagan was advised that a bargain could be struck -- secret arms sales to Iran , hostages back to the U.S. The plan , when it was revealed to the public , was decried as a failure and anathema to the U.S. policy of refusing to negotiate with terrorists . In August 1985 , the first consignment of arms to Iran was sent -- 100 anti-tank missiles provided by Israel ; another 408 were sent the following month . As a result of the deal , American hostage Benjamin Weir was released from captivity ; he had been imprisoned for 495 days . Only two other hostages were released as a result of the arms- for-hostages deal : in July 1986 , Martin Jenco , a Catholic priest , was released ; and the administrator of the American University of Beirut 's medical school , David Jacobson , was released in November 1986 . Since the funds from the arms sales to Iran were secretly , and illegally , funneled to the U.S. - backed Contras fighting to overthrow the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua , the infamous episode became known as the \" Iran - Contra affair . \" ( See the \" Final Report of the Independent Counsel for Iran / Contra Matters . ) Sept. 20 , 1984 | Bombing of U.S. Embassy annex northeast of Beirut | | | In Aukar , northeast of Beirut , a truck bomb exploded outside the U.S. Embassy annex killing 24 people , two of whom were U.S. military personnel . According to the U.S. State Department 's 1999 report on terrorist organizations , elements of Hezbollah are \" known or suspected to have been involved \" in the bombing . The U.S. mounted no military response to the embassy annex bombing , but it did begin to explore covert operations in Lebanon . Investigative journalist Bob Woodward says that the CIA trained foreign intelligence agents to act as \" hit teams \" designed to destroy the terrorists ' operations . Ambassador Robert Oakley says the U.S. merely attempted to set up a \" protective unit , \" a Lebanese counterterrorist strike force . President Reagan and the CIA called off covert operations when Lebanese intelligence operatives -- some allegedly trained by the U.S. -- set off a car bomb on March 8 , 1985 , in an attempted murder of Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah , the Shiite Muslim cleric who some believed to be the spiritual leader of Hezbollah . Over 80 people were killed in the attack near a Beirut mosque . Fadlallah survived . Many blamed the CIA for the attack , saying it had directed the intelligence operatives to carry it out . Robert McFarlane , President Reagan 's national security adviser , says that the operatives who carried out the attack on Fadlallah may have been trained by the U.S. , but the individuals who carried it out were \" rogue operative [ s ] , \" and the CIA in no way sanctioned or supported the attack . Dec. 3 , 1984 | Hijacking of Kuwait Airways Flight 221 | | | Kuwait Airways Flight 221 , on its way from Kuwait to Pakistan , was hijacked and diverted to Tehran . The hijackers demanded the release of the Kuwait 17 . When the demand was n't met , the hijackers killed two American officials from the U.S. Agency for International Development . On the sixth day of the drama , Iranian security forces stormed the plane and released the remaining hostages . Iran arrested the hijackers , saying they would be brought to trail . But the trial never took place , and the hijackers were allowed to leave the country . There was no U.S. military response . The State Department announced a $ 250,000 reward for information leading to the arrests of those involved in the hijacking . Later press reports linked Hezbollah 's Imad Mughniyah to the hijackings . June 14 , 1985 | Hijacking of TWA Flight 847 | | | TWA Flight 847 was hijacked en route from Athens to Rome and forced to land in Beirut , Lebanon , where the hijackers held the plane for 17 days . They demanded the release of the Kuwait 17 as well as the release of 700 fellow Shiite Muslim prisoners held in Israeli prisons and in prisons in southern Lebanon run by the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army . When these demands were n't met , hostage Robert Dean Stethem , a U.S. Navy diver , was shot and his body dumped on the airport tarmac . U.S. sources implicated Hezbollah . In what was widely perceived as an implicit , never explicit , quid pro quo , the hostages started being released by the hijackers , followed some days after by Israel starting to free some of its hundreds of Shiite prisoners . At the time , U.S. officials denied there was a deal and said Israel had already committed to releasing the prisoners . Imad Mughniyah , a senior officer with Hezbollah , was secretly indicted for the TWA hijacking in 1987 , along with three others . One of those indicted , Mohammed Ali Hamadei , was arrested in Frankfurt , Germany . In 1989 he was convicted in a German court and sentenced to life in prison . [ Editor 's Note : Imad Mugniyah remained at large and on the FBI 's Most Wanted List for 19 years , until he was killed in a car bombing in Damascus , Syria on Feb. 12 , 2008 . ] October 1985 - January 1986 | Hijacking of cruise ship Achille Lauro ; | Bombing of Rome , Vienna airports | | On Oct. 7 , 1985 , off the coast of Egypt , four gunmen hijacked the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro and demanded the release of Palestinian prisoners in Egypt , Italy , and elsewhere . When the demands were n't met , they killed Leon Klinghoffer , a 69 - year - old disabled American tourist . Investigators blamed the Palestine Liberation Front , which some believed to be allied with Yasser Arafat 's Palestinian Liberation Organization . Later , U.S. officials were able to link Libya to the PLF and the hijacking . After the hijackers escaped the Achille Lauro and left Egypt by air , U.S. Navy fighters intercepted their plane and forced it down in Italy . The four hijackers were apprehended , and in 1986 , they were found guilty in an Italian court . Two of the hijackers escaped from prison . One , Magid al - Molgi , who confessed to killing Mr. Klinghoffer , was caught and returned to prison . The man identified as the mastermind of the hijacking , Abu Abbas , was released by Italy despite Washington 's pleas that he be held for trial . Then on Dec. 17 , 1985 , airports in Rome and Vienna were bombed , killing 20 people , five of whom were Americans . This time , U.S. officials said they were able to link Libya to the bombing attacks . In January , U.S. officials decided to send the Navy and its warplanes to patrol the Gulf of Sidra -- in territorial waters claimed by Libya -- in an effort to provoke Qaddafi . The White House warned Qaddafi that any Libyan forces further than 12 miles from shore were subject to attack . ( The U.S. and other nations used an international standard , set at only 12 miles from Libya 's coast , to mark the country 's territorial waters ; Qaddafi said that Libya 's territorial waters extended more than 100 miles from the coastline . ) At this point , the face - off between the U.S. and Libya escalated . April 5 , 1986 | Bombing of La Belle Discotheque | | | An American soldier was killed when a bomb was detonated at La Belle , a discotheque in West Berlin known to be popular with off - duty U.S. servicemen . A Turkish woman was killed , and nearly 200 others were wounded . U.S. intelligence sources identified Libya as being responsible for the attack . [ For more on the evidence pointing to Libya , see interviews with Paul Bremer , Caspar Weinberger , and Robert Oakley . ] In Berlin , five individuals were tried for carrying out the bombing of the discotheque . In November 2001 , four of the defendants were convicted and sentenced , while the fifth was acquitted . The court found only Verena Chanaa guilty of murder ; she was sentenced to 14 years . Prosecutors said Chanaa , a 42 - year - old German national , brought the bomb into the disco in a handbag . Three other defendants were all convicted of multiple counts of attempted murder . Yasir Shraydi , a Palestinian who was said to have assembled the bomb , was sentenced to 14 years , while Musbah Eter , a Libyan diplomat , and Verena Chanaa 's former husband , Palestinian Ali Chanaa , were sentenced to 12 years apiece . Verena Chanaa 's sister , 36 - year - old Andrea Haeusler , was acquitted . She had accompanied Verena Chanaa to the disco on the night of the bombing . After U.S. intelligence intercepted Libyan government communications implicating Libya in the La Belle disco attack , President Reagan ordered retaliatory air strikes on Tripoli and Benghazi . The operation on April 15 , 1986 , dubbed Operation El Dorado Canyon , involved 200 aircraft and over 60 tons of bombs . One of the residences of Libyan leader Muammar el - Qadaffi was hit in the attack , which , according to Libyan estimates , killed 37 people and injured 93 others . As a result of this American operation , U.S. national security officials say Libyan-sponsored terrorism ceased \" for a long time . \" ( See interviews with Robert Oakley and L.Paul Bremer . ) Two days after the U.S. retaliatory attack , the bodies of three American University of Beirut employees -- American Peter Kilburn and Britons John Douglas and Philip Padfield -- were discovered near Beirut shot to death . The Arab Revolutionary Cells , a pro-Libyan group of Palestinians affiliated with terrorist Abu Nidal , claimed to have executed the three men in retaliation for Operation El Dorado Canyon . December 21 , 1988 | Bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 | | | Pan Am Flight 103 from London to New York exploded over the small town of Lockerbie , Scotland . All 259 people on board were killed , along with 11 on the ground . According to the State Department 's \" Patterns of Global Terrorism , 1991 , \" released in April 1992 , the bombing of Pan Am 103 \" was an action authorized by the Libyan Government . \" Though there were reports that Syria and Iran also played significant roles in the attack , U.S. officials were never able to tie the two countries to the bombing . No one has ever taken credit for planting the bomb . In May 2000 the trial of the two Libyan intelligence officers charged with planting the bomb started in the Netherlands . It ended in February 2001 with the conviction of defendant Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al - Megrahi ; he received a life sentence .

[ 1 ] Shortly thereafter , U.S. President Jimmy Carter ordered a complete embargo of Iranian oil ; stronger economic embargoes followed . On April 8 , 1980 , Carter severed diplomatic relations with Iran after negotiations for the hostages ' release failed . Later that month , Carter authorized a top-secret mission , named Operation Eagle Claw , to free the hostages . Helicopters were to carry Delta Force commandos from a carrier in the Persian Gulf to a point outside Tehran , where they were to spend the night and begin the rescue the next morning . The complicated mission , which involved refueling the helicopters at a spot in the Iranian desert labeled \" Desert One , \" was aborted April 25 after three of the eight helicopters suffered mechanical failure . Eight U.S. servicemen were killed when one of the helicopters collided with a refueling plane . The hostages were finally released just hours after Ronald Reagan 's presidential inauguration on Jan. 20 , 1981 . They had spent 444 days in captivity . May 1981 | Threats from Libya | | | When intelligence reports surfaced that Libyan leader Muammar el - Qaddafi had plans to assassinate American diplomats in Rome and Paris , President Reagan expelled all Libyan diplomats from the U.S. ( May 6 , 1981 ) and closed Libya 's diplomatic mission in Washington , D.C. Three months later , Reagan ordered U.S. Navy jets to shoot down Libyan fighters if they ventured inside what was known as the \" line of death . \" ( This was the line created by Qaddafi to demarcate Libya 's territorial waters , which he said extended more than 100 miles off the country 's shoreline ; the U.S. and other maritime nations recognized Libyan territorial waters as extending only 12 miles from shore . ) As expected , the Libyan Air Force counter - attacked and Navy jets shot down two SU - 22 warplanes about 60 miles off the Libyan coast . Some alleged that the U.S. exaggerated the terrorist threat from Libya , in part because Libya was an easy target . The small country -- Libya is about one - fifth the physical size of the U.S. , and its entire population at that time was only 3 million or so -- was and still is considered a minor player in the Middle East with no steadfast allies . U.S. officials denied Libya was used as a scapegoat , maintaining that it posed a credible terrorist threat against U.S. targets and that Libya had sufficient oil funds to mount a significant attack on U.S. interests . April 18 , 1983 | Bombing of U.S. Embassy in Beirut | | | A suicide bomber in a pickup truck loaded with explosives rammed into the U.S. Embassy in Beirut , Lebanon . Sixty - three people were killed , including 17 Americans , eight of whom were employees of the Central Intelligence Agency , including chief Middle East analyst Robert C. Ames and station chief Kenneth Haas . Reagan administration officials said that the attack was carried out by Hezbollah operatives , a Lebanese militant Islamic group whose anti-U.S. sentiments were sparked in part by the revolution in Iran . The Hezbollah operatives who carried out the attack on the embassy reportedly were receiving financial and logistical support from both Iran and Syria . [ For more on how and why Iran and Syria were helping to direct attacks on the U.S. , see FRONTLINE 's interviews with Robert Oakley and Robert C. McFarlane . ] The U.S. government took no military action in response to the embassy bombing , although , according to retired Marine Lt. Col. Bill Cowan , a covert military team entered Beirut in order to gather intelligence in preparation for retaliatory strikes . Oct. 23 , 1983 | Bombing of Marine barracks in Beirut | | | A suicide bomber detonated a truck full of explosives at a U.S. Marine barracks located at Beirut International Airport ; 241 U.S. Marines were killed and more than 100 others wounded . They were part of a contingent of 1,800 Marines that had been sent to Lebanon as part of a multinational force to help separate the warring Lebanese factions . ( Twice during the early 1980s the U.S. had deployed troops to Lebanon to deal with the fall - out from the 1982 Israeli invasion . In the first deployment , Marines helped oversee the peaceful withdrawal of the PLO from Beirut . In mid-September 1982 -- after the U.S. troops had left -- Israel 's Lebanese allies massacred an estimated 800 unarmed Palestinian civilians remaining in refugee camps . Following this , 1,800 Marines had been ordered back into Lebanon . ) In his September 2001 FRONTLINE interview , Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger said the U.S. still lacks \" actual knowledge of who did the bombing \" of the Marine barracks . But it suspected Hezbollah , believed to be supported in part by Iran and Syria . Hezbollah denied its involvement . The president assembled his national security team to devise a plan of military action . The planned target was the Sheik Abdullah barracks in Baalbek , Lebanon , which housed Iranian Revolutionary Guards believed to be training Hezbollah fighters . Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger aborted the mission , reportedly because of his concerns that it would harm U.S. relations with other Arab nations . Instead , President Reagan ordered the battleship USS New Jersey , stationed off the coast of Lebanon , to the hills near Beirut . The move was seen as largely ineffective . Four months after the Marine barracks bombing , U.S. Marines were ordered to start pulling out of Lebanon . Dec. 12 , 1983 | Bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait | | | The American embassy in Kuwait was bombed in a series of attacks whose targets also included the French embassy , the control tower at the airport , the country 's main oil refinery , and a residential area for employees of the American corporation Raytheon . Six people were killed , including a suicide truck bomber , and more than 80 others were injured . The suspects were thought to be members of Al Dawa , or \" The Call , \" an Iranian - backed group and one of the principal Shiite groups operating against Saddam Hussein in Iraq . The U.S. military took no action in retaliation . In Kuwait , 17 people were arrested and convicted for participating in the attacks . One of those convicted was Mustafa Youssef Badreddin , a cousin and brother - in - law of one of Hezbollah 's senior officers , Imad Mughniyah . After a six - week trial in Kuwait , Badreddin was sentenced to death for his role in the bombings . Over the following years , the arrest and imprisonment of the \" Kuwait 17 \" ( also known as the \" Al Dawa 17 \" ) , became one of the most consistent demands of the kidnappers of Western hostages in Lebanon and plane hijackers . Ironically , when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 , the Iraqis unwittingly released the imprisoned Badreddin and the remaining members of the Kuwait 17 . Press reports vary about Badreddin 's current whereabouts . March 16 , 1984 | CIA Station Chief William Buckley kidnapped | | | Buckley was the fourth person to be kidnapped by militant Islamic extremists in Lebanon . The first American hostage , American University of Beirut President David Dodge , had been kidnapped in July 1982 . Eventually , 30 Westerners would be kidnapped during the 10- year- long Lebanese hostage - taking crisis ( 1982 - 1992 ) . Americans who were kidnapped included journalist Terry Anderson , American University of Beirut librarian Peter Kilburn , and Benjamin Weir , a Presbyterian minister . While some of the prisoners lived through captivity -- Anderson spent the longest time as a hostage , 2,454 days -- some , including Buckley , died in captivity or were killed by their kidnappers . U.S. officials believed that the Iranian - backed Hezbollah was behind most of the kidnappings and the Reagan administration devised a covert plan . Iran was desperately running out of military supplies in its war with Iraq , but Congress had banned the sale of American arms to countries like Iran that sponsored terrorism . Reagan was advised that a bargain could be struck -- secret arms sales to Iran , hostages back to the U.S. The plan , when it was revealed to the public , was decried as a failure and anathema to the U.S. policy of refusing to negotiate with terrorists . In August 1985 , the first consignment of arms to Iran was sent -- 100 anti-tank missiles provided by Israel ; another 408 were sent the following month . As a result of the deal , American hostage Benjamin Weir was released from captivity ; he had been imprisoned for 495 days . Only two other hostages were released as a result of the arms- for-hostages deal : in July 1986 , Martin Jenco , a Catholic priest , was released ; and the administrator of the American University of Beirut 's medical school , David Jacobson , was released in November 1986 . Since the funds from the arms sales to Iran were secretly , and illegally , funneled to the U.S. - backed Contras fighting to overthrow the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua , the infamous episode became known as the \" Iran - Contra affair . \" ( See the \" Final Report of the Independent Counsel for Iran / Contra Matters . ) Sept. 20 , 1984 | Bombing of U.S. Embassy annex northeast of Beirut | | | In Aukar , northeast of Beirut , a truck bomb exploded outside the U.S. Embassy annex killing 24 people , two of whom were U.S. military personnel . According to the U.S. State Department 's 1999 report on terrorist organizations , elements of Hezbollah are \" known or suspected to have been involved \" in the bombing . The U.S. mounted no military response to the embassy annex bombing , but it did begin to explore covert operations in Lebanon . Investigative journalist Bob Woodward says that the CIA trained foreign intelligence agents to act as \" hit teams \" designed to destroy the terrorists ' operations . Ambassador Robert Oakley says the U.S. merely attempted to set up a \" protective unit , \" a Lebanese counterterrorist strike force . President Reagan and the CIA called off covert operations when Lebanese intelligence operatives -- some allegedly trained by the U.S. -- set off a car bomb on March 8 , 1985 , in an attempted murder of Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah , the Shiite Muslim cleric who some believed to be the spiritual leader of Hezbollah . Over 80 people were killed in the attack near a Beirut mosque . Fadlallah survived . Many blamed the CIA for the attack , saying it had directed the intelligence operatives to carry it out . Robert McFarlane , President Reagan 's national security adviser , says that the operatives who carried out the attack on Fadlallah may have been trained by the U.S. , but the individuals who carried it out were \" rogue operative [ s ] , \" and the CIA in no way sanctioned or supported the attack . Dec. 3 , 1984 | Hijacking of Kuwait Airways Flight 221 | | | Kuwait Airways Flight 221 , on its way from Kuwait to Pakistan , was hijacked and diverted to Tehran . The hijackers demanded the release of the Kuwait 17 . When the demand was n't met , the hijackers killed two American officials from the U.S. Agency for International Development . On the sixth day of the drama , Iranian security forces stormed the plane and released the remaining hostages . Iran arrested the hijackers , saying they would be brought to trail . But the trial never took place , and the hijackers were allowed to leave the country . There was no U.S. military response . The State Department announced a $ 250,000 reward for information leading to the arrests of those involved in the hijacking . Later press reports linked Hezbollah 's Imad Mughniyah to the hijackings . June 14 , 1985 | Hijacking of TWA Flight 847 | | | TWA Flight 847 was hijacked en route from Athens to Rome and forced to land in Beirut , Lebanon , where the hijackers held the plane for 17 days . They demanded the release of the Kuwait 17 as well as the release of 700 fellow Shiite Muslim prisoners held in Israeli prisons and in prisons in southern Lebanon run by the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army . When these demands were n't met , hostage Robert Dean Stethem , a U.S. Navy diver , was shot and his body dumped on the airport tarmac . U.S. sources implicated Hezbollah . In what was widely perceived as an implicit , never explicit , quid pro quo , the hostages started being released by the hijackers , followed some days after by Israel starting to free some of its hundreds of Shiite prisoners . At the time , U.S. officials denied there was a deal and said Israel had already committed to releasing the prisoners . Imad Mughniyah , a senior officer with Hezbollah , was secretly indicted for the TWA hijacking in 1987 , along with three others . One of those indicted , Mohammed Ali Hamadei , was arrested in Frankfurt , Germany . In 1989 he was convicted in a German court and sentenced to life in prison . [ Editor 's Note : Imad Mugniyah remained at large and on the FBI 's Most Wanted List for 19 years , until he was killed in a car bombing in Damascus , Syria on Feb. 12 , 2008 . ] October 1985 - January 1986 | Hijacking of cruise ship Achille Lauro ; | Bombing of Rome , Vienna airports | | On Oct. 7 , 1985 , off the coast of Egypt , four gunmen hijacked the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro and demanded the release of Palestinian prisoners in Egypt , Italy , and elsewhere . When the demands were n't met , they killed Leon Klinghoffer , a 69 - year - old disabled American tourist . Investigators blamed the Palestine Liberation Front , which some believed to be allied with Yasser Arafat 's Palestinian Liberation Organization . Later , U.S. officials were able to link Libya to the PLF and the hijacking . After the hijackers escaped the Achille Lauro and left Egypt by air , U.S. Navy fighters intercepted their plane and forced it down in Italy . The four hijackers were apprehended , and in 1986 , they were found guilty in an Italian court . Two of the hijackers escaped from prison . One , Magid al - Molgi , who confessed to killing Mr. Klinghoffer , was caught and returned to prison . The man identified as the mastermind of the hijacking , Abu Abbas , was released by Italy despite Washington 's pleas that he be held for trial . Then on Dec. 17 , 1985 , airports in Rome and Vienna were bombed , killing 20 people , five of whom were Americans . This time , U.S. officials said they were able to link Libya to the bombing attacks . In January , U.S. officials decided to send the Navy and its warplanes to patrol the Gulf of Sidra -- in territorial waters claimed by Libya -- in an effort to provoke Qaddafi . The White House warned Qaddafi that any Libyan forces further than 12 miles from shore were subject to attack . ( The U.S. and other nations used an international standard , set at only 12 miles from Libya 's coast , to mark the country 's territorial waters ; Qaddafi said that Libya 's territorial waters extended more than 100 miles from the coastline . ) At this point , the face - off between the U.S. and Libya escalated . April 5 , 1986 | Bombing of La Belle Discotheque | | | An American soldier was killed when a bomb was detonated at La Belle , a discotheque in West Berlin known to be popular with off - duty U.S. servicemen . A Turkish woman was killed , and nearly 200 others were wounded . U.S. intelligence sources identified Libya as being responsible for the attack . [ For more on the evidence pointing to Libya , see interviews with Paul Bremer , Caspar Weinberger , and Robert Oakley . ] In Berlin , five individuals were tried for carrying out the bombing of the discotheque . In November 2001 , four of the defendants were convicted and sentenced , while the fifth was acquitted . The court found only Verena Chanaa guilty of murder ; she was sentenced to 14 years . Prosecutors said Chanaa , a 42 - year - old German national , brought the bomb into the disco in a handbag . Three other defendants were all convicted of multiple counts of attempted murder . Yasir Shraydi , a Palestinian who was said to have assembled the bomb , was sentenced to 14 years , while Musbah Eter , a Libyan diplomat , and Verena Chanaa 's former husband , Palestinian Ali Chanaa , were sentenced to 12 years apiece . Verena Chanaa 's sister , 36 - year - old Andrea Haeusler , was acquitted . She had accompanied Verena Chanaa to the disco on the night of the bombing . After U.S. intelligence intercepted Libyan government communications implicating Libya in the La Belle disco attack , President Reagan ordered retaliatory air strikes on Tripoli and Benghazi . The operation on April 15 , 1986 , dubbed Operation El Dorado Canyon , involved 200 aircraft and over 60 tons of bombs . One of the residences of Libyan leader Muammar el - Qadaffi was hit in the attack , which , according to Libyan estimates , killed 37 people and injured 93 others . As a result of this American operation , U.S. national security officials say Libyan-sponsored terrorism ceased \" for a long time . \" ( See interviews with Robert Oakley and L.Paul Bremer . ) Two days after the U.S. retaliatory attack , the bodies of three American University of Beirut employees -- American Peter Kilburn and Britons John Douglas and Philip Padfield -- were discovered near Beirut shot to death . The Arab Revolutionary Cells , a pro-Libyan group of Palestinians affiliated with terrorist Abu Nidal , claimed to have executed the three men in retaliation for Operation El Dorado Canyon . December 21 , 1988 | Bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 | | | Pan Am Flight 103 from London to New York exploded over the small town of Lockerbie , Scotland . All 259 people on board were killed , along with 11 on the ground . According to the State Department 's \" Patterns of Global Terrorism , 1991 , \" released in April 1992 , the bombing of Pan Am 103 \" was an action authorized by the Libyan Government . \" Though there were reports that Syria and Iran also played significant roles in the attack , U.S. officials were never able to tie the two countries to the bombing . No one has ever taken credit for planting the bomb . In May 2000 the trial of the two Libyan intelligence officers charged with planting the bomb started in the Netherlands . It ended in February 2001 with the conviction of defendant Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al - Megrahi ; he received a life sentence . The other defendant , Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah , was acquitted and set free .

To some on the European ( and American ) Left , the President of Venezuela is a hero for his redistribution of wealth and truculent stance toward the U.S. under George W. Bush , whom he famously called the Devil . To others , his socialist agenda is tainted by human-rights violations and suppression of the opposition press . So if Ch\u00e1vez wanted to see the film at its world premiere , he 'd have to fly here on his own bol\u00edvar . The Sept. 8 evening public screening in the festival 's Sala Grande for which there was less visible security than for an inner-city high school began about 25 minutes late . The delay simply amped up the suspense : Would Ch\u00e1vez show ? He did , with Stone , both wearing dark jackets , white shirts and red ties . As is customary for the evening screenings , the festival 's female announcer slowly read off the names of a half - dozen members of the movie 's production team , standing in front of their seats in the front mezzanine . Polite applause for each . She got to Stone : hearty cheers for the writer -director of Platoon , Born on the Fourth of July and JFK . Then the announcer stopped . Ch\u00e1vez would not be officially introduced to the audience . So the director grabbed the President 's hand and raised it above their heads in a victory grip . No boos or rude cries greeted the gesture . Only : Ovation ! Ol\u00e9 ! ( See TIME 's top 100 movies . ) The 70 - minute movie which was co-written by the British - Pakistani commentator Tariq Ali , author of the 2006 study Pirates of the Caribbean : Axis of Hope , and photographed in part by docu-doyen Albert Maysles is amateur night as cinema , as lopsided and cheerleadery as its worldview . U.S. foreign policy , Stone asserts , divides South American nations into \" friends , whose leaders do what we tell them to do , and enemies , whose leaders occasionally disagree with us . \" His film is no more nuanced . He sees the geopolitical glass as all empty ( the U.S. and its world - banking arm , the International Monetary Fund ) or all full ( Ch\u00e1vez and his comrade Presidentes in South America ) . But there 's an undeniable fascination in the project , even some inspirational value , in Stone 's conversations with a half - dozen leaders of nations struggling to emerge from under the shadow or boot of the U.S. ( Read Mary Corliss ' review of Michael Moore 's new movie Capitalism : A Love Story . ) Stone extends his rigorous dichotomy to the film 's structure . The first half focuses on Ch\u00e1vez , the second on other South American heads of state who tilt to the port side : Brazil 's Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva , Paraguay 's Fernando Lugo , Ecuador 's Rafael Correa , Argentina 's Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner , Bolivia 's Evo Morales and the grand old man of social revolution , Ra\u00fal Castro . ( Stone profiled Ra\u00fal 's brother in a similarly indulgent 2003 poli-doc , Commandante . ) The only missing socialist leader is Daniel Ortega , President of Nicaragua a regime whose electoral council outlawed the two main opposition groups from participating in the 2008 election and barred outside observers from monitoring the vote , which was widely criticized as rigged . The film 's first section briefly synopsizes Ch\u00e1vez 's life from his mud - hut birth in Sabaneta to his rise through the Venezuelan military , to his abortive coup attempt in 1992 and his election seven years later to lead the world 's third - largest oil provider increasing the standard of living for many of his country 's poor while denying many rights to those , especially in the media , who would oppose him . In the movie 's rose - colored lens , the President comes across as an outsize personality , equal parts machismo and charisma . He sounds more sensible than menacing when he says of his government , \" This is a revolution , peaceful but armed . \" Standing near a corn-processing factory , he jokes , \" This is where we build the Iranian atomic bomb . A corn bomb . \" Every step of the way , Stone is by , and on , on the President 's side . He raises no tough issues , some of which are summarized in Amnesty International 's 2009 report on Venezuela : \" Attacks on journalists were widespread . Human-rights defenders continued to suffer harassment . Prison conditions provoked hunger strikes in facilities across the country . \" Referring to the 2006 election in which Ch\u00e1vez won a third term , Stone tells viewers that \" 90 % of the media was opposed to him , \" and yet he prevailed . \" There is a lesson to be learned , \" Stone says . Yes : support the man in power , or your newspaper , radio station or TV network may be in jeopardy . The movie 's second half has more appeal to a general audience , perhaps because most of the other Presidents are less famous or notorious than Ch\u00e1vez , perhaps because the first half has conditioned us to a rigorously genial treatment of them . Lula da Silva brags that Brazil paid off the IMF debt and that the country now has a $ 260 billion surplus . ( Irmao , can you spare us a dime ? ) Morales , the first indigenous President of Bolivia , says he considers himself \" less a President than a union leader . \" The Illinois-educated Correa says smilingly that the U.S. can again have a military base in Ecuador \" if Ecuador can have a military base in Miami . \" Ra\u00fal Castro , survivor of a half - century of American disapproval , toasts his younger compadres : \" Now we 're ready for another 50 years . \" As big an international celebrity as any of his subjects , Stone is ever willing to interrupt an interview for some schmoozing or fun . He kicks a football around with Ch\u00e1vez , shares coca leaves with Morales , quizzes Kirchner on how many pairs of shoes she owns . ( A little annoyed at the implicit comparison to Imelda Marcos , Kirchner replies , \" If I were a man , would you ask me how many pairs of pants I own ? \" ) Accompanying Ch\u00e1vez to the mud hut where he was born , Stone directs the President in a scene : ride around the yard on the bicycle you had as a kid . Ch\u00e1vez mounts the tiny bike and takes a few pedals . Instantly it breaks from his weight , and Ch\u00e1vez dissolves in laughter . South of the Border is a near sibling to the Michael Moore docu - comedy Capitalism : A Love Story , which premiered at Venice last night and which looks like a masterpiece of attitudinal moviemaking next to Stone 's slapdash effort . Moore appears in a news clip from 2007 , lecturing Wolf Blitzer on what the filmmaker saw as CNN 's gutless coverage of the U.S. Iraq invasion . Moore and Stone share the notions that capitalism can be predatory and that priests , in the U.S. and Paraguay ( where the President is a former Catholic bishop ) , are all liberation theologians . And in both films , Barack Obama 's election is heralded as triggering an era of enlightenment . \" I hope he will be a new Roosevelt , \" Ch\u00e1vez says at the end of the film , \" and I hope he starts a new New Deal . \" As the final credits rolled and the house lights came up , the director and his star received the crowd 's vocal warmth . Ch\u00e1vez went to the bleachers to greet a few people , then descended the steps to the orchestra area . Someone asked him a question , and he spoke for five minutes or more in Spanish , in a conversational voice that not many could hear .

To some on the European ( and American ) Left , the President of Venezuela is a hero for his redistribution of wealth and truculent stance toward the U.S. under George W. Bush , whom he famously called the Devil . To others , his socialist agenda is tainted by human-rights violations and suppression of the opposition press . So if Ch\u00e1vez wanted to see the film at its world premiere , he 'd have to fly here on his own bol\u00edvar . The Sept. 8 evening public screening in the festival 's Sala Grande for which there was less visible security than for an inner-city high school began about 25 minutes late . The delay simply amped up the suspense : Would Ch\u00e1vez show ? He did , with Stone , both wearing dark jackets , white shirts and red ties . As is customary for the evening screenings , the festival 's female announcer slowly read off the names of a half - dozen members of the movie 's production team , standing in front of their seats in the front mezzanine . Polite applause for each . She got to Stone : hearty cheers for the writer -director of Platoon , Born on the Fourth of July and JFK . Then the announcer stopped . Ch\u00e1vez would not be officially introduced to the audience . So the director grabbed the President 's hand and raised it above their heads in a victory grip . No boos or rude cries greeted the gesture . Only : Ovation ! Ol\u00e9 ! ( See TIME 's top 100 movies . ) The 70 - minute movie which was co-written by the British - Pakistani commentator Tariq Ali , author of the 2006 study Pirates of the Caribbean : Axis of Hope , and photographed in part by docu-doyen Albert Maysles is amateur night as cinema , as lopsided and cheerleadery as its worldview . U.S. foreign policy , Stone asserts , divides South American nations into \" friends , whose leaders do what we tell them to do , and enemies , whose leaders occasionally disagree with us . \" His film is no more nuanced . He sees the geopolitical glass as all empty ( the U.S. and its world - banking arm , the International Monetary Fund ) or all full ( Ch\u00e1vez and his comrade Presidentes in South America ) . But there 's an undeniable fascination in the project , even some inspirational value , in Stone 's conversations with a half - dozen leaders of nations struggling to emerge from under the shadow or boot of the U.S. ( Read Mary Corliss ' review of Michael Moore 's new movie Capitalism : A Love Story . ) Stone extends his rigorous dichotomy to the film 's structure . The first half focuses on Ch\u00e1vez , the second on other South American heads of state who tilt to the port side : Brazil 's Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva , Paraguay 's Fernando Lugo , Ecuador 's Rafael Correa , Argentina 's Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner , Bolivia 's Evo Morales and the grand old man of social revolution , Ra\u00fal Castro . ( Stone profiled Ra\u00fal 's brother in a similarly indulgent 2003 poli-doc , Commandante . ) The only missing socialist leader is Daniel Ortega , President of Nicaragua a regime whose electoral council outlawed the two main opposition groups from participating in the 2008 election and barred outside observers from monitoring the vote , which was widely criticized as rigged . The film 's first section briefly synopsizes Ch\u00e1vez 's life from his mud - hut birth in Sabaneta to his rise through the Venezuelan military , to his abortive coup attempt in 1992 and his election seven years later to lead the world 's third - largest oil provider increasing the standard of living for many of his country 's poor while denying many rights to those , especially in the media , who would oppose him . In the movie 's rose - colored lens , the President comes across as an outsize personality , equal parts machismo and charisma . He sounds more sensible than menacing when he says of his government , \" This is a revolution , peaceful but armed . \" Standing near a corn-processing factory , he jokes , \" This is where we build the Iranian atomic bomb . A corn bomb . \" Every step of the way , Stone is by , and on , on the President 's side . He raises no tough issues , some of which are summarized in Amnesty International 's 2009 report on Venezuela : \" Attacks on journalists were widespread . Human-rights defenders continued to suffer harassment . Prison conditions provoked hunger strikes in facilities across the country . \" Referring to the 2006 election in which Ch\u00e1vez won a third term , Stone tells viewers that \" 90 % of the media was opposed to him , \" and yet he prevailed . \" There is a lesson to be learned , \" Stone says . Yes : support the man in power , or your newspaper , radio station or TV network may be in jeopardy . The movie 's second half has more appeal to a general audience , perhaps because most of the other Presidents are less famous or notorious than Ch\u00e1vez , perhaps because the first half has conditioned us to a rigorously genial treatment of them . Lula da Silva brags that Brazil paid off the IMF debt and that the country now has a $ 260 billion surplus . ( Irmao , can you spare us a dime ? ) Morales , the first indigenous President of Bolivia , says he considers himself \" less a President than a union leader . \" The Illinois-educated Correa says smilingly that the U.S. can again have a military base in Ecuador \" if Ecuador can have a military base in Miami . \" Ra\u00fal Castro , survivor of a half - century of American disapproval , toasts his younger compadres : \" Now we 're ready for another 50 years . \" As big an international celebrity as any of his subjects , Stone is ever willing to interrupt an interview for some schmoozing or fun . He kicks a football around with Ch\u00e1vez , shares coca leaves with Morales , quizzes Kirchner on how many pairs of shoes she owns . ( A little annoyed at the implicit comparison to Imelda Marcos , Kirchner replies , \" If I were a man , would you ask me how many pairs of pants I own ? \" ) Accompanying Ch\u00e1vez to the mud hut where he was born , Stone directs the President in a scene : ride around the yard on the bicycle you had as a kid . Ch\u00e1vez mounts the tiny bike and takes a few pedals . Instantly it breaks from his weight , and Ch\u00e1vez dissolves in laughter . South of the Border is a near sibling to the Michael Moore docu - comedy Capitalism : A Love Story , which premiered at Venice last night and which looks like a masterpiece of attitudinal moviemaking next to Stone 's slapdash effort . Moore appears in a news clip from 2007 , lecturing Wolf Blitzer on what the filmmaker saw as CNN 's gutless coverage of the U.S. Iraq invasion . Moore and Stone share the notions that capitalism can be predatory and that priests , in the U.S. and Paraguay ( where the President is a former Catholic bishop ) , are all liberation theologians . And in both films , Barack Obama 's election is heralded as triggering an era of enlightenment . \" I hope he will be a new Roosevelt , \" Ch\u00e1vez says at the end of the film , \" and I hope he starts a new New Deal . \" As the final credits rolled and the house lights came up , the director and his star received the crowd 's vocal warmth . Ch\u00e1vez went to the bleachers to greet a few people , then descended the steps to the orchestra area . Someone asked him a question , and he spoke for five minutes or more in Spanish , in a conversational voice that not many could hear . Stone , slightly behind , seemed to wonder , Hey , whose movie is this ? and joined Ch\u00e1vez as he shouted , \" Viva Oliver ! \" He made it sound almost like \" Bol\u00edvar ! \" A small retinue of guards led them down the steps to the lobby , and on the way out , Ch\u00e1vez smiled and shook a few more hands . Quite a powerful grip , Mary Corliss told me . But then , he is Venezuela 's strongman .

Access Copyright then counter - sued for $ 50 million , arguing that Canadian schools make more than 150 million photocopies of copyrighted material each year that require payment .

While technically it 's impossible for any company to host \u201c unlimited \u201d websites ( more about this later ) , no-limit hosting plans are very popular \u2013 mainly because it reduces the cost of hosting multiple sites significantly . With A2 Hosting you get a choice of either hosting one or multiple websites in three unlimited hosting plans \u2013 Drive , Turbo Boost , and Turbo Max . A2's Turbo plans step up the game a little bit and open access to their Turbo option which lays claim to perform up to 20x faster . All A2 Hosting plans include a bunch of freebies ranging from easy site migration and free SSL setup to some other free applications that are quite useful such as A2 Optimized plugin for Word Press and Presta Shop . Pros : Cons : Green Geeks offers more than just unlimited storage and bandwidth , but also Bonneville Environmental Foundation ( BEF ) certified green hosting . They are very affordable \u2013 Lite plan signup at just $ 2.49 / mo and performed well in our server speed test . Pros : Cons : TMDHosting is not perfect but I do recommend their unlimited hosting for bloggers or business in need of a reliable web hosting solution . Not only do they offer stable server performances and tons of useful features , but they also have some of the best customer support team in the industry . TMD 's cheapest unlimited hosting plan comes with Weebly Sitebuilder and starts at $ 2.95 / mo. Pros : Cons : If I were not to have the utmost faith in InMotion hosting , I would not be forking out hundreds of dollars each year in hosting fees . I believe that two key elements make them one of the top hosts I 've encountered to date ; Exceptional server performance and fantastic customer service . In Motion unlimited hosting comes in four flavors \u2013 Lite , Launch , Power , and Pro with all four plans give \u201c unlimited \u201d data transfer capacity . In Motion Lite only allows 1 website per account , while Launch , Power and Pro allow up to 2 , 50 and 100 websites per account . Pros : Cons : Bluehost is an excellent choice in hosting partners for so many reasons . This US - based web host is one of the top performers we know . In addition , they 're one of only three WordPress -recommended hosting services in the world . They offer unlimited hosting with their Bluehost Plus plan . That applies to SSD storage space and the number of websites you can run with a single plan . Also included are a free domain name , SSL , and CDN . Pros : Cons : Take BlueHost as example \u2013 the company BlueHost offers full range hosting services \u2013 from shared hosting to VPS and dedicated hosting . If you opt for BlueHost Shared Hosting Plus Plan , you get to host * unlimited * websites at the price of $ 5.45 per month . On the other hand , you will have to pay at least $ 79.99 per month on BlueHost Standard Dedicated Plan , which comes with * limited * 500 GB storage , 4 GB RAM , and 5 TB bandwidth . The math does n't work right , is n't ? Why would someone pay $ 79.99 a month for a hosting plan with limited bandwidth when the same provider is offering an unlimited plan at just $ 5.45 a month ? Truth is , hosting companies are in a world of their own , especially in terminology . To the average layman , ' unlimited ' means exactly that \u2013 without limitations . However , that 's not quite so true when it comes to unlimited hosting plans . Trust is \u2026 there is always a limit . Wake up and smell the roses , people . We live in a finite world . \u201c Unlimited \u201d is nothing but an imaginary industrial term , liberally sprinkled with caveats ( also known as exceptions ) . Web hosting is a very competitive business . Web hosting companies are doing all they can , including giving out free migration services and free Google Adwords credits , to win new customers . Because \u201c more if often better \u201d in consumers ' beliefs , \u201c unlimited hosting plans \u201d became a popular marketing tactics in mid 2000 's ( and , if I recall this correctly , BlueHost was the very first that started this ) . So now you have the \u201c why \u201d \u2013 it 's time to tackle the \u201c how \u201d . If you 've gone through the ToS of a site that 's promising you the moon and the stars for the rock bottom price of $ 2 / mo and think you might finally be putting one over the web hosting provider , think again . Let 's consider the phenomena known as overselling . Overselling happens when a hosting company sells more than they have the actual capacity to provide . Large hosting companies normally own incomprehensible amounts of hosting capacity ( bandwidth pipes , computer servers , manpower \u2026 etc ) that would never be exceeded by a single website . At the same time , most websites need only very few resources to run daily , such as the average corporate website . Seeing that most resources in their servers remain unused , the hosting companies ( that offer unlimited hosting ) therefore have the ability to just re-sell those unused hosting capacities ( aka overselling ) . Now , jumping back to our topic \u2013 how unlimited web hosting works . Consider reading an ad for a new all - you - can - eat buffet place and heading over there to try it . Once you get there , there is a note saying you have to weigh less than 70kg ( 154lbs ) before you can enter . That 's the catch . The same applies to many unlimited hosting plans \u2013 you are welcomed to host unlimited websites and take up unlimited hosting storage and bandwidth as long X or Y conditions are met . The problem is that these conditions are rarely stated in the marketing area of the web hosting site . That part of the site keeps telling you that you 're getting an unlimited plan . In small print , usually under the Terms of Service ( ToS ) , there will likely be a million and one limitations and house rules . For instance : You can get more details of these limitations in my BlueHost , Hostinger , and i Page review . Every single unlimited hosting provider out there will have its own house rules and server limitations to control their users . These limitations could be in terms of CPU queries , RAM , inodes , number of MySQL databases , number of MySQL database connections , or even FTP uploads \u2013 the list goes on . As soon as your websites hit the red zone ; the hosting company will pull the plug on your account , or impose additional charges on you ( and boy will they CHARGE ! ) . That is how \u201c unlimited hosting \u201d works . You can argue that overselling and unlimited hosting plans are somewhat unethical . However , it does not indicate that the said hosting company is outright evil . For one , the practice of overselling is the main reason why we can have super cheap hosting services in the market these days . Also , going \u201c unlimited \u201d is never an easy business decision for hosting providers . Take Hostgator back in 2000 's for example , the company spent more than a year to prepare ( including hiring new employee and investing in supporting hardware ) for the launching of unlimited hosting . Although they are now offering unlimited hosting service , their servers remained reliable and efficient ; and the customer support is never lacking in quality . Brent Oxley , Hostgator founder , said this when Hostgator started offering unlimited hosting : I wanted to call the plans unlimited last time around . However , due to staffing constraints , we would n't have been able to keep up with the expected growth . A year later , we are finally OVERSTAFFED and ready to change the plan . Up until now , I 've been slowing sales down on purpose in order for our support to catch up . If history repeats itself , renaming the plan from essentially unlimited to actually \u201c unlimited \u201d will increase our sales by at least 30 % . \u201d In the last year , we have been spending more money on recruiting employees than we have on advertising ! It has taken us years of hiring and training to get us to the point where we are now . We 've gone from begging employees to work overtime to asking who wants to go home . Host Gator will always have the occasional scheduling gap , but for now , we 're sending over a dozen employees home a day . \u2013 Brent Oxley , Ex-Hostgator Founder & CEO The truth is , the quality of a hosting deal relies on a number of factors . Nowadays , the last things we need to compare are basic features like data transfer and disk storage . Technology has evolved so much that much of these factors are now dirt cheap and almost every shared hosting company is giving this same unlimited features to users these days . How do we compare between GreenGeeks and A2 Hosting 's unlimited hosting plans ? They look all the same from outside : unlimited bandwidth , unlimited storage , unlimited databases , unlimited addon domain , price below $ 10 / mo , and so on . Hosting performance , such as uptime and speed ; as well as special - built features are the answers . To get an unlimited web host you can trust on , try : Before we publish a host review , we signup to a web host and use uptime and speed tracking tools to gauge their service quality . Here are some uptime data ( tracked using Uptime Robot and our in - house built HostScore ) we published in the past : And here are some speed test results ( using Bitcatcha and our in - house built HostScore ) we published in our reviews . Unlimited hosting providers usually apply limitations on usage of their server resources \u2013 such as CPU run time , concurrent database connections , and inodes . There are several things you can do to overcome these limitations and protect yourself , including : So , are we clear on the topic unlimited hosting ? A quick recap on what you have just read : \u201c Unlimited Hosting \u201d refers to web hosting offers that come with unlimited disk storage , data transfer and in some cases , unlimited addon domain . We live in a finite world . Therefore \u201c Unlimited \u201d hosting is not possible . Web hosting is a very competitive business . Web hosting companies are doing all they can , including giving out free migration services and free Google Adwords credits , to win new customers . Because \u201c more if often better \u201d in consumers ' beliefs , \u201c unlimited hosting plans \u201d became a popular marketing tactics in mid 2000 's ( and , if I recall this correctly , BlueHost was the very first that started this ) . Overselling refers to the practice of providers selling more than they have the actual capacity to provide . Large hosting companies normally own incomprehensible amounts of hosting capacity ( bandwidth pipes , computer servers , manpower \u2026 etc ) that would never be exceeded by a single website . Seeing that most resources in their servers remain unused , the hosting companies therefore have the ability to just re-sell those unused hosting capacities ( aka overselling ) . Unlimited shared hosting plan usually costs between $ 3 \u2013 $ 7 per month during signup . Yes . The quality of a hosting service relies on a number of factors \u2013 basic features like data transfer and storage capacity are not as critical as they used to be . , the last things we need to compare are basic features like data transfer and disk storage . Technology has evolved so much that storage and network bandwidth are now dirt cheap and almost every shared hosting company is giving this same unlimited to users these days .

While technically it 's impossible for any company to host \u201c unlimited \u201d websites ( more about this later ) , no-limit hosting plans are very popular \u2013 mainly because it reduces the cost of hosting multiple sites significantly . With A2 Hosting you get a choice of either hosting one or multiple websites in three unlimited hosting plans \u2013 Drive , Turbo Boost , and Turbo Max . A2's Turbo plans step up the game a little bit and open access to their Turbo option which lays claim to perform up to 20x faster . All A2 Hosting plans include a bunch of freebies ranging from easy site migration and free SSL setup to some other free applications that are quite useful such as A2 Optimized plugin for Word Press and Presta Shop . Pros : Cons : Green Geeks offers more than just unlimited storage and bandwidth , but also Bonneville Environmental Foundation ( BEF ) certified green hosting . They are very affordable \u2013 Lite plan signup at just $ 2.49 / mo and performed well in our server speed test . Pros : Cons : TMDHosting is not perfect but I do recommend their unlimited hosting for bloggers or business in need of a reliable web hosting solution . Not only do they offer stable server performances and tons of useful features , but they also have some of the best customer support team in the industry . TMD 's cheapest unlimited hosting plan comes with Weebly Sitebuilder and starts at $ 2.95 / mo. Pros : Cons : If I were not to have the utmost faith in InMotion hosting , I would not be forking out hundreds of dollars each year in hosting fees . I believe that two key elements make them one of the top hosts I 've encountered to date ; Exceptional server performance and fantastic customer service . In Motion unlimited hosting comes in four flavors \u2013 Lite , Launch , Power , and Pro with all four plans give \u201c unlimited \u201d data transfer capacity . In Motion Lite only allows 1 website per account , while Launch , Power and Pro allow up to 2 , 50 and 100 websites per account . Pros : Cons : Bluehost is an excellent choice in hosting partners for so many reasons . This US - based web host is one of the top performers we know . In addition , they 're one of only three WordPress -recommended hosting services in the world . They offer unlimited hosting with their Bluehost Plus plan . That applies to SSD storage space and the number of websites you can run with a single plan . Also included are a free domain name , SSL , and CDN . Pros : Cons : Take BlueHost as example \u2013 the company BlueHost offers full range hosting services \u2013 from shared hosting to VPS and dedicated hosting . If you opt for BlueHost Shared Hosting Plus Plan , you get to host * unlimited * websites at the price of $ 5.45 per month . On the other hand , you will have to pay at least $ 79.99 per month on BlueHost Standard Dedicated Plan , which comes with * limited * 500 GB storage , 4 GB RAM , and 5 TB bandwidth . The math does n't work right , is n't ? Why would someone pay $ 79.99 a month for a hosting plan with limited bandwidth when the same provider is offering an unlimited plan at just $ 5.45 a month ? Truth is , hosting companies are in a world of their own , especially in terminology . To the average layman , ' unlimited ' means exactly that \u2013 without limitations . However , that 's not quite so true when it comes to unlimited hosting plans . Trust is \u2026 there is always a limit . Wake up and smell the roses , people . We live in a finite world . \u201c Unlimited \u201d is nothing but an imaginary industrial term , liberally sprinkled with caveats ( also known as exceptions ) . Web hosting is a very competitive business . Web hosting companies are doing all they can , including giving out free migration services and free Google Adwords credits , to win new customers . Because \u201c more if often better \u201d in consumers ' beliefs , \u201c unlimited hosting plans \u201d became a popular marketing tactics in mid 2000 's ( and , if I recall this correctly , BlueHost was the very first that started this ) . So now you have the \u201c why \u201d \u2013 it 's time to tackle the \u201c how \u201d . If you 've gone through the ToS of a site that 's promising you the moon and the stars for the rock bottom price of $ 2 / mo and think you might finally be putting one over the web hosting provider , think again . Let 's consider the phenomena known as overselling . Overselling happens when a hosting company sells more than they have the actual capacity to provide . Large hosting companies normally own incomprehensible amounts of hosting capacity ( bandwidth pipes , computer servers , manpower \u2026 etc ) that would never be exceeded by a single website . At the same time , most websites need only very few resources to run daily , such as the average corporate website . Seeing that most resources in their servers remain unused , the hosting companies ( that offer unlimited hosting ) therefore have the ability to just re-sell those unused hosting capacities ( aka overselling ) . Now , jumping back to our topic \u2013 how unlimited web hosting works . Consider reading an ad for a new all - you - can - eat buffet place and heading over there to try it . Once you get there , there is a note saying you have to weigh less than 70kg ( 154lbs ) before you can enter . That 's the catch . The same applies to many unlimited hosting plans \u2013 you are welcomed to host unlimited websites and take up unlimited hosting storage and bandwidth as long X or Y conditions are met . The problem is that these conditions are rarely stated in the marketing area of the web hosting site . That part of the site keeps telling you that you 're getting an unlimited plan . In small print , usually under the Terms of Service ( ToS ) , there will likely be a million and one limitations and house rules . For instance : You can get more details of these limitations in my BlueHost , Hostinger , and i Page review . Every single unlimited hosting provider out there will have its own house rules and server limitations to control their users . These limitations could be in terms of CPU queries , RAM , inodes , number of MySQL databases , number of MySQL database connections , or even FTP uploads \u2013 the list goes on . As soon as your websites hit the red zone ; the hosting company will pull the plug on your account , or impose additional charges on you ( and boy will they CHARGE ! ) .

He became father of the city in 1737 , but ' seldom or never ' attended a corporation meeting . 6 Made joint postmaster general in 1739 , he died 11 Mar. 1745 .","annotations":[{"text":"by English Jacobites","span":[1362,1381],"token_span":[285,287],"role":"Surrenderer","label":"Surrenderer","role_definition":"The person compelled to transfer the Theme to the Recipient."},{"text":"estates","span":[1344,1350],"token_span":[283,283],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The object that changes possession."},{"text":"1715","span":[1390,1393],"token_span":[290,290],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time is when the Surrenderer gives the Theme to the Recipient."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-2414-395-frame-Taking","frame":"Taking","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Agent removes a Theme from a Source so that the it is in the Agent's possession.","frame_ancestors":["Getting","Event","Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":["Theft"],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Seizure of DVDs On May 7 , 2008 , federal agents raided Spectrum Labs as part of an investigation related to \" drug masking products \" used to fool drug tests .

I\uff1a I went to a doa concert in Shibuya . Everybody was having fun . It was really good . I was also meeting the band backstage .

Johnna Wright almost chose tent No. 7 in the camp 's Kiowa unit . But Wright , now 18 , testified here Wednesday that she decided to go to another tent . \" I just did n't like the location , \" she said . \" There were a lot of woods around it . I just did n't like it . \" Sometime in the darkness of that night or the next morning , the three girls who chose tent No. 7 were raped and murdered . The parents of victims Denise Milner and Lori Farmer have filed a $ 5 million wrongful - death lawsuit here against the Tulsa - based Magic Empire Girl Scout Council , which operated the camp in Mayes County near Locust Grove . Also named in the lawsuit is the Hartford Insurance Company , which carried a policy on the camp . Attorneys for Walter and Bettye Milner and Charles and Sherri Farmer claim that the camp was overgrown , unlit , unsecured and poorly operated . The council 's alleged negligence allowed the girls ' deaths , the lawsuit contends . A string of witnesses testified Wednesday , the trial 's third day , about numerous thefts , burglaries and intrusions at the camp over the years . Several former counselors and campers testified Wednesday that Scouting officials never told them what to do if intruders entered the camp . Attorneys Jack Gaither and Ben Faulkner claim that Scouting officials showed an \" unbelievable lack of caution and alertness , \" despite numerous incidents which should have prompted them to improve camp security . Former head counselor Constance Cunningham testified that in a 1971 summer session she huddled , gun in hand , inside a tent which four teen - age Scouts said had been entered the night before by a strange man . Cunningham said the vigil culminated two years of frightening intrusions . During her two years as counselor , she said , campers ' and counselors ' tents were ransacked on several occasions . During both years , campers and counselors spotted intruders at night inside the 410 - acre camp , she said . The former counselor said she talked to camp director Helen \" Smitty \" Gray in 1970 , after campers came to her and told her they were hearing heavy breathing outside their tents at night . \" She brushed it off and said we 've had several things going on in summers past , \" Cunningham testified . She said that the next year , as the Camp Scott staff prepared for summer sessions , Gray called a meeting with the counselors who knew about the previous year 's incidents . \" She cautioned us not to say a thing of what had gone on the summer before to the counselors that were new . She did n't want them upset , \" Cunningham said . She said Gray insisted on secrecy . Later that summer , a disturbing series of incidents began at the Kiowa unit , Cunningham said . \" One of the counselors was reporting that she heard a male person calling , \" Help me . Help me . Please help me . I 'm hurt , \" ' she said . Shortly afterwards , someone began ransacking tents , she said . Again , she said , counselors voiced their concerns to Gray . \" She said , \" it 's nothing , \" ' Cunningham testified . \" In fact , she said she was n't sure that some of the counselors who had worked the summer before had n't told the other people , and that someone was n't playing a big joke . As the intrusions continued , Cunningham said , she grew more frightened . \" They were just pushing it aside as nothing important . I was told that it had gone on in summers past , that no harm had been done , just do n't worry about it . \" Finally , she said , a counselor who had a permit to carry a gun gave her the gun and showed her how to handle it . Dan Rogers , attorney for the Magic Empire Council , attacked Cunningham 's testimony about the gun . \" Do n't you know that 's so much against the rules that it 's unbelievable ? \" Rogers asked . \" Sir , I do n't know what the rules or regulations are , \" Cunningham replied . Gaither and Faulkner read Wednesday from a March 1981 deposition in which former Camp Scott counselor Michelle Hoffman testified about finding a threatening note in the camp 's Seminole unit , less than two months before the murders . During a pre-summer preparatory session for volunteers , one of her fellow counselors discovered that her belongings had been ransacked , Hoffman said . She said a box of doughnuts belonging to the counselor had been stolen . Hoffman said she found the empty doughnut box and picked it up . She said she found inside a note , written on folded notebook paper . \" In capital letters it was printed , \" We are on a mission to kill three girls in tent one . ' It was signed \" The Killer , ' or something like that , \" she said . Hoffman said the note alarmed her at first , but she decided it was a joke . She said the counselors turned the note over to Barbara Olmstead , coordinator of the spring Camporee session at Camp Scott . She said Olmstead threw the note away . Olmstead testified in that when the counselors gave her the note , they did not tell her that the tent had been ransacked .

But Wright , now 18 , testified here Wednesday that she decided to go to another tent . \" I just did n't like the location , \" she said . \" There were a lot of woods around it . I just did n't like it . \" Sometime in the darkness of that night or the next morning , the three girls who chose tent No. 7 were raped and murdered . The parents of victims Denise Milner and Lori Farmer have filed a $ 5 million wrongful - death lawsuit here against the Tulsa - based Magic Empire Girl Scout Council , which operated the camp in Mayes County near Locust Grove . Also named in the lawsuit is the Hartford Insurance Company , which carried a policy on the camp . Attorneys for Walter and Bettye Milner and Charles and Sherri Farmer claim that the camp was overgrown , unlit , unsecured and poorly operated . The council 's alleged negligence allowed the girls ' deaths , the lawsuit contends . A string of witnesses testified Wednesday , the trial 's third day , about numerous thefts , burglaries and intrusions at the camp over the years . Several former counselors and campers testified Wednesday that Scouting officials never told them what to do if intruders entered the camp . Attorneys Jack Gaither and Ben Faulkner claim that Scouting officials showed an \" unbelievable lack of caution and alertness , \" despite numerous incidents which should have prompted them to improve camp security . Former head counselor Constance Cunningham testified that in a 1971 summer session she huddled , gun in hand , inside a tent which four teen - age Scouts said had been entered the night before by a strange man . Cunningham said the vigil culminated two years of frightening intrusions . During her two years as counselor , she said , campers ' and counselors ' tents were ransacked on several occasions . During both years , campers and counselors spotted intruders at night inside the 410 - acre camp , she said . The former counselor said she talked to camp director Helen \" Smitty \" Gray in 1970 , after campers came to her and told her they were hearing heavy breathing outside their tents at night . \" She brushed it off and said we 've had several things going on in summers past , \" Cunningham testified . She said that the next year , as the Camp Scott staff prepared for summer sessions , Gray called a meeting with the counselors who knew about the previous year 's incidents . \" She cautioned us not to say a thing of what had gone on the summer before to the counselors that were new . She did n't want them upset , \" Cunningham said . She said Gray insisted on secrecy . Later that summer , a disturbing series of incidents began at the Kiowa unit , Cunningham said . \" One of the counselors was reporting that she heard a male person calling , \" Help me . Help me . Please help me . I 'm hurt , \" ' she said . Shortly afterwards , someone began ransacking tents , she said . Again , she said , counselors voiced their concerns to Gray . \" She said , \" it 's nothing , \" ' Cunningham testified . \" In fact , she said she was n't sure that some of the counselors who had worked the summer before had n't told the other people , and that someone was n't playing a big joke . As the intrusions continued , Cunningham said , she grew more frightened . \" They were just pushing it aside as nothing important . I was told that it had gone on in summers past , that no harm had been done , just do n't worry about it . \" Finally , she said , a counselor who had a permit to carry a gun gave her the gun and showed her how to handle it . Dan Rogers , attorney for the Magic Empire Council , attacked Cunningham 's testimony about the gun . \" Do n't you know that 's so much against the rules that it 's unbelievable ? \" Rogers asked . \" Sir , I do n't know what the rules or regulations are , \" Cunningham replied . Gaither and Faulkner read Wednesday from a March 1981 deposition in which former Camp Scott counselor Michelle Hoffman testified about finding a threatening note in the camp 's Seminole unit , less than two months before the murders . During a pre-summer preparatory session for volunteers , one of her fellow counselors discovered that her belongings had been ransacked , Hoffman said . She said a box of doughnuts belonging to the counselor had been stolen . Hoffman said she found the empty doughnut box and picked it up . She said she found inside a note , written on folded notebook paper . \" In capital letters it was printed , \" We are on a mission to kill three girls in tent one . ' It was signed \" The Killer , ' or something like that , \" she said . Hoffman said the note alarmed her at first , but she decided it was a joke . She said the counselors turned the note over to Barbara Olmstead , coordinator of the spring Camporee session at Camp Scott . She said Olmstead threw the note away . Olmstead testified in that when the counselors gave her the note , they did not tell her that the tent had been ransacked .

Physically and mystically forests have defined the environment of communities in the region throughout time . The distinction that has been made between cultural values and the forests functions is actually an artificial one . Tangibly and intangibly , forests feature in all aspects of culture : language , history , art , religion , medicine , politics , and even social structure itself . Forest trees may house the spirits of ancestors as well as those of the newborn . And forests are viewed in both positive and negative lights as sources of evil as well as power and munificence , as providers for , and hindrances to development . The mystical qualities of specific forest resources often play a crucial role in traditional healing practices . Forests provide the venue for religious , social , and healing ceremonies . Forest products such as tam - tams and forest foods such as palm wine are used in many ceremonies . Assessing the myriad of symbolic and cultural values of forests goes far beyond the scope of this study . However , this does not diminish their importance in terms of the value people place on forests and forest resources . The following discussion can only illustrate some of the ways in which forests are culturally and symbolically valued . Information on the cultural significance of forest resources can be gleaned from anthropological , ethnobotanical , geographic , ethnomedical , and linguistic studies . Such studies generally focus on a particular community or ethnic group . Thus it is difficult to compare the cultural use of forests across the region . The literature does however provide invaluable insight into peoples often seemingly contradictory views regarding forests . Abbiw ( in progress ) provides an interesting collection of information on the diversity of traditional values ascribed to forest resources throughout the region ( more than 1000 species are described ) . For example , plants associated with marriages may be used to attract a potential spouse , during the marriage ceremony , to protect marriages , or to improve them ( a talisman of Datura metel is believed to give patience so as to tolerate ones spouse ) . ( The Table in Appendix 13 shows the range of symbolic uses described by Abbiw . ) Forest trees , the links between the sky and earth , often symbolise links between the spiritual world of ancestors and people . Rituals and ceremonies which draw on forest symbols often serve to link people with their cultural heritage , as well as their ancestral past ( Calame - Griaule 1969 , 1970 ) . In an extremely interesting study , Calame - Griaule uses traditional stories and myths to analyse the symbolic function of trees in African oral tradition . The tree features in many myths and tales . It consistently reflects a few important symbolic images . The tree stands between heaven and earth and is associated with creation as well as the underworld ( cosmic tree ) . The tree is a maternal symbol : a protector and provider who gives fruit , other foods and medicines , provides a reservoir for water , protects against the elements and evil spirits . The tree often symbolizes human fecundity . It may also be a phallic and paternal symbol , symbolically linking people with their ancestors while being a symbol of political unity . Finally , the deciduous characteristic of the tree gives it an ambiguous image which reflects the trees power to give life and rebirth as well as to bring about death . In many African myths and stories , the tree is portrayed as an ancestral symbol of wisdom , authority and custom , providing a bond between the dead and the living ( Studstill 1970 ) . Similarly , in other stories Gorog - Karady ( 1970 ) relates that the tree is often symbolises a mediator and judge . Trees play a role in all facets and periods of West African peoples lives . The Oubangui ( Centre Afrique ) plant a tree in the bush for a newborn child . For female children a fast -growing profuse fruiter is planted . The childs development is linked to the growth of the tree . If tree growth declines , people fear for the health of the child and a healer is called upon . When the child is sick it is brought to the tree for treatment . When the tree begins to fruit , the time will have come for the child to marry . Throughout a persons life , gifts are occasionally left for the tree . When someone dies their spirit goes to reside in their personal birthright tree ( Vergiat 1969 ) . Ficus sycamorus : a sacred tree which grows by rivers Forests provide the venue for many cultural events . In many parts of West Africa , forest areas and specific trees are protected and valued for particular cultural occasions and as historic symbols . Each community has its own traditions associated with sacred areas and , as a result , the species that are found in them vary greatly . In an analysis of traditional African political institutions , Niangoran - Bouah ( 1983 ) notes that there are two traditional sacred locations for reunion : sacred groves and arbres a palabre . The arbre a palabre is the venue for political and social meetings : the location where elders sit under the big tree and talk until they agree . It is the location where political , judicial , and social decisions are made . Visser ( 1975 ) notes that among the Ando of C\u00f4te d Ivoire there are specific tree species which serve as arbres a palabre such as Microdesmis sp. , Blighia sapida ( also a symbol of fecundity ) , Cordia millenii , and Bombax buonopozense . Sacred groves are the site of ritual and secret society initiations , a locale where social and political values , morals , secrets , and laws are passed on to the younger generation . Sacred groves house the most important religious and ritual relics . They are often the site of ancestral burials or places where people can communicate with their ancestors . Sanago ( 1983 ) describes sacred groves in C\u00f4te dIvoire , noting that they are places where moral values are taught and passed on from one generation to the next . The trees within these groves are viewed as sacred trees , housing spirits , and providing links to ancestors . In some areas , sacred groves are the only forested areas that remain ( Koagne 1986 ) . Although many cultural traditions are disappearing with the rapidly changing social and physical environments , sacred groves often remain as valued elements of cultural heritage . The groves are also often the site for ritual healings and the location where villagers find particular plant medicines . ( The species that are often associated with sacred groves throughout the region are listed in Appendix 14 . ) In a village in Northern Ghana , Ntiamoa - Baidu ( 1987 ) describes a sacred region protected by traditional beliefs : the villagers ancestors were saved from enemies when they hid in this sacred area . Now the spirits of these ancestors and gods live there . The area is never farmed and is burnt once a year to protect it from accidental fires . Binet ( 1974 ) describes the symbolic and mystical use of forest areas valued by the Fang of Southern Cameroon . The temple ( the site of initiation ceremonies and rites ) is always situated at the foot of a large forest tree where medicinal plants are often cultivated . This tree symbolises the forest which houses the body of god and was once the source of peoples food . During initiation ceremonies , the root bark of the species Tabernantha iboga ( a hallucinogen ) is consumed by ail initiates , so that they can see god . In this culture , the tree and forest medicines are believed to be vehicles through which people communicate with god . In the Casamance region of Senegal , a traditional healer founded a healing village for mental patients at the foot of a large cottonwood tree ( Ceiba pentandra ) . The village location was chosen because the tree and surrounding forest symbolised healing and protection , a peaceful place that linked people with their god and ancestors . Village dwellings are now built around the tree ( Trincaz , J. 1980 ) . And every day , at the foot of this large tree , patients discuss their problems , undergoing the equivalent of group psychotherapy . The study concludes that this healing village demonstrates the fundamental mystical , religious , and social importance of trees in their culture . In some cases , specific resources serve as cultural symbols , linking people to a particular past . Some resources are valued throughout the region ; others are only significant to specific groups ( Ntiamoa - Baidu 1987 ) . In a study comparing the religious significance of different forest species for different West African cultures , Schnell ( 1946 ) found that Chlorophora excelsa was a sacred tree throughout the region . It was often protected , and sacrifices and gifts were given to it . Villages were often located near it , and in some cases the C. excelsa was planted in the village . The tree was especially associated with fertility and birth . For example , the Ibo ( Southern Nigeria ) believe that it furnishes the souls for the newborn ( Andoh 1986 ) . And in the Ho region of Ghana , it is ( Asamoah 1985 ) believed to be dwelling for dwarfs ; underneath it ritual sacrifices are performed . And its wood is used for making sacred drums and coffins . For the Guer\u00e9 and Oubi ( C\u00f4te d Ivoire ) , C. excelsa is also the location for ritual sacrifices ( T\u00e9h\u00e9 1980 ) . Ceiba pentandra is also a sacred tree throughout the West African region . It is usually associated with burials and ancestors ( Schnell 1946 ) . Asamoah ( 1985 ) notes that in the Ho region of Ghana , its bark and leaves are believed to expel evil spirits . ( See also Cousteix 1961 , Cameroon ; de Rosny 1981 . ) Among the Beti of Southern Cameroon , Amat and Cortadellas ( 1972 ) report that the oven tree Didelotia africana is sacred . It is thought extremely powerful and is used in many traditional healing treatments , especially those involving sorcery . It is approached for help with difficult problems ( e.g. broken marriages ) , but can only be used by healers who have the power to communicate with it . Mallart Guimera ( 1969 ) examined the symbolic importance of the oven tree ( in this case Copaifera religiosa and sometimes Guibourtia tessmannii ) to the Evuzok people of Southern Cameroon . For the Evuzok the oven tree is the most important of ail forest trees . Both C. religiosa and G. tessmannii are emergent species of the equatorial rainforest and occur at low densities . C. religiosa has a large red straight trunk . G. tessmannii is also an extremely tall species with large buttress roots . Its height , force , and uniqueness as compared to other species lend the oven tree its title of chief of all trees , controlling fecundity , wealth , power , and fame . However , the Evuzok oven tree is also a fearsome tree whose force can be used by evil spirits . Thus , it is an ambivalent symbol : it can give life , but also bring death . This duality features in many Evuzok stories and myths . Trees serve both practical and symbolic judicial roles . Symbolically , they can represent mediators or decision makers . Practically , they are physical boundary markers that define property and provide evidence of usuary rights in judicial disputes . The symbol of the tree as mediator is illustrated in Gorog - Karadys ( 1970 ) examination of the justice and mediating role of trees in African oral tradition . There are some common elements in these stories ( 22 are analysed ) : an evil deed is followed by atonement in which a tree has a part ; the tree can be giver of life , death or it can insure the heros survival ; the tree intervenes in situations where man is not able to solve a conflict ; the conflicts in which the tree acts as mediator are those where the rules regulating traditional society have been ignored . In some cases the practical and symbolic roles of particular tree species are combined . For instance , in Western Cameroon , the tree Dracaena arborea is traditionally considered a symbol of peace and for this reason it is used to mark property boundaries ( Depommier 1983 ) ( See also Dongmo ( 1985 ) ) . Among the Agni of C\u00f4te d Ivoire , the Sereer of Senegal , and in the Boual\u00e9 region of C\u00f4te d Ivoire trees play a central role in the land tenure system . For the Agni , trees evidence land - use rights for an individual or lineage group . And , as in many cultures of the region , in the Agni culture , someone who plants a tree in a field has sole rights to its produce and sole rights to the use of the land it stands on . Thus land rights are established by collecting the harvest from planted trees rather than by bush clearing ( Gastellu 1980 ) . Boamah ( 1986 ) presents the results of two court cases which indicate that the planting or tending of naturally regenerating fruit trees on a piece of land for several years without interference effectively constitutes proof of possession in Ghana as well . These court rulings emphasize the fact that it is often the person who gathers the fruit of a planted tree who gains exclusive right to the land itself ( see Section 6.2 ) . Forests provide a range of products for traditional ceremonies from food and beverages to costumes and musical instruments . While some of these products are perhaps less often used on a day- to - day basis , they still form essential elements of a variety of cultural traditions . In a study of the uses of fallow tree species in Ho , Ghana , Asamoah ( 1985 ) found that half the identified species were valued in customary rites . Forest products are used for healing throughout the region . The medicines and medicinal practices that were discussed in the first section , depend to a large extent on the mystical values associated with different forest species . Thus it is not possible to differentiate between the psychological and medical effects of a plant when investigating its effectiveness . Forest foods also feature in many cultural ceremonies : marriages , funerals , initiations , installation of chiefs , and birth celebrations , to name a few . Palm wine and cola nuts are important symbolic foods throughout humid West Africa . In Nigeria , for example , palm wine is of paramount importance at most social functions ( Okafor 1979 ) . It is used in pouring libations , offering prayers , and heralding events . Cola nuts are regarded as important symbols of welcome and hospitality . For Muslims of the region , cola nuts are sacred : something given them by the prophet . They are a symbol of friendship and feature in all festive occasions . Among the Igbo of Southern Nigeria , all discussions , prayers , and ceremonies begin with the breaking of cola nuts . Without cola , these occasions are not regarded as serious ( Okigbo 1980 ) . The seeds of Pentaclethra macrophylla are another example of symbolically important forest foods . In southwestern Nigeria , they feature in child - naming and girls initiation ceremonies ( heralding maturity ) . Bread fruit ( Treculia africana ) is served at womens burial ceremonies . It is also served during a festival staged to indicate a girls impending departure to her husbands home ( Okafor 1979 ) . Forests also provide the raw materials for many of the objects that are used in traditional ceremonies . Most musical instruments are made from forest products . For example , the Oubi ( in C\u00f4te d Ivoire ) use Cordia platythyrsa for making tam -tams . The Boual\u00e9 ( also from C\u00f4te d Ivoire ) make a musical slide / rattle with the fruit of Oncoba spinosa and Glyphaea brevis and the seed of Entada pursaetha ( T\u00e9h\u00e9 1980 ) . Similarly , the seed shells of Chrysophyllum albidum and Mammea africana are worn by dancers as rattles and the wooden strips of Ricinodendron heudelottii are used to make xylophones in Igboland , Nigeria ( Okigbo 1980 ) . Among the Mende and Dan ( C\u00f4te d Ivoire ) , masks play an important role in rituals and ceremonies ; they often represent the spirits of the forests and ancestors ( who reside in forests ) and thus express and evoke cultural links to the past ( Jedrej 1986 ) . In Gabon , Perrois ( 1971 ) notes that wood sculptures and ceremonial objects serve as vehicles of communication with ancestors ; the wood is used for different artifacts and is chosen according to the purposes and symbolic values of specific tree species . Ceremonial clothing and costumes are also often made from specific forest products . Among the Ashante in Ghana , traditional cloth is still important at festive and ceremonial occasions . For example , the bark and stem of Lannea kerstingii are used for dyeing the funeral cloth kuntunkun . The bark of Bridelia ferruginea is used for dyeing Adinkra cloth , important at other ceremonial occasions ( Annan 1980 ) . Gara cloth is a traditionally valued indigo cloth . The indigo dye of Gara is derived from the leaves of the woody climber Lonchocarpus cyanescens . Finally , masks used in ceremonies throughout the region are often made with the wood of trees that are valued for their spiritual or mystical attributes ( Jedrej 1986 , Gollnhofer et al 1975 ) . Conclusion Forests serve a variety of cultural and symbolic functions in West Africa . They are intimately linked with ancestry and cultural heritage . Forest symbols provide social structure and cultural identity in a rapidly changing environment . There is little information on the ways in which these values are changing . No studies explore the implications of changing cultural values on forest resource use . And yet , there can be little doubt that values have changed and are continuing to change . With this evolution peoples perceptions of the surrounding forest environment will undoubtedly be altered . Some researchers do however suggest that forests and their products are and will continue to be valued , in part because they symbolize cultural cohesion .","annotations":[{"text":"Centre Afrique","span":[4349,4362],"token_span":[759,760],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place where the thriving takes place."},{"text":"in the bush","span":[4379,4389],"token_span":[765,767],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place where the thriving takes place."},{"text":"the tree","span":[4528,4535],"token_span":[793,794],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The Entity is experiencing a period of desirable events or states."},{"text":"growth declines","span":[4547,4561],"token_span":[798,799],"role":"Desirability","label":"Desirability","role_definition":"This role describes the state of the Entity.

The literature does however provide invaluable insight into peoples often seemingly contradictory views regarding forests . Abbiw ( in progress ) provides an interesting collection of information on the diversity of traditional values ascribed to forest resources throughout the region ( more than 1000 species are described ) . For example , plants associated with marriages may be used to attract a potential spouse , during the marriage ceremony , to protect marriages , or to improve them ( a talisman of Datura metel is believed to give patience so as to tolerate ones spouse ) . ( The Table in Appendix 13 shows the range of symbolic uses described by Abbiw . ) Forest trees , the links between the sky and earth , often symbolise links between the spiritual world of ancestors and people . Rituals and ceremonies which draw on forest symbols often serve to link people with their cultural heritage , as well as their ancestral past ( Calame - Griaule 1969 , 1970 ) .

The childs development is linked to the growth of the tree . If tree growth declines , people fear for the health of the child and a healer is called upon . When the child is sick it is brought to the tree for treatment . When the tree begins to fruit , the time will have come for the child to marry . Throughout a persons life , gifts are occasionally left for the tree . When someone dies their spirit goes to reside in their personal birthright tree ( Vergiat 1969 ) . Ficus sycamorus : a sacred tree which grows by rivers Forests provide the venue for many cultural events . In many parts of West Africa , forest areas and specific trees are protected and valued for particular cultural occasions and as historic symbols . Each community has its own traditions associated with sacred areas and , as a result , the species that are found in them vary greatly . In an analysis of traditional African political institutions , Niangoran - Bouah ( 1983 ) notes that there are two traditional sacred locations for reunion : sacred groves and arbres a palabre . The arbre a palabre is the venue for political and social meetings : the location where elders sit under the big tree and talk until they agree . It is the location where political , judicial , and social decisions are made . Visser ( 1975 ) notes that among the Ando of C\u00f4te d Ivoire there are specific tree species which serve as arbres a palabre such as Microdesmis sp. , Blighia sapida ( also a symbol of fecundity ) , Cordia millenii , and Bombax buonopozense . Sacred groves are the site of ritual and secret society initiations , a locale where social and political values , morals , secrets , and laws are passed on to the younger generation . Sacred groves house the most important religious and ritual relics . They are often the site of ancestral burials or places where people can communicate with their ancestors . Sanago ( 1983 ) describes sacred groves in C\u00f4te dIvoire , noting that they are places where moral values are taught and passed on from one generation to the next . The trees within these groves are viewed as sacred trees , housing spirits , and providing links to ancestors . In some areas , sacred groves are the only forested areas that remain ( Koagne 1986 ) . Although many cultural traditions are disappearing with the rapidly changing social and physical environments , sacred groves often remain as valued elements of cultural heritage . The groves are also often the site for ritual healings and the location where villagers find particular plant medicines . ( The species that are often associated with sacred groves throughout the region are listed in Appendix 14 . ) In a village in Northern Ghana , Ntiamoa - Baidu ( 1987 ) describes a sacred region protected by traditional beliefs : the villagers ancestors were saved from enemies when they hid in this sacred area . Now the spirits of these ancestors and gods live there . The area is never farmed and is burnt once a year to protect it from accidental fires . Binet ( 1974 ) describes the symbolic and mystical use of forest areas valued by the Fang of Southern Cameroon . The temple ( the site of initiation ceremonies and rites ) is always situated at the foot of a large forest tree where medicinal plants are often cultivated . This tree symbolises the forest which houses the body of god and was once the source of peoples food . During initiation ceremonies , the root bark of the species Tabernantha iboga ( a hallucinogen ) is consumed by ail initiates , so that they can see god . In this culture , the tree and forest medicines are believed to be vehicles through which people communicate with god . In the Casamance region of Senegal , a traditional healer founded a healing village for mental patients at the foot of a large cottonwood tree ( Ceiba pentandra ) . The village location was chosen because the tree and surrounding forest symbolised healing and protection , a peaceful place that linked people with their god and ancestors . Village dwellings are now built around the tree ( Trincaz , J. 1980 ) . And every day , at the foot of this large tree , patients discuss their problems , undergoing the equivalent of group psychotherapy . The study concludes that this healing village demonstrates the fundamental mystical , religious , and social importance of trees in their culture . In some cases , specific resources serve as cultural symbols , linking people to a particular past . Some resources are valued throughout the region ; others are only significant to specific groups ( Ntiamoa - Baidu 1987 ) . In a study comparing the religious significance of different forest species for different West African cultures , Schnell ( 1946 ) found that Chlorophora excelsa was a sacred tree throughout the region . It was often protected , and sacrifices and gifts were given to it . Villages were often located near it , and in some cases the C. excelsa was planted in the village . The tree was especially associated with fertility and birth . For example , the Ibo ( Southern Nigeria ) believe that it furnishes the souls for the newborn ( Andoh 1986 ) . And in the Ho region of Ghana , it is ( Asamoah 1985 ) believed to be dwelling for dwarfs ; underneath it ritual sacrifices are performed . And its wood is used for making sacred drums and coffins . For the Guer\u00e9 and Oubi ( C\u00f4te d Ivoire ) , C. excelsa is also the location for ritual sacrifices ( T\u00e9h\u00e9 1980 ) . Ceiba pentandra is also a sacred tree throughout the West African region . It is usually associated with burials and ancestors ( Schnell 1946 ) . Asamoah ( 1985 ) notes that in the Ho region of Ghana , its bark and leaves are believed to expel evil spirits . ( See also Cousteix 1961 , Cameroon ; de Rosny 1981 . ) Among the Beti of Southern Cameroon , Amat and Cortadellas ( 1972 ) report that the oven tree Didelotia africana is sacred . It is thought extremely powerful and is used in many traditional healing treatments , especially those involving sorcery . It is approached for help with difficult problems ( e.g. broken marriages ) , but can only be used by healers who have the power to communicate with it . Mallart Guimera ( 1969 ) examined the symbolic importance of the oven tree ( in this case Copaifera religiosa and sometimes Guibourtia tessmannii ) to the Evuzok people of Southern Cameroon . For the Evuzok the oven tree is the most important of ail forest trees . Both C. religiosa and G. tessmannii are emergent species of the equatorial rainforest and occur at low densities . C. religiosa has a large red straight trunk . G. tessmannii is also an extremely tall species with large buttress roots . Its height , force , and uniqueness as compared to other species lend the oven tree its title of chief of all trees , controlling fecundity , wealth , power , and fame . However , the Evuzok oven tree is also a fearsome tree whose force can be used by evil spirits . Thus , it is an ambivalent symbol : it can give life , but also bring death . This duality features in many Evuzok stories and myths . Trees serve both practical and symbolic judicial roles . Symbolically , they can represent mediators or decision makers . Practically , they are physical boundary markers that define property and provide evidence of usuary rights in judicial disputes . The symbol of the tree as mediator is illustrated in Gorog - Karadys ( 1970 ) examination of the justice and mediating role of trees in African oral tradition . There are some common elements in these stories ( 22 are analysed ) : an evil deed is followed by atonement in which a tree has a part ; the tree can be giver of life , death or it can insure the heros survival ; the tree intervenes in situations where man is not able to solve a conflict ; the conflicts in which the tree acts as mediator are those where the rules regulating traditional society have been ignored . In some cases the practical and symbolic roles of particular tree species are combined . For instance , in Western Cameroon , the tree Dracaena arborea is traditionally considered a symbol of peace and for this reason it is used to mark property boundaries ( Depommier 1983 ) ( See also Dongmo ( 1985 ) ) . Among the Agni of C\u00f4te d Ivoire , the Sereer of Senegal , and in the Boual\u00e9 region of C\u00f4te d Ivoire trees play a central role in the land tenure system . For the Agni , trees evidence land - use rights for an individual or lineage group . And , as in many cultures of the region , in the Agni culture , someone who plants a tree in a field has sole rights to its produce and sole rights to the use of the land it stands on . Thus land rights are established by collecting the harvest from planted trees rather than by bush clearing ( Gastellu 1980 ) . Boamah ( 1986 ) presents the results of two court cases which indicate that the planting or tending of naturally regenerating fruit trees on a piece of land for several years without interference effectively constitutes proof of possession in Ghana as well . These court rulings emphasize the fact that it is often the person who gathers the fruit of a planted tree who gains exclusive right to the land itself ( see Section 6.2 ) . Forests provide a range of products for traditional ceremonies from food and beverages to costumes and musical instruments . While some of these products are perhaps less often used on a day- to - day basis , they still form essential elements of a variety of cultural traditions . In a study of the uses of fallow tree species in Ho , Ghana , Asamoah ( 1985 ) found that half the identified species were valued in customary rites . Forest products are used for healing throughout the region . The medicines and medicinal practices that were discussed in the first section , depend to a large extent on the mystical values associated with different forest species . Thus it is not possible to differentiate between the psychological and medical effects of a plant when investigating its effectiveness . Forest foods also feature in many cultural ceremonies : marriages , funerals , initiations , installation of chiefs , and birth celebrations , to name a few . Palm wine and cola nuts are important symbolic foods throughout humid West Africa . In Nigeria , for example , palm wine is of paramount importance at most social functions ( Okafor 1979 ) . It is used in pouring libations , offering prayers , and heralding events . Cola nuts are regarded as important symbols of welcome and hospitality . For Muslims of the region , cola nuts are sacred : something given them by the prophet . They are a symbol of friendship and feature in all festive occasions . Among the Igbo of Southern Nigeria , all discussions , prayers , and ceremonies begin with the breaking of cola nuts . Without cola , these occasions are not regarded as serious ( Okigbo 1980 ) . The seeds of Pentaclethra macrophylla are another example of symbolically important forest foods . In southwestern Nigeria , they feature in child - naming and girls initiation ceremonies ( heralding maturity ) . Bread fruit ( Treculia africana ) is served at womens burial ceremonies . It is also served during a festival staged to indicate a girls impending departure to her husbands home ( Okafor 1979 ) . Forests also provide the raw materials for many of the objects that are used in traditional ceremonies . Most musical instruments are made from forest products . For example , the Oubi ( in C\u00f4te d Ivoire ) use Cordia platythyrsa for making tam -tams . The Boual\u00e9 ( also from C\u00f4te d Ivoire ) make a musical slide / rattle with the fruit of Oncoba spinosa and Glyphaea brevis and the seed of Entada pursaetha ( T\u00e9h\u00e9 1980 ) . Similarly , the seed shells of Chrysophyllum albidum and Mammea africana are worn by dancers as rattles and the wooden strips of Ricinodendron heudelottii are used to make xylophones in Igboland , Nigeria ( Okigbo 1980 ) . Among the Mende and Dan ( C\u00f4te d Ivoire ) , masks play an important role in rituals and ceremonies ; they often represent the spirits of the forests and ancestors ( who reside in forests ) and thus express and evoke cultural links to the past ( Jedrej 1986 ) . In Gabon , Perrois ( 1971 ) notes that wood sculptures and ceremonial objects serve as vehicles of communication with ancestors ; the wood is used for different artifacts and is chosen according to the purposes and symbolic values of specific tree species . Ceremonial clothing and costumes are also often made from specific forest products . Among the Ashante in Ghana , traditional cloth is still important at festive and ceremonial occasions . For example , the bark and stem of Lannea kerstingii are used for dyeing the funeral cloth kuntunkun . The bark of Bridelia ferruginea is used for dyeing Adinkra cloth , important at other ceremonial occasions ( Annan 1980 ) . Gara cloth is a traditionally valued indigo cloth . The indigo dye of Gara is derived from the leaves of the woody climber Lonchocarpus cyanescens . Finally , masks used in ceremonies throughout the region are often made with the wood of trees that are valued for their spiritual or mystical attributes ( Jedrej 1986 , Gollnhofer et al 1975 ) . Conclusion Forests serve a variety of cultural and symbolic functions in West Africa . They are intimately linked with ancestry and cultural heritage . Forest symbols provide social structure and cultural identity in a rapidly changing environment . There is little information on the ways in which these values are changing . No studies explore the implications of changing cultural values on forest resource use . And yet , there can be little doubt that values have changed and are continuing to change . With this evolution peoples perceptions of the surrounding forest environment will undoubtedly be altered . Some researchers do however suggest that forests and their products are and will continue to be valued , in part because they symbolize cultural cohesion .","annotations":[{"text":"the tree","span":[4528,4535],"token_span":[793,794],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The Entity is experiencing a period of desirable events or states."},{"text":"growth declines","span":[4547,4561],"token_span":[798,799],"role":"Desirability","label":"Desirability","role_definition":"This role describes the state of the Entity.

Boundary Changes 1909 - 1989 After Sydney City Council was incorporated in 1842 the original boundaries remained constant until the early twentieth century , except for an expansion to take in Moore Park in 1870 . Around the edges of the City , suburban areas were incorporated as Municipal Councils from 1859 through the 1860s . Changes to Sydney City Council 's boundaries as a result of taking over responsibility for these suburban areas began in 1909 . In chronological order , the absorption and disgorgement of other municipalities by Sydney City Council has been as follows . 1909 Sydney City Council ( known as the Municipal Council of Sydney until 1949 ) took over the small and struggling Municipality of Camperdown . 1949 The City expanded further , to take in the surrounding suburban municipalities of The Glebe , Darlington , Newtown , Erskineville , Alexandria , Waterloo , Redfern , and Paddington . 1968 The City lost most of the areas it had acquired . Paddington ( north of Oxford Street ) was transferred to the Municipality of Woollahra . The Glebe was transferred to the Municipality of Leichhardt . Part of Camperdown ( west of about Church Street / Mallett Street north ) and part of Newtown ( west of King Street ) were transferred to the Municipality of Marrickville . The remaining part of Newtown , part of Darlington , and all of Erskineville , Alexandria , Waterloo and Redfern were combined to form the new Northcott Municipal Council , later re-named the South Sydney Municipal Council . Sydney City Council retained part of Paddington ( south of Oxford Street ) , part of Camperdown ( east of about Church Street / Mallett Street north ) , and part of Darlington ( corresponding roughly to the area then occupied by the University of Sydney ) . 1982 Northcott / South Sydney Municipal Council was abolished and all the areas lost to Northcott in 1968 returned to Sydney City Council . In addition , the City Council acquired responsibility for the Garden Island naval base . 1989 A new South Sydney City Council was created and Sydney City Council lost responsibility for all the areas it had acquired since 1909 and which had not already been transferred to Woollahra , Leichhardt or Marrickville in 1968 . In addition , it lost responsibility for some areas that had been inside the original 1842 boundaries , including parts of Ultimo and most of Surry Hills and the whole eastern side of the City from the Domain to Boundary Road , including Woolloomooloo and Kings Cross , Potts Point and Elizabeth Bay . In 1842 the area covered by Sydney City Council was 11.65 sq km . Since 1989 the City area has been only 6.19 sq km as a result of these changes . | 2003 2004 | South Sydney City Council was abolished and re-amalgamated with the City of Sydney in two stages ( May 2003 and February 2004 ) . Glebe was transferred from Leichhardt Council back to the City of Sydney ( May 2003 ) . The maps show the areas absorbed by Sydney City Council in 1909/1949 and in 1982 . The map Wards and Boundaries 1949 - 1959 shows the municipalities absorbed in 1949 . Camperdown , absorbed in 1909 , is the area of Phillip Ward sandwiched between The Glebe to the north and Newtown / Darlington in the south . The map Wards and Boundaries 1982 - 1988 shows the area that returned to Sydney City Council after the abolition of Northcott / South Sydney Municipal Council in 1982 , marked Newtown , Redfern , Alexandria and Waterloo . The present boundaries of the City correspond to those shown in the 1982 - 88 map , plus Glebe . The History of the Archival Records Most of the surviving records of the various municipal councils absorbed by Sydney City Council over the years are now held by the City of Sydney Archives . The Northcott / South Sydney Municipal Council recordswere inherited directly , when that Council was abolished and re-absorbed by the City in 1982 . Similarly the South Sydney City Council records ( and Leichhardt records relating to Glebe ) were transferred directlky in 2003 - 2004 as part of the re-amalgamation process . The history of the records of the other Councils is more complex and not all the facts are known . Very few Camperdown records have survived , and it is possible this is connected to the circumstances in which the City took over responsibility in 1909 . Camperdown was in serious financial difficulties . The Town Hall had been sold off in a sheriff 's sale and many records were in the hands of the official receiver . Sydney City Council officials soon complained about inadequate records . It seems the poor survival of Camperdown records is due to a combination of poor record -keeping by Camperdown officials and the dispersal of records resulting from the financial crisis . The records of the municipalities absorbed in 1949 were transferred to Sydney City Council , and seem to have been more or less dumped in the Queen Victoria Building , which by then was being used largely for Council offices and storage space . Eventually these records were transferred to the Manuscripts department of the Mitchell Library , from where they were transferred back to the City of Sydney Archives in 1992 and 2003 . Some Glebe Municipal Council records also turned up in Leichhardt Council storage during the 2003 re-acquisition of Glebe . The records that have come to the City of Sydney Archives , from the municipalities absorbed in 1949 , are not complete . For example we have very few subject and correspondence files . The principal series of records that we do have are the Minute Books , and Rate and Valuation Books . The records of the Northcott / South Sydney Municipal Council , 1968 - 1982 , by contrast are extensive and fairly complete . Using the Archives To make effective use of the archival records of absorbed Councils , your research must begin by determining which municipal council was responsible for the area you wish to look at , at the time the records would have been created . The table above , the maps below , and the notes about each municipality on the following pages can help you , as a starting point . Maps : The City of Sydney Wards and Boundaries 1949-1959 The City of Sydney Wards and Boundaries 1982- 1988 In using the maps , remember that they are based on a modern street grid . A century ago street alignments and grids were different . Many streets did not yet exist , others had different names or even ran in different directions . Street numbers also changed sometimes , when either whole streets were renumbered or new numbers were added within a street as new buildings were constructed . Click here to see a map of Newtown in 1886 , which illustrates the differences in street layouts a century ago and today . At the Archives we have maps from this period for all the municipalities absorbed in 1949 . Researchers can use them to identify nineteenth - century addresses and locations , and they also show the boundaries of Wards ( electoral areas ) within the municipalities , which is vital information for making successful use of many of the Valuation and Rate Books which are arranged according to Wards . Some areas have changed hands several times . Two examples are shown in this table . 221 King Street Newtown 1862-1948 1948-1968 1968 + Newtown Municipal Council Sydney City Council Marrickville Municipal Council 476 Gardeners Road Beaconsfield 1859 1860-1868 1868-1948 1949-1968 1968-1982 1982-1988 1989-2004 2004 + Redfern Municipal Council Waterloo Municipal Council Alexandria Municipal Council Sydney City Council Northcott / South Sydney M C Sydney City Council South Sydney City Council Sydney City Council Once you have discovered which municipality had the responsibility , you can use Archives Investigator to find out about the admistrative history of the municipality and what records are available in the Archives .

Records Series Details Some of the records series we hold , for the pre-1949 municipalities , are described generically in this table . For more information aboiut particular series , see Archives Investigator . Minute Books These records contain the records of business transacted at meetings of the Councillors . They generally include notes of : which Councillors were present , election of the Mayor , correspondence received and sent , reports submitted by Council officers about what they have been doing , discussion about current local issues of concern to the Council , and decisions reached about particular matters . The extent to which discussion among the Councillors is recorded in the Minutes varies from Council to Council . The reports by Council officers are mostly not recorded in any detail . The Minute books record meetings chronologically , and they are not generally indexed . Assessment and Valuation Books Assessment ( also called valuation ) of properties was carried out in order to determine how much each property was worth ( usually improved or unimproved capital value : ICV or UCV ) so that the right amount of rates could be levied in the following years . Properties were not always assessed / valued every year . Assessment books are records created by the municipal councils themselves , while Valuation books are copies of the records compiled by the NSW Valuer - General . Many Councils had given up doing their own assessments by 1949 , and made use of the VG 's records instead . These records are generally arranged by street addresses of the properties , not by names of property owners . They are sometimes also divided by Wards . They usually note : the property address , brief description ( eg \" house \" ) , the name of the owner , occupier and / or lessee , and details of the valuation figures . Valuation books also usually give the dimensions of the land . Rate Books Rates are taxes levied annually on real property by local government . The tax is assessed as a percentage of the value of the property . Rate books were usually compiled every year . They are usually arranged in street address order , and sometimes also divided by Wards . These records note much the same sort of details as Assessment books : the property address and brief description , name of owner , occupier or other person responsible for paying the rates , and the financial details of the rate levied and payments received . House names , where these were in use , are sometimes recorded in Rate books and / or Assessment books . Letter Books Letter books are volumes in which the Council officers made copies of the letters sent by the Council to other parties ( including other Councils , the NSW government , and private persons and organisations ) . The practise of maintaining Letter books had mostly ceased by the 1920s . The letters are copied into the books in chronological order according to the dates the originals were prepared . The books are generally indexed by the names of the persons to whom letters were addressed , and sometimes by the subject - matter of the letters as well . Letters received by the Councils were maintained in separate files , and few now survive , although the receipt of important letters ( and occasionally an abstract of the contents ) is generally recorded in the Minute books . Municipal Responsibilities In New South Wales , local government was introduced with the Sydney Corporation Act 1842 . However this legislation applied only to the City of Sydney . Municipal government for other areas of the Colony was only introduced with the passage of the Municipalities Act 1858 . This Act was replaced by new Municipalities Acts in 1867 and 1897 , and by the Local Government Act 1919 , each of which clarified anomalies , and provided new powers and responsibilities . From 1842 until 1948 , the City of Sydney remained subject to its own special legislation , while all other local governments in NSW were subject to another set of legislation . From 1949 the City of Sydney lost its special status and came under the Local Government Act 1919 . This Act was replaced by the Local Government Act 1993 which now governs all local governments in New South Wales . In addition to the major pieces of legislation discussed above , the NSW Parliament has passed ( and continues to pass ) many other laws relating to local government . These can broadly be divided into two categories : those affecting particular municipalities ( for example the Borough of Redfern Electric Lighting Act 1895 ) and those affecting a number of municipalities in a particular way ( for example the Municipal Baths Act 1896 , or the Local Government Areas Act 1948 ) . Copies of the major pieces of legislation affecting the municipal councils absorbed by Sydney City Council are available for consultation at the Archives . The major responsibilities and powers of municipal councils ( other than the City of Sydney ) for the period before 1949 are listed in the table below . It is important to understand that the creation of records by a municipality is directly related to the carrying out of its powers and responsibilities . The table is not a complete listing .

Boundary Changes 1909 - 1989 After Sydney City Council was incorporated in 1842 the original boundaries remained constant until the early twentieth century , except for an expansion to take in Moore Park in 1870 . Around the edges of the City , suburban areas were incorporated as Municipal Councils from 1859 through the 1860s . Changes to Sydney City Council 's boundaries as a result of taking over responsibility for these suburban areas began in 1909 . In chronological order , the absorption and disgorgement of other municipalities by Sydney City Council has been as follows . 1909 Sydney City Council ( known as the Municipal Council of Sydney until 1949 ) took over the small and struggling Municipality of Camperdown . 1949 The City expanded further , to take in the surrounding suburban municipalities of The Glebe , Darlington , Newtown , Erskineville , Alexandria , Waterloo , Redfern , and Paddington . 1968 The City lost most of the areas it had acquired . Paddington ( north of Oxford Street ) was transferred to the Municipality of Woollahra . The Glebe was transferred to the Municipality of Leichhardt . Part of Camperdown ( west of about Church Street / Mallett Street north ) and part of Newtown ( west of King Street ) were transferred to the Municipality of Marrickville . The remaining part of Newtown , part of Darlington , and all of Erskineville , Alexandria , Waterloo and Redfern were combined to form the new Northcott Municipal Council , later re-named the South Sydney Municipal Council . Sydney City Council retained part of Paddington ( south of Oxford Street ) , part of Camperdown ( east of about Church Street / Mallett Street north ) , and part of Darlington ( corresponding roughly to the area then occupied by the University of Sydney ) . 1982 Northcott / South Sydney Municipal Council was abolished and all the areas lost to Northcott in 1968 returned to Sydney City Council . In addition , the City Council acquired responsibility for the Garden Island naval base . 1989 A new South Sydney City Council was created and Sydney City Council lost responsibility for all the areas it had acquired since 1909 and which had not already been transferred to Woollahra , Leichhardt or Marrickville in 1968 . In addition , it lost responsibility for some areas that had been inside the original 1842 boundaries , including parts of Ultimo and most of Surry Hills and the whole eastern side of the City from the Domain to Boundary Road , including Woolloomooloo and Kings Cross , Potts Point and Elizabeth Bay . In 1842 the area covered by Sydney City Council was 11.65 sq km . Since 1989 the City area has been only 6.19 sq km as a result of these changes . | 2003 2004 | South Sydney City Council was abolished and re-amalgamated with the City of Sydney in two stages ( May 2003 and February 2004 ) . Glebe was transferred from Leichhardt Council back to the City of Sydney ( May 2003 ) . The maps show the areas absorbed by Sydney City Council in 1909/1949 and in 1982 . The map Wards and Boundaries 1949 - 1959 shows the municipalities absorbed in 1949 . Camperdown , absorbed in 1909 , is the area of Phillip Ward sandwiched between The Glebe to the north and Newtown / Darlington in the south . The map Wards and Boundaries 1982 - 1988 shows the area that returned to Sydney City Council after the abolition of Northcott / South Sydney Municipal Council in 1982 , marked Newtown , Redfern , Alexandria and Waterloo . The present boundaries of the City correspond to those shown in the 1982 - 88 map , plus Glebe . The History of the Archival Records Most of the surviving records of the various municipal councils absorbed by Sydney City Council over the years are now held by the City of Sydney Archives . The Northcott / South Sydney Municipal Council recordswere inherited directly , when that Council was abolished and re-absorbed by the City in 1982 . Similarly the South Sydney City Council records ( and Leichhardt records relating to Glebe ) were transferred directlky in 2003 - 2004 as part of the re-amalgamation process . The history of the records of the other Councils is more complex and not all the facts are known . Very few Camperdown records have survived , and it is possible this is connected to the circumstances in which the City took over responsibility in 1909 . Camperdown was in serious financial difficulties . The Town Hall had been sold off in a sheriff 's sale and many records were in the hands of the official receiver . Sydney City Council officials soon complained about inadequate records . It seems the poor survival of Camperdown records is due to a combination of poor record -keeping by Camperdown officials and the dispersal of records resulting from the financial crisis . The records of the municipalities absorbed in 1949 were transferred to Sydney City Council , and seem to have been more or less dumped in the Queen Victoria Building , which by then was being used largely for Council offices and storage space . Eventually these records were transferred to the Manuscripts department of the Mitchell Library , from where they were transferred back to the City of Sydney Archives in 1992 and 2003 . Some Glebe Municipal Council records also turned up in Leichhardt Council storage during the 2003 re-acquisition of Glebe . The records that have come to the City of Sydney Archives , from the municipalities absorbed in 1949 , are not complete . For example we have very few subject and correspondence files . The principal series of records that we do have are the Minute Books , and Rate and Valuation Books . The records of the Northcott / South Sydney Municipal Council , 1968 - 1982 , by contrast are extensive and fairly complete . Using the Archives To make effective use of the archival records of absorbed Councils , your research must begin by determining which municipal council was responsible for the area you wish to look at , at the time the records would have been created . The table above , the maps below , and the notes about each municipality on the following pages can help you , as a starting point . Maps : The City of Sydney Wards and Boundaries 1949-1959 The City of Sydney Wards and Boundaries 1982- 1988 In using the maps , remember that they are based on a modern street grid . A century ago street alignments and grids were different . Many streets did not yet exist , others had different names or even ran in different directions . Street numbers also changed sometimes , when either whole streets were renumbered or new numbers were added within a street as new buildings were constructed . Click here to see a map of Newtown in 1886 , which illustrates the differences in street layouts a century ago and today . At the Archives we have maps from this period for all the municipalities absorbed in 1949 . Researchers can use them to identify nineteenth - century addresses and locations , and they also show the boundaries of Wards ( electoral areas ) within the municipalities , which is vital information for making successful use of many of the Valuation and Rate Books which are arranged according to Wards . Some areas have changed hands several times . Two examples are shown in this table . 221 King Street Newtown 1862-1948 1948-1968 1968 + Newtown Municipal Council Sydney City Council Marrickville Municipal Council 476 Gardeners Road Beaconsfield 1859 1860-1868 1868-1948 1949-1968 1968-1982 1982-1988 1989-2004 2004 + Redfern Municipal Council Waterloo Municipal Council Alexandria Municipal Council Sydney City Council Northcott / South Sydney M C Sydney City Council South Sydney City Council Sydney City Council Once you have discovered which municipality had the responsibility , you can use Archives Investigator to find out about the admistrative history of the municipality and what records are available in the Archives .

Records Series Details Some of the records series we hold , for the pre-1949 municipalities , are described generically in this table . For more information aboiut particular series , see Archives Investigator . Minute Books These records contain the records of business transacted at meetings of the Councillors . They generally include notes of : which Councillors were present , election of the Mayor , correspondence received and sent , reports submitted by Council officers about what they have been doing , discussion about current local issues of concern to the Council , and decisions reached about particular matters . The extent to which discussion among the Councillors is recorded in the Minutes varies from Council to Council . The reports by Council officers are mostly not recorded in any detail . The Minute books record meetings chronologically , and they are not generally indexed . Assessment and Valuation Books Assessment ( also called valuation ) of properties was carried out in order to determine how much each property was worth ( usually improved or unimproved capital value : ICV or UCV ) so that the right amount of rates could be levied in the following years . Properties were not always assessed / valued every year . Assessment books are records created by the municipal councils themselves , while Valuation books are copies of the records compiled by the NSW Valuer - General . Many Councils had given up doing their own assessments by 1949 , and made use of the VG 's records instead . These records are generally arranged by street addresses of the properties , not by names of property owners . They are sometimes also divided by Wards . They usually note : the property address , brief description ( eg \" house \" ) , the name of the owner , occupier and / or lessee , and details of the valuation figures . Valuation books also usually give the dimensions of the land . Rate Books Rates are taxes levied annually on real property by local government . The tax is assessed as a percentage of the value of the property . Rate books were usually compiled every year . They are usually arranged in street address order , and sometimes also divided by Wards . These records note much the same sort of details as Assessment books : the property address and brief description , name of owner , occupier or other person responsible for paying the rates , and the financial details of the rate levied and payments received . House names , where these were in use , are sometimes recorded in Rate books and / or Assessment books . Letter Books Letter books are volumes in which the Council officers made copies of the letters sent by the Council to other parties ( including other Councils , the NSW government , and private persons and organisations ) . The practise of maintaining Letter books had mostly ceased by the 1920s . The letters are copied into the books in chronological order according to the dates the originals were prepared . The books are generally indexed by the names of the persons to whom letters were addressed , and sometimes by the subject - matter of the letters as well . Letters received by the Councils were maintained in separate files , and few now survive , although the receipt of important letters ( and occasionally an abstract of the contents ) is generally recorded in the Minute books . Municipal Responsibilities In New South Wales , local government was introduced with the Sydney Corporation Act 1842 . However this legislation applied only to the City of Sydney . Municipal government for other areas of the Colony was only introduced with the passage of the Municipalities Act 1858 . This Act was replaced by new Municipalities Acts in 1867 and 1897 , and by the Local Government Act 1919 , each of which clarified anomalies , and provided new powers and responsibilities . From 1842 until 1948 , the City of Sydney remained subject to its own special legislation , while all other local governments in NSW were subject to another set of legislation . From 1949 the City of Sydney lost its special status and came under the Local Government Act 1919 . This Act was replaced by the Local Government Act 1993 which now governs all local governments in New South Wales . In addition to the major pieces of legislation discussed above , the NSW Parliament has passed ( and continues to pass ) many other laws relating to local government . These can broadly be divided into two categories : those affecting particular municipalities ( for example the Borough of Redfern Electric Lighting Act 1895 ) and those affecting a number of municipalities in a particular way ( for example the Municipal Baths Act 1896 , or the Local Government Areas Act 1948 ) . Copies of the major pieces of legislation affecting the municipal councils absorbed by Sydney City Council are available for consultation at the Archives . The major responsibilities and powers of municipal councils ( other than the City of Sydney ) for the period before 1949 are listed in the table below . It is important to understand that the creation of records by a municipality is directly related to the carrying out of its powers and responsibilities . The table is not a complete listing . Municipalities Act 1858 In the following sections , powers and responsibilities first established in 1858 ( or later ) are not repeated under later Acts if they carried forward essentially unchanged .

Enterprising inventors , teachers , and braille users have sought to expand the possibilities of the braille cell by increasing the number of dots from six to eight . These expansions have resulted in a cell that is two dots wide and four dots high . Instead of the 63 possible dot combinations in a six - dot cell , an eight - dot cell yields 255 possible dot combinations . Typically , the dots of the eight - dot braille cell are numbered 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 downward on the left and 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 downward on the right . BANA recognizes that eight - dot braille systems have proven to be extremely useful , particularly in the technical areas such as mathematics and the sciences . While BANA currently has no official codes that incorporate eight dots , BANA plans to closely monitor all developments in the area of code extensions involving additional dots and will continue to assess their utility through its technical committees . This paper will provide an overview of eight - dot braille , its historic uses and modern developments . As the use of braille evolved throughout the world , there have been at least three instances where an eight - dot \" braille \" cell has been used for a special purpose . In each of these cases , several eight - dot braille slates were developed to enable users of the special code to write the eight - dot code in addition to reading it . Abreu . An eight - dot code was introduced in Spain for the purpose of reading and writing music notation . It was named for its creator , Gabriel Abreu , a blind music teacher . The Abreu code was officially recognized by the Royal Spanish Conservatory of Music and Oratory in 1855 to be \" an appropriate system for teaching music to the blind \" and the author was granted royal patent rights ( Aller , 1990 ) . Virtually unknown outside Spain , the Abreu system was extremely popular among its users because it evolved much more quickly than the tactile form of music developed by Louis Braille . The braille music system of the nineteenth century only covered the basics of music notation . The foundation of the more complete modern braille music code , \" Braille Music Notation , \" was not published until 1929 . Using eight dots with their 255 possible combinations , this code permitted the writing of all of the musical signs in addition to text . The four upper dots of the cell represented the musical note while the four lower dots represented the duration of the note sound . When text was present , the letters were represented in the bottom part of the cell and the upper part was only used for music signs . As is common in print music , Abreu placed each syllable of text next to its corresponding note . This arrangement was not always possible in the braille music system . Many music scores were published in the Abreu eight - dot code . The Abreu system was used in the National School for the Blind in Madrid , as well as in other regions of the country , from 1856 to well into the 1950s . While some material still exists today , a sixdot braille music code was officially adopted in Spain in the early 1950s . Stenographic Code . Another example of eight - dot braille was used in Austria and West Germany in the mid-twentieth century . This was a shorthand code used by blind stenographers . In 1943 , the Deutsche Einheitsstenographie , a six - dot stenographic code was first published . In 1952 , this code was extended by the Deutsche Verhandlungsstenographie , a seven - dot stenographic code in former East Germany . In the same year , a group of blind stenographers headed by Werner Castritius , proposed an eight - dot version for Austria and West Germany . The final version of the eight - dot stenographic code was published in 1961 . This code was widely used into the 1980s but has been slowly replaced by computer - based stenographic methods . Tenkanji and Kantenji . Tenji , the system of standard Japanese braille in use since 1890 does not permit the direct brailling of the Japanese Kanji , the Chinese characters that are used in the modern Japanese logographic writing system . It was generally thought that access to these characters could bring blind people closer to mainstream print used by sighted Japanese people thus facilitating communication and a common understanding about their language ( Dasgupta , 2002 ) . However , with over 10,000 kanji in common use , devising a braille code to represent this form of print was a formidable task . In the 1950's , Taiji Kawakami , a sighted teacher at a school for the blind in Osaka , developed kantenji , an eight - dot code to represent kanji . This code used the upper two dots of the cell to indicate that it was a kanji character and in two or three cells , constructed the braille characters to reflect the visual appearance of the original kanji . In 1966 , Sadao Hasegawa , a blind teacher at a school for the blind in Tokyo , created a six - dot braille system for brailling kanji called tenkanji . Hasegawa 's six - dot code took a very different approach from that of Kawakami . Each kanji character in six - dot tenkanji occupies three or four braille cells . Each character begins with a kanji indicator and is constructed from among several elements ( semantic , phonetic , and so forth ) of the character in an effort to avoid confusion with other characters . The selection of which elements to use to represent a character was based largely on the frequency of the word in everyday language . The introduction of computer - based technology into our everyday lives has had a profound effect on the options available to braille users . In the early 1970s , braille embossers became available from Triformation Systems , Inc. that were capable of embossing eight - dot braille . \" The Triformation embossers added a seventh and eighth dot to the braille cell , thus expanding the braille code into an eight - bit code that could display 256 combinations .... \" ( Cranmer , 2000 p.154 ) . While these were not the first machines capable of embossing braille , they were the first known units that could produce an expanded version of the North American ASCII - Braille Code . ASCII ( the American Standard Code for Information Interchange ) , the basic character code used by computers is a seven - bit code consisting of 128 characters ( 0 - 127 ) . It is composed of uppercase and lowercase letters , numbers , punctuation marks , a few special symbols , and some control characters . ASCII has 95 printable characters . To represent ASCII in six - dot braille , with only 64 combinations ( including the space ) , the ASCII values between 96 and 127 ( lowercase letters and a few punctuation marks ) had been mapped to the corresponding symbols between 64 and 95 ( uppercase letters and a few more punctuation marks ) , making upper - and lowercase letters and several pairs of punctuation marks indistinguishable when represented with a single braille cell . When more dots are available , the addition of dots seven and / or eight to some of the characters yields a unique braille symbol for each ASCII value . With these new embossers , the 95 printable ASCII characters could be represented by a single cell each . Additional cells are not needed to represent uppercase letters , the full array of punctuation marks or other ASCII symbols that have no representation in literary braille . In the expanded North American ASCII - Braille code , the uppercase letters retain their original form and are usually structured by adding dot seven at the bottom- left of the cell . This strategy generally worked well because it did not require the user to learn a completely new braille code . Having braille embossers capable of representing unambiguous text was a great boon to many blind people who were then finding employment in the burgeoning field of computer programming . But for the next ten years , eight - dot braille produced from a computer continued to be the exclusive province of computer programmers and the like . It was not until the introduction of refreshable braille displays and their use to read a computer screen that the use of eight - dot braille became more widespread among average braille users . Early refreshable braille displays , such as the Digicassette , the VersaBraille , and the Microbraille were all six -dot displays . These devices were initially developed for reading material stored in memory or on removable media . But as refreshable braille displays began to be used interactively with a computer screen , six dots proved again not to be enough to work efficiently . Again , more than six dots were needed to represent the printable characters of the ASCII character set . With the introduction of the IBM PC , an extended version of the ASCII character set was developed that included 256 characters . The additional 128 characters were mostly mathematics , graphical , and foreign characters but since braille embossers and braille displays already had eight dots , they were easily able to represent the entire range of the new eight - bit character set . By the late 1980s , most refreshable braille displays had eight dots per cell and used eight - dot braille codes that varied slightly from country to country . In addition to representing characters , the presence of the additional two dots per cell allowed the display to show highlighted or otherwise enhanced items and enabled the user to determine the location of the computer cursor or the mouse pointer without obscuring the underlying character . There is , however , still no accepted standard for eight - dot braille in the United States . Some believe that advances in computer technology may negate the need for an eight - dot braille display . Eight - dot braille became the norm for refreshable braille displays because it could provide a one - to - one representation of the computer screen , particularly in the 1980s and early 1990s , as refreshable braille devices became common in the professional world . But the computer screen of the day was a regular grid of evenly spaced characters on evenly spaced lines . More recently , the development of proportional fonts , the graphical user interface , and numerous character sets that are not limited to eight bits means that much of the benefit of the eight - dot braille concept has been somewhat mitigated . It is conceivable that braille displays of the future may return to the use of six - dot cells , reducing cost and complexity . However , the additional advantages of the enhanced display possibilities , a convenient method for displaying a cursor , the display of various text attributes , and so forth , have so far resulted in the continued production of refreshable braille displays with eight - dot cells . And what has happened with braille embossers ? Although most braille embossers of today can be configured to produce eight - dot braille , the common practice is to use refreshable braille displays to interact with the computer and emboss in six-dot braille . In general , embossed text does not lend itself as well to eight - dot braille . There is no real space saving with each line of a page occupying 33 percent more space than a six - dot line and there is much greater opportunity for confusion among similar looking characters . In most situations , embossed text is needed in contracted literary braille . Eight - dot Braille and Science . In the mid-1990s , another extension of six - dot braille was undertaken by The Science Access Project at Oregon State University . In an effort to make braille and print more directly equivalent without the need for any intermediate processing , a set of fonts called Dotsplus was developed . Dotsplus includes six - and eight - dot fonts . The six - dot font presents text similar to traditional uncontracted braille . The eight - dot font presents most two - cell characters of the six - dot font as single cells . For example , in the eight - dot font , uppercase letters , which in six - dot braille are shown with the letter in one cell preceded by a dot six in a cell by itself , are shown as the letter with an added dot seven in the bottom left corner of the eight - dot cell . In both fonts , punctuation marks and the symbols of math , science , accent marks on letters , etc. are shown as small graphic symbols very similar to their print equivalents . These fonts allow for a straightforward rendition of math and science material . The same document can be read by a blind person when embossed on a special embosser or by a sighted person when printed or viewed on a computer screen . Eight - dot Braille and Mathematics . Another relatively recent project has undertaken the task of developing an eight - dot code for mathematics . Under the auspices of the European Union , the LAMBDA Project 's goal is to develop an efficient system for blind people , especially students , to read mathematics with a refreshable braille display and synthetic speech . LAMBDA is an acronym for Linear Access to Mathematics for Braille Device and Audio Synthesis . Still in development , the LAMBDA Code is based on MathML , and , through its editor , is presented in a linear format for access with braille and speech . Because it uses an eight - dot braille cell , all of the operators and common symbols are represented by single characters . The elements of the LAMBDA code will be customized for the various countries for which it is intended . This customization will make the braille characters chosen and the language used as familiar as possible to each country 's residents . In recent years , versions of an eight - dot character set have been documented by standard - setting bodies . Unicode . In the context of defining symbols , in addition to musical , mathematical and technical symbols , the Unicode standard beginning with version 3.0 ( September 1999 ) has defined 256 eight - dot braille patterns . They can be found in the Unicode range u +2800 to u +28 ff . They are included in Unicode only as symbols , as the Unicode Standard encodes only their shapes but not their meaning . The association of letters to patterns is left to other standards . ISO . In 2001 , the International Standards Organization ( ISO ) released a standard defining the characters for eight - dot braille for Latin-based character sets . ISO / TR 11548 parts 1 and 2 are entitled \" Communication Aids for Blind Persons : Identifiers , Names and Assignation to Coded Character Sets for 8 - dot Braille Characters \" . This standard specifies the assignment of eight - dot braille to Latin alphabet 8 - bit code tables . As stated in the standard , it is \" intended to be used by experts and manufacturers of 8 - dot braille input and output devices , interfaces and software for data exchange . \" Aller , J.

Enterprising inventors , teachers , and braille users have sought to expand the possibilities of the braille cell by increasing the number of dots from six to eight . These expansions have resulted in a cell that is two dots wide and four dots high . Instead of the 63 possible dot combinations in a six - dot cell , an eight - dot cell yields 255 possible dot combinations . Typically , the dots of the eight - dot braille cell are numbered 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 downward on the left and 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 downward on the right . BANA recognizes that eight - dot braille systems have proven to be extremely useful , particularly in the technical areas such as mathematics and the sciences . While BANA currently has no official codes that incorporate eight dots , BANA plans to closely monitor all developments in the area of code extensions involving additional dots and will continue to assess their utility through its technical committees . This paper will provide an overview of eight - dot braille , its historic uses and modern developments . As the use of braille evolved throughout the world , there have been at least three instances where an eight - dot \" braille \" cell has been used for a special purpose . In each of these cases , several eight - dot braille slates were developed to enable users of the special code to write the eight - dot code in addition to reading it . Abreu . An eight - dot code was introduced in Spain for the purpose of reading and writing music notation . It was named for its creator , Gabriel Abreu , a blind music teacher . The Abreu code was officially recognized by the Royal Spanish Conservatory of Music and Oratory in 1855 to be \" an appropriate system for teaching music to the blind \" and the author was granted royal patent rights ( Aller , 1990 ) . Virtually unknown outside Spain , the Abreu system was extremely popular among its users because it evolved much more quickly than the tactile form of music developed by Louis Braille . The braille music system of the nineteenth century only covered the basics of music notation . The foundation of the more complete modern braille music code , \" Braille Music Notation , \" was not published until 1929 . Using eight dots with their 255 possible combinations , this code permitted the writing of all of the musical signs in addition to text . The four upper dots of the cell represented the musical note while the four lower dots represented the duration of the note sound . When text was present , the letters were represented in the bottom part of the cell and the upper part was only used for music signs . As is common in print music , Abreu placed each syllable of text next to its corresponding note . This arrangement was not always possible in the braille music system . Many music scores were published in the Abreu eight - dot code . The Abreu system was used in the National School for the Blind in Madrid , as well as in other regions of the country , from 1856 to well into the 1950s . While some material still exists today , a sixdot braille music code was officially adopted in Spain in the early 1950s . Stenographic Code . Another example of eight - dot braille was used in Austria and West Germany in the mid-twentieth century . This was a shorthand code used by blind stenographers . In 1943 , the Deutsche Einheitsstenographie , a six - dot stenographic code was first published . In 1952 , this code was extended by the Deutsche Verhandlungsstenographie , a seven - dot stenographic code in former East Germany . In the same year , a group of blind stenographers headed by Werner Castritius , proposed an eight - dot version for Austria and West Germany . The final version of the eight - dot stenographic code was published in 1961 . This code was widely used into the 1980s but has been slowly replaced by computer - based stenographic methods . Tenkanji and Kantenji . Tenji , the system of standard Japanese braille in use since 1890 does not permit the direct brailling of the Japanese Kanji , the Chinese characters that are used in the modern Japanese logographic writing system . It was generally thought that access to these characters could bring blind people closer to mainstream print used by sighted Japanese people thus facilitating communication and a common understanding about their language ( Dasgupta , 2002 ) . However , with over 10,000 kanji in common use , devising a braille code to represent this form of print was a formidable task . In the 1950's , Taiji Kawakami , a sighted teacher at a school for the blind in Osaka , developed kantenji , an eight - dot code to represent kanji . This code used the upper two dots of the cell to indicate that it was a kanji character and in two or three cells , constructed the braille characters to reflect the visual appearance of the original kanji . In 1966 , Sadao Hasegawa , a blind teacher at a school for the blind in Tokyo , created a six - dot braille system for brailling kanji called tenkanji . Hasegawa 's six - dot code took a very different approach from that of Kawakami . Each kanji character in six - dot tenkanji occupies three or four braille cells . Each character begins with a kanji indicator and is constructed from among several elements ( semantic , phonetic , and so forth ) of the character in an effort to avoid confusion with other characters . The selection of which elements to use to represent a character was based largely on the frequency of the word in everyday language . The introduction of computer - based technology into our everyday lives has had a profound effect on the options available to braille users . In the early 1970s , braille embossers became available from Triformation Systems , Inc. that were capable of embossing eight - dot braille . \" The Triformation embossers added a seventh and eighth dot to the braille cell , thus expanding the braille code into an eight - bit code that could display 256 combinations .... \" ( Cranmer , 2000 p.154 ) . While these were not the first machines capable of embossing braille , they were the first known units that could produce an expanded version of the North American ASCII - Braille Code . ASCII ( the American Standard Code for Information Interchange ) , the basic character code used by computers is a seven - bit code consisting of 128 characters ( 0 - 127 ) . It is composed of uppercase and lowercase letters , numbers , punctuation marks , a few special symbols , and some control characters . ASCII has 95 printable characters . To represent ASCII in six - dot braille , with only 64 combinations ( including the space ) , the ASCII values between 96 and 127 ( lowercase letters and a few punctuation marks ) had been mapped to the corresponding symbols between 64 and 95 ( uppercase letters and a few more punctuation marks ) , making upper - and lowercase letters and several pairs of punctuation marks indistinguishable when represented with a single braille cell . When more dots are available , the addition of dots seven and / or eight to some of the characters yields a unique braille symbol for each ASCII value . With these new embossers , the 95 printable ASCII characters could be represented by a single cell each . Additional cells are not needed to represent uppercase letters , the full array of punctuation marks or other ASCII symbols that have no representation in literary braille . In the expanded North American ASCII - Braille code , the uppercase letters retain their original form and are usually structured by adding dot seven at the bottom- left of the cell . This strategy generally worked well because it did not require the user to learn a completely new braille code . Having braille embossers capable of representing unambiguous text was a great boon to many blind people who were then finding employment in the burgeoning field of computer programming . But for the next ten years , eight - dot braille produced from a computer continued to be the exclusive province of computer programmers and the like . It was not until the introduction of refreshable braille displays and their use to read a computer screen that the use of eight - dot braille became more widespread among average braille users . Early refreshable braille displays , such as the Digicassette , the VersaBraille , and the Microbraille were all six -dot displays .
