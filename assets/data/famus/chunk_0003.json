Beginning in childhood , this buildup causes signs and symptoms that affect many parts of the body . Characteristic features of Fabry disease include episodes of pain , particularly in the hands and feet ( acroparesthesias ) ; clusters of small , dark red spots on the skin called angiokeratomas ; a decreased ability to sweat ( hypohidrosis ) ; cloudiness or streaks in the front part of the eye ( corneal opacity or corneal verticillata ) ; problems with the gastrointestinal system ; ringing in the ears ( tinnitus ) ; and hearing loss . Fabry disease also involves potentially life- threatening complications such as progressive kidney damage , heart attack , and stroke . Some affected individuals have milder forms of the disorder that appear later in life and affect only the heart or kidneys . Frequency Fabry disease affects an estimated 1 in 40,000 to 60,000 males . This disorder also occurs in females , although the prevalence is unknown . Milder , late - onset forms of the disorder are probably more common than the classic , severe form . Causes Fabry disease is caused by mutations in the GLA gene . This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A. This enzyme is active in lysosomes , which are structures that serve as recycling centers within cells . Alpha-galactosidase A normally breaks down a fatty substance called globotriaosylceramide . Mutations in the GLA gene alter the structure and function of the enzyme , preventing it from breaking down this substance effectively . As a result , globotriaosylceramide builds up in cells throughout the body , particularly cells lining blood vessels in the skin and cells in the kidneys , heart , and nervous system . The progressive accumulation of this substance damages cells , leading to the varied signs and symptoms of Fabry disease . GLA gene mutations that result in an absence of alpha-galactosidase A activity lead to the classic , severe form of Fabry disease . Mutations that decrease but do not eliminate the enzyme 's activity usually cause the milder , late - onset forms of Fabry disease that typically affect only the heart or kidneys . Inheritance This condition is inherited in an X-linked pattern . A condition is considered X -linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome , one of the two sex chromosomes in each cell . In males ( who have only one X chromosome ) , one altered copy of the GLA gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition . Because females have two copies of the X chromosome , one altered copy of the gene in each cell usually leads to less severe symptoms in females than in males , or rarely may cause no symptoms at all . Unlike other X-linked disorders , Fabry disease causes significant medical problems in many females who have one altered copy of the GLA gene . These women may experience many of the classic features of the disorder , including nervous system abnormalities , kidney problems , chronic pain , and fatigue . They also have an increased risk of developing high blood pressure , heart disease , stroke , and kidney failure . The signs and symptoms of Fabry disease usually begin later in life and are milder in females than in their affected male relatives . A small percentage of females who carry a mutation in one copy of the GLA gene never develop signs and symptoms of Fabry disease .

In this extract from his new biography , William Hague describes a man who was also socially awkward , hopeless with money and endured endless rumours about his sexuality It would scarcely be possible to imagine a more intensely political family than the one into which William Pitt was born on May 28 , 1759 . On his father 's side , his great-grandfather , grandfather and uncle had all been Members of Parliament . His father , 25 years an MP , was now the leading minister of the land . On his mother 's side , the Grenville family , one uncle was in the House of Lords , and two others were in the Commons ; one of them , George Grenville , was to be first Lord of the Treasury - the equivalent of today 's Prime Minister - by the time William was four years old . It was in the year of William 's birth at Hayes in south - east England that the career of his father , still also plain William Pitt , approached its zenith . Three years into what would be known as the Seven Years ' War , the elder Pitt - later ennobled as the Earl of Chatham - had become the effective Commander - in - Chief under King George II of the British prosecution of the war . He was not nominally the head of the Goverment , the position of First Lord of the Treasury being held by the Duke of Newcastle , but through his powerful oratory he dominated both Parliament and the Ministry , and was acknowledged as leader of the administration . Tall , haughty , but always eloquent , he was the great war leader who had placed himself beyond party factions to be at the service of the nation . The young William , as he became conscious of the people and events around him , would know only a world in which his father was treated as a legend . William himself soon emerged as notably bright . Indeed , his mother Hester wrote within a few weeks of his birth : \" I cannot help believing that little William is to become a personage . \" At the age of seven he was writing letters in Latin to his father . While the elder Pitt was delivering thundering orations against the Stamp Act in early 1766 , William was showing an insatiable appetite for political news . \" I expect many sage reflections from William upon the public papers , \" his father wrote to his mother . A seven-year - old with such interests in our own times would probably find them beaten out of him at school . William had the advantage of mixing almost exclusively with his own siblings , his tutor and adult family members , most of whom encouraged his political interest . His father took an active role in his education . At no other time in British history has the head of one administration acted as the tutor to another . He enjoyed passing on to William examples of eloquence from contemporary or classical writers and speakers , and asking him to study them . In addition , William showed early aptitude for mathematics . Uninhibited by peer pressure and required from the outset to meet adult standards , he developed a highly unusual ability to speak clearly , structure an argument , and think on his feet . By the time he arrived at Cambridge in 1773 , William could translate into English six or seven pages of Thucydides , without previous study of it and with barely a mistake . For a 14 - year - old to be admitted as an undergraduate was highly unusual in the 18th century , just as it would be today . A sample of undergraduate admissions to Pembroke Hall in the 20 years preceding Pitt 's arrival there suggests that fewer than one in five of them were even under 18 . Within two weeks of his arrival , however , William had fallen ill . He had been fragile since birth , with frequent coughs and colds . This time his illness was sufficiently serious for him to be sent home for a year . He was referred to his father 's physician , Dr Addington , the father of Henry Addington who was to become Pitt 's friend and , in 1801 , his successor as Prime Minister . It was at this point that Pitt received a piece of medical advice that probably influenced his social habit throughout his life and quite possibly contributed , three decades later , to his early death . Dr Addington recommended going to bed early , and ending the habit of studying classical literature into the night . He also recommended a specific diet , regular exercise on horseback and a daily quantity of port wine , variously recollected down the generations as \" a bottle a day \" or \" liberal potations \" , but at any rate a good deal of it . While this sounds surprising today , medical opinion of the time was that a regular infusion of alcohol could drive other less welcome toxins to disperse in the body and hopefully disappear . Pitt , methodical as ever , adhered to this advice throughout the rest of his life , particularly the requirement to ride and to drink port . He can be forgiven for thinking that this combination was healthy for him , since it was from this point in his adolescence that he enjoyed a substantial improvement in his health and shook off the complaints that had plagued him as a child . Five years later , in May 1778 , William Pitt was to perform his first public duty , that of chief mourner at his father 's funeral . The incident which seems to have precipitated the Earl of Chatham 's death could hardly have been more affecting . Although he had by this time retired from politics , Chatham had gone to the House of Lords to thunder against government plans to sue for peace with the American colonies . Against the advice of his doctors , he entered the Chamber supported on the shoulders of William and his son- in -law , Lord Mahon . Dramatically , the entire House rose to greet him . It is difficult to imagine that William Pitt ever forgot the poignancy of this moment and its illustration of the greatness of his father . Chatham 's voice was weak , at times his speech wandered , but his message was clear : \" In God 's name , let us at least make one effort ; and if we must fall , let us fall like men ! \" He sat down exhausted , and , trying to rise to speak for a second time , he fell backwards unable to do any more , a moment immortalised in Copley 's famous painting . He was taken to Downing Street , then two days later to Hayes , and died on May 11 . Fewer than 28 years would pass before William Pitt 's own body would join that of his father beneath the same dark stone slab in Westminster Abbey . In that time , he would equal his father 's fame and popularity while far exceeding his domination of politics and his endurance in office . Indeed , only four years later , when Pitt was 23 , he had succeeded in becoming the youngest ever Chancellor of the Exchequer . Within 18 months , he had been appointed First Lord of the Treasury . How was it that opinion in the 18th century could accept youthful seniority to an extent inconceivable two centuries later ? One explanation was that politics then was more of a younger man 's game . Ability , family connections and the sometimes early retirement or death of senior colleagues allowed some of them to rise more rapidly than could be the case in modern politics . Consequently , more than one hundred MPs in the early 1780s were under the age of 30 . The number of young prodigies in many disparate fields was also far greater than it is today . Perhaps the greater risk of early death produced an impulse to young brilliance , and certainly the intensive use of private tutors added to it : Alexander Pope wrote his first verses aged 12 ; Henry Fielding 's plays were being performed in London when he was 23 ; Adam Smith was a professor of logic at 28 . If a young man seemed brilliant enough he would be given patronage , and so it was with William Pitt . Despite their recognition of his prodigious talents , Pitt had a reputation for coldness among his political contemporaries . Shortly after Pitt became Prime Minister , the author Sir Nathaniel Wraxall wrote of his personal style : \" In his manners , Pitt , if not repulsive , was cold , stiff and without suavity or amenity . He seemed never to invite approach or encourage acquaintance , though when addressed he could be polite , communicative , and occasionally gracious . . . \" The explanation given by one of his closest companions , William Wilberforce , was a \" great natural shyness . . . and even awkwardness . . . which often produced effects for which pride was falsely charged on him \" . Pitt is himself meant to have said to Wilberforce , \" I am the shyest man alive . \" In his friends ' company however , Pitt threw off his shyness . Wilberforce described him as \" systematically witty . . . the others were often run away with by their wit . Pitt was always master of his . \" Later in his career his friends would come to regard him as \" something between God and man \" . This was in spite of his unprepossessing appearance , \" a sort of slovenly or negligent look \" that was only redeemed by his eyes , which \" lighted up in a manner quite surprising . . . you might see sparks coming from them \" . Pitt was happiest among his Cambridge companions or family . He had no social ambitions , and it was rare for him to set out to make a friend . The talented collaborators of his first 18 months in office - Beresford , Wyvil and Twining - passed in and out of his mind along with their areas of expertise . Pitt 's lack of interest in enlarging his social circle meant that it did not grow to encompass any women outside his own family , a fact that produced a good deal of rumour . From late 1784 , a series of satirical verses appeared in The Morning Herald drawing attention to Pitt 's lack of knowledge of women : \" Tis true , indeed , we oft abuse him , / Because he bends to no man ; / But slander 's self dares not accuse him / Of stiffness to a woman . \" Others made snide references to Pitt 's friendship with Tom Steele , Secretary to the Treasury . At the height of the constitutional crisis in 1784 , Sheridan had compared Pitt to James I 's favourite , the Duke of Buckingham , a clear reference to homosexuality . Socially , Pitt preferred the company of young men , and would continue to do so into his thirties and forties . It may be that Pitt had homosexual leanings but suppressed any urge to act on them for the sake of his ambitions . He could be charming to women , but it seems certain that he rejected intimacy whenever it was proffered - and would do so publicly at a later date . In practical terms it appears that Pitt was essentially asexual throughout his life , perhaps one example of how his rapid development as a politician stunted his growth as a man . As Prime Minister , Pitt 's combined salaries totalled nearly \u00a3 7,000 a year , equivalent to \u00a3 675,000 today . This was a handsome sum , and should have allowed him to live reasonably comfortably , but not extravagantly , while permitting a fair amount of entertainment , maintenance of horses , and travel . For three reasons , however , Pitt 's income never remotely kept up with his expenses . First , he had no capital , and in 1786 he ensured he never would by transferring to his mother the sum of \u00a3 5,800 which he was meant to one day receive out of his inheritance from his father . Second , he had been borrowing from 1780 onwards , since completing the purchase of his chambers in Lincoln 's Inn ( he had begun his career as a lawyer ) and had repeatedly taken on new loans in order to repay old ones . Third , despite balancing the nation 's books with great precision , creativity and care , Pitt had not the slightest interest in monitoring his own finances while he was in office . This is a common fault among politicians , many of whom to this day barely trouble to look at their bank balance until they are out of power . In Pitt 's defence , he was still only in his mid-twenties , and many people of that age are happy to borrow large amounts , confident that they can repay it in the infinity of life which stretches before them . Y et by the autumn of 1785 he could see that his financial affairs were running out of control , and , lacking the time or the patience to sort them out himself , he asked his friend Bob Smith , a banker and now MP for Nottingham , to work out where his money was going . The results were horrifying . Smith soon found forgotten and unpaid bills amounting to \u00a3 7,914 , more than Pitt 's annual income . Smith told Wilberforce that the bills for provisions \" exceed anything I could have imagined \" , and generally increased when Pitt was away , suggesting that his servants were regularly robbing him . The meat bill for January 1785 was \u00a3 96 , which in the prices of the day represented approximately 1.7 tonnes of meat . Pitt was also spending \u00a3 1,000 or \u00a3 2,000 a year on wine , but this paled into insignificance in comparison to the expense of running his stables , which for the three years from July 1783 to July 1786 had cost \u00a3 37,930 . This was a vast sum , probably sufficient to run a sizeable racing stable , which Pitt certainly did not possess . After Smith 's investigation , many of these costs were brought down , but not sufficiently to create a surplus . And for the subsequent 15 years until he left office in 1801 there is no evidence that Pitt gave any greater attention to his finances than hitherto . Despite his financial problems , he would not change his nature . In 1789 , when a group of merchants in the City of London offered him \u00a3 100,000 to pay off his debts and have a good deal left over besides , he refused point blank , saying , \" No consideration on earth could induce me to accept it . \" Lack of interest in money was an integral part of his vision of integrity and incorruptibility , even if it meant that he always owed a great deal of it . In 1786 , Pitt had rejoiced at the marriage of his sister Harriot to his great friend Edward Eliot . Soon she was pregnant , and on September 20 , 1786 the baby was born in Downing Street . Five days later , after going into a fever , Harriot died . Pitt was distraught . He had lost not only his sister , but the motivator and organiser of any hospitality for people beyond his immediate circle . The burdens of office were mounting on him ; and now , along with Harriot , his happy private household had died . The rupturing of the old circle brought new friendships and habits . Henry Dundas had already become Pitt 's right - hand man in many ways , an able and loyal deputy in House of Commons debates and an efficient political fixer . He worked hard and drank hard , two attributes which endeared him to Pitt. Indeed , Pitt would become known as a \" three - bottle man \" , a reference to his heavy consumption of port wine . The possibility that he drank up to three bottles of port at a single sitting has always seemed to modern observers to be either rather unlikely or highly eccentric . Several facts must be borne in mind . First , attitudes to alcohol were far more liberal than today . Indeed , the difficulty of obtaining clean drinking water meant that alcohol , often watered down , was considered safer and healthier . Second , port represented a very large part of British consumption of wine . One surviving cellar book of the 1760s shows the stock of port to be twice that of all other wines combined . Third , a typical bottle contained only three - quarters of a pint of liquid , little more than half the amount of a standard 75cl bottle of today . While the shapes of the bottle had changed during the 18th century to resemble those we would recognise now , they were hand - blown , with a larger punt ( the indentation at the base of the bottle ) and thicker glass . The space inside was therefore substantially smaller . Fourth , port wine in this period was often taken fortified with brandy and was therefore somewhat weaker than its namesake today . Three bottles of port in Pitt 's day would be roughly equivalent to one and two -thirds of a bottle of strong wine today . This is still a large amount of alcohol to consume , but not an unimaginable one . Pitt and Dundas evidently enjoyed outlining their future speeches and those of the opposition once the wine had been flowing . On one occasion Dundas made such a good effort as an opposition Whig that Pitt stood aside from the debate the following day and had him make the actual speech in response , to the mystification of the Commons . Ten years later , Pitt was to develop another close friendship with one of his Cabinet members . War with revolutionary France and the endless discussion of Foreign Office business frequently threw him together with his 26 - year - old protege , George Canning , a lawyer whom he had made a Foreign Office Under Secretary . There had already been grumbles around Parliament that he was too close to Pitt , and much too familiar . He had once even been seen to touch Pitt on the shoulder , an action unthinkable to most MPs . We cannot know for sure that this hero-protege relationship had no physical aspect ; some may have suspected it at the time : Pitt behaved in a strange , trance - like way at Canning 's wedding in 1800 , and in 1804 Pitt 's niece , Lady Hester Stanhope , told Canning that Pitt \" is attached to you in a way unlike what he feels about anybody else \" . As it happened , Canning witnessed a rare development in Pitt 's life - an apparently close friendship with a woman . If he was alone at Holwood , near Bromley in Kent , Pitt would travel to nearby Beckenham , to the home of Lord Auckland . There he mixed with Lord Auckland 's family , including his attractive daughter Lady Eleanor Eden . It was not long before rumours of an intended marriage between Pitt and Eleanor Eden were spreading . Pitt seems to have realised early in 1797 that the matter was getting out of hand , and on January 20 he wrote to Auckland from Downing Street : \" My Dear Lord . . . It can hardly , I think , be necessary to say that the time I have passed among your family has led to my forming sentiments of very real attachment towards them all , and of much more than attachment to one whom I need not name . . . Nor should I do justice to my own feelings . . . if I did not own that every hour of my acquaintance with the person to whom you will easily conceive I refer . . . has convinced me that whoever may have the good fortune to be united to her is destined to more than his share of human happiness . \" Whether I could have had any ground to hope that such might have been my lot , I have to reproach myself for ever having indulged the idea as far as I have done without asking myself carefully and early enough what were the difficulties in the way of it being realised . . . Having now at length reflected as fully and as calmly as I am able . . . I am compelled to say that I find the obstacles to it decisive and insurmountable . . . \" Auckland 's reply described the shock and disappointment of his wife and daughter : \" We had from an early period every reason to believe that the sentiments formed were most cordially mutual : and we saw with delight that they were ripening into an attachment which might lay the foundation of a system of most perfect happiness . . . \" He went on to probe for the nature of the \" insurmountable obstacle \" protested by Pitt but to no avail ; Pitt would only reply that \" further explanation or discussion can answer no good purpose \" . Did Pitt really fall in love with Eleanor Eden ? His use of the word \" attachment \" certainly conveyed the impression of strong affection , and in the 18th century , usually of sexual desire . In later years , Pitt was happy for others to continue to believe that had he been a private citizen he would have married Eleanor Eden . Interestingly , however , his explanation - some six or seven years later - of why he had not proceeded was varied , and might be considered less than convincing . He had thought \" she was not a woman to be left at will when business might require it , and he sacrificed his feelings to his sense of public duty \" . This sounds like a man making excuses rather than one reluctantly abandoning a passionate love . It seems unlikely then that Pitt set out with an intention to marry Eleanor Eden and later changed his mind . Of course , there are many candidates to be considered for the role of \" insurmountable obstacle \" , at least one of which is sexual . Dundas is said to have wagered \u00a3 500 that Pitt never touched a woman . At 37 years old he had no experience of intimacy with the opposite sex . It is likely therefore that he either lacked inclination or confidence , and had never even thought about Eleanor Eden in a sexual sense , while enjoying her company . The episode has been described as \" Pitt 's one love story \" . It seems unlikely he would have given it that title himself . - William Pitt the Younger , by William Hague ( HarperCollins ) , is published on September 6 .

In this extract from his new biography , William Hague describes a man who was also socially awkward , hopeless with money and endured endless rumours about his sexuality It would scarcely be possible to imagine a more intensely political family than the one into which William Pitt was born on May 28 , 1759 . On his father 's side , his great-grandfather , grandfather and uncle had all been Members of Parliament . His father , 25 years an MP , was now the leading minister of the land . On his mother 's side , the Grenville family , one uncle was in the House of Lords , and two others were in the Commons ; one of them , George Grenville , was to be first Lord of the Treasury - the equivalent of today 's Prime Minister - by the time William was four years old . It was in the year of William 's birth at Hayes in south - east England that the career of his father , still also plain William Pitt , approached its zenith . Three years into what would be known as the Seven Years ' War , the elder Pitt - later ennobled as the Earl of Chatham - had become the effective Commander - in - Chief under King George II of the British prosecution of the war . He was not nominally the head of the Goverment , the position of First Lord of the Treasury being held by the Duke of Newcastle , but through his powerful oratory he dominated both Parliament and the Ministry , and was acknowledged as leader of the administration . Tall , haughty , but always eloquent , he was the great war leader who had placed himself beyond party factions to be at the service of the nation . The young William , as he became conscious of the people and events around him , would know only a world in which his father was treated as a legend . William himself soon emerged as notably bright . Indeed , his mother Hester wrote within a few weeks of his birth : \" I cannot help believing that little William is to become a personage . \" At the age of seven he was writing letters in Latin to his father . While the elder Pitt was delivering thundering orations against the Stamp Act in early 1766 , William was showing an insatiable appetite for political news . \" I expect many sage reflections from William upon the public papers , \" his father wrote to his mother . A seven-year - old with such interests in our own times would probably find them beaten out of him at school . William had the advantage of mixing almost exclusively with his own siblings , his tutor and adult family members , most of whom encouraged his political interest . His father took an active role in his education . At no other time in British history has the head of one administration acted as the tutor to another . He enjoyed passing on to William examples of eloquence from contemporary or classical writers and speakers , and asking him to study them . In addition , William showed early aptitude for mathematics . Uninhibited by peer pressure and required from the outset to meet adult standards , he developed a highly unusual ability to speak clearly , structure an argument , and think on his feet . By the time he arrived at Cambridge in 1773 , William could translate into English six or seven pages of Thucydides , without previous study of it and with barely a mistake . For a 14 - year - old to be admitted as an undergraduate was highly unusual in the 18th century , just as it would be today . A sample of undergraduate admissions to Pembroke Hall in the 20 years preceding Pitt 's arrival there suggests that fewer than one in five of them were even under 18 . Within two weeks of his arrival , however , William had fallen ill . He had been fragile since birth , with frequent coughs and colds . This time his illness was sufficiently serious for him to be sent home for a year . He was referred to his father 's physician , Dr Addington , the father of Henry Addington who was to become Pitt 's friend and , in 1801 , his successor as Prime Minister . It was at this point that Pitt received a piece of medical advice that probably influenced his social habit throughout his life and quite possibly contributed , three decades later , to his early death . Dr Addington recommended going to bed early , and ending the habit of studying classical literature into the night . He also recommended a specific diet , regular exercise on horseback and a daily quantity of port wine , variously recollected down the generations as \" a bottle a day \" or \" liberal potations \" , but at any rate a good deal of it .

If he was alone at Holwood , near Bromley in Kent , Pitt would travel to nearby Beckenham , to the home of Lord Auckland . There he mixed with Lord Auckland 's family , including his attractive daughter Lady Eleanor Eden . It was not long before rumours of an intended marriage between Pitt and Eleanor Eden were spreading . Pitt seems to have realised early in 1797 that the matter was getting out of hand , and on January 20 he wrote to Auckland from Downing Street : \" My Dear Lord . . . It can hardly , I think , be necessary to say that the time I have passed among your family has led to my forming sentiments of very real attachment towards them all , and of much more than attachment to one whom I need not name . . . Nor should I do justice to my own feelings . . . if I did not own that every hour of my acquaintance with the person to whom you will easily conceive I refer . . . has convinced me that whoever may have the good fortune to be united to her is destined to more than his share of human happiness . \" Whether I could have had any ground to hope that such might have been my lot , I have to reproach myself for ever having indulged the idea as far as I have done without asking myself carefully and early enough what were the difficulties in the way of it being realised . . . Having now at length reflected as fully and as calmly as I am able . . . I am compelled to say that I find the obstacles to it decisive and insurmountable . . . \" Auckland 's reply described the shock and disappointment of his wife and daughter : \" We had from an early period every reason to believe that the sentiments formed were most cordially mutual : and we saw with delight that they were ripening into an attachment which might lay the foundation of a system of most perfect happiness . . . \" He went on to probe for the nature of the \" insurmountable obstacle \" protested by Pitt but to no avail ; Pitt would only reply that \" further explanation or discussion can answer no good purpose \" . Did Pitt really fall in love with Eleanor Eden ? His use of the word \" attachment \" certainly conveyed the impression of strong affection , and in the 18th century , usually of sexual desire . In later years , Pitt was happy for others to continue to believe that had he been a private citizen he would have married Eleanor Eden . Interestingly , however , his explanation - some six or seven years later - of why he had not proceeded was varied , and might be considered less than convincing . He had thought \" she was not a woman to be left at will when business might require it , and he sacrificed his feelings to his sense of public duty \" . This sounds like a man making excuses rather than one reluctantly abandoning a passionate love . It seems unlikely then that Pitt set out with an intention to marry Eleanor Eden and later changed his mind . Of course , there are many candidates to be considered for the role of \" insurmountable obstacle \" , at least one of which is sexual . Dundas is said to have wagered \u00a3 500 that Pitt never touched a woman . At 37 years old he had no experience of intimacy with the opposite sex . It is likely therefore that he either lacked inclination or confidence , and had never even thought about Eleanor Eden in a sexual sense , while enjoying her company . The episode has been described as \" Pitt 's one love story \" . It seems unlikely he would have given it that title himself . - William Pitt the Younger , by William Hague ( HarperCollins ) , is published on September 6 .

Tony , a Welsh shepherd who had emigrated to NS in 1967 , wrote at the request of the North American Clun Forest Association , the following history of those Cluns in North America . Tony 's story is of particular interest for a number of reasons , not the least of which is the following statistic : of the ten original ewes still owned by Tony Turner in the Spring of 1980 ( all of those ewes going on 14 years of age ) , one was empty , three had singles , and six ' had their usual twins !' We bought the Cluns from Ray Williams in the late summer of 1970 while preparations were going ahead for the first \u201c great importation \u201d of sheep from Britain to Nova Scotia . Most people bought Scottish Blackfaces either of their own accord or on advice . In fact , about 1,200 of the total consignment of 1,400 were \u201c Blackies . \u201d There were a few other breeds , of course . A small flock of North Country Cheviots for the Nova Scotia College Farm , a few \u201c Bluefaced \u201d ( Hexham ) Leicesters for crossing with the Blackfaces , and one or two Colbred \u201c improvers \u201d that I believe went on to Ottawa . Most of my friends supposed we would buy Welsh Mountain ewes , but for a variety of reasons I thought the Cluns would be a better choice . So far , I see no reason to doubt the wisdom of this . If you want sheep to thrive on the most inhospitable and barren slopes imaginable \u2013 well , the Welsh ewe is unbeatable . But in Nova Scotia , where there is plenty of feed in summer and where the winters can be hellish ( and the sheep have to be fed ) , then I think the Clun is the ideal animal . I telephoned Ray one evening to ask if he could send forty ewes and two rams . He asked later if we wanted him to send a Suffolk ram as well ( ! ) \u2013 not realizing that these would be the first Cluns in Canada . I declined ! After all the usual quarantine and testing procedures , these forty - two animals eventually boarded a ship ( I believe it was the Shorthorn Express ) and left Glasgow in the fall . I believe it was a Dutch ship , with a Spanish crew , carrying British sheep to Canada ! Before the arrival at Quebec , six ewes were to die . The first of these was one of the Cluns . In fact , this was the only one to die for the next three years . ( I 'm told she had a perforated duodenal ulcer ) . The consignment arrived in Nova Scotia by Canadian National Train on Armistice Day 1970 . A lot of people were very taken by the appearance of the Cluns , but several asked , \u201c Where are the rams ? \u201d They were there , but unlike many other breeds of animals , the Clun ram is often little bigger than the ewes . Nonetheless , those two rams , one of Pedwardine breeding , the other a Woodhouse ram , left a wonderful legacy of good , prolific , and hard - working progeny . Perhaps I should explain that some of the conditions of entry under quarantine rules are that the animals have to be at least three and a half years of age and the ewes must not be in lamb . This naturally made the selection of two \u201c old \u201d unrelated rams from his own flock very difficult for Ray , especially as he was not allowed to go out to acquire any others owing to the short notice and stringent quarantine regulations . In addition , in Canada the sheep and their progeny had to be kept on the quarantine farm until the first lamb was thirty months old , thus effectively making approximately three years in seclusion . Of late , quite unreasonably , the US Government has decreed a sixty - month period . With an extra sixty days added before the imported sheep can move from Canada to the States , this period is now almost six years ! ( ed. note : as of 1999 , live sheep can no longer be imported into the US from Canada unless they were born in Canada ) . As many people say , \u201c The bloody things will be dead by then ! \u201d At nine and a half years old , I suppose a great many might be , except , of course , that their progeny are younger . The first lamb arrived February 1971 \u2013 St. Paul 's 27C . She has just lambed again for the ninth time . This effectively proved that despite man 's efforts , when a ewe and a ram meet , even on the dockside in Quebec , nature has it 's way ! That first year our lambing percentage was 150 % , not too bad considering the lack of flushing and the thousands of miles they had traveled . Over the years , our lambing has not gone below 150 % and has gone as high as 180 % . Because I 'm not over - fond of triplets , I think perhaps 1972 was our best year \u2013 30 sets of twins and nine singles , not counting the yearlings . We 've had triplets , of course , but much prefer just a nice lot of twins . Actually , the ewes have never really been flushed or fed grain , except at lambing time , because I ca n't really see the wisdom of buying expensive feed for an animal that can do admirably on a diet of grass . A final note on the importation : in addition to the two original rams we brought in then , in 1973 another Woodhouse ram of a different strain was selected for us and sent over by the secretary of the Clun Forest Sheep Breeders ' Society . About twelve years ago , Tom Lloyd - Jones imported a ram from the Knockmaroon flock in Ireland . Thus , when Angus Rouse 's 1977 ram clears quarantine this year , there will be five registered ' ram lines ' available . I have found , however , that with as few as three sires in use , it is not too difficult to avoid in - breeding , so long as you keep good records on both sides and your fences are reasonably safe ! ( ed. note : Angus Rouse imported additional Cluns from the UK on two occasions . Those animals were available to US breeders in 1982 and 1993 . Since then , semen has been imported and used by a number of breeders . ) In 1973 , at the first Nova Scotia Sheep Fair in Truro , we importers had our first opportunity to sell breeding stock . Luckily , the powers that be had permitted us all to dispose of surplus lambs from the three lambing seasons prior to being released from quarantine . This enabled us to realize a small sum to help us wait out the three years ' lack of income . The only other return , had , of course , been the sale of our wool , and we all know what a small percentage of the gross return from sheep - keeping this represents . Most of the importers sent sheep to the sale and I think everyone was well pleased with the support and interest it engendered . In addition to the Sale , the Fair became from the outset a \u201c Fair \u201d with everything from sheepdog trials to demonstrations ( culinary as well as husbandry and breed displays ) , to craft shows , to shearing competitions , all in addition to the raison d'\u00eatre \u2013 the Sale . Buyers for this were present from many parts of the States and Canada , and indeed I believe they still attend . We consigned 45 CLuns , of which 35 were Nova Scotian born sheep . Al the ewes were sold and most of the rams . Most went to buyers from the Maritime provinces , but the seeds of the North American Clun Forest Association were planted when two American families bought Cluns at Truro . These good folks were Annette and Warn Menhennett from Pennsyvlania , and Joe Lavieri from Connecticut . One might think that after three years ' supervised quarantine the sheep would have been judged healthy . But no ! Those sheep headed for the US had to go back to their NS homes and wait out an additional 60 days for their release from quarantine . Eventually , however , they did reach their new homes and acquitted themselves well . Four years to the day of the original arrival of the Cluns in Nova Scotia , on Armistice Day of 1974 , the North American Clun Forest Association was founded in Harrisburg , PA . Those present were Joe Lavieri of CT elected President , myself elected Vice President , Annette Menhennett of PA elected Secretary , and Walter Maxwell of IA , Tom Lloyd - Jones of NY ( who was an earlier importer ) , and John Ubbens of PA . That year Walter Maxwell came up from Iowa for sheep , and returned again in the summer of 1975 , as did Annette Menhennett . After this , the number of breeders increased markedly . In the intervening years there have been annual meetings in Connecticut , Nova Scotia , Iowa , Vermont , Wisconsin , and Oregon . Joe Lavieri served as Secretary from 1976 - 78 ; I was President for those same years , followed by Walter Maxwell as President , with Joan Mueller and Elizabeth Reedy as co-Secretary / Treasurers . Since the founding of the Association , numbers of breeders and sheep have continued to increase . During the past two years , two major dispersal sales , first that of the Menhennett flock due to health reasons , and most recently my own flock , since my family is returning to Wales , have meant the enlargement of existing flocks and establishment of small new ones . Almost all our sales have been by private treaty , the largest single one being in January of this year ( ed. note : 1981 ) when breeders met in Iowa to collect stock to go to Oregon , Oklahoma , Iowa , Wisconsin , and Michigan . While we were in Nova Scotia , we sold only a few sheep to Canadians . After moving to Vermont , however , our buyers came increasingly from Canada , and in 1978 , for example , we sold five small flocks into PEI , Ontario , and Quebec . It would appear now that the breed has certain well - established ' strongholds ' in North America \u2013 New England , the Midwest , the Northwest , and Ontario \u2013 with selected other places such as Nova Scotia , and , the Virginias . Breeders are slowly but surely discovering the attributes of the Clun which cau sed me to select the breed for importation ten years ago and which have been yearly reaffirmed over the past decade . First among these attributes for me has been their ability to lamb with ease and without assistance . Over the past nine seasons , with numbers of ewes lambing ranging from 39 in the first year , to over 100 , assistance has been necessary an average of only once a year , and twice to the same ewe , each time with triplets , which were in a tangle the second time , but which she went on to raise , as always , without any assistance from us . Generally speaking , lambing has been a pleasure . Clun lambs are very quick on their feet , almost as quick as real mountain breeds like the Welsh Mountains and the Scottish Blackfaces , etc . Also there is virtually none of this business of having to teach lambs to suck , or the ewe to clean off and nurse her offspring , which seems to be such a feature of North American farming . Naturally we have had the odd case of rejection , but almost always with one of twins , but on the other hand , I 've found the Clun more adaptable than most breeds in accepting an extra lamb if she only had one . As regards general health , we 've only had the usual problems . The sheep have grown well and longevity and fertility speak for themselves . We 've suffered the usual North American problem with vitamin E deficiency in both NS and VT ( ed. note : selenium deficiency ) . Footrot was also a problem in the first year . Apparently some of the 1,400 - odd immigrants must have infected the rest , because several other importers ran into this problem . Luckily , however , we were able to get rid of it , perhaps because our farms have been dry ones for the most part . In all other regards , the Clun has proved in my experience to be the same thrifty breed it is in Great Britain , an excellent forager who actually does better on grass than grain , and as well on clover hay as on alfalfa . New breeders I have talked with over the past few years have made similar discoveries , and in general seem well pleased with their Cluns . We are glad to have played a part in the establishment of the breed in North America and expect to hear much about its growth on this continent . Cluns have been called the 'ideal mothering breed . ' I only wonder how long it will be before they emulate their record in Britain and become North America 's most popular and widespread purebreed .

FX 's Justified has returned , and with it , our weekly postmortems with showrunner Graham Yost , who 'll once again take us inside the writers room . He penned the season 4 premiere , \u201c Hole in the Wall , \u201d which introduced a season - long mystery somehow involving Arlo ( Raymond J. Barry ) ; Patton Oswalt 's recurring character , Constable Bob Sweeney , who proved a help to Raylan ( Timothy Olyphant ) ; and a snake-handling preacher ( Joe Mazzello ) , who 's already hurting Boyd 's ( Walton Goggins ) revenue . Bonus : it also included a reference to Yost 's Speed screenplay ( did you catch it ? ) . ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY : We 've talked before about you not wanting to repeat yourself by giving this season one big bad guy , which is why you opted for one big mystery instead . But what 's the inspiration for this particular mystery ? GRAHAM YOST : There is a thing nicknamed the Bluegrass Conspiracy . It did involve a guy who plummeted to his death in a streamer parachute with a lot of cocaine on him , and that was in the South . He landed in Tennessee . His name was Drew Thornton , a Lexington kid who was a lawyer and a cop and got in bad with drugs . It happened in 1985 . I know next week 's episode is called \u201c Where 's Waldo ? \u201d but is there a story behind the name Waldo Truth , which is on the driver 's license Raylan found with that Panamanian diplomatic bag in the wall of Arlo 's home ? Yes . It 's a silly story , but there you go . Our new writer , Leonard [ Chang ] was manning the board and scribbling things down . We were breaking episode 2 [ when we meet the Truth family ] , and he just wrote down Mother , and then the next word was Truth . So it was something about Mother and then \u201c Truth comes out , \u201d and I said , \u201c Oh , I like Mother Truth , it 's sort of like Brecht 's Mother Courage . \u201d And so that last name stuck . The first name , Waldo , comes from this bad pitch I made last year . I 'm very bad at names , and I just called a character Waldo and we all laughed at me for calling a character Waldo , so this year , we decided , well , let 's call this guy Waldo Truth . When we talked for EW 's Winter TV preview , you said Arlo would do something at the end of this episode that you hoped was shocking , and that it would set the mystery in motion . Did he slit the throat of that guy who overheard him talking to Raylan about the bag to protect Raylan , himself , or someone / something else ? You know , one of the things in Elmore [ Leonard ] 's world is people do n't change that much . So if Arlo does something like that , it 's probably not to save Raylan . I had originally pitched that Arlo would grab the guy and slashed his femoral artery , and Michael Dinner [ who directed the episode ] said , \u201c Yeah , that 's pretty hard to read , I need him to go for the neck , \u201d and I said , \u201c Okay \u201d and it became very bloody . The author the guy talks about is one of my favorite authors , Alan Furst , who writes these fantastic WWII - era spy thrillers , and so I thought I 'd get a little plug in for Alan because I love his stuff . You also had a Big Lebowski reference in this episode . Lebowski is a touchstone for the writers and for our line producer Don Kurt . We just always refer to Lebowski . And [ EP ] Fred Golan , in fact , has a Lebowski Fest poster on his office wall , and he 's been to Lebowski Fest and met the real Dude . Let 's talk about the bail jumper , Jody ( Chris Chalk ) : It makes me nervous that he knows Raylan 's name . I assume we 'll see him again . Oh , we might be lookin ' around episode 7 , perhaps . Really , the reason for the character was that we wanted to see Raylan doing something that he should n't be doing , which is grabbing a bail jumper . Once we landed on that for our first story , then we started looking for parallels . How could this guy have something [ kids ] that might trigger something in Raylan ? Whose idea was it for Raylan to shoot the air bag in Jody 's car ? It came out of the room . I 'm not sure who exactly thought of it . But I know I very quickly looked it up on YouTube and saw that it could happen . [ Laughs ] Fact-checking ! MythBusters wo n't have to get you on that . It can happen . I do n't think that it would happen every time . I think in the YouTube video I saw , it was a guy shooting one with a rifle and it took a few shots , but , you know , we 're doing a TV show and Raylan 's cool , so \u2026 I always enjoy watching Raylan deal with people who are amateurs . Tell me about Roz ( Alexandra Kyle ) and Benny ( Casey Brown ) , who stole his car . Her flashing him was just something we thought would be weird , odd , and hopefully funny . But that whole scenario \u2014 the pretty young girl distracting someone while someone else is stealing their car \u2014 is something that [ producer / writer ] Chris Provenzano and [ executive story editor ] Ingrid Escajeda heard down in Harlan on a research trip [ last year ] . And that the cars would be stolen and sold for scrap and not sold as automobiles \u2014 it 's just a faster way to get a little bit of cash . And the idea of junkies stealing rich kids ' bikes , is that something they heard in Harlan as well ? No , that 's something I came across . I did a little bit of research about bicycle thieves . You find out a lot of bicycle thieves are junkies . You 'd been wanting to find a role for Patton Oswalt , who 's been a vocal fan of the show . How did Constable Bob Sweeney and the idea that he would ask people to pull on him come up ? That was something that came out of Chris and Ingrid 's trip , too . They met someone who suggested something like that , although the guy that they met was actually really competent . We just thought it would be a funny little affectation of Constable Bob's . When does Bob make his next appearance ? He appears in episode 5 . As long as Patton is available and wants to play , we want to be able to go back to him . He just does a great job , and I finally got to meet him last Saturday night when we had our little Justified premiere , and that was a real treat . I rarely go out to set . But Fred Golan , of course , has become a text buddy of Patto n's . We talked a lot about Chekhov 's Gun last season in regard to when Quarles would use his rail gun . I feel like we have n't seen the last of Bob 's go bag . There is something in a later episode . It 's not really fulfilling the Chekhov dictum , but it does come into play again , yes . And Raylan asking Bob to hold onto his family photos ? There is an element of his past that he 's not totally willing to toss into the dumpster . Raylan has very fond memories of his mother . His youth is n't just his dad . And that will come into play in the fifth episode as well \u2014 the photos and his family history . Speaking of history , what should we take away from that story of Bob putting a guy in a coma in high school ? There 's an aspect to him of being a cop wannabe and all of that , but he did put a guy in a coma , so there is an element of real danger to the guy . And in episode 1 , he does stab poor Roz in the foot . I loved the shot of him deciding whether to stab Jody or Roz . Choosing Roz was smart . Yeah , there was this movie years ago where these two SWAT cops have a debate , what do you do in a situation like that , and one of them says , \u201c Shoot the hostage . \u201d I ca n't remember what the movie was . Speed ! That 's right ! So it 's a tiny homage to the old bus movie . NEXT : Boyd 's got an old buddy and a new enemy , Ellen May has a problem with furries You introduced another new recurring character , Colton Rhodes ( Ron Eldard ) . I 'm guessing Boyd called him in because he plans on moving Johnny ( David Meunier ) out of the inner circle ? A little bit , yeah . What can you tease about him ? In the second episode , he 's smart , he 's observant \u2014 he was good at his job as an MP . But you look at Ron Eldard with the long hair and kind of unkempt , and you know that this guy did n't get discharged from the military last week . Life has maybe not been going exactly the way he hoped it would upon his return . So , he has issues , and those issues will start to manifest themselves more at the end of the fourth episode , and that takes us somewhere for the rest of the season . He 's obviously fine with Boyd putting a firecracker in a man 's lap , which was a fun scene . That just goes back to Boyd likes to blow sh\u2013 up and make money . It just suggested itself as something cool to do with Boyd in the first episode , and it also starts the mystery of what 's been happening in the past couple of months in Harlan and why things are n't going perfectly for Boyd and Ava as they build their criminal empire . Before we get into the Last Chance Holiness church , how soon will we find out why Boyd is hiding that money he collected \u2014 even from Ava ? That was surprising . I think it 's in maybe our sixth episode or something that you get a hint of what 's going on with that money . But we liked the parallel of both Raylan stashing his money in his sock drawer and Boyd sticking the money up in the ceiling . And there 's more money up there , so Boyd 's got a plan . You would not be off - base if you surmised that both Raylan and Boyd are kind of planning for the future . On to Preacher Billy ( Mazzello ) . I know you sent those two writers to a snake - handling church on that Harlan trip . In this episode , we heard that Billy and his sister Cassie ( Lindsay Pulsipher ) lost their father and grandfather to snake bites . Was that foreshadowing ? Well as Chekhov says , \u201c The snake that 's introduced in the first act will bite in the third . \u201d [ Laughs ] That 's all I 'm gonna say about that \u2026 But did I tell you about the million dollar bill ? Chris and Ingrid actually brought one back from Harlan . Someone was handing these out , and it was basically a flier for a church . We 've got it somewhere in the writers room . That really struck us . But one of my favorite moments I think is Abby Miller playing Ellen May and she thinks it 's real . And then the pay off to that , and it was Tim 's idea , that when Ava looks at it , Ellen May says , \u201c It 's not real \u201d and Ava gives that look like , yeah , I know . Dear , Ellen May . Let 's talk about her shooting the furry . I have no personal experience with furries , although I think Tim , when he was shooting a movie in Pittsburgh , was at a hotel where they had a furry convention . He said it was really kinda weird to go through the lobby and see all these furries around . I 'm trying to remember . [ Laughs ] We wanted Ellen May to shoot someone , let 's put it that way , and so one thing leads to another . We wanted her to get into trouble with Ava and Boyd and just have this low moment , and we felt her shooting something was suitably justified . Episode 2 launches into a story line for Raylan and Lindsey ( Jenn Lyon ) . But will we see the woman who called Raylan for help with the bail jumper again ? You mean Sharon Edmunds [ Aja Evans ] , named after an old grade school friend of mine ? Yes , we will see Sharon again . And will she and Raylan be having sex again ? They will not have sex again . I am sorry . They 're very attractive naked people , but we 've given you your thrill in the first episode . Last question : Why is Raylan 's hair so long this season ? [ Laughs ] Tim just said he wanted to have it longer , and we said , \u201c Okay . \u201d Gutterson 's hair is a little longer this season , too . Art 's hair is not longer . Put that in there and see if Nick Searcy reads this .

Lt. Col. William A. Hamilton , Jr. '40 arrived in the Philippines on Nov. 1 , 1941 and was stationed at Camp Mills on Corregidor Island . As April 21 approached , an Aggie general in command at Corregidor called for the names of all A&M men on the island . Under nearly constant bombardment , they were not able to physically gather together , but a story wired back to the U.S. of their San Jacinto Day roll call became famous nationwide . The tradition of Aggie Muster became legend , and Aggies returned to Corregidor in 1946 for a famous \u201c Victory Muster \u201d and photo ( AggieNetwork.com / Corregidor ) . Of the couple dozen Aggies on Corregidor in 1942 , only 12 survived the battle and the POW camps . Hamilton recalled his three years as a POW in a 2013 interview with The Association of Former Students . Read his story here :","annotations":[{"text":"Lt. Col. William A.

I remember noting the dryness of the landscape while patrolling through April into early May . Places normally exhibiting pools of standing water ; the low ground west of Route One , Town Farm Road , and the Greenbelt property off of County Road , were nearly parched and less verdant than usual . Bull Brook was all but a trickle , and the spring rush of the Ipswich River had long past . It would be a tough summer for lawns and gardens , and I wondered how Marini Farms would struggle to irrigate their crops . The dry pattern continued until the weekend of May 13 and 14 \u2013 Mother 's Day weekend , when Eastern New England and Essex County in particular would be subjected to days of relentless , pouring rain with a full moon to boot ! This storm would cause millions of dollars in property damage , cause deaths and leave Ipswich nearly isolated from neighboring communities . With the Jet Stream dropping south of the normal west - east flow pattern , a strong high pressure system in Eastern Canada blocked the tropical , moisture laden air streaming up the east coast . Unable to exit over the ocean , this air mass remained stationary over New England , bringing rain , wind and more rain . The storm began in earnest on Saturday May 13 , and at first seemed a mere inconvenience to the folks scurrying to complete weekend errands and plan their celebrations for Mom . However , by the afternoon hours it was clear that we were in for an unprecedented weather event , one that forecasters termed \u201c A Hundred Year Storm . \u201d That night I listened at home as the rain hammered against the roof and gutters . The dawn came dark and foreboding . I woke to see ponds of water on all four sides of our little ranch house and a wide stream of water flowing through the backyard and spilling into the bulkhead . I scrambled to add a second pump into the sump hole , then waded into the freshet and wrestled old brush , limbs and other blockages from the usually bone dry drainage ditch out back . Late for work , I wished Josie a Happy Mother 's Day , and reported for duty . At the station - house , the dispatch room was buzzing with phone calls , police and fire radio transmissions , status boards , weather reports and dozens of other storm related activities . Detective Charlie Cooper was Emergency Management Director then , and he was up to his ears in questions , complaints and coordination tasks . Charlie being Charlie , he was equal parts of aggravation and excitement over the crisis at hand , and was completely up to the task . Off duty cops , firefighters and dispatchers were called in as DPW crews struggled to keep the roads open . County Road was severely flooded by Saltonstall Brook just south of the phone company building , and a police cruiser and several other vehicles had been disabled while trying to traverse the roadway . By 10:00 am this road was closed and Route 1A - 133 traffic was diverted through Essex , Northgate and Argilla Roads . The flooding would eventually extend beyond Lane 's End , inundating several nearby homes and the Giles Fermin Playground . High Street flooded in the area of Browns Pond and become impassable in spots . Areas of Topsfield Road were submerged and this road would be closed before days end . Bull Brook was surging across Linebrook Road with waters draining from Willowdale Forrest . The hydraulic power was so intense that late in the afternoon , the culvert collapsed and Linebrook Road just washed away , isolating the area west of Galicki Farm . Responding to emergencies and calls for assistance was a challenge . Linebrook Fire Station was opened and fully staffed . A police cruiser and ambulance were stationed west of Marini Farms in order to provide coverage of the outer Linebrook area . Route One in Topsfield was closed in the area of the fairgrounds by the swollen Ipswich River . People attempting to drive south toward Boston were forced to drive out to Route 95 in Georgetown . Tragically , two men died in separate incidents in Topsfield . On May 16 , James Eldkin , who lived in New Hampshire and worked on Route One in Ipswich , was found drowned in his swamped vehicle on Salem Road . On Sunday , May 21 , the body of Melvin Hughes of Topsfield , an employee of the Postal Service and beloved presence at the Agawam Diner , was recovered near Rowley Bridge Road days after he had been reported missing by his family . His swamped and flooded vehicle was discovered nearby . Both men had been caught on lonely , flooded roadways while driving to work in the pre-dawn darkness . Others had better fortune , and the I.P.D. answered a number of calls of stranded motorists who ignored common sense and attempted to drive through barricaded and flooded streets . Tow truck companies earned a lot of soggy dollars that weekend . On the morning of Monday , May 15 , schools remained closed as South Main Street began to flood . This was caused in part by the new River Walk Footbridge acting more like a dam than a pathway . The river waters were pushed laterally , onto both South Main Street and the EBSCO parking lot and archives building . I watched in dismay as the water lapped across South Main onto the War Memorial and into the police station parking lot . Further down South Main , the waters crept up between the buildings and spilled out onto the street . By 2:00 pm we were evacuating people from their apartments and at 4:35 pm , South Main Street was closed to traffic . By Tuesday , May 16 , the rain began to taper off , but the destruction continued . Portions of Lakemans Lane were crumbling , and by noontime the integrity of the County Street Bridge was so precarious that it was closed to vehicles and pedestrians . This was followed by the closure of the Choate Bridge and the establishment of a detour for 1A - 133 traffic onto Poplar Street , Turkey Shore Road and Green Street . As the river expanded behind EBSCO , the waters rose up along the alleyways and onto Market Street , flooding the basements of every building and meeting the waters of Farley Brook as they gushed from the blocked storm drains . The downtown flooded and by 2:00 pm , Market Street was closed . All businesses lost power and workers moved frantically to protect or salvage whatever property they could reach . Folks could be seen walking silently along Market Street with anguished looks , taking photos and standing witness to the damage and the relentless power of nature . Ipswich had received 10.97 inches of rain . The Ipswich River would crest at 10 \u2032.67 \u2033 . The normal flood stage is 7 \u2032 . The flow rate was nearly twenty times the norm . Street drainage systems were overwhelmed , leaving many neighborhoods inundated . It was estimated that nearly half the homes in town received water damage of some degree . The Ipswich Fire Department responded to over 250 requests to pump flooded basements . The Police Station , Linebrook Fire Station , Library , Town Hall , Cemetery Office and Power Plant all received rain and flood related damage . On Tuesday , the first concerns of erosion at the Mill Road Bridge were reported by Officer Ted Lemieux . He was working a traffic post there and observed the bridge shift as the detoured cars and trucks passed over the ancient structure . The river had risen so high that the roadbed sandwiched between the arches and pavement had flushed away . The police and DPW continued to monitor the integrity of the bridge throughout the night , and by 10:30 on Wednesday morning , this bridge was closed to traffic . Fortunately , at the same time the Mill Road Bridge was closed , the County Street Bridge passed inspection and was re-opened to traffic . This relieved the South Side neighborhood of bumper to bumper cars along narrow streets \u2013 at least until the Green Street intersection where the traffic stalled again . West of downtown , emergency repairs had been made on Linebrook Road at Bull Brook , once again allowing traffic to outer Linebrook and beyond . By Thursday , May 18 , the river had begun to recede ever so slightly , allowing the reopening of South Main Street . Just before noon that day , I received a call of a vehicle in the water near the submerged Willowdale Bridge . Joining me there was Fire Department Lieutenant Jeff French and a crew of firefighters . We were shocked to see a small vehicle had driven beyond the barricade deep into the flooded roadway . I put binoculars on the vehicle for a better view and saw the swirling waters nearly up to the window well . It was difficult to see if anyone was inside and I had not observed anyone on Topsfield Road as I was driving to the call . Could the person be trapped in the vehicle ? Did they attempt to walk off and get swept downstream ? Had the Ipswich River claimed the life of another motorist ? Jeff French is a brave , can - do firefighter . He looked out at the car bobbing in the water and after weighing the risks decided to try to reach the vehicle . He donned a survival suit and harness , and tethered to a long line held by the rest of us , slowly made his way into the rushing river . From my position on dry land I could see the vehicle afloat and bobbing sideways by the force of the flow . Jeff struggled in the waist-deep water and when he reached the vehicle signaled to us that no one was inside . He looked around the immediate area for signs of an operator , then we reeled him back to shore and wondered what to do next . As it turned out , the operator was safe and sound . He had been attempting to join a group of fellow bird watchers at Appleton Farms and had gotten confused by the many detours . His GPS told him to take Willowdale Road , and well , who pays attention to barricades and water anyway ? After his engine flooded he abandoned ship and walked out to Topsfield Road where he was picked up by a passer - by to join his fellow avian enthusiasts . He forgot to call us about his flooded car though , and when he returned was dismayed to see it being towed away . More hard earned , soggy dollars for the tow truck operator . Throughout the flood , the Town Wharf parking lot was submerged as the river roared past creating a whirlpool at Ringbolt Rock . There was very little tidal activity ; the river seemed continually at flood stage . The launch dock strained against the force of the water and needed to be secured so as not to be torn from the seawall . The fresh water pouring downstream crashed at the bend creating a cascading effect of water on water . Local clammer Paul Damon recalled that the amount of rainwater flowing to the bay impacted the clam flats with closures and devastation of the Razor Clam beds for weeks to come . As the flood waters receded , damage estimates were complied by Charlie Cooper in hopes of gaining Federal Disaster Assistance . It was clear that Ipswich had received unprecedented storm related damage . In addition to the bridge closures and lost roadways mentioned above , storm water culverts at Fellows Road , Old Right Road , Boxford Road and Sagamore Road had been destroyed at an estimated cost of at least $ 40,000 . Over two and a half miles of roadway shoulders had been washed away and replaced , as well as portions of Jutland Way , Heartbreak Road , Labor In Vain , Sagamore and County Roads . The storm water drainage system in Farley Brook was impaired as well as the ongoing storm water drainage project in the Green and Summer Street area which had washed out costing an additional $ 45,000 to repair . Most of the businesses on the east side of Market Street were heavily damaged and required replacement of electrical and plumbing utilities as well as structural repairs . More than 35 business establishments remained closed , and some would never reopen . EBSCO Publishing lost an entire inventory of archival material estimated in the millions of dollars . Both the Choate and County Street Bridges would require major repairs beneath the waterline . Diver-repairmen from Black Dog Underwater Construction of Deer Island Tunnel fame were called in . This work was done round the clock in series . The Mill Road Bridge required a different treatment involving drilling through the arch stones and stitching them together with rods of steel and grout . This work was done by a company from Canada that specialized in the restoration of historic , stone arch bridges . After two years and lots of money , the \u201c back road to Beverly \u201d was reopened \u2013 much to the chagrin of the neighbors who had grown fond of their quiet seclusion . And who could blame them ? The storm did have some positive aspects , I suppose . Neighbors pitched in to help each other , and the ability of the various town departments to handle a wide spread emergency was tested and met . For those of us who live near and appreciate the beauty of the river , perhaps the most important revelation was a new found awareness that severe weather events could happen anywhere \u2013 even in sleepy old Ipswich .

Compare Aesch . Seven 1005 ff . A different version of the story is told by Hyginus , Fab. 72 . According to him , when Antigone was caught in the act of performing funeral rites for her brother Polynices , Creon handed her over for execution to his son Haemon , to whom she had been betrothed . But Haemon , while he pretended to put her to death , smuggled her out of the way , married her , and had a son by her . In time the son grew up and came to Thebes , where Creon detected him by the bodily mark which all descendants of the Sparti or Dragon - men bore on their bodies . In vain Herakles interceded for Haemon with his angry father . Creon was inexorable ; so Haemon killed himself and his wife Antigone . Some have thought that in this narrative Hyginus followed Euripides , who wrote a tragedy Antigone , of which a few fragments survive . See TGF ( Nauck 2nd ed. ) , pp. 404ff . 2 As to the flight of Adrastus to Athens , and the intervention of the Athenians on his behalf see Isoc. 4.54 - 58 ; Isoc. 12.168-174 ; Paus. 1.39.2 ; Plut. Thes. 29 ; Statius , Theb. xii.464ff. , \uff08 who substitutes Argive matrons as suppliants instead of Adrastus\uff09 . The story is treated by Euripides in his extant play The Suppliants , which , on the whole , Apollodorus follows . But whereas Apollodorus , like Statius , lays the scene of the supplication at the altar of Mercy in Athens , Euripides lays it at the altar of Demeter in Eleusis \uff08 Eur. Supp. 1 ff.\uff09. In favour of the latter version it may be said that the graves of the fallen leaders were shown at Eleusis , near the Flowery Well \uff08 Paus. 1.39.1 ff . ; Plut . Thes. 29 \uff09 ; while the graves of the common soldiers were at Eleutherae , which is on the borders of Attica and Boeotia , on the direct road from Eleusis to Thebes \uff08 Eur. Supp. 756 ff . ; Plut . Thes. 29 \uff09 . Tradition varied also on the question how the Athenians obtained the permission of the Thebans to bury the Argive dead . Some said that Theseus led an army to Thebes , defeated the Thebans , and compelled them to give up the dead Argives for burial . This was the version adopted by Euripides , Statius , and Apollodorus . Others said that Theseus sent an embassy and by negotiations obtained the voluntary consent of the Thebans to his carrying off the dead . This version , as the less discreditable to the Thebans , was very naturally adopted by them \uff08 Paus. 1.39.2 \uff09 and by the patriotic Boeotian Plutarch , who expressly rejects Euripides 's account of the Theban defeat . Isocrates , with almost incredible fatuity , adopts both versions in different passages of his writings and defends himself for so doing \uff08 Isoc. 12.168 -174 \uff09 . Lysias , without expressly mentioning the flight of Adrastus to Athens , says that the Athenians first sent heralds to the Thebans with a request for leave to bury the Argive dead , and that when the request was refused , they marched against the Thebans , defeated them in battle , and carrying off the Argive dead buried them at Eleusis . See Lys. 2.7-10 . 3 As to the altar of Mercy at Athens see above Apollod . 2.8.1 ; Paus. 1.17.1 , with my note \uff08vol . ii. pp. 143ff.\uff09 ; Diod. 13.22.7 ; Statius , Theb. xii.481-505 . It is mentioned in a late Greek inscription found at Athens \uff08 Corpus Inscriptionum Atticarum , iii .170 ; G. Kaibel , Epigrammata Graeca ex lapidibus conlecta 792 \uff09 . The altar , though not mentioned by early writers , was in later times one of the most famous spots in Athens . Philostratus says that the Athenians built an altar of Mercy as the thirteenth of the gods , and that they poured libations on it , not of wine , but of tears \uff08 Philostratus , Epist. 39 \uff09 . In this fancy he perhaps copied Statius , Theb. xii.488 , \u201c lacrymis altaria sudant \u201d . 4 The branch of olive which a suppliant laid on the altar of a god in token that he sought the divine protection . See Andoc. 1.110 ff . ; Jebb on Sophocles , OT 3 . 5 For the death of Evadne on the pyre of her husband Capaneus , see Eur. Supp. 1034 ff . ; Zenobius , Cent. i.30 ; Prop. i.15.21 ff . ; Ovid , Tristia v.14.38 ; Ovid , Pont. iii.1.111 ff . ; Hyginus , Fab. 243 ; Statius , Theb. xii.800ff. , with the note of Lactantius Placidus on Statius , Theb. v. 801 ; Martial iv . 75.5 . Capaneus had been killed by a thunderbolt as he was mounting a ladder at the siege of Thebes . See Apollod . 3.6.7 . Hence his body was deemed sacred and should have been buried , not burned , and the grave fenced off ; whereas the other bodies were all consumed on a single pyre . See Eur. Supp. 934-938 , where \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03ae\u03be\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf \u03bd refers to the fencing in of the grave . So the tomb of Semele , who was also killed by lightning , seems to have stood within a sacred enclosure . See Eur. Ba. 6 - 11 . Yet , inconsistently with the foregoing passage , Euripides appears afterwards to assume that the body of Capaneus was burnt on a pyre \uff08 Eur. Supp. 1000 ff .\uff09. The rule that a person killed by a thunderbolt should be buried , not burnt , is stated by Pliny , Nat. Hist. ii.145 and alluded to by Tertullian , Apologeticus 48 . An ancient Roman law , attributed to Numa , forbade the celebration of the usual obsequies for a man who had been killed by lightning . See Festus , s.v. \u201c Occisum , \u201d p. 178 , ed. C. O. M\u00fcller . It is true that these passages refer to the Roman usage , but the words of Eur. Supp. 934-938 seem to imply that the Greek practice was similar , and this is confirmed by Artemidorus , who says that the bodies of persons killed by lightning were not removed but buried on the spot \uff08 Artemidorus , Onirocrit. ii.9 \uff09. The same writer tells us that a man struck by lightning was not deemed to be disgraced , nay , he was honoured as a god ; even slaves killed by lightning were approached with respect , as honoured by Zeus , and their dead bodies were wrapt in fine garments . Such customs are to some extent explained by the belief that Zeus himself descended in the flash of lightning ; hence whatever the lightning struck was naturally regarded as holy . Places struck by lightning were sacred to Zeus the Descender \uff08 \u0396\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \uff09 and were enclosed by a fence . Inscriptions marking such spots have been found in various parts of Greece . See Pollux ix.41 ; Paus. 5.14.10 , with \uff08 Frazer , Paus. vol. iii. p. 565 , vol. v. p. 614 \uff09 . Compare E. Rohde , Psyche ( 3 ) , i.320 ff . ; H. Useher , \u201c Keraunos , \u201d Kleine Schriften , iv.477 ff . , \uff08 who quotes from Clemens Romanus and Cyrillus more evidence of the worship of persons killed by lightning \uff09 ; Chr. Blinkenberg , The Thunder-weapon in Religion and Folklore \uff08 Cambridge , 1911 \uff09 , pp. 110 ff . Among the Ossetes of the Caucasus a man who has been killed by lightning is deemed very lucky , for they believe that he has been taken by St. Elias to himself . So the survivors raise cries of joy and sing and dance about him . His relations think it their duty to join in these dances and rejoicings , for any appearance of sorrow would be regarded as a sin against St. Elias and therefore punishable . The festival lasts eight days . The deceased is dressed in new clothes and laid on a pillow in the exact attitude in which he was struck and in the same place where he died . At the end of the celebrations he is buried with much festivity and feasting , a high cairn is erected on his grave , and beside it they set up a tall pole with the skin of a black he-goat attached to it , and another pole , on which hang the best clothes of the deceased . The grave becomes a place of pilgrimage . See Julius von Klaproth , Reise in den Kaukasus und nach Georgien \uff08 Halle and Berlin , 1814 \uff09 , ii .606 ; A. von Haxthausen , Transkaukasia \uff08 Leipsig , 1856 \uff09 , ii.21 ff . Similarly the Kafirs of South Africa \u201c have strange notions respecting the lightning . They consider that it is governed by the umshologu , or ghost , of the greatest and most renowned of their departed chiefs , and who is emphatically styled the inkosi ; but they are not at all clear as to which of their ancestors is intended by this designation . Hence they allow of no lamentation being made for a person killed by lightning , as they say that it would be a sign of disloyalty to lament for one whom the inkosi had sent for , and whose services he consequently needed ; and it would cause him to punish them , by making the lightning again to descend and do them another injury . \u201d Further , rites of purification have to be performed by a priest at the kraal where the accident took place ; and till these have been performed , none of the inhabitants may leave the kraal or have intercourse with other people . Meantime their heads are shaved and they must abstain from drinking milk . The rites include a sacrifice and the inoculation of the people with powdered charcoal . See \u201c Mr. Warner 's Notes , \u201d in Col. Maclean 's Compendium of Kafir Laws and Customs \uff08 Cape Town , 1866 \uff09 , pp. 82 - 84 . Sometimes , however , the ghosts of persons who have been killed by lightning are deemed to be dangerous . Hence the Omahas used to slit the soles of the feet of such corpses to prevent their ghosts from walking about . See J. Owen Dorsey , \u201c A Study of Siouan Cults , \u201d Eleventh Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology \uff08 Washington , 1894 \uff09 , p. 420 . For more evidence of special treatment accorded to the bodies of persons struck dead by lightning , see A. B. Ellis , The Ewe-speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast \uff08 London , 1890 \uff09 , p. 39 ff . ; A. B. Ellis , The Yoruba-speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast \uff08 London , 1894 \uff09 , p. 49 ; Rev.

Kitching , On the backwaters of the Nile \uff08 London , 1912 \uff09 , pp. 264 ff . Among the Barundi of Central Africa , a man or woman who has been struck , but not killed , by lightning becomes thereby a priest or priestess of the god Kiranga , whose name he or she henceforth bears and of whom he or she is deemed a bodily representative . And any place that has been struck by lightning is enclosed , and the trunk of a banana- tree or a young fig-tree is set up in it to serve as the temporary abode of the deity who manifested himself in the lightning .

Capaneus had been killed by a thunderbolt as he was mounting a ladder at the siege of Thebes . See Apollod . 3.6.7 . Hence his body was deemed sacred and should have been buried , not burned , and the grave fenced off ; whereas the other bodies were all consumed on a single pyre . See Eur. Supp. 934-938 , where \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03ae\u03be\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf \u03bd refers to the fencing in of the grave . So the tomb of Semele , who was also killed by lightning , seems to have stood within a sacred enclosure . See Eur. Ba. 6 - 11 . Yet , inconsistently with the foregoing passage , Euripides appears afterwards to assume that the body of Capaneus was burnt on a pyre \uff08 Eur. Supp. 1000 ff .\uff09. The rule that a person killed by a thunderbolt should be buried , not burnt , is stated by Pliny , Nat. Hist. ii.145 and alluded to by Tertullian , Apologeticus 48 . An ancient Roman law , attributed to Numa , forbade the celebration of the usual obsequies for a man who had been killed by lightning . See Festus , s.v. \u201c Occisum , \u201d p. 178 , ed. C. O. M\u00fcller . It is true that these passages refer to the Roman usage , but the words of Eur. Supp. 934-938 seem to imply that the Greek practice was similar , and this is confirmed by Artemidorus , who says that the bodies of persons killed by lightning were not removed but buried on the spot \uff08 Artemidorus , Onirocrit. ii.9 \uff09. The same writer tells us that a man struck by lightning was not deemed to be disgraced , nay , he was honoured as a god ; even slaves killed by lightning were approached with respect , as honoured by Zeus , and their dead bodies were wrapt in fine garments . Such customs are to some extent explained by the belief that Zeus himself descended in the flash of lightning ; hence whatever the lightning struck was naturally regarded as holy . Places struck by lightning were sacred to Zeus the Descender \uff08 \u0396\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \uff09 and were enclosed by a fence . Inscriptions marking such spots have been found in various parts of Greece . See Pollux ix.41 ; Paus. 5.14.10 , with \uff08 Frazer , Paus. vol. iii. p. 565 , vol. v. p. 614 \uff09 . Compare E. Rohde , Psyche ( 3 ) , i.320 ff . ; H. Useher , \u201c Keraunos , \u201d Kleine Schriften , iv.477 ff . , \uff08 who quotes from Clemens Romanus and Cyrillus more evidence of the worship of persons killed by lightning \uff09 ; Chr. Blinkenberg , The Thunder-weapon in Religion and Folklore \uff08 Cambridge , 1911 \uff09 , pp. 110 ff . Among the Ossetes of the Caucasus a man who has been killed by lightning is deemed very lucky , for they believe that he has been taken by St. Elias to himself . So the survivors raise cries of joy and sing and dance about him . His relations think it their duty to join in these dances and rejoicings , for any appearance of sorrow would be regarded as a sin against St. Elias and therefore punishable . The festival lasts eight days . The deceased is dressed in new clothes and laid on a pillow in the exact attitude in which he was struck and in the same place where he died . At the end of the celebrations he is buried with much festivity and feasting , a high cairn is erected on his grave , and beside it they set up a tall pole with the skin of a black he-goat attached to it , and another pole , on which hang the best clothes of the deceased . The grave becomes a place of pilgrimage . See Julius von Klaproth , Reise in den Kaukasus und nach Georgien \uff08 Halle and Berlin , 1814 \uff09 , ii .606 ; A. von Haxthausen , Transkaukasia \uff08 Leipsig , 1856 \uff09 , ii.21 ff . Similarly the Kafirs of South Africa \u201c have strange notions respecting the lightning . They consider that it is governed by the umshologu , or ghost , of the greatest and most renowned of their departed chiefs , and who is emphatically styled the inkosi ; but they are not at all clear as to which of their ancestors is intended by this designation . Hence they allow of no lamentation being made for a person killed by lightning , as they say that it would be a sign of disloyalty to lament for one whom the inkosi had sent for , and whose services he consequently needed ; and it would cause him to punish them , by making the lightning again to descend and do them another injury . \u201d Further , rites of purification have to be performed by a priest at the kraal where the accident took place ; and till these have been performed , none of the inhabitants may leave the kraal or have intercourse with other people . Meantime their heads are shaved and they must abstain from drinking milk . The rites include a sacrifice and the inoculation of the people with powdered charcoal . See \u201c Mr. Warner 's Notes , \u201d in Col. Maclean 's Compendium of Kafir Laws and Customs \uff08 Cape Town , 1866 \uff09 , pp. 82 - 84 . Sometimes , however , the ghosts of persons who have been killed by lightning are deemed to be dangerous . Hence the Omahas used to slit the soles of the feet of such corpses to prevent their ghosts from walking about . See J. Owen Dorsey , \u201c A Study of Siouan Cults , \u201d Eleventh Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology \uff08 Washington , 1894 \uff09 , p. 420 . For more evidence of special treatment accorded to the bodies of persons struck dead by lightning , see A. B. Ellis , The Ewe-speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast \uff08 London , 1890 \uff09 , p. 39 ff . ; A. B. Ellis , The Yoruba-speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast \uff08 London , 1894 \uff09 , p. 49 ; Rev. J. H. Weeks , \u201c Notes on some customs of the Lower Congo people , \u201d Folk - Lore , xx. \uff08 1909 \uff09 , p. 475 ; Rendel Harris , Boanerges \uff08 Cambridge , 1913 \uff09 , p. 97 ; A. L. Kitching , On the backwaters of the Nile \uff08 London , 1912 \uff09 , pp. 264 ff . Among the Barundi of Central Africa , a man or woman who has been struck , but not killed , by lightning becomes thereby a priest or priestess of the god Kiranga , whose name he or she henceforth bears and of whom he or she is deemed a bodily representative . And any place that has been struck by lightning is enclosed , and the trunk of a banana- tree or a young fig-tree is set up in it to serve as the temporary abode of the deity who manifested himself in the lightning .

But if ( Fay ) does take this path into the Gulf of Mexico it would ( make ) its fourth landfall into Florida . \" Fay 's third landfall Thursday will again deliver heavy rain and high winds to Central Florida counties , Local 6 meteorologist Tom Sorrells said . Marion County can expect 30 to 40 mph winds with some thunderstorms and heavy rain . Flagler County could also see winds up to 38 mph with higher gusts on the latest path of projected movement . The highest wind speeds will come between 6 a.m. and noon . Sanford had wind gusts approaching 40 mph early Thursday . The National Hurricane Center 's path of projected movement showed the storm no longer threatening to intensify into a hurricane Thursday as initially predicted . However , more record - breaking rain is possible . \" The good news with this is that the threat of tornadoes is almost nil in our viewing area , \" Local 6 meteorologist Eric Wilson said . Fay should deliver rain into Central Florida until at least Friday . Tornado Damages 54 Homes Also , at least three people were injured and 54 homes damaged when a Fay-spawned tornado touched down in Brevard County Tuesday . IMAGES : Tornado Damage Barefoot Bay resident Frank Amoretti reported seeing a tornado touch down in the vicinity of Brown Road and Puffin Drive west of U.S. 1 in Brevard County Tuesday afternoon . \" I saw the swirling and stuff and there was a lot of debris and everything , \" resident Frank Amoretti said . \" As quick as it came in , it looked like it went right back up . It looks like part of a house or part of a roof and a couple of carports and a lot of aluminum and insulation and construction barricades from Mico Road . \" Brevard County reported 50 structures were damaged by the tornado and nine of them were completely destroyed . The tornado was confirmed by the National Weather Service to have touched down about an hour after it was reported , Wilson said . The National Weather Service had issued a tornado warning for Brevard and Osceola counties before the damage reports . Watch Local 6 News for more on this story .

In the early months of 1975 , a few weeks before the proposed reopening of the station for the pioneering Dales Rail service in May of that year , British Rail engineers demolished the ' down ' ( northbound ) platform to allow for the construction of a new siding to serve Ribblehead Quarry .

It has panoramic windows , offering passengers superb views of some of the finest karst limestone landscapes in the British Isles , over the top of the drystone walls , better than from a car , especially for drivers who can relax and absorb the breath-taking scenery . The Ingleborough Pony , sponsored by the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority 's Sustainable Development Fund , is part of the popular Sunday Dales Bus network .

From here it travels up to the Station to give visitors 40 minutes to enjoy the visitor centre ( free entry ) and to photograph the viaduct . The bus then continues via Selside , Horton , Settle and on to Austwick and Clapham to Ingleton , Passengers can stay longer at Ribblehead , for example to explore Natural England 's Nature Trail around the old Ribblehead Quarry and National Nature Reserve before catching a later bus back to Ingleton or the train back to Settle .

Slimming down to a wafer - thin 5 mm at its edges , the newest iteration of i Mac is by far the slimmest of its kin . We are very curious what sort of diet could cause such a drastic change , so we opened it up to find out ! Still hungry for more ? Follow us on the Tweet Machine , or like us on the Face Emporium . It may not have a Retina display , but the new 21.5 \" i Mac has some commendable specs : 2.7 GHz quad - core Intel Core i5 processor with 6 MB L3 cache 8 GB of RAM 1TB hard drive ( 5400 rpm ) NVIDIA GeForce GT 640 M graphics processor with 512 MB dedicated VRAM Four USB 3.0 ports and two Thunderbolt ports 802.11n Wi- Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 In case you have n't heard , the new i Mac is really thin \u2026kinda . At its thinnest point ( around the edge ) , it is 5 mm thick . At its thickest , though , it is over 4 cm thick , more than 8 times the thickness of the edge . Since the new i Mac is barely thicker than a CD itself , it does not include an optical drive . However , it still does sport a plethora of ports : 3.5 mm headphone SDXC card slot 4 x USB 3.0 2 x Thunderbolt Gigabit Ethernet We find what appear to be cooling vents on the back of the rear case hidden behind the \" foot . \" Unlike previous revisions , the vent is rectangular instead of circular . Even though there are vents at the bottom of the rear case , our guess is that the fan is somewhere in the middle of the i Mac \u2014 where it 's fattest . These slots are probably the exhaust vents that spit out air drawn in from the bottom . Hiding above the Apple logo , we find the small dual microphone grates . It 's listening ; it 's always listening \u2026 This i Mac 's model and EMC numbers hide in their usual spot under the foot : A1418 and EMC 2544 . We begin to strum away at the adhesive holding the display assembly in place . Unlike in the previous i Mac , this glass is held in place with more than magnets . To our dismay , we 're forced to break out our heat gun and guitar picks to get past the adhesive holding the display down . With the iPad-like adhesive severed , we bust out the heavy - duty stuff . Repair faux pas alert ! To save space and eliminate the gap between the glass and the pixels , Apple opted to fuse the front glass and the LCD . This means that if you want to replace one , you 'll have to replace both . The fused display may look awesome , but at what cost , Apple ? At. What . Cost !? The cost is quickly apparent : cutting open the display destroys the foam adhesive securing it shut . Putting things back together will require peeling off and replacing all of the original adhesive , which will be a major pain for repairers . We were fairly surprised to see that the new i Mac 's LCD sports the same model number as last year 's \u2014 LM215WF3 from LG \u2014even though the LCD is 5 mm thinner . If it 's the same , why is it smaller ? We surmise that Apple took all the same pieces of the LCD and crammed them into a smaller housing . - Talk about a facelift \u2014 nothing about the inside of this i Mac resembles last year 's model . As we tear through this machine we 'll be able to take a look at how Apple managed to eliminate a millimeter here and a micron there , one component at a time . We like hard drives and devices that support dual hard drives , so naturally we start by examining the new i Mac 's 1 TB drive . By switching from a traditional 3.5 \" desktop hard drive to a 2.5 \" laptop drive , Apple designers were able to clear a lot of real estate inside the iMac. Smaller laptop hard drives are also often quieter , thanks to smaller moving parts than their big brothers . Apple turned to HGST \u2014 Western Digital 's acquisition of Hitachi\u2014to manage the iMac 's spinning storage . A rubbery housing is lightly adhered to the edges of the hard drive beneath the upper and lower hard plastic bezels . This design is far different from what we 've seen before . Since the internal components are more tightly packed than before , small vibrations may carry through more components . The rubber housing dampens the vibrations from the spinning hard drive so they are not perpetuated throughout the device . You might already know that we carry a 54 - bit driver kit to handle any of your mechanical fastener needs . What you might not know , however , is that the included extender can be used to provide extra torque to remove tough screws \u2014 such as those holding down the power supply board inside the iMac . This board takes the readily available AC voltage from your wall socket and converts it to tasty DC voltage for the iMac to consume . The specified output is 12.1 V , 15.4 A. A new fan layout ! We are fans . Apple is changing things up quite a bit and has moved from multiple small fans to a single centralized fan . \" 1 \" may be the loneliest number , but removing 2/3 of the fans goes a long way towards saving space . Judging by the orientation of the squirrel cage fan , we gather that it draws cool air from the bottom vents , then blows hot air out of the grating in the back of the iMac . The webcams in i Macs of yesteryear have always been connected to the logic board with long snaking cables that were relatively fragile ; that is no longer the case . A ribbon cable we can only describe as \" beefy \" keeps the FaceTime HD camera in touch with the logic board . As we mentioned earlier , the newest i Mac features not one , but two microphones . Dual microphone technology has been utilized in mobile devices for years to cut out background noise during phone calls . Now , the same idea is being applied here to improve sound quality during intimate FaceTime chats with your mother . It 's not often that we see the microphone ( s ) and webcam for a computer disconnected from each other . That modularity means positive points towards repairability . Three gold barsantennas come out next with a few spudger flicks . Even though the main Wi-Fi antenna is hidden behind the big Apple logo on the rear case as usual , these three antennas split up Bluetooth and secondary Wi-Fi duties . Stop \u2014speaker time ! The speakers may look simple , but removing them is nerve-wracking . For seemingly no reason other than to push our buttons , Apple has added a barb to the bottom of the speaker assemblies that makes them harder - than - necessary to remove . After sufficiently wracking all of our nerves , the speaker assemblies allow us to remove them from their sick beat dropping enclosure . - Good news : The i Mac 's RAM is \" user-replaceable . \" Bad news : You have to unglue your screen and remove the logic board in order to do so . This is just barely less-terrible than having soldered RAM that 's completely non-removable . Our bargain - basement unit has a solid 8 GB of Hynix PC3-12800 RAM . Like a young fellow nervous to dance at prom , the AirPort card sits inconspicuously in the corner . After a short hiatus , Broadcom is back to bring WLAN capabilities to the iMac. A Broadcom BCM4331 single - chip WLAN solution dominates the tiny AirPort card . The three Wi-Fi antennas are run by three Skyworks SE5515 Dual - Band frontend chips . New from last year 's model , Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are integrated into the same card , with the addition of a BCM20702 single - chip Bluetooth 4.0 processor . And off comes that honkin' heat sink ! And along with it \u2026 what 's this \u2026 the CPU ??? The new i Mac uses a spring - loaded , FCLGA1155 socket to make all those little electrical signals go into , and out of , the CPU . The Intel Core i5-3330S is clocked at 2.7 GHz , but can stretch its legs up to 3.2 GHz if needed . This is the bottom rung of the ladder as far as processors in the iMac go . You can max out a 21.5 \" machine with a 3.1 GHz quad - core Intel Core i7 with Turbo Boost up to 3.9 GHz .

See these traces on the board here ? See this other hole on the left ? Looks like this is where Apple 's proprietary SSD connector should reside . Placing the SSD from the 13 \" MacBook Pro Retina Display confirms this notion . If the shoe fits ... We purchased the \" bargain - basement \" version of the iMac . We 're assuming that the more-expensive version \u2014 one that has the built- to-order Fusion drive option \u2014 has this connector soldered onto the board , and a 128GB SSD placed into said connector . Looks like there 'll be no love for our awesome dual - drive kit from this i Mac generation . :( Though the rear case is the last piece we reach , it 's where the design of the new i Mac began . In order to carefully join together the pieces of the case , Apple turned to friction stir welding , a process previously reserved for applications such as ship building and aerospace . Friction stir welding is more like joining clay than welding \u2014 it does n't melt the workpieces , but rather softens the area between them and forces material together , creating a strong weld with no weakened heat affected zone . i Mac 21.5 \" EMC 2544 Repairability Score : 3 out of 10 ( 10 is easiest to repair ) You can still replace the RAM , hard drive , and CPU inside this machine . The glass and LCD are now fused together , and there are no more magnets holding the glass in place . That means it 's heatgun time ! Most replaceable components ( like the RAM ) are buried behind the logic board , meaning you 'll have to take apart most of the iMac just to gain access to them . Budget-minded folks can no longer add a second hard drive to the base i Mac unless they are super-fond of soldering missing proprietary connectors onto the logic board . You 'll have to masterfully peel off the old double - sided sticky tape and apply new tape in order to reseal this i Mac into original condition . 41 Comments May , You can write some more about \u2013 back \u2013 of LCD display ? I 'm guessing they broke the glass which is why we do n't see the display in the end picture . William : Nope , we just wanted to do something different this time around . It 's a terrible PITA to take a decent photo of such a large piece of reflective glass . Post-teardown image , just for you : http://guide-images.ifixit.net/igi/unNoO... Could you guys get the same tools apple has for their service tech to remove the LCD . They do not used heat gun at all . It 's a type plastic round wheel mounted on a plastic handle .

When a bacterium wants to settle down , it uses a molecular ' clutch ' to disengage its propulsion system , researchers have found . No one had previously worked out how bacteria turn off their flagella , the spinning tails that they use to move around . The discovery could lead to a way to keep bacteria moving in places we 'd rather they did n't linger , such as medical equipment . Many bacteria have two modes \u2014 either free-living and swimming , or settled down as part of a stationary ' biofilm ' . These films are slimy bacterial cities only a fraction of a millimetre thick that contain vast numbers of cells and often many species . The gene for the molecular clutch , which is called epsE , is part of a group of 15 genes that , when activated , send the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis into biofilm mode . The other genes control things such as slime production . Molecular motor Daniel Kearns at Indiana University in Bloomington and his colleagues identified epsE by studying cells with mutations that should have triggered biofilm formation , but did n't . It turned out that they had been unable to disengage their flagella , thanks to mutations in epsE. epsE attaches to a rotor protein at the flagellum 's base that is driven by protons flowing into the cell . To stop cells moving , it bends the rotor molecule so that it no longer touches the proton motor , the researchers report in Science 1 . The flagellum is still free to turn \u2014 hence the description of epsE as a clutch , and not a brake \u2014 but friction rapidly brings the cell to a halt . Kearn 's team is now looking for a protein that disengages the clutch and reconnects the motor . It had been thought that bacteria slowed down by switching off the genes that make flagella , says Richard Berry , a physicist at the University of Oxford , UK , who studies molecular motors . \u201c This is a completely unknown thing , \u201d he says . \u201c The previous wisdom was that flagella would spin for ever . \u201d Some nanotechnologists have dreamed of harnessing bacterial rotors as molecular pumps , he adds . If that ever happened , epsE could be a useful regulator . Horror films B. subtilis is harmless . But biofilms can be deadly \u2014 for example , when they form in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis , or when MRSA cells settle down on hospital equipment . \" If we could target the clutching mechanism , we might trick cells into staying mobile , \" says Kearns . \" It could be very destabilizing . \" B. subtilis cells that ca n't switch off still form groups , he says , but these are not cohesive . \" They writhe around . \" \u201c It could be a target , \u201d agrees Berry . \u201c But it 's not the softest target \u2013 there are probably more vital things you could shoot for . \u201d References Blair , K.

When a bacterium wants to settle down , it uses a molecular ' clutch ' to disengage its propulsion system , researchers have found . No one had previously worked out how bacteria turn off their flagella , the spinning tails that they use to move around . The discovery could lead to a way to keep bacteria moving in places we 'd rather they did n't linger , such as medical equipment . Many bacteria have two modes \u2014 either free-living and swimming , or settled down as part of a stationary ' biofilm ' . These films are slimy bacterial cities only a fraction of a millimetre thick that contain vast numbers of cells and often many species . The gene for the molecular clutch , which is called epsE , is part of a group of 15 genes that , when activated , send the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis into biofilm mode . The other genes control things such as slime production . Molecular motor Daniel Kearns at Indiana University in Bloomington and his colleagues identified epsE by studying cells with mutations that should have triggered biofilm formation , but did n't . It turned out that they had been unable to disengage their flagella , thanks to mutations in epsE. epsE attaches to a rotor protein at the flagellum 's base that is driven by protons flowing into the cell . To stop cells moving , it bends the rotor molecule so that it no longer touches the proton motor , the researchers report in Science 1 . The flagellum is still free to turn \u2014 hence the description of epsE as a clutch , and not a brake \u2014 but friction rapidly brings the cell to a halt . Kearn 's team is now looking for a protein that disengages the clutch and reconnects the motor . It had been thought that bacteria slowed down by switching off the genes that make flagella , says Richard Berry , a physicist at the University of Oxford , UK , who studies molecular motors . \u201c This is a completely unknown thing , \u201d he says . \u201c The previous wisdom was that flagella would spin for ever . \u201d Some nanotechnologists have dreamed of harnessing bacterial rotors as molecular pumps , he adds . If that ever happened , epsE could be a useful regulator . Horror films B. subtilis is harmless . But biofilms can be deadly \u2014 for example , when they form in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis , or when MRSA cells settle down on hospital equipment . \" If we could target the clutching mechanism , we might trick cells into staying mobile , \" says Kearns . \" It could be very destabilizing . \" B. subtilis cells that ca n't switch off still form groups , he says , but these are not cohesive . \" They writhe around . \" \u201c It could be a target , \u201d agrees Berry . \u201c But it 's not the softest target \u2013 there are probably more vital things you could shoot for . \u201d References Blair , K.

But on August 1 , before all hell broke loose on the world 's second - highest mountain , the weather was so calm and clear that some of the 18 climbers who 'd summitted that day spent up to an hour and a half taking it in . On the summit was Wilco van Rooijen , the leader of a Dutch expedition , who survived the ensuing ordeal and who remembers seeing tears in the eyes of a teammate who ultimately did not : Gerard McDonnell , an Irishman whod lived and climbed in Alaska for the past decade . Both men had been seriously injured by rockfall on previous K2 attempts , but now they 'd made it together . Celebrating with them , taking photographs and calling loved ones from their sat phones , were Dutchman Cas van de Gevel ; Pemba Gyalje Sherpa , of Nepal , who had accompanied McDonnell up Everest in 2003 ; and Hugues d'Aubarede and his Pakistani porter , Karim Meherban , both members of a French team . Between 7:30 and 8 P.M. , Marco Confortola , the leader of an Italian team , also reached the top . Beneath them all , bathed in twilight , sprawled Pakistan 's Karakoram Rangeincluding Gasherbrum I and II , the world 's eleventh - and thirteenth - highest mountains , and Broad Peak , the twelfth-highest . Below the 28,250 - foot summit of K2 , a team of three Norwegians were on their way down , moving slowly into a treacherous portion of the upper slope known as the Traverse . The Traverse is a wildly steep slope with an unstable 200 - foot - tall glacier towering above it and thousands of feet of certain- death falls yawning below . After it plays out , the route descends into the Bottleneck , a narrow , 60 - degree couloir . Both the Traverse and the Bottleneck are exposed to icefall from the glacier 's hanging seracs . At the front of the Norwegian group was mountaineer and polar explorer Rolf Bae , who 'd turned around just shy of the top because of altitude sickness . Behind him on the rope were his wife , Cecilie Skog , and teammate Lars Naesse , who 'd both reached the summit . Skog was several yards behind Bae when she heard a loud crack , followed by a palpable rumble from the darkness above . In an instant , her husband 's headlamp vanished under a massive icefall . She and Naesse played their own thin beams over the debris but saw nothing but shredded ropes . They knew that Bae was gone . Behind the Norwegians , 14 others found themselves stranded on the wrong side of the Traverse . Their fixed lines were badly damaged and their supplemental oxygenwhich nine of the 14 relied onwas already running low . Things were bad , but they were about to get a lot worse . By the next day , a third of the nearly three dozen mountaineers whod started toward the summit on August 1 would be dead . In the immediate aftermath , news outlets and commentators quickly made comparisons to the infamous 1996 Everest disaster , chronicled by Jon Krakauer in Outside and later in his bestselling book Into Thin Air , which brought to light a growing industry of commercial guides and underexperienced climbers at the top of the world . The New York Times wrote of the K2 tragedy that the presence of hired high - altitude porters on some of the teams raised questions about whether some of the expeditions might have been commercial , guided efforts . \" The insider newsletter Expedition News published a story headlined , \" The Everestification of K2 . \" And Tyrolean climbing legend Reinhold Messner scorned the victims ' \" pure stupidity \" in the German media . Meanwhile , ExplorersWeb.com countered that such statements were n't warranted , and that all of the dead on K2 were , in fact , experienced mountaineers with substantial high- altitude r\u00e9sum\u00e9s . None of the climbers caught up in the disaster were on commercially guided expeditions . Who was right ? Two months after the debacle , it seems clear that the truth lies somewhere in the middle . Direct comparisons between Everest and K2 are a mistakethe mountains are just too differentbut it 's obvious that grave mistakes were made in both instances : on Everest by experienced guides leading guided groups , on K2 by groups of experienced climbers . And though K2 is too difficult and dangerous a mountain ever to see Everest-size crowdswhich these days can mean hundreds vying for the summit on a single daythe world 's second - highest peak is suddenly facing its own crowding problem . The difference is that on K2 , a few dozen climbers is all it takes to create a murderous traffic jam . THERE ARE ABOUT TEN ROUTES to the top from K2s 16,750 - foot base camp , but most expeditions make their way up the Abruzzi Spur , a series of steep ridgelines on the southeast flank . Several dozen successful teams have also taken a more direct ridgeline , the Cesen Route , on the south side of the peak . Both approaches stop at three camps en route to a shared camp four , situated at 25,000 feet on the mountains prominent shoulder . In August , the seven teams were divided between the two routes , with most ascending the Abruzzi . Above camp four , some three dozen climbers merged into a single narrow column . Everest also has two main routes with four standard camps , but K2 is 20 degrees steeper on average and is located 545 miles farther north . It 's 785 feet shorter than Everest , but the climbing is more technical , more exposed to falling rock and ice , and the peak is subject to harsher weather . The result is a mountain that claims many more lives for each successful summit bid . Everest has been climbed roughly 3,000 times , with hundreds of new names added to the list every year . K2 has seen only 299 ascentsand in many years , nobody summits . According to logs compiled by Explorers Web , 10.3 percent of K2 summiters have died on the descent . Thats more than five times Everests fatality rate for summiters , 1.82 percent . Among elite climbers , K2 is known as \" the mountaineer 's mountain . \" It 's also called \" the savage mountain . \" \" K2 is the holy grail , \" says American Ed Viesturs , who 's climbed all of the world 's 8,000 - meter peaks , including K2 , without supplemental oxygen . \" A climb of K2 is more important than a climb of Everest . People are willing to push longer and harder for it . \" The mountain 's prestige beckons mountaineers , as does its relative affordability . Since 2003 , the Pakistani government has attempted to boost tourism by cutting prices on Himalayan -climbing permits by up to 95 percent . It now costs a mere $ 6,000 for a team of seven to attempt the mountain . Still , there 's no evidence to suggest that inexperienced mountaineers are suddenly flocking to K2 . The use of hired Nepalese and Pakistani portersaberrant a decade agois becoming more common , but guided expeditions are still rare . ( One was there this year , although none of those climbers were involved in the August mayhem . ) Everest , by comparison , is dominated by commercial expeditions . \" Commercial climbing has no place on K2 like on easier mountains like Broad Peak , Gasherbrum II , or even Everest , \" wrote Nazir Sabir , president of the Alpine Club of Pakistan , in an open letter after the disaster . Which raises an obvious question : How did a group of veteran mountaineers get themselves into so much trouble ? THE SUMMIT BID BEGAN with a meeting in base camp in late July , after forecasts had predicted a good weather window on August 1 . On crowded peaks , climbers generally work together to improve everyone 's chances of reaching the top safely . This year , with ten expeditions on the mountainincluding teams from Singapore , Korea , Spain , Serbia , the Netherlands , France , Italy , Norway , and the U.S. , as well as a multinational groupcommunication was especially important . Van Rooijen , who 'd arrived with his Dutch squad several weeks before the other teams , organized the communal effort . Each expedition would be tasked with carrying ropes and other shared gear up the mountain , piling it up at camp four in preparation for the final push . At 10 P.M. on July 31 , an advance teamcomprising the strongest climber from each expeditionwould leave camp four to fix the ropes through the Bottleneck and Traverse . The team would be led by Korean climber Kim Jae Soo , and it included Pakistani porter Shaheen Baig , the only climber on the mountain whod been through the Bottleneck and knew where to set the ropes . Shaheen Baig never made it to camp four , however . He turned back sick at camp two . According to Chhiring Dorje Sherpa and Chris Klinke , of the American expedition , when the time came for the rope-fixing team to start working , they discovered that they were short - handed and that some teams had n't brought enough line . The search for more equipment and manpower delayed the advance team for more than two hours , the first of a series of setbacks that would keep all but one climber out well past dark . With Shaheen Baig out of the picture , fixing the ropes fell to half a dozen other loosely organized climbers whod learned their skills on Everest , where the presence of so many less- experienced climbers requires fixing ropes on every inch of the mountain . At some point , after they 'd begun setting the route at the Bottleneck , they were joined by Spaniard Alberto Zerainthe fastest climber on the mountain , but not part of the advance teamwhod climbed straight through from camp three . Without Baig to direct them , the group wasted line on the low- angle slopes below the Bottleneck and ran out of gear well before the crux . When van Rooijen , who 'd set out with the other climbers on their summit bid , arrived around sunrise , he and the others were astonished to find Zerain already there , directing the route setting . \" We had discussed this so many times , \" he recalls , \" what had to be done and who had to take care of this job . \" The Bottleneck soon lived up to its name . Klinke , stuck behind at least 20 climbers , began removing ropes from the lower slopes and passing them up the line . \" There was no way we were moving fast enough to summit and get down before dark \" he says . \" Accidents on K2 happen when people spend too long on their ascent . \" Most climbers aim for a time of 10 to 12 hours between camp four and the summit . This year , nobody reached the top in less than 16 hours . Klinke and his teammates , Eric Meyer and Fredrik Str\u00e4ng , turned back for camp four at about 10 A.M. The first fatality occurred shortly thereafter , in the Bottleneck . Dren Mandic , a Serbian climber who unclipped from the rope to adjust his oxygen equipment and pass another climber , lost his footing and fell onto Cecilie Skog . The rope stopped Skog , but Mandic tumbled hundreds of feet . Meyer and Str\u00e4ng left camp to help but , on the way , received radio communication that Mandic was dead . When they reached Mandic 's corpse , hours later , his teammates were trying to lower the body back to camp four . The recovery went wrong almost immediately . Jehan Baig , a Pakistani porter working for the Serbs , toppled onto Str\u00e4ng before sliding headfirst down the slope . He made no attempt to arrest his fall with his ice ax and tumbled off the mountain . The remaining climbers left Mandic 's body and returned to camp four . Up in the Bottleneck , Pemba Gyalje Sherpa , from the Dutch team , was spooked by the accident and the late hour . He advised the climbers to descend , but Marco Confortola gave a pep talk , noting that the first climbers to summit K2 , in 1954 Italians , like himdid so at 6 P.M. They all continued up . Zerain , climbing solo ahead of the pack , topped out around 3 P.M. and descended so quickly to camp three that he did n't learn of the disaster until the next day . At 5:30 P.M. , Lars Naesse summitted with the Norwegians , followed within half an hour by Skog and Chhiring . Five Koreans and two Sherpas working for them reached the top at 5:40 and , according to Pakistani officials , spent 90 minutes there . Just after 7 P.M. , about an hour before sunset , Van Rooijen , McDonnell , and the rest arrived . All but Cas van de Gevel , of the Dutch team , had started down when Confortola arrived between 7:30 and 8 P.M. ROLF BAE WAS DEAD . The icefall that killed him also took out crucial fixed ropes on the upper mountain . Skog , Naesse , and the 14 others strung out behind them would have to descend the Traverse and Bottleneck in the dark , with only fragments of ropes to clip into . After the disaster , several news stories noted that the climbers were \" stranded \" above the Bottleneck . In reality , the Traverse and the Bottleneck are entirely navigable by an experienced climber with the right equipment . Many earlier expeditions to K2 did n't rely on fixed ropes at all . Instead , climbers tackled the peak alpine - style , ascending and descending while roped only to their teammates . But alpine - style climbing on terrain this steep requires two ice axes , in the same way ice-climbing does . Most of the climbers in August had only one tool each , which made climbing down the dark , debris-strewn slope that much more insecure . After the initial accident , Naesse removed a short rope he carried in his pack , and he and Skog crept over the icy rubble and descended into the Bottleneck . Higher up , the climbers were still unaware of the icefall . Above the Traverse , Cas van de Gevel came upon Hugues d'Aubarede , sitting in the snow , exhausted . The porter Karim Meherban was missing and would not be found . Van de Gevel passed the Frenchman ; soon after , he heard a crash and turned to see d'Aubarede falling into the void . Elsewhere , at the point where the ropes vanished , Chhiring found \" Little \" Pasang Bhote , who 'd been working for the Koreans . Hed lost his ice axe , leaving him unable to continue without the ropes . Chirring tied in with Pasang and the two men kicked steps downward with only Chhiring 's axe to anchor them . \" Either we live together or we die together , \" said Chhiring . Skog and Naesse , meanwhile , had made it through the Bottleneck and reached camp four around 11 P.M. Chhiring , Pasang , Pemba , van de Gevel , and two of the Koreans made it back to camp sometime after midnight . Those in camp could still count nine headlamps above the Bottleneck . The highest three of those lights belonged to van Rooijen , McDonnell , and Confortola . They 'd lost the route above the Traverse because the bamboo wands that should 've marked the linelike breadcrumbshad never been planted . Confortola used his sat phone to call the president of an Italian mountaineering club , who advised him to bivouac rather than risk walking off the edge of the glacier in the dark . Then the phone battery died . Van Rooijen was determined to keep descending , so Confortola dug only two seats in the snowone for McDonnell , a jovial , bearded climber hed taken to calling Jesus , and one for himself . \" Stick with me , \" he told McDonnell . They shouted at one another to stay awake , fearing that if they fell asleep , they 'd fall off the mountain . Van Rooijen continued looking for a way down but eventually planted himself nearby . By the time the sky lightened at dawn , van Rooijen was gone . Confortola and McDonnell began making their way down but soon came upon three Korean climbers Park Kyeong - Hyo , Kim Hyo-Gyeong , and Hwang Dong - Jinall dangling from the same rope . \" All three of them were upside down , hanging , \" recalls Confortola . \" They were still alive , but two of them were in very critical condition . \" One of the Koreans could speak but had lost his boot . Confortola put one of his gloves over the climber 's exposed foot , and McDonnell held the man up while Confortola tried to lift his teammates . They spent three and half hours trying to free the Koreans but gave up when the glacier let loose nearby and reminded them of their perilous location . McDonnell , perhaps confused by the lack of oxygen , climbed back up the slope toward the summit . Confortola shouted to his friend but could n't get his attention . Then he heard an avalanche and recognized two yellow boots in the slide . \" They were Jesus 's boots , \" says Confortola . \" He was in pieces . \" Confortola continued down the mountain alone . Hours later , Pemba , climbing up from camp four , found Confortola asleep in the snow below the Bottleneck and woke him . The Italian was barely on his feet when the serac calved again . An oxygen bottle , knocked loose from above , whacked Confortola 's head , nearly knocking him off the mountain . \" But Pemba covered me like I was his baby , \" recalls Confortola . Whether in the same icefall or in one just before , Jumich Bhote and \" Big \" Pasang Bhote , Sherpas and brothers working for the Korean team , were both killed . Jumich had summitted the night before but had been delayed by the icefall . Pasang , who had not been part of the summit party , had climbed up to help with the rescue . Confortola and Pemba could see body parts protruding from the debris on their way back to camp four . WILCO VAN ROOIJEN WAS ALIVE . He 'd gotten up while it was still dark and somehow survived his solo descent . It was light out , but he was snowblind and had no idea where he was . He did n't have a radio and his stricken eyes could n't read the display of his sat phone to call for help , though he could trace the pattern of his home phone number on the keyboard . His wife , Heleen , who was caring for their nine- month-old son , picked up back in Holland . She then called base camp , where the message was relayed up to Pemba and van de Gevel in camp four : Van Rooijen was still out theresomewhere . Early in the morning , van Rooijen had passed the dangling Koreans , who 'd waved him off . He 'd clipped in to their rope , but it soon ran out . He meandered up and down steep terrain until he found remnants of the fixed ropes hanging straight down over cliffs . He 'd clipped into them and worked sideways , like a pendulum , from rope to rope across the Traverse to the Bottleneck . Then he 'd down - climbed until cliffs blocked his path . \" It was so steep , and I just sat down , \" says van Rooijen . \" I was too tired to climb up again . I was coming to the end of my strength . \" After van Rooijen had called his wife , the team 's webmaster , in Holland , arranged a GPS trace of the signal from the sat phone and located the climber between camps three and four on the Cesen Route . He 'd overshot camp four altogether . Van Rooijen hung up with his wife and slept for a few hours , waking to find his sight improved and the clouds parting to reveal a couloir where he could continue his descent . Through the same break in the whiteout , spotters down in base camp saw a man in an orange suit wandering the mountain . They called up to Pemba and van de Gevel , who descended to intercept van Rooijen . But the sun set again before they could reach him , and van Rooijen hunkered down for his second night out on K2 . In camp three , Pemba could hear van Rooijen 's sat phone ringing nearby , but avalanche - prone slopes kept him from searching for his teammate . The next morning , van Rooijen followed a ridgeline until he saw tents and climbers , although he did n't recognize the scene as his own camp . Van de Gevel , Pemba , and van Rooijen made it off the mountain that evening and were air - lifted to a hospital in Skardu the next morning . On August 5 , aided by rescuers , Marco Confortola hobbled into base camp on badly frostbitten feet . He was the last survivor off the mountain . TWO WEEKS LATER , half a dozen members of the Dutch team sat up front at Gerard McDonnell 's memorial service , in County Limerick , Ireland . More than 2,000 mourners had shown up to honor the first climber from their country to summit K2 . Musicians played , and doves were released into the cold drizzle . Friends presented the family with gifts , and speakers noted that McDonnell most likely would 've survived if he had n't tried to rescue the dying Koreans . \" It 's not just because he wore a beard that he was called Jesus , \" said Father Joe Noonan in his sermon . But van de Gevel , emaciated by his ordeal and crushed by the sorrow of his teammate 's family , saw things differently . \" On the mountain there were no heroes , \" he said , \" just an unspoken agreement that you help as much as you can . \" Back on K2 , it 's likely that little will change . If the trend following the Everest 1996 disaster is any indication , the mountain will become only more popular . On Everest , better forecasting and route setting have staved off another day as catastrophic as the one 12 years agothough not the annual parade of stunts , films , and record attempts . But on a mountain as unrelenting as K2 , little can be done to lessen the danger of 30 climbers rushing the summit . That much is simple .","annotations":[{"text":"in the Bottleneck","span":[10563,10579],"token_span":[1999,2001],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the Agent detaches an Item or Items."},{"text":"Dren Mandic","span":[10583,10593],"token_span":[2003,2004],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The individual that causes the Item and Source to come apart by manipulating the connector."},{"text":"from the rope","span":[10629,10641],"token_span":[2011,2013],"role":"Source","label":"Source","role_definition":"Source identifies the location to which an Item was attached before getting detached."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"Mandi\u0107 and Baig fall At 8:00 a.m. , climbers were finally advancing through the Bottleneck .

After it plays out , the route descends into the Bottleneck , a narrow , 60 - degree couloir . Both the Traverse and the Bottleneck are exposed to icefall from the glacier 's hanging seracs . At the front of the Norwegian group was mountaineer and polar explorer Rolf Bae , who 'd turned around just shy of the top because of altitude sickness . Behind him on the rope were his wife , Cecilie Skog , and teammate Lars Naesse , who 'd both reached the summit . Skog was several yards behind Bae when she heard a loud crack , followed by a palpable rumble from the darkness above . In an instant , her husband 's headlamp vanished under a massive icefall . She and Naesse played their own thin beams over the debris but saw nothing but shredded ropes . They knew that Bae was gone . Behind the Norwegians , 14 others found themselves stranded on the wrong side of the Traverse . Their fixed lines were badly damaged and their supplemental oxygenwhich nine of the 14 relied onwas already running low . Things were bad , but they were about to get a lot worse . By the next day , a third of the nearly three dozen mountaineers whod started toward the summit on August 1 would be dead . In the immediate aftermath , news outlets and commentators quickly made comparisons to the infamous 1996 Everest disaster , chronicled by Jon Krakauer in Outside and later in his bestselling book Into Thin Air , which brought to light a growing industry of commercial guides and underexperienced climbers at the top of the world . The New York Times wrote of the K2 tragedy that the presence of hired high - altitude porters on some of the teams raised questions about whether some of the expeditions might have been commercial , guided efforts . \" The insider newsletter Expedition News published a story headlined , \" The Everestification of K2 . \" And Tyrolean climbing legend Reinhold Messner scorned the victims ' \" pure stupidity \" in the German media . Meanwhile , ExplorersWeb.com countered that such statements were n't warranted , and that all of the dead on K2 were , in fact , experienced mountaineers with substantial high- altitude r\u00e9sum\u00e9s . None of the climbers caught up in the disaster were on commercially guided expeditions . Who was right ? Two months after the debacle , it seems clear that the truth lies somewhere in the middle . Direct comparisons between Everest and K2 are a mistakethe mountains are just too differentbut it 's obvious that grave mistakes were made in both instances : on Everest by experienced guides leading guided groups , on K2 by groups of experienced climbers . And though K2 is too difficult and dangerous a mountain ever to see Everest-size crowdswhich these days can mean hundreds vying for the summit on a single daythe world 's second - highest peak is suddenly facing its own crowding problem . The difference is that on K2 , a few dozen climbers is all it takes to create a murderous traffic jam . THERE ARE ABOUT TEN ROUTES to the top from K2s 16,750 - foot base camp , but most expeditions make their way up the Abruzzi Spur , a series of steep ridgelines on the southeast flank . Several dozen successful teams have also taken a more direct ridgeline , the Cesen Route , on the south side of the peak . Both approaches stop at three camps en route to a shared camp four , situated at 25,000 feet on the mountains prominent shoulder . In August , the seven teams were divided between the two routes , with most ascending the Abruzzi . Above camp four , some three dozen climbers merged into a single narrow column . Everest also has two main routes with four standard camps , but K2 is 20 degrees steeper on average and is located 545 miles farther north . It 's 785 feet shorter than Everest , but the climbing is more technical , more exposed to falling rock and ice , and the peak is subject to harsher weather . The result is a mountain that claims many more lives for each successful summit bid . Everest has been climbed roughly 3,000 times , with hundreds of new names added to the list every year . K2 has seen only 299 ascentsand in many years , nobody summits . According to logs compiled by Explorers Web , 10.3 percent of K2 summiters have died on the descent . Thats more than five times Everests fatality rate for summiters , 1.82 percent . Among elite climbers , K2 is known as \" the mountaineer 's mountain . \" It 's also called \" the savage mountain . \" \" K2 is the holy grail , \" says American Ed Viesturs , who 's climbed all of the world 's 8,000 - meter peaks , including K2 , without supplemental oxygen . \" A climb of K2 is more important than a climb of Everest . People are willing to push longer and harder for it . \" The mountain 's prestige beckons mountaineers , as does its relative affordability . Since 2003 , the Pakistani government has attempted to boost tourism by cutting prices on Himalayan -climbing permits by up to 95 percent . It now costs a mere $ 6,000 for a team of seven to attempt the mountain . Still , there 's no evidence to suggest that inexperienced mountaineers are suddenly flocking to K2 . The use of hired Nepalese and Pakistani portersaberrant a decade agois becoming more common , but guided expeditions are still rare . ( One was there this year , although none of those climbers were involved in the August mayhem . ) Everest , by comparison , is dominated by commercial expeditions . \" Commercial climbing has no place on K2 like on easier mountains like Broad Peak , Gasherbrum II , or even Everest , \" wrote Nazir Sabir , president of the Alpine Club of Pakistan , in an open letter after the disaster . Which raises an obvious question : How did a group of veteran mountaineers get themselves into so much trouble ? THE SUMMIT BID BEGAN with a meeting in base camp in late July , after forecasts had predicted a good weather window on August 1 . On crowded peaks , climbers generally work together to improve everyone 's chances of reaching the top safely . This year , with ten expeditions on the mountainincluding teams from Singapore , Korea , Spain , Serbia , the Netherlands , France , Italy , Norway , and the U.S. , as well as a multinational groupcommunication was especially important . Van Rooijen , who 'd arrived with his Dutch squad several weeks before the other teams , organized the communal effort . Each expedition would be tasked with carrying ropes and other shared gear up the mountain , piling it up at camp four in preparation for the final push . At 10 P.M. on July 31 , an advance teamcomprising the strongest climber from each expeditionwould leave camp four to fix the ropes through the Bottleneck and Traverse . The team would be led by Korean climber Kim Jae Soo , and it included Pakistani porter Shaheen Baig , the only climber on the mountain whod been through the Bottleneck and knew where to set the ropes . Shaheen Baig never made it to camp four , however . He turned back sick at camp two . According to Chhiring Dorje Sherpa and Chris Klinke , of the American expedition , when the time came for the rope-fixing team to start working , they discovered that they were short - handed and that some teams had n't brought enough line . The search for more equipment and manpower delayed the advance team for more than two hours , the first of a series of setbacks that would keep all but one climber out well past dark . With Shaheen Baig out of the picture , fixing the ropes fell to half a dozen other loosely organized climbers whod learned their skills on Everest , where the presence of so many less- experienced climbers requires fixing ropes on every inch of the mountain . At some point , after they 'd begun setting the route at the Bottleneck , they were joined by Spaniard Alberto Zerainthe fastest climber on the mountain , but not part of the advance teamwhod climbed straight through from camp three . Without Baig to direct them , the group wasted line on the low- angle slopes below the Bottleneck and ran out of gear well before the crux . When van Rooijen , who 'd set out with the other climbers on their summit bid , arrived around sunrise , he and the others were astonished to find Zerain already there , directing the route setting . \" We had discussed this so many times , \" he recalls , \" what had to be done and who had to take care of this job . \" The Bottleneck soon lived up to its name . Klinke , stuck behind at least 20 climbers , began removing ropes from the lower slopes and passing them up the line . \" There was no way we were moving fast enough to summit and get down before dark \" he says . \" Accidents on K2 happen when people spend too long on their ascent . \" Most climbers aim for a time of 10 to 12 hours between camp four and the summit . This year , nobody reached the top in less than 16 hours . Klinke and his teammates , Eric Meyer and Fredrik Str\u00e4ng , turned back for camp four at about 10 A.M. The first fatality occurred shortly thereafter , in the Bottleneck . Dren Mandic , a Serbian climber who unclipped from the rope to adjust his oxygen equipment and pass another climber , lost his footing and fell onto Cecilie Skog . The rope stopped Skog , but Mandic tumbled hundreds of feet . Meyer and Str\u00e4ng left camp to help but , on the way , received radio communication that Mandic was dead . When they reached Mandic 's corpse , hours later , his teammates were trying to lower the body back to camp four . The recovery went wrong almost immediately . Jehan Baig , a Pakistani porter working for the Serbs , toppled onto Str\u00e4ng before sliding headfirst down the slope . He made no attempt to arrest his fall with his ice ax and tumbled off the mountain . The remaining climbers left Mandic 's body and returned to camp four . Up in the Bottleneck , Pemba Gyalje Sherpa , from the Dutch team , was spooked by the accident and the late hour . He advised the climbers to descend , but Marco Confortola gave a pep talk , noting that the first climbers to summit K2 , in 1954 Italians , like himdid so at 6 P.M. They all continued up . Zerain , climbing solo ahead of the pack , topped out around 3 P.M. and descended so quickly to camp three that he did n't learn of the disaster until the next day . At 5:30 P.M. , Lars Naesse summitted with the Norwegians , followed within half an hour by Skog and Chhiring . Five Koreans and two Sherpas working for them reached the top at 5:40 and , according to Pakistani officials , spent 90 minutes there . Just after 7 P.M. , about an hour before sunset , Van Rooijen , McDonnell , and the rest arrived . All but Cas van de Gevel , of the Dutch team , had started down when Confortola arrived between 7:30 and 8 P.M. ROLF BAE WAS DEAD . The icefall that killed him also took out crucial fixed ropes on the upper mountain . Skog , Naesse , and the 14 others strung out behind them would have to descend the Traverse and Bottleneck in the dark , with only fragments of ropes to clip into . After the disaster , several news stories noted that the climbers were \" stranded \" above the Bottleneck . In reality , the Traverse and the Bottleneck are entirely navigable by an experienced climber with the right equipment . Many earlier expeditions to K2 did n't rely on fixed ropes at all . Instead , climbers tackled the peak alpine - style , ascending and descending while roped only to their teammates . But alpine - style climbing on terrain this steep requires two ice axes , in the same way ice-climbing does . Most of the climbers in August had only one tool each , which made climbing down the dark , debris-strewn slope that much more insecure . After the initial accident , Naesse removed a short rope he carried in his pack , and he and Skog crept over the icy rubble and descended into the Bottleneck . Higher up , the climbers were still unaware of the icefall . Above the Traverse , Cas van de Gevel came upon Hugues d'Aubarede , sitting in the snow , exhausted . The porter Karim Meherban was missing and would not be found . Van de Gevel passed the Frenchman ; soon after , he heard a crash and turned to see d'Aubarede falling into the void . Elsewhere , at the point where the ropes vanished , Chhiring found \" Little \" Pasang Bhote , who 'd been working for the Koreans . Hed lost his ice axe , leaving him unable to continue without the ropes . Chirring tied in with Pasang and the two men kicked steps downward with only Chhiring 's axe to anchor them . \" Either we live together or we die together , \" said Chhiring . Skog and Naesse , meanwhile , had made it through the Bottleneck and reached camp four around 11 P.M. Chhiring , Pasang , Pemba , van de Gevel , and two of the Koreans made it back to camp sometime after midnight . Those in camp could still count nine headlamps above the Bottleneck . The highest three of those lights belonged to van Rooijen , McDonnell , and Confortola . They 'd lost the route above the Traverse because the bamboo wands that should 've marked the linelike breadcrumbshad never been planted . Confortola used his sat phone to call the president of an Italian mountaineering club , who advised him to bivouac rather than risk walking off the edge of the glacier in the dark . Then the phone battery died . Van Rooijen was determined to keep descending , so Confortola dug only two seats in the snowone for McDonnell , a jovial , bearded climber hed taken to calling Jesus , and one for himself . \" Stick with me , \" he told McDonnell . They shouted at one another to stay awake , fearing that if they fell asleep , they 'd fall off the mountain . Van Rooijen continued looking for a way down but eventually planted himself nearby . By the time the sky lightened at dawn , van Rooijen was gone . Confortola and McDonnell began making their way down but soon came upon three Korean climbers Park Kyeong - Hyo , Kim Hyo-Gyeong , and Hwang Dong - Jinall dangling from the same rope . \" All three of them were upside down , hanging , \" recalls Confortola . \" They were still alive , but two of them were in very critical condition . \" One of the Koreans could speak but had lost his boot . Confortola put one of his gloves over the climber 's exposed foot , and McDonnell held the man up while Confortola tried to lift his teammates . They spent three and half hours trying to free the Koreans but gave up when the glacier let loose nearby and reminded them of their perilous location . McDonnell , perhaps confused by the lack of oxygen , climbed back up the slope toward the summit . Confortola shouted to his friend but could n't get his attention . Then he heard an avalanche and recognized two yellow boots in the slide . \" They were Jesus 's boots , \" says Confortola . \" He was in pieces . \" Confortola continued down the mountain alone . Hours later , Pemba , climbing up from camp four , found Confortola asleep in the snow below the Bottleneck and woke him . The Italian was barely on his feet when the serac calved again . An oxygen bottle , knocked loose from above , whacked Confortola 's head , nearly knocking him off the mountain . \" But Pemba covered me like I was his baby , \" recalls Confortola . Whether in the same icefall or in one just before , Jumich Bhote and \" Big \" Pasang Bhote , Sherpas and brothers working for the Korean team , were both killed . Jumich had summitted the night before but had been delayed by the icefall . Pasang , who had not been part of the summit party , had climbed up to help with the rescue . Confortola and Pemba could see body parts protruding from the debris on their way back to camp four . WILCO VAN ROOIJEN WAS ALIVE . He 'd gotten up while it was still dark and somehow survived his solo descent . It was light out , but he was snowblind and had no idea where he was . He did n't have a radio and his stricken eyes could n't read the display of his sat phone to call for help , though he could trace the pattern of his home phone number on the keyboard . His wife , Heleen , who was caring for their nine- month-old son , picked up back in Holland . She then called base camp , where the message was relayed up to Pemba and van de Gevel in camp four : Van Rooijen was still out theresomewhere . Early in the morning , van Rooijen had passed the dangling Koreans , who 'd waved him off . He 'd clipped in to their rope , but it soon ran out . He meandered up and down steep terrain until he found remnants of the fixed ropes hanging straight down over cliffs . He 'd clipped into them and worked sideways , like a pendulum , from rope to rope across the Traverse to the Bottleneck . Then he 'd down - climbed until cliffs blocked his path . \" It was so steep , and I just sat down , \" says van Rooijen . \" I was too tired to climb up again . I was coming to the end of my strength . \" After van Rooijen had called his wife , the team 's webmaster , in Holland , arranged a GPS trace of the signal from the sat phone and located the climber between camps three and four on the Cesen Route . He 'd overshot camp four altogether . Van Rooijen hung up with his wife and slept for a few hours , waking to find his sight improved and the clouds parting to reveal a couloir where he could continue his descent . Through the same break in the whiteout , spotters down in base camp saw a man in an orange suit wandering the mountain . They called up to Pemba and van de Gevel , who descended to intercept van Rooijen . But the sun set again before they could reach him , and van Rooijen hunkered down for his second night out on K2 . In camp three , Pemba could hear van Rooijen 's sat phone ringing nearby , but avalanche - prone slopes kept him from searching for his teammate . The next morning , van Rooijen followed a ridgeline until he saw tents and climbers , although he did n't recognize the scene as his own camp . Van de Gevel , Pemba , and van Rooijen made it off the mountain that evening and were air - lifted to a hospital in Skardu the next morning . On August 5 , aided by rescuers , Marco Confortola hobbled into base camp on badly frostbitten feet . He was the last survivor off the mountain . TWO WEEKS LATER , half a dozen members of the Dutch team sat up front at Gerard McDonnell 's memorial service , in County Limerick , Ireland . More than 2,000 mourners had shown up to honor the first climber from their country to summit K2 . Musicians played , and doves were released into the cold drizzle . Friends presented the family with gifts , and speakers noted that McDonnell most likely would 've survived if he had n't tried to rescue the dying Koreans . \" It 's not just because he wore a beard that he was called Jesus , \" said Father Joe Noonan in his sermon . But van de Gevel , emaciated by his ordeal and crushed by the sorrow of his teammate 's family , saw things differently . \" On the mountain there were no heroes , \" he said , \" just an unspoken agreement that you help as much as you can . \" Back on K2 , it 's likely that little will change . If the trend following the Everest 1996 disaster is any indication , the mountain will become only more popular . On Everest , better forecasting and route setting have staved off another day as catastrophic as the one 12 years agothough not the annual parade of stunts , films , and record attempts . But on a mountain as unrelenting as K2 , little can be done to lessen the danger of 30 climbers rushing the summit . That much is simple .","annotations":[{"text":"Dren Mandic","span":[10583,10593],"token_span":[2003,2004],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The individual that causes the Item and Source to come apart by manipulating the connector."},{"text":"from the rope","span":[10629,10641],"token_span":[2011,2013],"role":"Source","label":"Source","role_definition":"Source identifies the location to which an Item was attached before getting detached."},{"text":"the Bottleneck","span":[10566,10579],"token_span":[2000,2001],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the Agent detaches an Item or Items."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-2526-619-frame-Detonate_explosive","frame":"Detonate_explosive","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Agent causes an Explosive device to explode.","frame_ancestors":["Using","Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"April April 6 - Five Russian soldiers have been killed in Chechnya when their armoured vehicle detonated a mine outside Grozny .

Is this true ? -- Stephanie S. - Columbia , Missouri Answer At the end , thirty feet or so from the counter that closed the entrance , a grinning Negro face bobbed and grimaced through a hole in the back curtain painted to represent a jungle river . The Negro 's head came right out of the spread terrific jaws of a crocodile . \" Hit the nigger in the head , get a good ten cent seegar , \" the barker said . \" Three balls for a dime , folks . Try your skill and accuracy . Hit the nigger baby on the head get a handsome cane and pennant \" ( Stegner , 1957 , p. 47 ) . This was a common chant at numerous carnivals , fairs , and circuses across the United States throughout the late 19th century until the mid 1940s , as Americans took part in one of their favorite pastimes , \" African Dodger . \" The African Dodger , also known as \" Hit the Nigger Baby \" or \" Hit the Coon \" was as commonplace in local fairs , carnivals , and circuses as Ferris wheels and roller coasters are today . The purpose of the game was to hit the target with a ball - with one of your three throws - and win a prize . It sounds like a common carnival target game , but there was one unsettling part of the game , namely , the game 's target was a real live human being , a \" negro \" human being . In St. Louis in 1913 , it was reported that carnival organizers were \" unable for hours today to secure an ' African Dodger ' who would allow baseballs to be thrown at his cranium at the usual rate of three for 5 cents ; \" the reason was that future Hall of Fame fastball pitcher Walter Johnson was rumored to be at the fair ( \" Do n't Want \" , 1913 ) . The game was so popular nationwide that newspapers mentioned the African Dodger game along with trained animals , illusionists , penny arcades , merry - go - rounds and magic shows in the list of a carnival 's attractions . Dodgers made headlines when they were seriously and horrifically injured - otherwise , they were nameless victims . In 1904 in New York , the Meriden Daily Journal reported how a dodger was smashed in the nose by a professional baseball player . The Journal reported that Albert Johnson dodged \" fifty or sixty cents \" worth of balls thrown by \" Cannon Ball \" Gillen of the Clifton Athletic club . Finally Johnson \" exposed his head and face a little farther than usual \" and was caught by a curve ball that left him unconscious . The article , which was written as a play-by - play commentary on the incident , concluded with the report that it \" will probably be necessary to amputate the nose in order to save Johnson 's life \" ( \" Hit African \" , 1904 ) . But this was not the only report of serious injuries to the dodger . There were numerous reports of such incidents ; for example , at the Sheraden Methodist Protestant Church street fair in Pittsburgh , John Jones \" failed to dodge \" and was hit \" squarely in the eye \" ( \" Ball Hits \" , 1916 ) . In Ohio , Grady Williams was struck in the eye by a stone by someone who \" stood to one side and threw a stone at the negro \" ( \" Threw Stone \" , 1915 ) . In Connecticut , Walter Smith was hit \" with such force that several of the dodger 's teeth were knocked out , and the ball was locked so securely within the negro 's mouth that it had to be cut to pieces before it could be removed \" ( \" His Mouth \" , 1908 ) . In Hanover , PA , William White was assaulted by local baseball players who brought their own heavy balls and \" hit the ' coon ' nearly every time . \" The reporter described how \" courageously \" White took the punishment and wrote that the \" negro was pretty well used - up . \" Only after this , do we find out that the injuries sustained by White were internal and \" may prove fatal \" ( \" ' Coon Hitting ' \" , 1908 ) . At an Elks Lodge Jubilee in Washington DC , just 17 miles from the White House , the \" visiting Elks were royally entertained \" as \" ' nigger babies ' were hit with baseballs until they were unable to maintain their upright position ... \" ( \" Elks Jubilee \" , 1908 ) . There may be no better example of the pervasiveness and brutality of the African Dodger game in American society than an advertisement in the Providence News on September 11 , 1924 . Wants African Dodger to Face Balls at Club Fair Do you want to earn a few precious dollars on the evening of September 19 and 20 ? If you do and if you are not at all particular as to what happens to your head why apply at Room 10 in the building at 144 Pine street . Ask for Charlie and tell him you \" saw his ad in the paper \" . Charlie is looking for a lion-hearted and hard - headed young man who will act as an African dodger at the big carnival to be staged by the West Barrington Community Club . The reward ? That is a little matter that you can adjust with Charlie . He will treat you fairly and will see that you reach the Rhode Island Hospital safely in the event that that [ sic ] one of the baseballs comes in contact with your head . We beg your pardon for not detailing the duties of an African dodger . He just puts his head through a hole in a big piece of canvass and permits the aforesaid head to be used as a target by young men who toss baseballs . One day last week an African dodger was killed in Elizabeth , N.J. , and the week before a dodger was killed in Hackensack , but do n't permit these deaths to influence you . ( \" Wants African Dodger \" , 1924 ) . The African Dodger game was widespread in American society , in every part of the country . If you could not make it to the fair , you could purchase for $ .69 an African Dodger table game , which featured a caricatured black face poking through a canvas reading \" Hit the Dodger ! Knock Him Out ! Every Time You Hit Sambo The Bell Rings \" ( \" Bloomingdales \" , 1893 ) . But how could this all be ? How could such a barbaric practice be such an integral part of a \" civilized \" society ? How could Americans justify this practice ? Were there any objections ? One response to objections to the brutality of the African dodger game was to summon authorities to provide \" scientific \" findings on the topic . A short article in The Wayne County Democrat cited \" authorities on anthropology \" who \" state that the negro has a very heavy and massive cranium constituting a bony arch of great resisting power . One scientist refers to the ' common habit of negroes , of both sexes in butting like rams ' [ which ] ... indicates that a negro 's head bones have defensive strength unknown in the Caucasian race . \" The newspaper assures its readers that the dodger does n't mind . \" He seems cheerful about it . \" The players of the game , the ones who throw the ball , are just men with a \" man 's desire to display his powers \" , particularly in front of \" women friends . \" The article finally concludes that until there is evidence that shows \" fractured skulls or brain contusions \" or until the dodger takes issue himself , the game will continue . A final warning is provided to the dodger who may be considering a new line of work that \" He might regret to lose a daily wage that comes with less effort than manual labor \" ( \" The Black Dodger \" , 1913 ) . After all , what could be so bad about a game that was an \" innocent \" sport ( \" Large Crowd \" , 1907 ) and a game that was \" fun for the small boys and the grown - ups as well \" ( \" Dodger \" , 1907 ) ? A game played by Governors ( \" Preparing \" , 1912 ) , famous ball players like Ty Cobb ( \" Bob Thayer \" , 1911 ) and Babe Ruth ( Wagenheim , 1974 , p. 35 ) , what could be wrong with that ? When legislation was presented in 1915 to ban some forms of the game at Coney Island , the headline read : BAN ON \" BONEHEAD \" HITS . The proposed ban was framed as \" depressing news \" for those who may be unable to participate in the \" soothing exercise of hitting with a baseball the head of an ' Ethiopian ' as it protrudes from a hole in a canvas sheet . \" But do n't just feel sorry for the players , understand that \" many persons who have no more profitable use for their heads will join the army of the unemployed \" if the bill is passed and Africans are no longer allowed to dodge ( \" Ban \" , 1915 ) . In 1911 , some carnivals ushered in a new game for the \" progressive era \" called the African Dip , the precursor to the dunk tank . The game was \" arranged that every time a baseball hits the target a colored man , seated upon a bar , is thrown into a large pool of water . It 's said to be lots of fun ... \" ( \" It 's Called \" , 1911 ) . This new game did n't entirely replace the African Dodger . Versions of the original African Dodger were still found in the 1950s . Some carnivals and fairs decided to use targets that resembled African Americans instead of using real people . Promoters sold entire family doll racks that were used as targets at Amusement parks ( A. J. Smith Mfg. Co. , 1914 ) . The development of Amusement parks in permanent locations increased the popularity of the African Dip game because it was hard to travel with the African Dip dunk tank . Riverview Amusement park in Chicago Illinois , was well known for their popular African Dip attraction , which was a staple there until the late 1950s . It may be hard to imagine a world where such barbaric games were accepted and played , and to understand why people would allow themselves to be targets . This is another example of the complexities of relationships during the Jim Crow era . The idea that African Americans were sub-humans was prevalent and widely accepted . Religious speakers , politicians , and scientists all agreed and \" proved \" that the African was a \" less evolved \" creature and therefore not subject to humane treatment . Almost everything in American society pointed to a hierarchical structure , whites on top and blacks at the bottom . With everyday objects , forms of entertainment , advertising and public policies confirming this hierarchy , it is possible to see how whites came to believe they were superior and how some blacks could internalize these images , practices , attitudes and policies and come to see themselves as inferior and to accept the role of target . It 's also difficult for many to see the negative impact of racist games when playing them is associated with fondness of yesteryear . One of the most popular attractions at zoos during this time was the \" Negro Village \" or \" Human Zoo \" , but that 's a topic for another day .

Is this true ? -- Stephanie S. - Columbia , Missouri Answer At the end , thirty feet or so from the counter that closed the entrance , a grinning Negro face bobbed and grimaced through a hole in the back curtain painted to represent a jungle river . The Negro 's head came right out of the spread terrific jaws of a crocodile . \" Hit the nigger in the head , get a good ten cent seegar , \" the barker said . \" Three balls for a dime , folks . Try your skill and accuracy . Hit the nigger baby on the head get a handsome cane and pennant \" ( Stegner , 1957 , p. 47 ) . This was a common chant at numerous carnivals , fairs , and circuses across the United States throughout the late 19th century until the mid 1940s , as Americans took part in one of their favorite pastimes , \" African Dodger . \" The African Dodger , also known as \" Hit the Nigger Baby \" or \" Hit the Coon \" was as commonplace in local fairs , carnivals , and circuses as Ferris wheels and roller coasters are today . The purpose of the game was to hit the target with a ball - with one of your three throws - and win a prize . It sounds like a common carnival target game , but there was one unsettling part of the game , namely , the game 's target was a real live human being , a \" negro \" human being . In St. Louis in 1913 , it was reported that carnival organizers were \" unable for hours today to secure an ' African Dodger ' who would allow baseballs to be thrown at his cranium at the usual rate of three for 5 cents ; \" the reason was that future Hall of Fame fastball pitcher Walter Johnson was rumored to be at the fair ( \" Do n't Want \" , 1913 ) . The game was so popular nationwide that newspapers mentioned the African Dodger game along with trained animals , illusionists , penny arcades , merry - go - rounds and magic shows in the list of a carnival 's attractions . Dodgers made headlines when they were seriously and horrifically injured - otherwise , they were nameless victims . In 1904 in New York , the Meriden Daily Journal reported how a dodger was smashed in the nose by a professional baseball player . The Journal reported that Albert Johnson dodged \" fifty or sixty cents \" worth of balls thrown by \" Cannon Ball \" Gillen of the Clifton Athletic club . Finally Johnson \" exposed his head and face a little farther than usual \" and was caught by a curve ball that left him unconscious . The article , which was written as a play-by - play commentary on the incident , concluded with the report that it \" will probably be necessary to amputate the nose in order to save Johnson 's life \" ( \" Hit African \" , 1904 ) . But this was not the only report of serious injuries to the dodger . There were numerous reports of such incidents ; for example , at the Sheraden Methodist Protestant Church street fair in Pittsburgh , John Jones \" failed to dodge \" and was hit \" squarely in the eye \" ( \" Ball Hits \" , 1916 ) . In Ohio , Grady Williams was struck in the eye by a stone by someone who \" stood to one side and threw a stone at the negro \" ( \" Threw Stone \" , 1915 ) . In Connecticut , Walter Smith was hit \" with such force that several of the dodger 's teeth were knocked out , and the ball was locked so securely within the negro 's mouth that it had to be cut to pieces before it could be removed \" ( \" His Mouth \" , 1908 ) . In Hanover , PA , William White was assaulted by local baseball players who brought their own heavy balls and \" hit the ' coon ' nearly every time . \" The reporter described how \" courageously \" White took the punishment and wrote that the \" negro was pretty well used - up . \" Only after this , do we find out that the injuries sustained by White were internal and \" may prove fatal \" ( \" ' Coon Hitting ' \" , 1908 ) . At an Elks Lodge Jubilee in Washington DC , just 17 miles from the White House , the \" visiting Elks were royally entertained \" as \" ' nigger babies ' were hit with baseballs until they were unable to maintain their upright position ... \" ( \" Elks Jubilee \" , 1908 ) . There may be no better example of the pervasiveness and brutality of the African Dodger game in American society than an advertisement in the Providence News on September 11 , 1924 . Wants African Dodger to Face Balls at Club Fair Do you want to earn a few precious dollars on the evening of September 19 and 20 ? If you do and if you are not at all particular as to what happens to your head why apply at Room 10 in the building at 144 Pine street . Ask for Charlie and tell him you \" saw his ad in the paper \" . Charlie is looking for a lion-hearted and hard - headed young man who will act as an African dodger at the big carnival to be staged by the West Barrington Community Club . The reward ? That is a little matter that you can adjust with Charlie . He will treat you fairly and will see that you reach the Rhode Island Hospital safely in the event that that [ sic ] one of the baseballs comes in contact with your head . We beg your pardon for not detailing the duties of an African dodger . He just puts his head through a hole in a big piece of canvass and permits the aforesaid head to be used as a target by young men who toss baseballs . One day last week an African dodger was killed in Elizabeth , N.J. , and the week before a dodger was killed in Hackensack , but do n't permit these deaths to influence you . ( \" Wants African Dodger \" , 1924 ) . The African Dodger game was widespread in American society , in every part of the country . If you could not make it to the fair , you could purchase for $ .69 an African Dodger table game , which featured a caricatured black face poking through a canvas reading \" Hit the Dodger ! Knock Him Out ! Every Time You Hit Sambo The Bell Rings \" ( \" Bloomingdales \" , 1893 ) . But how could this all be ? How could such a barbaric practice be such an integral part of a \" civilized \" society ? How could Americans justify this practice ? Were there any objections ? One response to objections to the brutality of the African dodger game was to summon authorities to provide \" scientific \" findings on the topic . A short article in The Wayne County Democrat cited \" authorities on anthropology \" who \" state that the negro has a very heavy and massive cranium constituting a bony arch of great resisting power . One scientist refers to the ' common habit of negroes , of both sexes in butting like rams ' [ which ] ... indicates that a negro 's head bones have defensive strength unknown in the Caucasian race . \" The newspaper assures its readers that the dodger does n't mind . \" He seems cheerful about it . \" The players of the game , the ones who throw the ball , are just men with a \" man 's desire to display his powers \" , particularly in front of \" women friends . \" The article finally concludes that until there is evidence that shows \" fractured skulls or brain contusions \" or until the dodger takes issue himself , the game will continue . A final warning is provided to the dodger who may be considering a new line of work that \" He might regret to lose a daily wage that comes with less effort than manual labor \" ( \" The Black Dodger \" , 1913 ) . After all , what could be so bad about a game that was an \" innocent \" sport ( \" Large Crowd \" , 1907 ) and a game that was \" fun for the small boys and the grown - ups as well \" ( \" Dodger \" , 1907 ) ? A game played by Governors ( \" Preparing \" , 1912 ) , famous ball players like Ty Cobb ( \" Bob Thayer \" , 1911 ) and Babe Ruth ( Wagenheim , 1974 , p. 35 ) , what could be wrong with that ? When legislation was presented in 1915 to ban some forms of the game at Coney Island , the headline read : BAN ON \" BONEHEAD \" HITS . The proposed ban was framed as \" depressing news \" for those who may be unable to participate in the \" soothing exercise of hitting with a baseball the head of an ' Ethiopian ' as it protrudes from a hole in a canvas sheet . \" But do n't just feel sorry for the players , understand that \" many persons who have no more profitable use for their heads will join the army of the unemployed \" if the bill is passed and Africans are no longer allowed to dodge ( \" Ban \" , 1915 ) . In 1911 , some carnivals ushered in a new game for the \" progressive era \" called the African Dip , the precursor to the dunk tank . The game was \" arranged that every time a baseball hits the target a colored man , seated upon a bar , is thrown into a large pool of water . It 's said to be lots of fun ... \" ( \" It 's Called \" , 1911 ) . This new game did n't entirely replace the African Dodger . Versions of the original African Dodger were still found in the 1950s . Some carnivals and fairs decided to use targets that resembled African Americans instead of using real people . Promoters sold entire family doll racks that were used as targets at Amusement parks ( A. J. Smith Mfg. Co. , 1914 ) . The development of Amusement parks in permanent locations increased the popularity of the African Dip game because it was hard to travel with the African Dip dunk tank . Riverview Amusement park in Chicago Illinois , was well known for their popular African Dip attraction , which was a staple there until the late 1950s . It may be hard to imagine a world where such barbaric games were accepted and played , and to understand why people would allow themselves to be targets . This is another example of the complexities of relationships during the Jim Crow era . The idea that African Americans were sub-humans was prevalent and widely accepted . Religious speakers , politicians , and scientists all agreed and \" proved \" that the African was a \" less evolved \" creature and therefore not subject to humane treatment . Almost everything in American society pointed to a hierarchical structure , whites on top and blacks at the bottom . With everyday objects , forms of entertainment , advertising and public policies confirming this hierarchy , it is possible to see how whites came to believe they were superior and how some blacks could internalize these images , practices , attitudes and policies and come to see themselves as inferior and to accept the role of target . It 's also difficult for many to see the negative impact of racist games when playing them is associated with fondness of yesteryear . One of the most popular attractions at zoos during this time was the \" Negro Village \" or \" Human Zoo \" , but that 's a topic for another day .

It aired on pay-per-view following prelims on ESPN and UFC Fight Pass . Usman ( 15 - 1 MMA , 10 -0 UFC ) crawled out to the center to start , pressing forward and keeping his guard high as Woodley ( 19 - 4-1 MMA , 9 - 3-1 UFC ) laced out a huge right hand . Usman changed levels shortly after , looking for the takedown , and Woodley tried to grab hold of a guillotine , falling to his back . In half - guard , Usman felt comfortable enough to punch and elbow the body , and Woodley eventually had to let go . Once he let go of the choke , Woodley crawled first to his knees and then to his feet , eventually backing away and again looking to strike . Usman kicked from range and then shot forward looking for the takedown . Woodley continued to defend against the charge , and referee Marc Goddard brought them back to the center . Woodley did land once nice left hand in the closing seconds , though his follow - up takedown was stuffed . Usman again took the center to start the second , moving quickly forward and resuming his grinding attack against the cage . The crowd became restless , but Usman stuck with it . Woodley briefly pulled free , but Usman chased him and wrapped the body , lifting his foe and slamming him to the floor . Usman moved quickly to mount , pressing down from the top and keeping Woodley flat on his back .

Usman kept pressing forward , holding Woodley against the cage , but Goddard brought them back to the center after a bit of a stalemate . In the restart , Usman continued to hold the center .

Usman continued to move forward with his hands high , and he stumbled briefly after a two -punch combination from Woodley snuck partially through his guard . Still , he immediately gave chase again , pressing Woodley to the fence , where they finished the round . Usman charged across the cage to start the fourth , and Woodley set up against the cage . As Usman pushed forward , Woodley nearly landed a clean uppercut but then turned to the guillotine again . Woodley dropped to guard but did n't have control of the neck , and Usman popped out rather quickly , taking top position and looking to dig at the body . With Goddard watching closely , Usman did his best to stay busy and maintain his dominant spot . Woodley worked to guard and then looked to get his back to the cage , but he could n't get up from the seated position . Usman used his shoulder to drive into the chin , though Goddard did bring them back to the feet with a little under two minutes .

As Woodley held on , Usman stomped the feet a bit before eventually lifting his opponent in the air and slamming him to the floor . Woodley was able to move to half - guard and maintained pressure on the head , but there was no control or threat of a submission .

The left engine burst into flames . It was time to bail out . He yanked on the release lever but the cockpit canopy only half - opened . He unbuckled his seat belt , rose to shake the canopy loose and was instantly sucked out . Swinging beneath his opened parachute , he plunged toward a Pacific island jungle of thick , towering eucalyptus trees , of crocodile rivers and headhunters , into enemy territory , and into an unimagined future as a hero , \" Suara Auru , \" Chief Warrior , to generations of islanders yet unborn . Fred Hargesheimer was shot down in the southwest Pacific on June 5 , 1943 . A lifetime later , he sits in his quiet California ranch house amid the snow and soaring sugar pines of the Sierra Nevada foothills . The light blue eyes , at age 91 , ca n't see as well as they once did . But when he looks back over 65 years , the smiling Minnesotan sees it all clearly \u2014 the struggle to survive , the native rescuers , the Japanese patrols and narrow escapes , the mother 's milk that saved him . He remembers well his return to New Britain , the people 's embrace , the fundraising and building , the children taught , the adults cured , the happy years beside the Bismarck Sea with Dorothy , his wife . \" I 'm so grateful for getting shot out of the sky , \" he said . Garua Peni is grateful , too , as a member of those once - future generations here on New Britain . \" I thank God from the depths of my heart for blessing me in such an abundant way when He brought Suara Auru Fred Hargesheimer , \" she said . The tale of Mastah Preddi's The improbable story of \" Mastah Preddi , \" a story of uncommon gratitude and the heart 's uncanny ways , began when the 27- year - old Army lieutenant crashed to the tangled underbrush of the jungle floor . Picking himself up , \" Hargy \" Hargesheimer found no broken bones , but felt a bloody gash on his head , the graze of a bullet or shrapnel . He cut off bits of nylon parachute for a bandage . Then he looked around . He had been on a photo-reconnaissance mission from his base on the main island of New Guinea , tracking ship movements around Japanese-occupied New Britain , a 370 - mile - long crescent of hot , dark , mist-shrouded forests fringed by smoldering volcanos , 700 miles from northeastern Australia . He came down halfway up the slopes of the 4,000 - foot-high Nakanai mountains , in a wilderness of torrential rains , giant ferns , venomous insects and vicious wild pigs whose tusks could kill a man . Hargesheimer checked his survival kit , finding compass , machete , extra ammunition for his pistol , and two bars of concentrated chocolate , his only food . First he set out southward , hoping to cross the mountains and reach New Britain 's south coast , and somehow from there the island of New Guinea , 300 miles across the Solomon Sea . Steep and muddy slopes defeated him , however , and he turned north instead , toward the Bismarck Sea . Remembering the small inflatable raft in his kit , he tried floating down a stream , but a huge crocodile reared up and sent him scrambling back ashore . \" The Lord is my shepherd ' Day by day , he pushed agonizingly through the choking jungle , hoping for a trail or clearing . At night , he recalled , he 'd lie beneath a parachute shelter , dreaming he was home in bed in Rochester , Minn . After 10 days , as his chocolate dwindled , he came upon a riverside clearing and an empty native lean - to , and decided to settle in , start a fire with his emergency matches , and hunt for food . Snails he found in the riverbed became his staple for weeks to come , roasted by the dozen . His daily existence in the jungle was miserable . Leeches clung to his skin . Flying insects sought out his eyes and nose . Losing weight and strength , out of matches and desperately keeping his fire going , he suffered through nightmares of dying alone in the jungle . From his youthful days as an Episcopalian lay reader , the lost pilot summoned words of hope . \" The Lord is my shepherd . I shall not want , \" he told himself , over and over . From memory each day , he 'd recite that 23rd Psalm to its comforting final verse , \" Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life ... \" And on the 31st day , he heard voices on the river . When they came to him , he cried . Reassurance comes in song Villagers here on the north coast had seen the distant plane go down . Now , in an outrigger canoe on an upriver hunting trip , they had their eyes out for a pilot . Finding Hargesheimer by the riverside , Lauo , their \" luluai , \" or chief , showed the bearded , haggard white man a note written by an Australian officer saying these villagers had saved other pilots and could be trusted . That night by the river , Lauo 's party exploded with wild singing and feasting , unnerving the young American , who had been warned by intelligence officers of headhunters in these highlands . Then , as they sang in an island tongue , he picked out the melody : \" Onward , Christian Soldiers . \" He felt reassured . They took him downriver to their seaside village , Ea Ea , a place of grass - roofed lean - tos . They gave him a hut and fed him boiled pig , shellfish and taro , their starchy tuber mainstay . He went fishing with them in their canoes under cover of darkness , and began to learn Pidgin , the islanders ' simple , English - based common language . In his tattered aviator 's uniform , he joined in services each Sunday led by three Christian missionaries , natives who had fled New Britain 's main town , Rabaul , when the Japanese landed 17 months earlier . Because enemy troops patrolled the beaches , Hargesheimer spent many days in a hut hidden in a nearby swamp . But one day he was caught away from his hideout when an alarm went up that Japanese were approaching . Village friend Joseph Gabu led the American into the rain forest , sending him up a eucalyptus tree to hide . Bitten , sick and too weak to eat Through the night , he was tormented by swarms of mosquitoes , until finally the next day Gabu came for him . All was clear , but within weeks Hargesheimer was stricken with the severe chills and fever of mosquito-borne malaria . It left him prostrate , weakening , not eating for days . He asked for milk , but there was none . Then the missionary Apelis asked whether he would drink \" susu . \" He brought his wife , Ida , to the hut , carrying their month-old baby . She slipped behind the grass wall and returned with a cup of milk . For 10 or more days following , she supplied Hargesheimer with her \" susu , \" mother 's milk that helped restore his health . Villagers protected \" Mastah Preddi \" \u2014 Master Freddie \u2014 apparently because they hated the Japanese for their cruel treatment of natives . Time and again , the low echo of a conch shell blown by a villager would warn of Japanese . If Mastah Preddi wore his boots as he rushed to hide , children would follow with makeshift brooms , sweeping away his prints from the sand . The village took a great risk by protecting him from the Japanese , he says . \" If they 'd seen my boot prints , I think they would have tortured everyone in the village until they produced me . \" When he finally left , \" some of them wanted me to take their children back to the States with me , \" he recalls , sitting so many years later in the afternoon light at his dining table , sharing indelible memories of human kindness . Fred Hargesheimer walked repeatedly through the 23rd Psalm 's \" valley of the shadow of death , \" always emerging safely with the help of the people of Ea Ea . ' Debt I had to repay ' In February 1944 , eight months after he was shot down , Hargesheimer was picked up from a New Britain beach by a U.S. submarine , in a rendezvous arranged by Australian \" coastwatcher \" commandos operating behind Japanese lines . He returned to civilian life after the war ended in 1945 . By then he had married Dorothy Sheldon of Ashtabula , Ohio , and by 1949 they had three children \u2014 Richard , Eric and Carol . In 1951 , he took a sales job with a Minnesota forerunner of computer maker Sperry Rand , his employer ever after . But the people of Ea Ea never left his mind . He corresponded with a missionary to learn how they had fared . He studied and restudied international air schedules . \" The more I thought about my experience with the people in New Guinea , the more I realized what a debt I had to try to repay , \" he said . With books on his mind In 1960 , with the family vacation money and the family 's blessing , Hargesheimer made a solitary , 11,000 - mile journey back to New Britain , biggest outer island of Papua New Guinea , then Australian -run , now independent . The villagers , hearing Mastah Preddi was coming , lined the beach and sang \" God Save the Queen \" as he stepped from a boat in the moonlight . \" It was wonderful , overwhelming , \" he said . He was met by Luluai Lauo , Joseph Gabu and others , and later found Ida and her 16 - year - old son , to thank her , too . But \" a simple thank you did n't seem enough , \" he recalled . Back home , he consulted with a missionary , who told him what the people needed : a school . The Minnesota salesman went to work , canvassing relatives , meeting with church groups , speaking to service organizations . He raised $ 15,000 over three years , \" most of it $ 5 and $ 10 gifts . \" A school is built With the money and 17- year - old son Dick in tow , he returned to New Britain in 1963 . He was given church land in Ewasse , a central settlement near Ea Ea , now renamed Nantabu . There a contractor raised the area 's first permanent elementary school \u2014 cement floor , metal roof , sturdy walls . He brought in New Guinean teachers , American volunteers and an Australian headmaster , and the Airmen 's Memorial School opened in 1964 with 40 pupils and four classrooms . But Fred Hargesheimer was n't finished . Back in the U.S. , a brief spurt of publicity drew more contributions , he got more ideas , and this story of a debt repaid grew , decade by decade . But it was a story little known or celebrated beyond New Britain 's welcoming villages . In 1969 , his fund built a library at the school and a clinic for Ewasse . By then , too , the school 's successful plot of oil palm helped pave the way for a large plantation of the lucrative crop , with scores of jobs , easing the deep poverty here in Bialla district . Rows of the stout palms today blanket the hills , property of Belgian - owned Hargy Oil Palm Ltd. , west of a large lake named Hargy . Once his own children were grown , Hargesheimer saw an opportunity to \" say thank you in a meaningful way . \" In 1970 , he and Dorothy packed up and moved to New Britain , to teach the children themselves and to build a second school \u2014 this time closer to Nantabu , next door in the village of Noau , at the foot of the smoking Mount Ulawan volcano . Garua Peni , then 10 , was one of their first students . \" I thought , ' Wow ! They left their place to come here for us , just to share themselves with us , ' \" she recalled . Dorothy said their four years here were the best of their lives , despite New Britain 's difficulties \u2014 of supplies , transportation , the surprises of local culture . \" Dorothy sometimes had a problem registering children , because they would change their names often , just on a whim , \" Hargesheimer recalls with a laugh . But the couple , leaving New Britain in 1974 , had less than a dozen more years left together . In 1985 , at age 63 , Dorothy Hargesheimer died of a heart attack . Pilot becomes ' Suara Auru ' The old pilot flew on alone , visiting New Britain every two or three years , funneling fresh funds into his causes , finding ever-warm embraces . On a visit in 2000 , they proclaimed him , in a great tribute , \" Suara Auru , \" \" Chief Warrior \" in the local Nakanai language . Then , in 2006 , Hargesheimer , at 90 , returned for what he said would be his last visit . Life had changed here since he first walked in the shadow of Mount Ulawan . Grass huts have given way to concrete- block houses , conch shells to cell phones . The men favor slacks over sarongs and all the women wear tops . Blue-eyed cockatoos may still squawk in the forest , but their eucalyptus trees are falling to loggers by the millions . As he was carried past them in a ceremonial canoe and Nakanai headdress , thousands cheered . \" The people were very happy . They 'll always remember what Mr. Fred Hargesheimer has done for our people , \" says Ismael Saua , 69 , a former teacher at the Airmen 's school . Mastah Preddi had come back for a special reason : His old P-38 fighter had been found deep in the jungle . He was flown by helicopter up the winding Pandi River , the river he once descended by canoe , and then carried in a chair by Nakanai men to the site , to view what 's left of the plane he bailed out of so long ago . As usual , he also had business to attend to , dedicating a new library at the Noau school . The schools had an enrollment of some 500 , and a list of well - educated alumni numbering many hundreds more , including Garua Peni . She had gone on to an advanced degree in linguistics in Australia and now was taking over Hargesheimer 's New Guinea foundation as chairperson . He may have taken a step back , but his heart was still in New Britain . And the love they returned at times seemed almost mystical . At one point , in the 1960s , he was told villagers planned to send the late Luluai Lauo 's bones to him in Minnesota , a trust he solemnly declined . ' I was very rich ' As he looks back from his Grass Valley , Calif. , retirement home , Hargesheimer says he often mused over the word \" if . \" Why , for example , did n't the Japanese pilot finish him off as he floated helplessly down beneath his parachute ?

The left engine burst into flames . It was time to bail out . He yanked on the release lever but the cockpit canopy only half - opened . He unbuckled his seat belt , rose to shake the canopy loose and was instantly sucked out . Swinging beneath his opened parachute , he plunged toward a Pacific island jungle of thick , towering eucalyptus trees , of crocodile rivers and headhunters , into enemy territory , and into an unimagined future as a hero , \" Suara Auru , \" Chief Warrior , to generations of islanders yet unborn . Fred Hargesheimer was shot down in the southwest Pacific on June 5 , 1943 . A lifetime later , he sits in his quiet California ranch house amid the snow and soaring sugar pines of the Sierra Nevada foothills . The light blue eyes , at age 91 , ca n't see as well as they once did . But when he looks back over 65 years , the smiling Minnesotan sees it all clearly \u2014 the struggle to survive , the native rescuers , the Japanese patrols and narrow escapes , the mother 's milk that saved him . He remembers well his return to New Britain , the people 's embrace , the fundraising and building , the children taught , the adults cured , the happy years beside the Bismarck Sea with Dorothy , his wife . \" I 'm so grateful for getting shot out of the sky , \" he said . Garua Peni is grateful , too , as a member of those once - future generations here on New Britain . \" I thank God from the depths of my heart for blessing me in such an abundant way when He brought Suara Auru Fred Hargesheimer , \" she said . The tale of Mastah Preddi's The improbable story of \" Mastah Preddi , \" a story of uncommon gratitude and the heart 's uncanny ways , began when the 27- year - old Army lieutenant crashed to the tangled underbrush of the jungle floor . Picking himself up , \" Hargy \" Hargesheimer found no broken bones , but felt a bloody gash on his head , the graze of a bullet or shrapnel . He cut off bits of nylon parachute for a bandage . Then he looked around . He had been on a photo-reconnaissance mission from his base on the main island of New Guinea , tracking ship movements around Japanese-occupied New Britain , a 370 - mile - long crescent of hot , dark , mist-shrouded forests fringed by smoldering volcanos , 700 miles from northeastern Australia . He came down halfway up the slopes of the 4,000 - foot-high Nakanai mountains , in a wilderness of torrential rains , giant ferns , venomous insects and vicious wild pigs whose tusks could kill a man . Hargesheimer checked his survival kit , finding compass , machete , extra ammunition for his pistol , and two bars of concentrated chocolate , his only food . First he set out southward , hoping to cross the mountains and reach New Britain 's south coast , and somehow from there the island of New Guinea , 300 miles across the Solomon Sea . Steep and muddy slopes defeated him , however , and he turned north instead , toward the Bismarck Sea . Remembering the small inflatable raft in his kit , he tried floating down a stream , but a huge crocodile reared up and sent him scrambling back ashore . \" The Lord is my shepherd ' Day by day , he pushed agonizingly through the choking jungle , hoping for a trail or clearing . At night , he recalled , he 'd lie beneath a parachute shelter , dreaming he was home in bed in Rochester , Minn . After 10 days , as his chocolate dwindled , he came upon a riverside clearing and an empty native lean - to , and decided to settle in , start a fire with his emergency matches , and hunt for food . Snails he found in the riverbed became his staple for weeks to come , roasted by the dozen . His daily existence in the jungle was miserable . Leeches clung to his skin . Flying insects sought out his eyes and nose . Losing weight and strength , out of matches and desperately keeping his fire going , he suffered through nightmares of dying alone in the jungle . From his youthful days as an Episcopalian lay reader , the lost pilot summoned words of hope . \" The Lord is my shepherd . I shall not want , \" he told himself , over and over . From memory each day , he 'd recite that 23rd Psalm to its comforting final verse , \" Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life ... \" And on the 31st day , he heard voices on the river . When they came to him , he cried . Reassurance comes in song Villagers here on the north coast had seen the distant plane go down . Now , in an outrigger canoe on an upriver hunting trip , they had their eyes out for a pilot . Finding Hargesheimer by the riverside , Lauo , their \" luluai , \" or chief , showed the bearded , haggard white man a note written by an Australian officer saying these villagers had saved other pilots and could be trusted . That night by the river , Lauo 's party exploded with wild singing and feasting , unnerving the young American , who had been warned by intelligence officers of headhunters in these highlands . Then , as they sang in an island tongue , he picked out the melody : \" Onward , Christian Soldiers . \" He felt reassured . They took him downriver to their seaside village , Ea Ea , a place of grass - roofed lean - tos . They gave him a hut and fed him boiled pig , shellfish and taro , their starchy tuber mainstay . He went fishing with them in their canoes under cover of darkness , and began to learn Pidgin , the islanders ' simple , English - based common language . In his tattered aviator 's uniform , he joined in services each Sunday led by three Christian missionaries , natives who had fled New Britain 's main town , Rabaul , when the Japanese landed 17 months earlier . Because enemy troops patrolled the beaches , Hargesheimer spent many days in a hut hidden in a nearby swamp . But one day he was caught away from his hideout when an alarm went up that Japanese were approaching . Village friend Joseph Gabu led the American into the rain forest , sending him up a eucalyptus tree to hide . Bitten , sick and too weak to eat Through the night , he was tormented by swarms of mosquitoes , until finally the next day Gabu came for him . All was clear , but within weeks Hargesheimer was stricken with the severe chills and fever of mosquito-borne malaria . It left him prostrate , weakening , not eating for days . He asked for milk , but there was none . Then the missionary Apelis asked whether he would drink \" susu . \" He brought his wife , Ida , to the hut , carrying their month-old baby . She slipped behind the grass wall and returned with a cup of milk . For 10 or more days following , she supplied Hargesheimer with her \" susu , \" mother 's milk that helped restore his health . Villagers protected \" Mastah Preddi \" \u2014 Master Freddie \u2014 apparently because they hated the Japanese for their cruel treatment of natives . Time and again , the low echo of a conch shell blown by a villager would warn of Japanese . If Mastah Preddi wore his boots as he rushed to hide , children would follow with makeshift brooms , sweeping away his prints from the sand . The village took a great risk by protecting him from the Japanese , he says . \" If they 'd seen my boot prints , I think they would have tortured everyone in the village until they produced me . \" When he finally left , \" some of them wanted me to take their children back to the States with me , \" he recalls , sitting so many years later in the afternoon light at his dining table , sharing indelible memories of human kindness .

Dahl joined the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1933 , during which time he was commissioned to Second Lieutenant . In February 1936 , Dahl was kicked out of the army because of compulsive gambling and civil court convictions . He then became a freelance pilot for a while before getting into trouble with some Los Angeles based gamblers . He fled to Mexico City where he flew airships , charter flights and ferried aircraft to Vera Cruz for shipment to the Spanish Republic . He served as a volunteer on the Government side during the Spanish Civil War and used the nom de guerre Hernando Diaz Evans . By February 1937 , capit\u00e1n Ram\u00f3n Puparelli Francia was well enough ( he had been wounded in combat on 21 October 1936 ) to be given command of the first two Spanish I - 15 escuadrillas . The short - lived grupo was named Grupo de Caza No 16 but both escuadrillas were to operate virtually independently . Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda La Calle was put in command of the 1a Escuadrilla . Initially it comprised three elements . The 1a Patrulla consisted of La Calle , Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n , Ram\u00f3n Casta\u00f1eda di Campo and Ben Leider , the 2a Patrulla comprised of Jim Allison , Frank Tinker , Dahl and Jos\u00e9 Chang Sell\u00e9s and the 3a Patrulla was made up of Luis Bercial , Esteban Ortiz , Jos\u00e9 Riverola Gr\u00faas and Gerardo Gil S\u00e1nchez ( who joined the unit on 10 February ) . Capit\u00e1n Roberto Alonso Santamar\u00eda took command of the new second Spanish I - 15 escuadrilla , the 2a Escuadrilla , which was established at Los Alc\u00e1zares and San Javier . From there they moved to El Soto airfield , again on the Madrid front . The new escuadrilla comprised tenientes Rafael Robledano Ruiz , Juan Comas Borr\u00e1s ( posted in late February ) , Antonio Blanch Latorre , Ricardo Rubio G\u00f3mez , Mariano Palacios Men\u00e9ndez , \u00c1ngel \u00c1lvarez Pacheco , Justo Garc\u00eda Esteban and Hip\u00f3lito Barbeito Ramos , sargentos Manuel Garc\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n , Alfonso Calvo Ortiz , C\u00e1ndido Palomar Agraz and Rafael Magri\u00f1a Vidal and Uruguayan teniente Luis Tuya . On 7 February , the 1a Escuadrilla moved to the old Hispano - Suiza aerodrome in Guadalajara . They began operations at El Jarama , where their activities were outstanding , but their losses heavy ; Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n , Ben Leider and Luis Bercial were killed , while Jim Allison and Dahl were shot down but survived . In the early morning on 18 February , two Nationalist Ro.37s ( flown by Spanish pilots ) took off , followed by three Ju 52/3 ms escorted by the Spanish Patrulla Azul and the Italian Fiat Group ( totally 25 CR.32 including the Spanish ) . When they arrived over the front at Jarama , the CR.32 s turned so that they were patrolling parallel to the front , while a large formation of Polikarpov fighters waited on the other side . When the Ro.37s and Ju 52/3 ms were safe and returning , capit\u00e1n Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda Morato broke formation and , followed by teniente Julio Salvador D\u00edaz -Benjumea and capit\u00e1n Narciso Berm\u00fades de Castro , launched himself into Soviet fighters near Arganda . Disregarding recent orders restricting them from engaging superior numbers of enemy aircraft , Italian pilots tenente Corrado Ricci , tenente Enrico Degli Incerti , capitano Guido Nobili and Fiacchino went to the assistance of their Spanish comrades by leading their respective flights against the large Republican formation of Polikarpov fighters . Finally , the entire group took part in the battle , fighting a reportedly 21 I - 15s and 18 I - 16s , and the Italians claimed for four Curtiss fighters destroyed and four probables , as well as four Ratas destroyed and one probables . One I -16 and two probable I - 15s were claimed by tenente Degli Incerti while sergente maggiore Silvio Costigliolo claimed an I -15 in the Arganda area . Sergente maggiore Guido Presel claimed two I - 15s and a probable and sergente maggiore Brunetto di Montegnacco claimed two I - 16s . Among the Spaniards , capit\u00e1n Morato , who returned with damage to his fighter , was credited with an I - 15 and another as a probable while teniente Salvador was credited with and I - 16 and a second fighter as a probable . The Italians suffered no losses during this action , and only a solitary pilot was forced to make an emergency landing after he was wounded ; the damage to his CR.32 was quickly repaired . Tenente Degli Incerti described the combat : We were on the return leg of an escort mission , and having made sure that our bombers were safe , we had the airfield in sight and prepared to land . It was at that very moment that the three Spanish CR.32 pilots following us , but still flying over enemy territory , decided to take on a large Soviet formation . Although the enemy aircraft were still some distance away , we performed a hasty 180 - degree turn at full throttle and joined the fray . All the Italian fighter flights following suit , despite us having orders only to intervene following provocation our duty was to fight as courageously as possible to the end . Reportedly this battle was fought at 11:00 against at least the I - 15s of the Escuadrilla La Calle and Escuadrilla Jos\u00e9 ( the Escuadrilla led by Ivan Kopets ) and the I - 16s from Escuadrilla Kolesnikov ( 1a/21 ) . The Republican pilots reported meeting six Junkers and 50 fighters ( other sources states 85 ( ! ) Heinkel He 51s ) over the front . Immediately the Escuadrilla went into a tight horizontal circle ( Lufbery circle ) . The first enemy aircraft fired randomly at the I - 15s as they dived past the Escuadrillas defensive pattern . Unwillingly to challenge the Republican fighters , the remainder of the Nationalist pilots followed suit , executing a single strafing pass , and then flying lazily below the I - 15s in hopes of enticing a few green Republican pilots away of the defensive protection . Ben Leider took the bait and started down after one of the easy - looking targets , only to attract three enemy fighters on his tail . As Frank Tinker peered over his shoulder during the swirling melee of aircraft , he saw Leiders I - 15 to shudder as the CR.32s flashed past . Tinkers heart sank as he noticed Leider veer toward friendly territory in a shallow dive . Twice , Leider tried to land his fighter in a small field before slamming into the side of a hill , killing him . Once we had engaged the enemy , both sides formed a long line of aircraft , and this was turning , banking and circling . The fighters alternated in this single file trail , with two or three Reds for every Nationalist . It was as if this formation had been planned . Many tracer rounds flashed through the sky from the aircraft , turning the dogfight into an infernal ballet . Smoke trails of death suddenly appeared , and the long line broke into smaller rows . The battle threw up numerous small skirmishes that ended inconclusively . Despite being outnumbered , we legionnaires stood together , compact , protecting each other . All of a sudden in the centre of the melee an aircraft caught fire and a parachute opened . The former fell away and crashed to the ground , while the latter floated away to safety . A Red had been shot down . Four of his comrades , fearing that we 'd shoot at the pilot , circled him for his protection . Two CR.32s engaged them . This turn of events split the battle into two groups , within which fierce fighting continued . The Curtiss fighter section then broke off their attack , unable to defeat our concentrated gunfire . They tried to escape , but this move failed and two of the stubby fighters fell in flames . Thirty minutes into the battle , thousands of bullets had crossed the sky over Villaconejos . By now the revolving aircraft and chatter of the guns had diminished . The fighting faded slowly away , and within a short time we remained as the sole masters of the sky over the Jarama front . On 20 March 1937 , the 1a Escuadrilla ( Escuadrilla La Calle ) took part in the last aerial combat during the battle of Guadaljara . They took off in four patrols , led by Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda La Calle , Dahl , Frank Tinker ( CA-056 ) and the Guatemalan pilot Miguel Garc\u00eda Granados , and were soon involved with three bombers and 20 Fiats . Granados patrol was jumped by the Fiats , which had been patrolling in a higher altitude , and in the first hail of bullets Granados was shot down . Tinker gained his second victory at 17:00 ( M. Scala KIA ? ) , and from the two squadrons of fighters taking part five Fiats were destroyed . The Italians reported that a patrol of four Fiat fighters under the command of Capitano Mario Viola had taken off from El Burgo de Osma in the afternoon and subsequently bounced two I - 15s flying at low altitude in the vicinity of Almadrones . Sergente Maggiore Brunetto di Montegnacco shot one of the aircraft down in flames in spite of his opponents violent evasive action , the pilot taking to his parachute and being captured . Montegnaccos victim was Miguel Garcia Granados , who suffered burns to his face and one hand and he was captured ( he later returned in a prison exchange ) . Granados ( 1896 -1968 ) was a former Colonel in the Guatemalan Air Force who had done a famous goodwill flight in 1929 from Washington DC to Guatemala . He had previously commanded the Guatemalan air force , with the rank of colonel , between 1930 and 1933 . He had also served with the Paraguayan Air Force in the Gran Chaco War . During the spring of 1937 , the second group of Soviet volunteers was sent to Spain . The group was led by Kapitan Ivan Yeremenko and included Leitenant Mikhail Yakushin ( ' Carlos Castej\u00f3n ' ) , Leonid Rybkin , Mikhail Petrov , Sergei Shalyganov and Ivan Karpov . They travelled through France with Dutch passports - they did n't speak either foreign language fluently ! Not without adventures the Soviet fliers arrived at their destination on 31 May 1937 . Arriving with them where Spanish Republican pilots who had been undergoing fighter training at the Soviet flight school near Kirovabad . At the same time as this second group of Soviet volunteers arrived , another batch of 31 Chatos arrived from the Soviet Union , taking the total number supplied to the Republicans to 116 . These new fighters greatly enhanced the strength of the I - 15 Grupo . After arrival , an escuadrilla of I - 16 fighters , designated 1a Escuadrilla of Grupo de Caza No 21 ( 1 a/21 ) , was organized under the command of Kapitan Ivan Yeremenko while Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda La Calle was to undergo further training in the Soviet Union . Initially this unit performed defensive duties from Cartagena and Elche to Alicante , protecting Republican warships and cargo vessels from insurgent air raids . Following the redeployment of the I - 16s to the north , and the poor quality of the latest batch of I - 16s to reach Spain and during a period of forced inaction in June 1937 , half of the group was sent to Los Alcazares airfield , where it was re-equipped with the new I - 15s . The new escuadrilla was later designated 1a /26 and commanded by Kapitan Ivan Yeremenko . The Russian pilots in this escuadrilla included Yevgeniy Antonov , Ivan Karpov , Georgii Masterov , Mikhail Petrov , Leonid Rybkin , Anatoly Serov , Nikolai Sobolev , Sergei Shalyganov and Mikhail Yakushin . The 1a/26 was completed by pilots of different origin ; three Spanish , two Austrian , two Americans ( one of them was Dahl ) and the Yugoslav Bozidar Petrovich . It is also known that Leitenant Leonid Rybkin served as a Patrulla leader and Dahl was part of this Patrulla . Another Patrulla leader was Yevgeniy Antonov . The escuadrilla , was based at El Soto , had already become operational two days after the Brunete campaign began and where aviation played considerable role . The insurgents increased their presence in the air battles by using German and Italian units armed with the newest aircraft . Nevertheless , Soviet fliers gained considerable success there , claiming numerous enemy aircraft shot down . On 13 July , Feldwebel Peter Boddem of 2.J/88 ( Bf 109B ) claimed an I - 16 in the course of an hour - long air battle which also saw Feldwebel Braunschweiger ( 6 - 13 ) and Oberfeldwebel Fritz Hillman claim an unconfirmed I - 16 each . It is possible that one of these claims ( possibly Boddem ) was Dahl , who was shot down and taken prisoner during the day . Dahl was tried and sentenced to death together with radio / gunner Aleksey Fedorovich Cherkasov , who had been shot down in an SB the day before . The sentence was commuted and he remained in a Spanish prison until 1940 , when he was allowed to return to the US . Dahl is reputed to have claimed 5 biplane victories during his time in Spain . When he returned to the US he found out that his wife , Edith , had divorced him . Dahl spent several months of rest a relaxation before going to Canada to join the Royal Canadian Air Force where he became a commissioned officer . He served with the RCAF with distinction throughout WW II and remarried . After the war , Dahl was cashiered out of the RCAF for selling equipment , which had not been declared surplus . He went to Venezuela for a short time before signing on to join Swissair in which he flew the Geneva to Paris route . He got into trouble again in 1953 when a gold bar turned up missing on one of his flights . He was arrested and sat in prison for months awaiting trial . He was released during his appeal and ordered to leave Switzerland . Dahl returned to Canada and became a bush pilot . On 14 February 1956 Dahl died in a fatal crash in the DC - 3 he was piloting near Fort Chimo , 800 miles north of Quebec , Canada .

Dahl joined the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1933 , during which time he was commissioned to Second Lieutenant . In February 1936 , Dahl was kicked out of the army because of compulsive gambling and civil court convictions . He then became a freelance pilot for a while before getting into trouble with some Los Angeles based gamblers . He fled to Mexico City where he flew airships , charter flights and ferried aircraft to Vera Cruz for shipment to the Spanish Republic . He served as a volunteer on the Government side during the Spanish Civil War and used the nom de guerre Hernando Diaz Evans . By February 1937 , capit\u00e1n Ram\u00f3n Puparelli Francia was well enough ( he had been wounded in combat on 21 October 1936 ) to be given command of the first two Spanish I - 15 escuadrillas . The short - lived grupo was named Grupo de Caza No 16 but both escuadrillas were to operate virtually independently . Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda La Calle was put in command of the 1a Escuadrilla . Initially it comprised three elements . The 1a Patrulla consisted of La Calle , Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n , Ram\u00f3n Casta\u00f1eda di Campo and Ben Leider , the 2a Patrulla comprised of Jim Allison , Frank Tinker , Dahl and Jos\u00e9 Chang Sell\u00e9s and the 3a Patrulla was made up of Luis Bercial , Esteban Ortiz , Jos\u00e9 Riverola Gr\u00faas and Gerardo Gil S\u00e1nchez ( who joined the unit on 10 February ) . Capit\u00e1n Roberto Alonso Santamar\u00eda took command of the new second Spanish I - 15 escuadrilla , the 2a Escuadrilla , which was established at Los Alc\u00e1zares and San Javier . From there they moved to El Soto airfield , again on the Madrid front . The new escuadrilla comprised tenientes Rafael Robledano Ruiz , Juan Comas Borr\u00e1s ( posted in late February ) , Antonio Blanch Latorre , Ricardo Rubio G\u00f3mez , Mariano Palacios Men\u00e9ndez , \u00c1ngel \u00c1lvarez Pacheco , Justo Garc\u00eda Esteban and Hip\u00f3lito Barbeito Ramos , sargentos Manuel Garc\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n , Alfonso Calvo Ortiz , C\u00e1ndido Palomar Agraz and Rafael Magri\u00f1a Vidal and Uruguayan teniente Luis Tuya . On 7 February , the 1a Escuadrilla moved to the old Hispano - Suiza aerodrome in Guadalajara . They began operations at El Jarama , where their activities were outstanding , but their losses heavy ; Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n , Ben Leider and Luis Bercial were killed , while Jim Allison and Dahl were shot down but survived . In the early morning on 18 February , two Nationalist Ro.37s ( flown by Spanish pilots ) took off , followed by three Ju 52/3 ms escorted by the Spanish Patrulla Azul and the Italian Fiat Group ( totally 25 CR.32 including the Spanish ) . When they arrived over the front at Jarama , the CR.32 s turned so that they were patrolling parallel to the front , while a large formation of Polikarpov fighters waited on the other side . When the Ro.37s and Ju 52/3 ms were safe and returning , capit\u00e1n Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda Morato broke formation and , followed by teniente Julio Salvador D\u00edaz -Benjumea and capit\u00e1n Narciso Berm\u00fades de Castro , launched himself into Soviet fighters near Arganda . Disregarding recent orders restricting them from engaging superior numbers of enemy aircraft , Italian pilots tenente Corrado Ricci , tenente Enrico Degli Incerti , capitano Guido Nobili and Fiacchino went to the assistance of their Spanish comrades by leading their respective flights against the large Republican formation of Polikarpov fighters . Finally , the entire group took part in the battle , fighting a reportedly 21 I - 15s and 18 I - 16s , and the Italians claimed for four Curtiss fighters destroyed and four probables , as well as four Ratas destroyed and one probables . One I -16 and two probable I - 15s were claimed by tenente Degli Incerti while sergente maggiore Silvio Costigliolo claimed an I -15 in the Arganda area . Sergente maggiore Guido Presel claimed two I - 15s and a probable and sergente maggiore Brunetto di Montegnacco claimed two I - 16s . Among the Spaniards , capit\u00e1n Morato , who returned with damage to his fighter , was credited with an I - 15 and another as a probable while teniente Salvador was credited with and I - 16 and a second fighter as a probable . The Italians suffered no losses during this action , and only a solitary pilot was forced to make an emergency landing after he was wounded ; the damage to his CR.32 was quickly repaired . Tenente Degli Incerti described the combat : We were on the return leg of an escort mission , and having made sure that our bombers were safe , we had the airfield in sight and prepared to land . It was at that very moment that the three Spanish CR.32 pilots following us , but still flying over enemy territory , decided to take on a large Soviet formation . Although the enemy aircraft were still some distance away , we performed a hasty 180 - degree turn at full throttle and joined the fray . All the Italian fighter flights following suit , despite us having orders only to intervene following provocation our duty was to fight as courageously as possible to the end . Reportedly this battle was fought at 11:00 against at least the I - 15s of the Escuadrilla La Calle and Escuadrilla Jos\u00e9 ( the Escuadrilla led by Ivan Kopets ) and the I - 16s from Escuadrilla Kolesnikov ( 1a/21 ) . The Republican pilots reported meeting six Junkers and 50 fighters ( other sources states 85 ( ! ) Heinkel He 51s ) over the front .

Captain A. Michael brought down one of the Soviet -mad jets with the missile and the other with a salvo from his cannons . The victory was the first time that Israeli fighters had defeated a MIG - 19 and the first Israeli-Egyptian air clash since 1961 when Israeli pilots shot down a MIG - 17 . The battle , which lasted about two minutes at 15,000 feet , near Nitzana , began when two MIGs went after a Piper scouting plane on a routine reconnaissance mission . Israeli radar picked up the MIGs and orders were sent to an Air Force base . Two Israeli Mirage jets rose to intercept the MIGs . Initially , two MIG - 17 jets entered Israeli territory in pursuit of the Piper which went into evasive action and disappeared without being seen by the Egyptian pilots . The first two MIGs then returned to Egyptian territory . A few minutes later , two other MIGs , this time the more advanced MIG - 19s , flew over Israeli territory in a straight line from Sinai , apparently also searching for the Piper Cub . When the Egyptian pilots sighted the Mirage jets they tried to run off but the 26- year - old Israeli captain moved in too quickly . Describing the encounter , Captain Michael said that when he received the order to attack , he fired his air - to - air missile at less than a mile distance . He said he saw the missile hit the MIG which exploded into \u201c a mushroom of flame . \u201d Captain Michael then maneuvered toward the second MIG , which was engaged in evasive action , and hit the MIG with a cannon salvo .

Captain A. Michael brought down one of the Soviet -mad jets with the missile and the other with a salvo from his cannons . The victory was the first time that Israeli fighters had defeated a MIG - 19 and the first Israeli-Egyptian air clash since 1961 when Israeli pilots shot down a MIG - 17 . The battle , which lasted about two minutes at 15,000 feet , near Nitzana , began when two MIGs went after a Piper scouting plane on a routine reconnaissance mission . Israeli radar picked up the MIGs and orders were sent to an Air Force base . Two Israeli Mirage jets rose to intercept the MIGs . Initially , two MIG - 17 jets entered Israeli territory in pursuit of the Piper which went into evasive action and disappeared without being seen by the Egyptian pilots . The first two MIGs then returned to Egyptian territory . A few minutes later , two other MIGs , this time the more advanced MIG - 19s , flew over Israeli territory in a straight line from Sinai , apparently also searching for the Piper Cub . When the Egyptian pilots sighted the Mirage jets they tried to run off but the 26- year - old Israeli captain moved in too quickly . Describing the encounter , Captain Michael said that when he received the order to attack , he fired his air - to - air missile at less than a mile distance . He said he saw the missile hit the MIG which exploded into \u201c a mushroom of flame . \u201d Captain Michael then maneuvered toward the second MIG , which was engaged in evasive action , and hit the MIG with a cannon salvo .

ANTELOPE ISLAND STATE PARK , Utah ( AP ) -- In 1893 , bison -- all but wiped out after decades of slaughter -- came to Antelope Island , but not because of the Endangered Species Act or a firestorm from environmentalists . They came because businessmen , cattle ranchers and hunters wanted their chance -- so common in 1850 , so rare in 1890 -- to drop the one - ton beasts . By 1893 , an Antelope Island State Park brochure estimates there were only about 800 bison -- down from a high of at least 45 million -- remaining in the United States that year , when the first dozen were shipped to the island . It was n't a reintroduction . There is no evidence that bison roamed Antelope Island before Kit Carson named it for the herds of antelope found there . There were mule deer , coyotes , bobcats and bighorn sheep , and maybe the occasional mountain lion or elk , according to Clay Shelley , curator of Fielding Garr Ranch . But no bison . It was n't an attempt to save the species , either . Opportunity simply knocked -- when William Glasmann could n't draw people to his Buffalo Park on the Great Salt Lake 's south shore , he put his dozen bison on the auction block -- and Antelope Island owner John Dooly answered . Glasmann , an Ogden publisher , thought the once - common species was finally novel enough to make a nice tourist attraction . Apparently , it was n't . Dooly decided to see if shooting a bison was rare and attractive enough to supplement income from his cattle ranch . He also apparently brought over eight elk , another potential hunting trophy , according to the Aug. 17 , 1893 , Davis County Clipper . The elk were soon gone -- \" It 's not really elk country , \" Shelley said -- but the bison troop started what is now the oldest publicly owned bison herd in the world . The bison herd is now worth about $ 120,000 annually to Antelope Island State Park , money made from an auction of excess animals ( on Nov. 19 this year ) and spent on habitat projects and other bison management activities . The park also still allows six hunters to harvest bison , a practice that adds another $ 8,000 to state coffers . Hunts started at least by 1896 , when the Standard - Examiner reported a group of Salt Lake City hunters shot a 2,317 - pound bison after ranch managers noticed the animal \" becoming savage . \" Occasional hunts continued and the herd grew . To 28 in 1905 . To about 100 in 1910 . Between 1910 and 1926 , the herd fluctuated between 100 and 400 , growing then being thinned by hunts when the animals ate too much of the cattle 's grass . In 1920 , the Parowan Times called it the largest herd in the United States . The howls from preservationists started around then , when a bison tag cost $ 200 . In 1921 , for instance , the Eureka Reporter delivered a scathing attack on the hunting of Antelope Island 's \" noble herd . \" The Reporter and the Times both noted efforts to buy the island and turn it into a wildlife preserve . That did n't happen , but in 1926 , the bison hunt -- perhaps too much of a burden with public sentiment mounting against it -- effectively ended . It went out with a bang : The final \" Big Buffalo Hunt \" killed all but a few of the island 's bison . Ranchers continued to kill a few bison a year to keep the herd in check , but the numbers rebounded slowly , according to \" Visions of Antelope Island \" by Marlin Stum . Meanwhile , sheep replaced cattle as the animal of choice on the island , and the last antelope died of starvation in 1933 , Stum wrote . When the state of Utah completed its purchase of the island in 1981 -- realizing the wildlife preserve goal of 1920s preservationists -- the bison herd had grown to about 250 head , all of which were grazing on the island 's interior , away from about 1,200 cattle that used the island until 1984 . There were still no antelope or bighorn sheep -- the natives were brought back in 1993 and 1997 , respectively . They also gave elk another shot , releasing a dozen in 1993 along with the antelope . But it was no more successful than the first release 100 years earlier . \" They either drowned or swam off the island , \" Shelley said . Most headed for the Oquirrh Mountains , the Tooele County range , said Steve Bates , now the habitat biologist for the island , but a few stayed for a while . \" I found the last cow 's bones four years ago , \" Bates said . Under state park management , the bison herd got larger than ever , and managers started to worry that overgrazing would return , this time by wild bison rather than domestic sheep and cattle . So , in 1987 , the annual Bison Roundup began , the most recent version of which was last weekend . The herd is now managed closely , bison are treated annually for parasites and disease , and numbers are thinned not by hunting but by the annual auction , which also pays for bison additions to supplement the gene pool . Bates keeps the old cows -- which lead the herd -- until they stop calving , and sells off mostly calves and 2 - year - old bulls , a total of 150 to 200 a year . He takes note of range conditions and adjusts the herd size accordingly . ( It 's been kept to 450 for the last few drought years , but is now on its way back to 550 with the healthy vegetation . ) It 's a more scientific method than the grow - and - hunt ( or \" slaughter , \" as the Eureka Reporter termed it ) that occurred through the 1920s . But it 's still human management of a species that , if left unchecked , can eat more than is good for its range . Only now , instead of several thousand cattle or sheep , the bison are sharing the island with 200 antelope , 200 bighorn sheep , 250 mule deer and 300,000 annual visitors .

The National Society of Genetic Counselors has a wealth of online CEU options currently available with a significant number of CEUs offered upon completion . The ABGC Board will continue to monitor issues around certification and recertification during these unprecedented times . Recertification Recertification demonstrates a commitment to maintaining the standard of ethical and competent practice set by the profession , and is significant for licensing , professional advancement , hospital credentialing and privileging and insurance reimbursement . ABGC implemented a mandatory recertification requirement for any Diplomate certified in 1996 or later . Diplomates may recertify by examination or by participation in appropriate continuing education activities . If a Diplomate chooses to recertify by examination , she or he should follow the application guidelines and eligibility requirements included in the Examination Bulletin . Each Diplomate is responsible for : - Applying for recertification within the allotted time frame - Creating and updating the contact information on her / his ABGC Portal profile - Keeping current with ABGC news , information , policy , rules and regulations Newly certified Diplomates can start earning CEUs towards recertification as soon as the month after they have successfully completed the examination . To check your current recertification cycle eligibility period , log in to your Certification Renewal portal and click on \u201c Recertify \u201d in the upper right . Retired Professional Activity Credits ( PACS ) As part of evaluating the continuing education activities used for recertification , the ABGC Board of Directors issued Standards and Guidelines for CEUs and CEU providers . As a continuation of this activity , the Board reviewed the approved Professional Activity Credits ( PACs ) to ensure that what is accepted by ABGC falls within these new guidelines . Based on this analysis , several of the existing PACs do not meet the new CEU Standards and Guidelines . Therefore , the Board made the decision to retire these PAC activities . This decision is effective as of December 31 , 2019 . Therefore , the deadline to use any retiring PAC was 12/31/2019 . Please plan now for replacing any of the anticipated credits earned from these activities after 12/31/2019 .

The National Society of Genetic Counselors has a wealth of online CEU options currently available with a significant number of CEUs offered upon completion . The ABGC Board will continue to monitor issues around certification and recertification during these unprecedented times . Recertification Recertification demonstrates a commitment to maintaining the standard of ethical and competent practice set by the profession , and is significant for licensing , professional advancement , hospital credentialing and privileging and insurance reimbursement . ABGC implemented a mandatory recertification requirement for any Diplomate certified in 1996 or later . Diplomates may recertify by examination or by participation in appropriate continuing education activities . If a Diplomate chooses to recertify by examination , she or he should follow the application guidelines and eligibility requirements included in the Examination Bulletin . Each Diplomate is responsible for : - Applying for recertification within the allotted time frame - Creating and updating the contact information on her / his ABGC Portal profile - Keeping current with ABGC news , information , policy , rules and regulations Newly certified Diplomates can start earning CEUs towards recertification as soon as the month after they have successfully completed the examination . To check your current recertification cycle eligibility period , log in to your Certification Renewal portal and click on \u201c Recertify \u201d in the upper right . Retired Professional Activity Credits ( PACS ) As part of evaluating the continuing education activities used for recertification , the ABGC Board of Directors issued Standards and Guidelines for CEUs and CEU providers . As a continuation of this activity , the Board reviewed the approved Professional Activity Credits ( PACs ) to ensure that what is accepted by ABGC falls within these new guidelines . Based on this analysis , several of the existing PACs do not meet the new CEU Standards and Guidelines . Therefore , the Board made the decision to retire these PAC activities . This decision is effective as of December 31 , 2019 . Therefore , the deadline to use any retiring PAC was 12/31/2019 . Please plan now for replacing any of the anticipated credits earned from these activities after 12/31/2019 . As part of this analysis , it was determined that graduate coursework and case conference / peer supervision groups ( now retired PAC activities ) would qualify as a Category 2 CEU .

He was , for more than a decade , the chairman and chief executive of the UAC conglomerate , a business with interests in a wide range of sectors , and which worth as a group rivaled the annual budget of some African countries . Anyone who could sit atop the huge and complex UAC in the dual capacities of chairman of the board of directors and chief executive was reasonably good to run Nigeria . All things considered , Shonekan exhibited the mark of a patriot . Urbane titan and champion of Nigeria 's private sector , the Abese of Egbaland , and former head of Nigeria government who died on January 11 , 2022 at age 85 , was a patriot . As executive chairman of a business colossus , Shonekan did n't just happen . He attended reputable schools \u2013 CMS Grammar School , Lagos , University of London where he took a law degree in 1962 , and Harvard Business School . So educationally grounded , he was employed assistant legal adviser by UAC in 1964 . Surely , competence , steadfastness , and patience stood him in good stead to steadily rise through the ranks . At age 40 he was on the board of directors . In 1980 , he attained the topmost position in the group of companies . As head of the UAC , a company founded in 1929 , Shonekan was the private sector 's most important voice on the state of the Nigerian economy . His opinion , nay , pronouncement , on a federal budget made a huge difference between the well informed on such matters and the ordinary man on the street . So influential was Shonekan that when he spoke on matters of the country 's economy , many believed that the UK ( that largely owned the UAC ) had spoken . Considering his staying power as head of the company , he was a boardroom guru who while in charge \u2013 and this is to his eternal credit \u2013 also held UAC to its core values and avowed code of business conduct . In sum , Shonekan did well for himself and for UAC . And then he was called ostensibly , to a higher , but arguably a troubling service . General Ibrahim Babangida , under pressure from the self- inflicted complications and crises of his convoluted , never-ending political plan , invited Shonekan into national service in January 1993 to head a 27 - member Transitional Council to run the transition from military to civil rule programme , manage the economy , and implement a somewhat distressed 1993 federal budget . The council was , in Shonekan 's words ' ' conceived in crisis and born in crisis . '' Coming from a background of certain management style and values that worked perfectly for the private sector world , Shonekan patriotically took the job bringing what he knew to a Nigerian government system diametrically opposed in values and in practice to what he thought should apply . He applied himself diligently to the task at hand , and with eyes set upon financial prudence , sought debt cancellation from foreign creditors to relieve the national economy , began the process to audit the opaque operations of the huge , intolerably inefficient Federal Government owned oil company NNPC , and set a timetable to withdraw Nigerian troops from the ECOMOG for reasons that obviously include its corruption - ridden drain on the country 's purse . The Transitional Council was deliberately created to be under the watchful eyes ( and subtle and purely self - seeking control ) of the military : Babangida was military head of state and General Sani Abacha was both minister of defence an chief of defence staff . If at all Shonekan saw through the contrivance , he stayed focused on doing his duty to his country as best as he could under the circumstance . But he lacked power and authority to do what needed to be done . Late June , 1993 , Babangida ( with the connivance , willful or inadvertent , of some other persons and groups ) annulled the June 12 , 1993 presidential election and thereby outraged the international community as well as threw the country under Shonekan into chaotic protests that in August 26 forced Babangida out of power handing over to an ' Interim National Government ' headed by Shonekan . But the real power remained with Abacha as defence minister . Shonekan served in his newly designated position for only 82 days \u2013 till November 17 , 1993 . But again , given where he was coming from \u2013 his personality , his training , and his values - he sought to bring some sanity and transparency into governance , in his words , ''to bring honour to government and take steps against \u2026 corruption and indiscipline in society . '' For example , it is reported that he ordered a probe into a N100 million deal between the Nigerian Postal Service , and foreign airlines to distribute mails ; sanctioned top officials of the NNPC and sought to bring the private sector to work more closely with government under an '' Economic Action Agenda . '' He pursued the respect for human rights and freed many detained protesters , pardoned persons accused or convicted of political offences , and generally sought to restore peace and stabilise the country . Furthermore , his interim government had in his words '' put in place the machinery for local and presidential elections in February 1994 . '' Despite his efforts , Abacha , driven by naked ambition , seized power on November 17 , 1993 . Opinion was rife that , all along , Shonekan was a mere pawn in the game of the military saddled with a bobby - trapped contraption of a government . Shonekan might be a ' guru ' in the world of business ; placed in the arena of Nigerian politics with despicable and unrepentantly self - seeking players , he was not exactly found wanting . But he certainly did n't cope well \u2013 and for quite understandable reasons . In the business world , he came , he saw , he conquered ; in the world of national politics , he came , he saw , did his best . But that was not at all good enough for his country . Certainly , not by the private sector standards that he helped to set . It is regrettable that he did not document for posterity his experience in government . Should he have accepted Babangida 's offer ? Could he have served Nigeria in a different and more effective capacity ? The answers to these are anyone 's guess . Could the chief have done things differently ? Possibly so ; for he should have seen through Babangida 's ' dark agenda , ' to borrow the phrase of respected columnist Olatunji Dare .

Luckily for them , health provision is good . The Sidra Medical and Research Center , the first of its kind in the Middle East , is due to open next year . It is designed to offer state - of - the art research facilities as well as education and health care for women and children locally and across the Gulf . The project has been endowed with \u00a3 4.6bn by the Qatar Foundation , which was set up in 1995 to modernise the emirate and improve education for all . The centre will employ more than 5,000 people , including 2,000 nurses , 600 doctors and 800 other health care professionals plus managers and support staff . While Sidra is still under construction , Qatar is already well equipped to meet the health needs of its two million people \u2013 locals and expats . Unlike neighbouring Saudi Arabia , Qatar has not made medical insurance mandatory for expats . It plans to do so before the end of next year but in the meantime , the only requirement for visitors , residents and Qataris is a health card . These can be bought at ports of entry for QR100 ( around \u00a3 17 ) and renewed online . With a card , immediate and initial medical care is generally free for all , whatever one 's nationality . Some expats report that this holds good even if they do n't have a health card handy . Free care is not guaranteed on a second appointment under these circumstances . Aetna , a major US health care company ( aetna.com ) advises : \" The health card entitles you to free treatment at public hospitals and subsidised prices on prescription medicines . However , accessing these services can be a difficult task , filled with bureaucracy and confusion . To avoid these complications , expatriates in Qatar are strongly encouraged to take out private health insurance . \" You would hardly expect Aetna , also an insurer , to say different . But its recommendation to buy cover fits with other advice . The Foreign and Commonwealth Office says of Qatar : \" Emergency medical treatment is excellent but can be expensive . Routine treatment is available but expensive for visitors . \" Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation . \" If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip , dial 999 and ask for an ambulance . You should contact your insurance / medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment . \" Buying cover could be likened to dining at the Ritz . The experience is more enjoyable if someone else pays \u2013 in this case your employer . Every effort should be made by workers to get good medical insurance written into their employment contract . When this is not possible , premiums can be held at affordable levels by opting for an excess ( or deductible ) , which works on the same basis as in motor insurance . Raymond Lepr\u00eatre , director of Expat Assure ( expatassure.com ) , an independent broker based in the City of London , made this point in recommending four insurance companies . Using an example , a 42 - year - old man moving to Qatar would pay an annual premium of \u00a3 1,661 for comprehensive cover with InterGlobal 's Select plan ( interglobalpmi.com ) . He would save more than \u00a3 300 if he opted for an excess of \u00a3 100 per medical condition per year , resulting in an annual premium of \u00a3 1,359 . The decision to opt for the excess would only be negated if he were to make \u00a3 100 - plus claims relating to three separate medical conditions over 12 months . Another plan for the same individual is Now Health Advance . The premium is \u00a3 2,299 , dropping to \u00a3 1,503 for an excess of \u00a3 155 per medical condition per year . It is possible to dispense with the \" per medical condition \" clause by a straightforward excess in order to be covered , after paying the excess , irrespective of the variety of claims . Here , William Russell 's Elite Silver plan ( william-russell.com ) charges \u00a3 2,205 without excess ( \u00a3 1,608 with a \u00a3 150 excess ) . Another UK - based provider , ALC ( alchealth.com ) , charges \u00a3 2,634 without excess ( \u00a3 2,328 with a \u00a3 150 excess ) . All the plans cover rescue and repatriation , specialist fees , a private hospital room , tests and other features . Mr Lepr\u00eatre said it is important to look for chronic , or recurrent , disease cover . \" All four plans of course cover the onset of a chronic condition and acute exacerbations , but long - term maintenance can be expensive , with treatment lasting many years , sometimes for life , \" he said . In that context , the plans from William Russell offered the best long - term protection for the 42- year - old man used as an example , as there is no upper limit within the overall ceiling of \u00a3 1,250,000 a year for all claims . The other three plans do have an upper limit .","annotations":[{"text":"Qatar","span":[0,4],"token_span":[0,0],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place is the location within which the teaching takes place.

Luckily for them , health provision is good . The Sidra Medical and Research Center , the first of its kind in the Middle East , is due to open next year . It is designed to offer state - of - the art research facilities as well as education and health care for women and children locally and across the Gulf . The project has been endowed with \u00a3 4.6bn by the Qatar Foundation , which was set up in 1995 to modernise the emirate and improve education for all . The centre will employ more than 5,000 people , including 2,000 nurses , 600 doctors and 800 other health care professionals plus managers and support staff . While Sidra is still under construction , Qatar is already well equipped to meet the health needs of its two million people \u2013 locals and expats . Unlike neighbouring Saudi Arabia , Qatar has not made medical insurance mandatory for expats . It plans to do so before the end of next year but in the meantime , the only requirement for visitors , residents and Qataris is a health card . These can be bought at ports of entry for QR100 ( around \u00a3 17 ) and renewed online . With a card , immediate and initial medical care is generally free for all , whatever one 's nationality . Some expats report that this holds good even if they do n't have a health card handy . Free care is not guaranteed on a second appointment under these circumstances . Aetna , a major US health care company ( aetna.com ) advises : \" The health card entitles you to free treatment at public hospitals and subsidised prices on prescription medicines . However , accessing these services can be a difficult task , filled with bureaucracy and confusion . To avoid these complications , expatriates in Qatar are strongly encouraged to take out private health insurance . \" You would hardly expect Aetna , also an insurer , to say different . But its recommendation to buy cover fits with other advice . The Foreign and Commonwealth Office says of Qatar : \" Emergency medical treatment is excellent but can be expensive . Routine treatment is available but expensive for visitors . \" Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation . \" If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip , dial 999 and ask for an ambulance . You should contact your insurance / medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment . \" Buying cover could be likened to dining at the Ritz . The experience is more enjoyable if someone else pays \u2013 in this case your employer . Every effort should be made by workers to get good medical insurance written into their employment contract . When this is not possible , premiums can be held at affordable levels by opting for an excess ( or deductible ) , which works on the same basis as in motor insurance . Raymond Lepr\u00eatre , director of Expat Assure ( expatassure.com ) , an independent broker based in the City of London , made this point in recommending four insurance companies . Using an example , a 42 - year - old man moving to Qatar would pay an annual premium of \u00a3 1,661 for comprehensive cover with InterGlobal 's Select plan ( interglobalpmi.com ) . He would save more than \u00a3 300 if he opted for an excess of \u00a3 100 per medical condition per year , resulting in an annual premium of \u00a3 1,359 . The decision to opt for the excess would only be negated if he were to make \u00a3 100 - plus claims relating to three separate medical conditions over 12 months . Another plan for the same individual is Now Health Advance . The premium is \u00a3 2,299 , dropping to \u00a3 1,503 for an excess of \u00a3 155 per medical condition per year . It is possible to dispense with the \" per medical condition \" clause by a straightforward excess in order to be covered , after paying the excess , irrespective of the variety of claims . Here , William Russell 's Elite Silver plan ( william-russell.com ) charges \u00a3 2,205 without excess ( \u00a3 1,608 with a \u00a3 150 excess ) . Another UK - based provider , ALC ( alchealth.com ) , charges \u00a3 2,634 without excess ( \u00a3 2,328 with a \u00a3 150 excess ) . All the plans cover rescue and repatriation , specialist fees , a private hospital room , tests and other features . Mr Lepr\u00eatre said it is important to look for chronic , or recurrent , disease cover . \" All four plans of course cover the onset of a chronic condition and acute exacerbations , but long - term maintenance can be expensive , with treatment lasting many years , sometimes for life , \" he said . In that context , the plans from William Russell offered the best long - term protection for the 42- year - old man used as an example , as there is no upper limit within the overall ceiling of \u00a3 1,250,000 a year for all claims . The other three plans do have an upper limit .","annotations":[{"text":"The Sidra Medical and Research Center","span":[157,193],"token_span":[32,37],"role":"Institution","label":"Institution","role_definition":"An educational establishment, such as a school or college."},{"text":"Qatar","span":[0,4],"token_span":[0,0],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place is the location within which the teaching takes place.

Problem is that for centuries church calendars in the East and the West have agreed that there are twelve days of Christmas and they begin on Christmas Day and end on January 6 . The twelve days of Christmas end with the Feast of Epiphany also called \" The Adoration of the Magi \" or \" The Manifestation of God . \" Celebrated on January 6 , it is known as the day of the Three Kings ( or wise men / magi ) : Caspar , Melchior and Balthasar . According to an old legend based on a Bible story , these three kings saw , on the night when Christ was born , a bright star , followed it to Bethlehem and found there the Christchild and presented it with gold , frankincense and myrrh .

The sweets , chocolate ornaments wrapped in foil or cookies , which have replaced The history of Christmas , ( the festival of the nativity of Jesus Christ , ) is intertwined with that of the Epiphany . The commemoration of the Baptism ( also called the Day of Lights , i.e. the Illumination of Jesus ) was also known as the birthday of Jesus , because he was believed to have been born then of the Virgin or reborn in baptism . In some records Christmas and Epiphany were referred to as the first and second nativity ; the second being Christ 's manifestation to the world . In the fourth century , December 25 was finally adopted by the Western Christian Church as the date of the Feast of Christ 's birth . It is believed that this change in date gave rise to the tradition of the \" 12 Days of Christmas . \" While the Western Christian Church celebrates December 25th , the Eastern Christian Church to this day recognizes January 6 as the celebration of the nativity . January 6 was also kept as the physical birthday in Bethlehem . In the Teutonic west , Epiphany became the Festival of the Three Kings ( i.e. the Magi ) , or simply Twelfth day . On the evening before Three Kings , traditionally there were prayers , blessed dried herbs would be burnt and their aromatic smell would fill the house . Doorways would be sprinkled with holy water and the master of the house would write with chalk C + M + B and the year above the house and barn door and say : \" Caspar , Melchior , Balthasar , beh\u00fctet uns auch f\u00fcr dieses Jahr , vor Feuer und vor Wassergefahr . \" ( \" CMB , protect us again this year from the dangers of fire and water . \" ) C + M + B has traditionally been translated with Caspar , Melchior and Balthasar , however , according to the Church it stands for \" Christus Mansionem Benedictat \" ( Christ bless this home ) . The custom of the Star Singers , reminiscent of the travel of the Three Kings is still very much alive in Bavaria and Austria . Beginning with New Years and through January 6 , children dressed as the kings , and holding up a large star , go from door to door , caroling and singing a Three Kings ' song . For this they receive money or sweets . Formerly the collected donations went to unemployed craftsmen and veterans , today . Oldtimers of Jasper in Indiana still remember the times when January 6 was celebrated . Lillian Doane and her family lived app . 4 miles out of town . Since it was a holy day they would go to church over the corduroy road . Claude and Martina Eckert also remember it as a special day . \" People would put their trees out for the city to pick up and then all would be told that six o'clock this evening they would burn the Christmas trees . That was sometime ago ; now the city will pick them up and chop them up as mulch .

The sweets , chocolate ornaments wrapped in foil or cookies , which have replaced The history of Christmas , ( the festival of the nativity of Jesus Christ , ) is intertwined with that of the Epiphany . The commemoration of the Baptism ( also called the Day of Lights , i.e. the Illumination of Jesus ) was also known as the birthday of Jesus , because he was believed to have been born then of the Virgin or reborn in baptism . In some records Christmas and Epiphany were referred to as the first and second nativity ; the second being Christ 's manifestation to the world . In the fourth century , December 25 was finally adopted by the Western Christian Church as the date of the Feast of Christ 's birth . It is believed that this change in date gave rise to the tradition of the \" 12 Days of Christmas . \" While the Western Christian Church celebrates December 25th , the Eastern Christian Church to this day recognizes January 6 as the celebration of the nativity . January 6 was also kept as the physical birthday in Bethlehem . In the Teutonic west , Epiphany became the Festival of the Three Kings ( i.e. the Magi ) , or simply Twelfth day . On the evening before Three Kings , traditionally there were prayers , blessed dried herbs would be burnt and their aromatic smell would fill the house . Doorways would be sprinkled with holy water and the master of the house would write with chalk C + M + B and the year above the house and barn door and say : \" Caspar , Melchior , Balthasar , beh\u00fctet uns auch f\u00fcr dieses Jahr , vor Feuer und vor Wassergefahr . \" ( \" CMB , protect us again this year from the dangers of fire and water . \" ) C + M + B has traditionally been translated with Caspar , Melchior and Balthasar , however , according to the Church it stands for \" Christus Mansionem Benedictat \" ( Christ bless this home ) . The custom of the Star Singers , reminiscent of the travel of the Three Kings is still very much alive in Bavaria and Austria . Beginning with New Years and through January 6 , children dressed as the kings , and holding up a large star , go from door to door , caroling and singing a Three Kings ' song . For this they receive money or sweets . Formerly the collected donations went to unemployed craftsmen and veterans , today . Oldtimers of Jasper in Indiana still remember the times when January 6 was celebrated . Lillian Doane and her family lived app . 4 miles out of town . Since it was a holy day they would go to church over the corduroy road . Claude and Martina Eckert also remember it as a special day . \" People would put their trees out for the city to pick up and then all would be told that six o'clock this evening they would burn the Christmas trees . That was sometime ago ; now the city will pick them up and chop them up as mulch . If you chipped in a tree you can get a bag of mulch . \" For the Reichmanns in Brown County , \" Dreik\u00f6nigsabend \" is always a special event . If there are any treats left on the tree ( Ruth buys them at the Heidelberg Haus in Indianapolis ) , the grandchildren come to get them . In the evening there is a big gathering with Christmas foods , Gl\u00fchwein and Stollen and Christmas carols with Eberhard at the piano . Ruth M.

The tiny comestibles are very high in protein , it noted , especially compared to meats such as beef and pork . In the poor , rural communities of Mexico 's central highlands and southern states , families have been eating insects for generations as tradition , but also out of necessity . \" We ate them because we were hungry , \" said Mario Rendon , a bug supplier at the San Juan market . He said he grew up in the southern state of Guerrero learning to catch and consume them seasonally . When the rains came in late spring , he and his brothers would accompany their father on cricket - capturing expeditions , trapping them in nets .

The stink bugs are typically eaten live and are prized for their powerful anise - like flavour and cinnamon finish .

The new data comes from a sample of married women who used AshleyMadison.com , a dating website aimed at people seeking to cheat on their partners . The new conclusions challenge the popular conception that women cheat because they are generally unhappy with their relationships , said study lead author Eric Anderson , a professor of sport , masculinity and sexuality at the University of Winchester in England . \" People will often say that infidelity is a sign of a deeper relationship trouble , \" Anderson said . But that storyline largely comes from the therapist 's couch , after a woman has gotten caught cheating , he added . \" When you get caught doing anything that is highly stigmatized , you make excuses . The excuse becomes , ' Well my husband does n't treat me well , oh there 's a problem in the relationship , ' \" said Anderson , who is chief science officer at AshleyMadison.com . [ 6 Scientific Tips for a Successful Marriage ] The findings will be presented on Monday ( Aug. 18 ) at the American Sociological Association 's 109th annual meeting . Causes of cheating Though monogamy is the norm in modern society , adultery is fairly common , with up to one - third of men and one- quarter of women in the U.Shaving at least one affair outside of their primary relationship at some point in their lives , according to a 2011 study in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior . But figuring out why people cheat is trickier . The most entrenched storyline is that men are unfaithful because they want more sexual variety , whereas women step out to get their emotional needs met , Anderson said . And some studies suggest that women who are unhappy with relationships are likelier to cheat . Still , someone 's justifications after the fact may be very different from their initial reasons for straying , Anderson said . Women lose interest in sex with their partners the longer they are in a relationship , according to a 2012 study in the Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy . So it may be that , just like men , female cheaters are seeking an extra sexual frisson , he said . Seeking affair Anderson and his colleagues gained access to the profiles and messages sent by 100 married , heterosexual women , who listed their age as between 35 and 45 . All told , that included about 42,000 lines of text , Anderson said . Most of the women exchanged a few messages with potential partners before taking their interaction offline or ending conversation altogether , he said . \" They did n't know I was reading their conversations , \" which enabled Anderson to study their self - professed motivations , without them worrying about being judged , Anderson said . ( When they sign up for Ashley Madison , users agree to terms of service that include the possibility that their profile information and usage of the site may be studied for research purposes , Anderson said . ) About two -thirds of the women said they were seeking more romantic passion , which always involved sex . And none of the women wanted to leave their spouses , with many even talking up their husbands , the researchers found . Though the findings are limited to just one dating website \u2014 and one catering to people seeking to cheat \u2014 they suggest that many women who are unfaithful are not dissatisfied overall with their partners , Anderson said . Emotional or rational ? Most of the women wanted just one affair partner and sought at least some emotional connection , Anderson said . \" They needed a bit of a relationship to have an affair , whereas men are more willing to go off and just have sex with whoever , \" Anderson said . It 's possible that women need more emotional connection to enjoy sex , or that they are simply being rational , so they choose to have a single , more involved , affair , he said . \" If you 're off having multiple affairs with multiple people , your chances of getting caught go up , \" Anderson said .

The new data comes from a sample of married women who used AshleyMadison.com , a dating website aimed at people seeking to cheat on their partners . The new conclusions challenge the popular conception that women cheat because they are generally unhappy with their relationships , said study lead author Eric Anderson , a professor of sport , masculinity and sexuality at the University of Winchester in England . \" People will often say that infidelity is a sign of a deeper relationship trouble , \" Anderson said . But that storyline largely comes from the therapist 's couch , after a woman has gotten caught cheating , he added . \" When you get caught doing anything that is highly stigmatized , you make excuses . The excuse becomes , ' Well my husband does n't treat me well , oh there 's a problem in the relationship , ' \" said Anderson , who is chief science officer at AshleyMadison.com . [ 6 Scientific Tips for a Successful Marriage ] The findings will be presented on Monday ( Aug. 18 ) at the American Sociological Association 's 109th annual meeting . Causes of cheating Though monogamy is the norm in modern society , adultery is fairly common , with up to one - third of men and one- quarter of women in the U.Shaving at least one affair outside of their primary relationship at some point in their lives , according to a 2011 study in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior . But figuring out why people cheat is trickier . The most entrenched storyline is that men are unfaithful because they want more sexual variety , whereas women step out to get their emotional needs met , Anderson said . And some studies suggest that women who are unhappy with relationships are likelier to cheat . Still , someone 's justifications after the fact may be very different from their initial reasons for straying , Anderson said . Women lose interest in sex with their partners the longer they are in a relationship , according to a 2012 study in the Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy . So it may be that , just like men , female cheaters are seeking an extra sexual frisson , he said . Seeking affair Anderson and his colleagues gained access to the profiles and messages sent by 100 married , heterosexual women , who listed their age as between 35 and 45 . All told , that included about 42,000 lines of text , Anderson said . Most of the women exchanged a few messages with potential partners before taking their interaction offline or ending conversation altogether , he said . \" They did n't know I was reading their conversations , \" which enabled Anderson to study their self - professed motivations , without them worrying about being judged , Anderson said . ( When they sign up for Ashley Madison , users agree to terms of service that include the possibility that their profile information and usage of the site may be studied for research purposes , Anderson said . ) About two -thirds of the women said they were seeking more romantic passion , which always involved sex . And none of the women wanted to leave their spouses , with many even talking up their husbands , the researchers found . Though the findings are limited to just one dating website \u2014 and one catering to people seeking to cheat \u2014 they suggest that many women who are unfaithful are not dissatisfied overall with their partners , Anderson said . Emotional or rational ? Most of the women wanted just one affair partner and sought at least some emotional connection , Anderson said . \" They needed a bit of a relationship to have an affair , whereas men are more willing to go off and just have sex with whoever , \" Anderson said . It 's possible that women need more emotional connection to enjoy sex , or that they are simply being rational , so they choose to have a single , more involved , affair , he said . \" If you 're off having multiple affairs with multiple people , your chances of getting caught go up , \" Anderson said .

He said : \u201c As one party spokesman after another resigns , I am reminded of the nightmare Jeremy Corbyn faced in 2016 when 21 members of his shadow cabinet resigned . \u201c Corbyn was written off by the Press , but the rank and file membership saved him . \u201c If Bolton has the courage and the vision to introduce a new constitution , and shows that he can be a strong spokesman for Britain leaving the single market , taking back its fisheries and restoring pride in the UK , he may well surprise all of his critics too . \u201d He added : \u201c Whatever speculation there is about new political parties being formed and led by me , the fact is UKIP has the recognition as the party that wants a clean Brexit and dares to talk about immigration .

By tonight 16 of the party 's 24 - strong team of party spokesmen and women had quit their roles in protest at Mr Bolton 's refusal to resign , including eight who quit between dawn and 5.30 pm yesterday .

I repeat I shall not be resigning as Party leader . \u201d \" If , by a number of people resigning and showing that they no longer wish to work for him , that helps him make that decision , then fine . \" Meanwhile , William Dartmouth also quit as Ukip 's trade and industry spokesman and claimed Mr Bolton 's position was \u201c untenable \u201d . Tim Aker , announced he was resigning as the party 's local government spokesman , while David Kurten stepped down from his role as education spokesman . Peter Whittle , the party 's spokesman for London , has also quit along with David Meacock , the culture and arts spokesman , and David Sprason , the work and pensions spokesman . Mr Bolton 's fate now lies in the hands of the Ukip party membership with an emergency general meeting due to take place within the next month . Mr Bolton added : \u201c During the next four weeks I shall be calling for the coordination and mobilisation of all Leave campaigns , to ensure that the government delivers full independence from the European Union in all areas of government and administration and I shall be calling for the Party itself to mobilise to support this agenda . \u201c This is the most pressing matter facing our country and I am determined not to allow the NEC to distract the Party away from participating forcefully in the Independence debate . \u201d Mr Bolton said the NEC was \u201c unfit for purpose \u201d and that the ruling committee had \" lost the confidence \" of not only him but also much of the party 's rank and file . He said that it was \u201c time to put an end to the factional in - fighting within the Party and to remove those who have been a part of that \u201d . Only Ukip members who attend the meeting can vote in the leadership contest . One Ukip source said : \u201c It is a question of who can be a **** [ to turn up ] . \u201d Mr Bolton 's leadership of Ukip has unravelled in spectacular fashion since his relationship with Jo Marney , a 25 - year - old model , emerged . Mr Bolton , 54 , left his wife Tatiana , 42 , for Ms Marney just after Christmas but he faced a volley of calls to resign after Ms Marney was revealed to have made highly offensive comments about Meghan Markle , Prince Harry 's fianc\u00e9e , and black people .

Mr Bolton added : \u201c During the next four weeks I shall be calling for the coordination and mobilisation of all Leave campaigns , to ensure that the government delivers full independence from the European Union in all areas of government and administration and I shall be calling for the Party itself to mobilise to support this agenda . \u201c This is the most pressing matter facing our country and I am determined not to allow the NEC to distract the Party away from participating forcefully in the Independence debate . \u201d Mr Bolton said the NEC was \u201c unfit for purpose \u201d and that the ruling committee had \" lost the confidence \" of not only him but also much of the party 's rank and file . He said that it was \u201c time to put an end to the factional in - fighting within the Party and to remove those who have been a part of that \u201d . Only Ukip members who attend the meeting can vote in the leadership contest . One Ukip source said : \u201c It is a question of who can be a **** [ to turn up ] . \u201d Mr Bolton 's leadership of Ukip has unravelled in spectacular fashion since his relationship with Jo Marney , a 25 - year - old model , emerged . Mr Bolton , 54 , left his wife Tatiana , 42 , for Ms Marney just after Christmas but he faced a volley of calls to resign after Ms Marney was revealed to have made highly offensive comments about Meghan Markle , Prince Harry 's fianc\u00e9e , and black people . Following the outcry , Mr Bolton said their \" romantic \" relationship was over .

This brief introduction discusses the reasons for conducting the study . Subsequent sections of the report are devoted to descriptions of the countermeasure programs , the results of the programs , and the implications of study results . BACKGROUND The words , \u201c aggressive driving , \u201d emerged during the 1990s as a label for a category of dangerous on - the- road behaviors . The category comprises following too closely , driving at excessive speeds , weaving through traffic , and running stop lights and signs , among other acts . Aggressive driving occasionally escalates to gesturing in anger or yelling at another motorist , confrontation , physical assault , and even murder ; \u201c Road Rage \u201d is the label that emerged to describe the angry and violent behaviors at the extreme of the aggressive driving continuum . NHTSA defines aggressive driving as , \u201c The operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property . \u201d An important distinction is that aggressive driving is a traffic violation , while road rage , aside from the yelling and gesticulating , is a criminal offense . People have reported the occasional on - the- road behavior that we now describe as aggressive driving since the advent of motorized transport , and quite possibly , since the beginning of vehicular travel . Anyone who has spent more than a few hours in an automobile has experienced the rudeness of other drivers . Until the final decade of the Twentieth Century , most motorists were comforted by knowing that aggressive driving behavior was infrequent and atypical , and that extreme , confrontational acts were quite rare . However , beginning in the 1990s , an unrelenting series of news reports captured the public 's attention and elevated to a national problem what previously had been considered to be , simply , rude and occasionally bizarre human behavior . 1 The shocking reports of road rage incidents appeared to many observers to coincide with a noticeable increase in aggressive driving , in general , and a sharp decline in civility and respect for other motorists and traffic laws . The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety studied more than 10,000 reported cases of road rage and found a 51 percent increase in serious incidents between 1990 and 1996 ( Mizell , 1997 ) . A national survey found that 60 percent of motorists believe that unsafe driving by others is a major personal threat to them and their families ; 75 percent of the respondents consider it to be \u201c very important \u201d to do something about unsafe driving ( NHTSA , 1999 ) . It is reasonable to question the claims of dramatic increases in aggressive driving and road rage . For example , Mizell 's estimate of a 51 percent increase in extreme cases was based on news reports , but the amount of reporting on a topic in a particular year is influenced by journalists ' interest in an issue , not necessarily the actual incidence of the phenomenon in question . Even accepting Mizell 's estimate of 10,000 cases of road rage during the first six years of the 1990s , the incidence is really quite low compared to the numbers of injuries and fatalities that occur on our nation 's roads and highways . During the same six year period studied by Mizell , more than 22.7 million people were injured in motor vehicle crashes in the U.S. , and more than 290,000 people were killed ( FARS , 2000 ) . That is , the number of cases of road rage was only .04 percent of the total number of people injured or killed in traffic ( i.e. , four one - hundredths of a percent ) , or one case of road rage for every 2,300 injuries and fatalities . The relative size of the road rage problem is further revealed by comparisons to subsets of traffic crash data . For example , 33,521 pedestrians and 4,782 bicyclists were killed , and 531,000 pedestrians and 385,000 bicyclists were injured during the six year period in which Mizell counted 10,000 cases of road rage with various outcomes ( FARS , 2000 ) . The crash data suggest that road rage is a relatively small traffic safety problem , despite the volume of news accounts and the general salience of the issue . It is important to consider the issues objectively because programmatic and enforcement efforts designed to reduce the incidence of road rage might detract attention and divert resources from other , objectively more serious traffic safety problems . Although cases of road rage are relatively rare , the incidence of aggressive driving is much more frequent and a measurable contributing factor to traffic crashes . The perceived increase in aggressive driving is largely explained by demographic changes . In particular , the population of the United States increased by nearly 100 million people between 1960 and the year 2000 , and by 35 percent since 1970 , the year that NHTSA was created with the mission of improving traffic safety . Traffic safety has improved significantly , with fatality rates declining from 5.5 per million miles traveled during the mid-1960s to 1.5 fatalities per million miles traveled in the year 2000 . Figure 1 illustrates the change in fatality rate since 1966 ( FARS , 2000 ) . The numbers presented in Table 1 show that the final decade of the Twentieth Century was a period of rapid population growth , with even greater increases in individual mobility and improvements in the ultimate measure of traffic safety . The table shows that the population of the U.S. increased by 22 million people between 1991 and the year 2000 , an increase of nine percent . However , the number of licensed drivers increased by 21 million during the same period ( an increase of 13 percent ) , and there were 30 million additional vehicles ( an increase of 16 percent ) and nearly 600 billion additional miles traveled in the year 2000 than in 1991 ( an increase of 27 percent ) . That is , the number of miles traveled in a year increased at a rate that is three times the rate of population growth . The table also shows that despite the 27 percent increase in miles traveled between 1991 and the year 2000 , a driver was 21 percent less likely to die in a motor vehicle crash at the end of the decade than at the beginning . In other words , it is safer to drive on our nations roads and highways now than ever before , despite the increases in population , miles traveled , and aggressive driving . How is this possible ? d Figure 1 . Fatality rates per 100 million miles traveled in the U.S. TABLE 1 CHANGES IN POPULATION , FATALITY RATE , AND THE NUMBERS OF DRIVERS , VEHICLES , AND MILES TRAVELED IN THE UNITED STATES , BETWEEN 1991 AND THE YEAR 2000 | | 252.1 | | 169.0 | | 186.4 | | 2,172 | | 1.9 | | 274.6 | | 190.6 | | 217.0 | | 2,750 | | 1.5 | | +9 % | | + 13 % | | + 16 % | | + 27 % | | - 21 % | Sources : FARS 2000 , US Census | Improved safety features of vehicles and highways , and a general aging of the population , have contributed incrementally to the steady decline in the traffic fatality rate . However , since 1980 , the greatest contributions to the improved conditions have come from law enforcement efforts , in particular , a focus on detecting and removing impaired drivers from the road and the development of general deterrence and effective public information and education ( PI&E ) programs . Largely in response to the enforcement and programmatic efforts , the proportion of all crashes in which alcohol was involved declined by 25 percent during the 1990s ; there were 3,200 fewer alcohol - related traffic fatalities in the year 2000 than in 1991 , even though the numbers of drivers , vehicles , and miles traveled all increased substantially . Law enforcement and traffic safety experts believe that some of the methods that helped reduce the incidence of alcohol - involved crashes also might be useful for reducing the number of crashes caused by aggressive driving . CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO AGGRESSIVE DRIVING A definitive explanation for aggressive driving is beyond the scope of the current study . However , a brief discussion of contributing factors might be useful to understanding study results . Experts have suggested many reasons for the apparent increases in aggressive driving and road rage . Sociologists point to the fragmentation of society and the disintegration of shared values and sense of community as the cause of these and other acts of incivility . Many psychologists blame the intoxicating combination of power and anonymity provided by motor vehicles . Traffic engineers tend to ignore the human component , recognizing that crashes can occur when a vehicle that is traveling at the design speed of a roadway encounters a slower moving vehicle . The engineering solution is to encourage all drivers to travel at uniformly fast speeds to avoid the potentially dangerous encounters , but this approach disregards different perceptions of conditions and differences in motorists ' destinations , intentions , and capabilities . Many law enforcement officers have learned from their operations - level experiences with dangerous drivers that several factors can contribute to a single example of aggressive driving . Further , it is important to understand that not all instances of the behaviors that are categorized as aggressive driving are volitional . For example , errors in judging turning headway can result in right of way violations , and driver inattention can result in failures to obey traffic signals and signs . Also , driving in excess of a speed limit does not always endanger persons or property , nor does it necessarily involve an aggressive intent . That is , an unknown portion of all such driving acts is caused by human error , rather than conscious decisions to take risks and drive aggressively . Figure 2 illustrates the most salient factors , excluding human error , that are believed to contribute to the apparent increase in the incidence of aggressive driving behavior . The factors are summarized in the following paragraphs . d Figure 2 . Salient factors that contribute to the incidence aggressive driving . TRAFFIC DELAYS Traffic congestion is one of the most frequently mentioned contributing factors to aggressive driving . On - the- road delays , whether caused by highway maintenance , a collision , or high traffic volumes , are frustrating for all drivers , but intolerably so for some . Drivers with low tolerances for traffic delays might respond by following too closely , changing lanes frequently , or becoming angry at anyone who impedes their progress . A 1998 survey found that 33 percent of drivers reported that they become impatient while waiting at stoplights and for parking spaces ; 25 percent reported impatience while waiting for passengers to enter their vehicle ; and , 22 percent said that they feel anger when a multi-lane highway narrows ( Ferguson , 1998 ) . The survey results concerning driver impatience and anger are particularly revealing when considered in the context provided by Table 1 , and one additional statistic . That is , while the number of miles traveled increased by 27 percent during the 1990s , the number of miles of roadway in the United States increased by only one percent . Together , these measures confirm and quantify most drivers ' subjective perceptions ; traffic congestion has , indeed , increased . RUNNING LATE Some people drive aggressively because they have too much to do and are \u201c running late \u201d for work , school , their next meeting , lesson , soccer game , or other appointment . There does , indeed , appear to be more to do with each passing year . It is reported that the average mother now spends more than an hour making five trips and driving 29 miles during a typical day . Many of the stops are to drop off or pick up children or elderly parents who cannot drive themselves ( STPP , 2002 ) . The endless series of errands and obligations of modern life weighs more heavily and / or more frequently on some individuals than on others , and can contribute to a pattern of aggressive driving . The effects of busy schedules on driving were evident when several police departments in the Washington , DC , area conducted a special enforcement program that targeted aggressive drivers . Officers issued approximately 60,000 citations during a 28 day period in 1997 for offenses ranging from following too closely to passing on the right . The most frequent excuse offered by the violators was , \u201c I 'm late \u201d ( Ferguson , 1998 ) . ANONYMITY Driving involves a unique combination of public and private behavior . A motor vehicle insulates the driver from the world while , at the same time , traveling through it . Shielded from the hostile outside environment by tinted windows and a micro-climate that defies the seasons , a driver can develop a sense of anonymity and detachment , as if an observer of the surroundings , rather than a participant . The anonymity provided by this insulation can erode the inhibitions to antisocial behavior that normally shape interpersonal relations . That is , some people feel less constrained in their behavior when they cannot be seen by others and / or when it is unlikely that they will ever again see the witnesses to their behavior . When emboldened by the seemingly invincible power of a motor vehicle , a driver 's feeling of anonymity can result in extreme rudeness and even transform an otherwise nice person into a dangerous , raging individual . 2 Ellison et al. ( 1995 ) tested the hypothesis that vehicle - induced anonymity contributes to aggressive behavior , wisely limiting the dependent variables to measures of relatively harmless horn honking . Convertibles and jeep-like vehicles were delayed at controlled intersections by an automobile , operated by a confederate of the experimenters , that failed to proceed when the light changed to green . The confederate recorded whether the top on the delayed convertible ( immediately behind the confederate 's vehicle ) was up ( the anonymous condition ) or down ( the exposed or identifiable condition ) . Several additional variables were recorded , including the gender and age of the driver , the number of passengers , and the type of vehicle . The confederate also recorded the time interval between the change to the green light and the first sounding of the convertible 's horn , the number of honks , and the duration of the honking . As predicted , the experimenters found that drivers in the anonymous condition ( convertible tops up ) honked significantly sooner , more frequently , and for longer durations than the drivers in the exposed condition ( tops down ) . Gulledge ( 1996 ) modified the research design by using a convertible as the impeding vehicle at intersections , with the convertible 's top up for half of the trials and the top down for the other half . Only the time interval between the light change and the first honk by the delayed driver ( any passenger vehicle located immediately behind the experimenter 's convertible ) was recorded . Analysis of the data found significantly longer intervals between the light change and the first use of the horn when the top on the delaying convertible was down , exposing the experimenter and driver to view . The results of this study suggest that greater visibility of the intended target also inhibits horn honking , and that mutual anonymity is a factor in at least some aggressive driving behaviors . DISREGARD FOR OTHERS AND DISREGARD FOR THE LAW Human behavior is clearly shaped by the external forces collectively known as Culture . The external source of the influence and degree to which norms can change are illustrated by the music , clothing , or salutation that seemed so \u201c stylish \u201d or appropriate in 1970 , and so odd or inappropriate now . All forms of human behavior , including driving style , are similarly influenced by external forces that define what is appropriate and what is not , and the definitions change over time . Feature films and television programming can be extremely influential in defining current style and appropriate or desirable behavior . The extent of media influence on popular culture and behavior is not fully understood . In particular , it is unknown if depictions of car chases influence motorists to drive aggressively by gradually altering individual conceptions of acceptability , or more immediately , by providing vivid images of aggressive behavior for motorists to model .

However , chronic anger , habitual or persistent aggressive driving , and especially a pattern of confrontation on the road , must be considered manifestations of pathology , in addition to violations of the law . 4 The less extreme forms of aggressive driving are better understood , but are we really experiencing increases in road rage and aggressive driving ? The answer is \u201c yes , \u201d and for the same reason that traffic congestion has increased , as described previously in the Introduction to this report and summarized in Table 1 . That is , even if the proportions of predisposed and provoked drivers have remained unchanged during the past decade , 26 percent increases in both road rage and aggressive driving should be expected from the increase in miles traveled during that period ( i.e. , a 27 percent increase in miles traveled minus a one percent increase in new roadway ) ; rate and incidence of the phenomena are separate measures . If it seems that there are more cases of rude and outrageous behavior on the road now than in the past , the observation is correct , if for no other reason than there are more drivers driving more miles on the same roads than ever before . SUMMARY OF CONTRIBUTING FACTORS The preceding discussion addressed only the most salient of the many factors that might contribute to the incidence of road rage and aggressive driving .

This brief introduction discusses the reasons for conducting the study . Subsequent sections of the report are devoted to descriptions of the countermeasure programs , the results of the programs , and the implications of study results . BACKGROUND The words , \u201c aggressive driving , \u201d emerged during the 1990s as a label for a category of dangerous on - the- road behaviors . The category comprises following too closely , driving at excessive speeds , weaving through traffic , and running stop lights and signs , among other acts . Aggressive driving occasionally escalates to gesturing in anger or yelling at another motorist , confrontation , physical assault , and even murder ; \u201c Road Rage \u201d is the label that emerged to describe the angry and violent behaviors at the extreme of the aggressive driving continuum . NHTSA defines aggressive driving as , \u201c The operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property . \u201d An important distinction is that aggressive driving is a traffic violation , while road rage , aside from the yelling and gesticulating , is a criminal offense . People have reported the occasional on - the- road behavior that we now describe as aggressive driving since the advent of motorized transport , and quite possibly , since the beginning of vehicular travel . Anyone who has spent more than a few hours in an automobile has experienced the rudeness of other drivers . Until the final decade of the Twentieth Century , most motorists were comforted by knowing that aggressive driving behavior was infrequent and atypical , and that extreme , confrontational acts were quite rare . However , beginning in the 1990s , an unrelenting series of news reports captured the public 's attention and elevated to a national problem what previously had been considered to be , simply , rude and occasionally bizarre human behavior . 1 The shocking reports of road rage incidents appeared to many observers to coincide with a noticeable increase in aggressive driving , in general , and a sharp decline in civility and respect for other motorists and traffic laws . The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety studied more than 10,000 reported cases of road rage and found a 51 percent increase in serious incidents between 1990 and 1996 ( Mizell , 1997 ) . A national survey found that 60 percent of motorists believe that unsafe driving by others is a major personal threat to them and their families ; 75 percent of the respondents consider it to be \u201c very important \u201d to do something about unsafe driving ( NHTSA , 1999 ) . It is reasonable to question the claims of dramatic increases in aggressive driving and road rage . For example , Mizell 's estimate of a 51 percent increase in extreme cases was based on news reports , but the amount of reporting on a topic in a particular year is influenced by journalists ' interest in an issue , not necessarily the actual incidence of the phenomenon in question . Even accepting Mizell 's estimate of 10,000 cases of road rage during the first six years of the 1990s , the incidence is really quite low compared to the numbers of injuries and fatalities that occur on our nation 's roads and highways . During the same six year period studied by Mizell , more than 22.7 million people were injured in motor vehicle crashes in the U.S. , and more than 290,000 people were killed ( FARS , 2000 ) . That is , the number of cases of road rage was only .04 percent of the total number of people injured or killed in traffic ( i.e. , four one - hundredths of a percent ) , or one case of road rage for every 2,300 injuries and fatalities . The relative size of the road rage problem is further revealed by comparisons to subsets of traffic crash data . For example , 33,521 pedestrians and 4,782 bicyclists were killed , and 531,000 pedestrians and 385,000 bicyclists were injured during the six year period in which Mizell counted 10,000 cases of road rage with various outcomes ( FARS , 2000 ) . The crash data suggest that road rage is a relatively small traffic safety problem , despite the volume of news accounts and the general salience of the issue . It is important to consider the issues objectively because programmatic and enforcement efforts designed to reduce the incidence of road rage might detract attention and divert resources from other , objectively more serious traffic safety problems . Although cases of road rage are relatively rare , the incidence of aggressive driving is much more frequent and a measurable contributing factor to traffic crashes . The perceived increase in aggressive driving is largely explained by demographic changes . In particular , the population of the United States increased by nearly 100 million people between 1960 and the year 2000 , and by 35 percent since 1970 , the year that NHTSA was created with the mission of improving traffic safety . Traffic safety has improved significantly , with fatality rates declining from 5.5 per million miles traveled during the mid-1960s to 1.5 fatalities per million miles traveled in the year 2000 . Figure 1 illustrates the change in fatality rate since 1966 ( FARS , 2000 ) . The numbers presented in Table 1 show that the final decade of the Twentieth Century was a period of rapid population growth , with even greater increases in individual mobility and improvements in the ultimate measure of traffic safety . The table shows that the population of the U.S. increased by 22 million people between 1991 and the year 2000 , an increase of nine percent . However , the number of licensed drivers increased by 21 million during the same period ( an increase of 13 percent ) , and there were 30 million additional vehicles ( an increase of 16 percent ) and nearly 600 billion additional miles traveled in the year 2000 than in 1991 ( an increase of 27 percent ) . That is , the number of miles traveled in a year increased at a rate that is three times the rate of population growth . The table also shows that despite the 27 percent increase in miles traveled between 1991 and the year 2000 , a driver was 21 percent less likely to die in a motor vehicle crash at the end of the decade than at the beginning . In other words , it is safer to drive on our nations roads and highways now than ever before , despite the increases in population , miles traveled , and aggressive driving . How is this possible ? d Figure 1 . Fatality rates per 100 million miles traveled in the U.S. TABLE 1 CHANGES IN POPULATION , FATALITY RATE , AND THE NUMBERS OF DRIVERS , VEHICLES , AND MILES TRAVELED IN THE UNITED STATES , BETWEEN 1991 AND THE YEAR 2000 | | 252.1 | | 169.0 | | 186.4 | | 2,172 | | 1.9 | | 274.6 | | 190.6 | | 217.0 | | 2,750 | | 1.5 | | +9 % | | + 13 % | | + 16 % | | + 27 % | | - 21 % | Sources : FARS 2000 , US Census | Improved safety features of vehicles and highways , and a general aging of the population , have contributed incrementally to the steady decline in the traffic fatality rate . However , since 1980 , the greatest contributions to the improved conditions have come from law enforcement efforts , in particular , a focus on detecting and removing impaired drivers from the road and the development of general deterrence and effective public information and education ( PI&E ) programs . Largely in response to the enforcement and programmatic efforts , the proportion of all crashes in which alcohol was involved declined by 25 percent during the 1990s ; there were 3,200 fewer alcohol - related traffic fatalities in the year 2000 than in 1991 , even though the numbers of drivers , vehicles , and miles traveled all increased substantially . Law enforcement and traffic safety experts believe that some of the methods that helped reduce the incidence of alcohol - involved crashes also might be useful for reducing the number of crashes caused by aggressive driving . CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO AGGRESSIVE DRIVING A definitive explanation for aggressive driving is beyond the scope of the current study . However , a brief discussion of contributing factors might be useful to understanding study results . Experts have suggested many reasons for the apparent increases in aggressive driving and road rage . Sociologists point to the fragmentation of society and the disintegration of shared values and sense of community as the cause of these and other acts of incivility . Many psychologists blame the intoxicating combination of power and anonymity provided by motor vehicles . Traffic engineers tend to ignore the human component , recognizing that crashes can occur when a vehicle that is traveling at the design speed of a roadway encounters a slower moving vehicle . The engineering solution is to encourage all drivers to travel at uniformly fast speeds to avoid the potentially dangerous encounters , but this approach disregards different perceptions of conditions and differences in motorists ' destinations , intentions , and capabilities . Many law enforcement officers have learned from their operations - level experiences with dangerous drivers that several factors can contribute to a single example of aggressive driving . Further , it is important to understand that not all instances of the behaviors that are categorized as aggressive driving are volitional . For example , errors in judging turning headway can result in right of way violations , and driver inattention can result in failures to obey traffic signals and signs . Also , driving in excess of a speed limit does not always endanger persons or property , nor does it necessarily involve an aggressive intent . That is , an unknown portion of all such driving acts is caused by human error , rather than conscious decisions to take risks and drive aggressively . Figure 2 illustrates the most salient factors , excluding human error , that are believed to contribute to the apparent increase in the incidence of aggressive driving behavior . The factors are summarized in the following paragraphs . d Figure 2 . Salient factors that contribute to the incidence aggressive driving . TRAFFIC DELAYS Traffic congestion is one of the most frequently mentioned contributing factors to aggressive driving . On - the- road delays , whether caused by highway maintenance , a collision , or high traffic volumes , are frustrating for all drivers , but intolerably so for some . Drivers with low tolerances for traffic delays might respond by following too closely , changing lanes frequently , or becoming angry at anyone who impedes their progress . A 1998 survey found that 33 percent of drivers reported that they become impatient while waiting at stoplights and for parking spaces ; 25 percent reported impatience while waiting for passengers to enter their vehicle ; and , 22 percent said that they feel anger when a multi-lane highway narrows ( Ferguson , 1998 ) . The survey results concerning driver impatience and anger are particularly revealing when considered in the context provided by Table 1 , and one additional statistic . That is , while the number of miles traveled increased by 27 percent during the 1990s , the number of miles of roadway in the United States increased by only one percent . Together , these measures confirm and quantify most drivers ' subjective perceptions ; traffic congestion has , indeed , increased . RUNNING LATE Some people drive aggressively because they have too much to do and are \u201c running late \u201d for work , school , their next meeting , lesson , soccer game , or other appointment . There does , indeed , appear to be more to do with each passing year . It is reported that the average mother now spends more than an hour making five trips and driving 29 miles during a typical day . Many of the stops are to drop off or pick up children or elderly parents who cannot drive themselves ( STPP , 2002 ) . The endless series of errands and obligations of modern life weighs more heavily and / or more frequently on some individuals than on others , and can contribute to a pattern of aggressive driving . The effects of busy schedules on driving were evident when several police departments in the Washington , DC , area conducted a special enforcement program that targeted aggressive drivers . Officers issued approximately 60,000 citations during a 28 day period in 1997 for offenses ranging from following too closely to passing on the right . The most frequent excuse offered by the violators was , \u201c I 'm late \u201d ( Ferguson , 1998 ) . ANONYMITY Driving involves a unique combination of public and private behavior . A motor vehicle insulates the driver from the world while , at the same time , traveling through it . Shielded from the hostile outside environment by tinted windows and a micro-climate that defies the seasons , a driver can develop a sense of anonymity and detachment , as if an observer of the surroundings , rather than a participant . The anonymity provided by this insulation can erode the inhibitions to antisocial behavior that normally shape interpersonal relations . That is , some people feel less constrained in their behavior when they cannot be seen by others and / or when it is unlikely that they will ever again see the witnesses to their behavior . When emboldened by the seemingly invincible power of a motor vehicle , a driver 's feeling of anonymity can result in extreme rudeness and even transform an otherwise nice person into a dangerous , raging individual . 2 Ellison et al. ( 1995 ) tested the hypothesis that vehicle - induced anonymity contributes to aggressive behavior , wisely limiting the dependent variables to measures of relatively harmless horn honking . Convertibles and jeep-like vehicles were delayed at controlled intersections by an automobile , operated by a confederate of the experimenters , that failed to proceed when the light changed to green . The confederate recorded whether the top on the delayed convertible ( immediately behind the confederate 's vehicle ) was up ( the anonymous condition ) or down ( the exposed or identifiable condition ) . Several additional variables were recorded , including the gender and age of the driver , the number of passengers , and the type of vehicle . The confederate also recorded the time interval between the change to the green light and the first sounding of the convertible 's horn , the number of honks , and the duration of the honking . As predicted , the experimenters found that drivers in the anonymous condition ( convertible tops up ) honked significantly sooner , more frequently , and for longer durations than the drivers in the exposed condition ( tops down ) . Gulledge ( 1996 ) modified the research design by using a convertible as the impeding vehicle at intersections , with the convertible 's top up for half of the trials and the top down for the other half . Only the time interval between the light change and the first honk by the delayed driver ( any passenger vehicle located immediately behind the experimenter 's convertible ) was recorded . Analysis of the data found significantly longer intervals between the light change and the first use of the horn when the top on the delaying convertible was down , exposing the experimenter and driver to view . The results of this study suggest that greater visibility of the intended target also inhibits horn honking , and that mutual anonymity is a factor in at least some aggressive driving behaviors . DISREGARD FOR OTHERS AND DISREGARD FOR THE LAW Human behavior is clearly shaped by the external forces collectively known as Culture . The external source of the influence and degree to which norms can change are illustrated by the music , clothing , or salutation that seemed so \u201c stylish \u201d or appropriate in 1970 , and so odd or inappropriate now . All forms of human behavior , including driving style , are similarly influenced by external forces that define what is appropriate and what is not , and the definitions change over time . Feature films and television programming can be extremely influential in defining current style and appropriate or desirable behavior . The extent of media influence on popular culture and behavior is not fully understood . In particular , it is unknown if depictions of car chases influence motorists to drive aggressively by gradually altering individual conceptions of acceptability , or more immediately , by providing vivid images of aggressive behavior for motorists to model . Children predictably exhibit the aggressive behavior observed previously in a cartoon ; it is likely that some adults and adolescents of driving age are similarly influenced by the driving observed in films and on television . 3 Learning to drive from a parent or friend who is an aggressive driver , or associating with aggressive drivers , also can shape the behavior . In this regard , Parker et al. ( 1998 ) found that drivers who had committed large numbers of aggressive driving violations were more likely to believe that people important to them would approve of the behavior , than drivers with few violations . Much has been written about the erosion of shared values and respect for authority , variously attributed to the fragmentation of the extended family , increased individual mobility , media influence , and other characteristics of modern society . It does appear that civility and respect for authority have diminished , the trend epitomized by the phrase , \u201c I 'm just looking out for number one . \u201d HABITUAL OR CLINICAL BEHAVIOR Most motorists rarely drive aggressively , and some never at all . For others , episodes of aggressive driving are frequent , and for a small proportion of motorists it is their usual driving behavior . Occasional episodes of aggressive driving might occur in response to specific situations , such as speeding and changing lanes abruptly when late for an important appointment , when it is not the driver 's normal behavior . Among the chronic aggressive drivers there are those who learned the driving style and consider it appropriate , and others who may have learned to drive properly , but for whom the behavior is an expression of illness . Clearly , it is a matter of degree and not all anger is uncontrolled , or even inappropriate ; that is , it is not the anger , but what a person does about it that matters ( e.g. , anger that motivates a person to call the police when encountered on the road by an obviously impaired or dangerously aggressive driver ) . However , chronic anger , habitual or persistent aggressive driving , and especially a pattern of confrontation on the road , must be considered manifestations of pathology , in addition to violations of the law . 4 The less extreme forms of aggressive driving are better understood , but are we really experiencing increases in road rage and aggressive driving ? The answer is \u201c yes , \u201d and for the same reason that traffic congestion has increased , as described previously in the Introduction to this report and summarized in Table 1 .

Mike Rogers , Gary Palmer , Martha Roby and Robert Aderholt , voted alongside Rep. Terri Sewell , a Democrat , in the 354 - 60 vote to approve . The bipartisan nature of the resolution comes as northern Syria has devolved into chaos following Trump 's decision to remove U.S. troops , who had provided security for the incarceration of Islamic State fighters held in the area and dissuaded Turkey from attacking the Kurds . U.S. politicians and experts on the area say there 's a real fear over the release of the ISIS prisoners without the presence of U.S. troops there . Turkey began an offensive , which included Syrian rebels , in northern Syria last week to push back Kurdish forces . Russian forces moved in just behind fleeing U.S. troops Tuesday and overtook a former U.S. military outpost near Manbij . Video taken by one of the Russians showed the soldiers walking through the former American outpost , operating electronic vehicle barriers and inspecting the American equipment . The Washington Post reported that Trump said from the Oval Office on Wednesday that the conflict between Turkey and the Kurds was \u201c over land that has nothing to do with us \u201d and that the Kurds were \u201c no angels . \u201d \u201c There 's a lot of sand that they can play with , \u201d Trump said from the Oval Office . In contrast to his words from the White House on Wednesday that seemed to indicate he had no concern for the chaos ensuing in northern Syria , Trump 's letter on Oct. 9 to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned of financial repercussions if Turkey persisted in the attacks . \u201c History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way , \u201d Trump wrote in a letter , first reported by Fox News . \u201c It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things do n't happen . Do n't be a tough guy .

Republican U.S. House Reps. Bradley Byrne of Fairhope and Mo Brooks of Huntsville voted against the resolution , while the remaining four Republicans , Reps . Mike Rogers , Gary Palmer , Martha Roby and Robert Aderholt , voted alongside Rep. Terri Sewell , a Democrat , in the 354 - 60 vote to approve . The bipartisan nature of the resolution comes as northern Syria has devolved into chaos following Trump 's decision to remove U.S. troops , who had provided security for the incarceration of Islamic State fighters held in the area and dissuaded Turkey from attacking the Kurds . U.S. politicians and experts on the area say there 's a real fear over the release of the ISIS prisoners without the presence of U.S. troops there . Turkey began an offensive , which included Syrian rebels , in northern Syria last week to push back Kurdish forces . Russian forces moved in just behind fleeing U.S. troops Tuesday and overtook a former U.S. military outpost near Manbij . Video taken by one of the Russians showed the soldiers walking through the former American outpost , operating electronic vehicle barriers and inspecting the American equipment . The Washington Post reported that Trump said from the Oval Office on Wednesday that the conflict between Turkey and the Kurds was \u201c over land that has nothing to do with us \u201d and that the Kurds were \u201c no angels . \u201d \u201c There 's a lot of sand that they can play with , \u201d Trump said from the Oval Office . In contrast to his words from the White House on Wednesday that seemed to indicate he had no concern for the chaos ensuing in northern Syria , Trump 's letter on Oct. 9 to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned of financial repercussions if Turkey persisted in the attacks . \u201c History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way , \u201d Trump wrote in a letter , first reported by Fox News . \u201c It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things do n't happen .

In this sometimes - scattershot but often hilarious collection , McGowan ( Rook , 2017 , etc. ) recounts the details of his life as a husband , father , and North London writer . Organized as a series of titled journal entries , the narrative explores the strangeness and banality of everyday life and , in particular , its often laughable embarrassments . In \u201c I Love You , \u201d the author describes the unusual events that led him to accidentally put a banana on which he 'd written \u201c I love you \u201d in front of a man sitting near him at the British Library . His eye ever on the bizarre , McGowan also tells the story of encountering his double in a dwarf who \u201c propelled himself with crutches along the pavement , at high speed \u201d and seemed to exist to offer the author a \u201c cryptic message \u201d he never actually delivered . In reflecting on his career as a writer , he recalls an interview he did with Anthony Burgess that \u201c went like a drea m \u201d but ended in disaster when he later realized he had failed to turn on his tape recorder . McGowan 's family life is a rich source of material for his entries . Whether he is recounting his neighborhood adventures with Monty , a \u201c dog blessed more with irascibility than intelligence , \u201d musing at how he ever could have ended up with as sensible , successful , and beautiful a wife as his \u201c Mrs. McG , \u201d or wondering at the softness of his M&S woolen socks and whether they make him too \u201c content with the state of the world , \u201d McGowan always brings a quirky and refreshing perspective . Though the meandering plotlessness becomes irksome , the author 's delight in unearthing the overlooked pain points of everyday life and laughing at them makes up for the fractured , willy - nilly nature of the narrative . The authors have created a sort of anti-Book of Virtues in this encyclopedic compendium of the ways and means of power . Everyone wants power and everyone is in a constant duplicitous game to gain more power at the expense of others , according to Greene , a screenwriter and former editor at Esquire ( Elffers , a book packager , designed the volume , with its attractive marginalia ) . We live today as courtiers once did in royal courts : we must appear civil while attempting to crush all those around us . This power game can be played well or poorly , and in these 48 laws culled from the history and wisdom of the world 's greatest power players are the rules that must be followed to win . These laws boil down to being as ruthless , selfish , manipulative , and deceitful as possible . Each law , however , gets its own chapter : \u201c Conceal Your Intentions , \u201d \u201c Always Say Less Than Necessary , \u201d \u201c Pose as a Friend , Work as a Spy , \u201d and so on . Each chapter is conveniently broken down into sections on what happened to those who transgressed or observed the particular law , the key elements in this law , and ways to defensively reverse this law when it 's used against you . Quotations in the margins amplify the lesson being taught . While compelling in the way an auto accident might be , the book is simply nonsense . Rules often contradict each other . We are told , for instance , to \u201c be conspicuous at all cost , \u201d then told to \u201c behave like others . \u201d More seriously , Greene never really defines \u201c power , \u201d and he merely asserts , rather than offers evidence for , the Hobbesian world of all against all in which he insists we live . The world may be like this at times , but often it is n't . To ask why this is so would be a far more useful project . If the authors are serious , this is a silly , distasteful book . If they are not , it 's a brilliant satire . The former first lady opens up about her early life , her journey to the White House , and the eight history - making years that followed . It 's not surprising that Obama grew up a rambunctious kid with a stubborn streak and an \u201c I'll show you \u201d attitude . After all , it takes a special kind of moxie to survive being the first African - American FLOTUS \u2014 and not only survive , but thrive . For eight years , we witnessed the adversity the first family had to face , and now we get to read what it was really like growing up in a working - class family on Chicago 's South Side and ending up at the world 's most famous address . As the author amply shows , her can- do attitude was daunted at times by racism , leaving her wondering if she was good enough . Nevertheless , she persisted , graduating from Chicago 's first magnet high school , Princeton , and Harvard Law School , and pursuing careers in law and the nonprofit world . With her characteristic candor and dry wit , she recounts the story of her fateful meeting with her future husband . Once they were officially a couple , her feelings for him turned into a \u201c toppling blast of lust , gratitude , fulfillment , wonder . \u201d But for someone with a \u201c natural resistance to chaos , \u201d being the wife of an ambitious politician was no small feat , and becoming a mother along the way added another layer of complexity . Throw a presidential campaign into the mix , and even the most assured woman could begin to crack under the pressure . Later , adjusting to life in the White House was a formidable challenge for the self - described \u201c control freak \u201d \u2014 not to mention the difficulty of sparing their daughters the ugly side of politics and preserving their privacy as much as possible . Through it all , Obama remained determined to serve with grace and help others through initiatives like the White House garden and her campaign to fight childhood obesity .

In this sometimes - scattershot but often hilarious collection , McGowan ( Rook , 2017 , etc. ) recounts the details of his life as a husband , father , and North London writer . Organized as a series of titled journal entries , the narrative explores the strangeness and banality of everyday life and , in particular , its often laughable embarrassments . In \u201c I Love You , \u201d the author describes the unusual events that led him to accidentally put a banana on which he 'd written \u201c I love you \u201d in front of a man sitting near him at the British Library . His eye ever on the bizarre , McGowan also tells the story of encountering his double in a dwarf who \u201c propelled himself with crutches along the pavement , at high speed \u201d and seemed to exist to offer the author a \u201c cryptic message \u201d he never actually delivered . In reflecting on his career as a writer , he recalls an interview he did with Anthony Burgess that \u201c went like a drea m \u201d but ended in disaster when he later realized he had failed to turn on his tape recorder . McGowan 's family life is a rich source of material for his entries . Whether he is recounting his neighborhood adventures with Monty , a \u201c dog blessed more with irascibility than intelligence , \u201d musing at how he ever could have ended up with as sensible , successful , and beautiful a wife as his \u201c Mrs. McG , \u201d or wondering at the softness of his M&S woolen socks and whether they make him too \u201c content with the state of the world , \u201d McGowan always brings a quirky and refreshing perspective . Though the meandering plotlessness becomes irksome , the author 's delight in unearthing the overlooked pain points of everyday life and laughing at them makes up for the fractured , willy - nilly nature of the narrative . The authors have created a sort of anti-Book of Virtues in this encyclopedic compendium of the ways and means of power . Everyone wants power and everyone is in a constant duplicitous game to gain more power at the expense of others , according to Greene , a screenwriter and former editor at Esquire ( Elffers , a book packager , designed the volume , with its attractive marginalia ) . We live today as courtiers once did in royal courts : we must appear civil while attempting to crush all those around us . This power game can be played well or poorly , and in these 48 laws culled from the history and wisdom of the world 's greatest power players are the rules that must be followed to win . These laws boil down to being as ruthless , selfish , manipulative , and deceitful as possible . Each law , however , gets its own chapter : \u201c Conceal Your Intentions , \u201d \u201c Always Say Less Than Necessary , \u201d \u201c Pose as a Friend , Work as a Spy , \u201d and so on . Each chapter is conveniently broken down into sections on what happened to those who transgressed or observed the particular law , the key elements in this law , and ways to defensively reverse this law when it 's used against you . Quotations in the margins amplify the lesson being taught . While compelling in the way an auto accident might be , the book is simply nonsense . Rules often contradict each other . We are told , for instance , to \u201c be conspicuous at all cost , \u201d then told to \u201c behave like others . \u201d More seriously , Greene never really defines \u201c power , \u201d and he merely asserts , rather than offers evidence for , the Hobbesian world of all against all in which he insists we live . The world may be like this at times , but often it is n't . To ask why this is so would be a far more useful project . If the authors are serious , this is a silly , distasteful book . If they are not , it 's a brilliant satire . The former first lady opens up about her early life , her journey to the White House , and the eight history - making years that followed . It 's not surprising that Obama grew up a rambunctious kid with a stubborn streak and an \u201c I'll show you \u201d attitude . After all , it takes a special kind of moxie to survive being the first African - American FLOTUS \u2014 and not only survive , but thrive . For eight years , we witnessed the adversity the first family had to face , and now we get to read what it was really like growing up in a working - class family on Chicago 's South Side and ending up at the world 's most famous address . As the author amply shows , her can- do attitude was daunted at times by racism , leaving her wondering if she was good enough . Nevertheless , she persisted , graduating from Chicago 's first magnet high school , Princeton , and Harvard Law School , and pursuing careers in law and the nonprofit world . With her characteristic candor and dry wit , she recounts the story of her fateful meeting with her future husband . Once they were officially a couple , her feelings for him turned into a \u201c toppling blast of lust , gratitude , fulfillment , wonder . \u201d But for someone with a \u201c natural resistance to chaos , \u201d being the wife of an ambitious politician was no small feat , and becoming a mother along the way added another layer of complexity . Throw a presidential campaign into the mix , and even the most assured woman could begin to crack under the pressure . Later , adjusting to life in the White House was a formidable challenge for the self - described \u201c control freak \u201d \u2014 not to mention the difficulty of sparing their daughters the ugly side of politics and preserving their privacy as much as possible . Through it all , Obama remained determined to serve with grace and help others through initiatives like the White House garden and her campaign to fight childhood obesity . And even though she deems herself \u201c not a political person , \u201d she shares frank thoughts about the 2016 election . An engrossing memoir as well as a lively treatise on what extraordinary grace under extraordinary pressure looks like .","annotations":[{"text":"to accidentally put a banana on which he 'd written

Before we get started , let 's review the basic definitions of the two terms : Seed Round : Refers to a series of related investments in which 15 or less investors \" seed \" a new company with anywhere from $ 50,000 to $ 2 million . This money is often used to support initial market research and early product development . Investors are typically rewarded with convertible notes , equity , or a preferred stock option in exchange for their investment . Series A: Refers to a smaller number of angel investors or VCs who contribute an average of $ 2 - 10 million in exchange for equity . The fund is named after the type of equity investors hope to eventually receive : Series A Preferred shares . This implies they will be the first group of investors to receive preferred shares . Now that we have reviewed the terms , let 's take a deeper dive into the differences : Raising a Seed Round A great analogy for understanding the functionality of a Seed Round is that of planting a tree . Trees do n't grow overnight ; they start out as small seedlings that form strong roots , laying the foundation for the majestic masterpieces that eventually grow . Similarly , Seed Rounds are meant to supply startups with the capital they need to build the kind of foundation that yields a profitable business . Seed Round funding is typically used for things like hiring instrumental team members , market testing ideas , and further developing MVPs . Once a startup has raised a Seed Round they can use that capital to iron out the kinks of business models and product - market fits . Arguably , the most important opportunity given to founders during the Seed Round is the freedom to fill in their \" knowledge gaps \" with key players . No founder is expected to know everything , and having access to experienced investors who can troubleshoot is almost as important as the cash itself . Unfortunately , once a startup jumps to Series A , the ownership requirements of much larger funds leave less negotiating room to bring on knowledgeable investors whose expertise might be needed later on . Thus , most tech startups would do well to take their time forming the right Seed Round partnerships , before moving on to Series A. Key Benefits of Raising a Seed Round : More time to fine - tune your business model . More time to connect with instrumental business partners . Supports lower dilution and more capital for future rounds . More flexibility to pivot and change course , according to market demand . If a Seed Round signifies planting the tree ( and rooting the company with a strong foundation ) , a Series A signifies sprouting branches ... Raising a Series A Once a VC , or group of VCs , has poured significant funds into your startup to form a Series A , you are expected to grow FAST . Thus , the primary question to ask oneself before pursuing a Series A is essentially : Do we have both product - market fit and proven systems that will allow us to easily multiply our revenue within the next 18 months ? Though not typical , it is not unheard of for startup founders to completely skip the Seed Round and go straight to Series A . In such instances , a prominent VC has usually extended an offer before the startup expected to receive one . Considering the significant jump in capital , saying no to such an offer can be challenging . Why would anyone ever say ' no ' to more capital ? Surprisingly , there are many reasons whymostearly - stage founders are better off taking a Seed Round . Seed rounds allow you to put some wins on the board for your company , and then run a process to really maximize your Series A round and the firm and person that you would want to work with . When jumping ' straight to A , ' entrepreneurs usually do need to sell a large chunk of their company to make it worth the while of a large VC to write a big check . According to Go , the dilution in such instances is typically greater than the often advised 20 percent ! That means the capital raised will have to last the founder through the next two value accretive inflection points so they can justify raising more cash during subsequent rounds . With that said , there are some instances where skipping the Seed Round in favor of Series A makes sense . For example , say your startup genuinely needs significant amounts of cash to prove its business model . It 's not uncommon for enterprise projects to require more product development than the $ 1 to 2 million a Seed Round can provide . Otherwise , as Matt Turck , VC at FirstMarksuggests : Straight -to- Asare often serial entrepreneurs who either already have experienced a large exit with a previous company , or already have proven significant success in the industry of their current project . Key Benefits of Raising a Series A : Ability to scale faster with larger partners and more cash . Increased notoriety , prestige , and name recognition within the community . The bottom line : The pressure to perfect product - market fit and build a scalable marketing blueprint that comes along with a Series A is too intense for most early - stage startups . Fail to deliver on both fronts and an otherwise promising startup might be closing its doors all too soon . Seed Round vs Series A : Which Should You Raise ? Pursuing a Seed Round before a Series A is the best option formoststartups . Jump \u201c Straight to A , \" and you will most likely have tosell a larger equity portionin exchange for that larger check . As previously discussed , more funding translates to increased pressure to scale and less time to fine - tune the kind of factors that ultimately make or break companies ( i.e. Product - to - Market Fit , Customer Acquisition Rates , Customer Lifetime Value ) . In exchange for the $ 2 to $ 10 million provided by your Series A , you should already have optimized your distribution , determined a working business model , and assembled the key players your team needs for success . Do n't yet have these things in place ? You are probably better off raising a smaller amount of cash in a Seed Round . Regardless of what you decide , your ultimate success will depend just as much on cash flow management as anything else . Raise too much capital , and you 're parting with precious equity you may need to negotiate with later on . Raise too little , and you risk feeling frustrated by an inability to hire top talent , a loss of momentum and a slower path to growth . We 've gathered insights from both founders of successfully funded startups and VCs , to create a list of tips and best practices to help make your fundraising roller coaster more productive and less daunting .","annotations":[{"text":"a new company","span":[1918,1930],"token_span":[359,361],"role":"Exchanger_2","label":"Exchanger_2","role_definition":"In cases where the Exchangers involved in a conversation are construed as two separate groups with different levels of volitionality or control, Exchanger_2 refers to the semantically and grammatically less prominent group.

The first sign of unwanted change appears when Lionel 's colleague Rene ( artist Julieth Mars Toussaint ) retires , leaving the older man visibly lost after years in which his job regulated his life and defined his identity .

Diop , a fledgling helmer and niece of Senegalese director Djibril Diop Mambety , brings a sympathetic , assertive personality to Josephine , while Dogue 's thousand - watt smile exudes kindness and care . Ingrid Caven has a small role , shot in Luebeck , as Jo 's aunt , a more disillusioned creature looking back at the past . By now , Denis has perfected her crew family , crafting a flawless package . Masterful d.p. Agnes Godard 's confidence is both restrained and thrilling : Ancillary will be difficult here , since such subtle work wo n't have the same impact on DVD . Costume designer Judy Shrewsbury 's contributions are often overlooked , but there 's a white piqued dress at the end that 's too special to ignore , not just in its simple beauty but also in the way it perfectly matches Josephine 's character . Denis ' signature sensitivity to music is beautifully demonstrated , not only with Tindersticks ' original compositions but also with songs heard on the radio or in the cafe , where the Commodores ' \u201c Nightshift \u201d envelops characters and audience in its warm , soulful sounds .","annotations":[{"text":"the love between a father and daughter","span":[326,363],"token_span":[59,65],"role":"Plan","label":"Plan","role_definition":"The Plan is a goal or purpose that the Agent carries out."},{"text":"most people","span":[424,434],"token_span":[74,75],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent, often an institution or governmental organization, puts a Plan into effect.

Even with the disapproving glances \u2014 Lionel when he sees Jo and Noe kissing , Gabrielle when she sees Lionel dancing with the gorgeous caf\u00e9 owner ( Adele Ado ) \u2014 it 's obvious , in the way Denis uses space , music and her performers , that the warmth they feel for each other is incorruptible . This is the moment when Lionel realizes his daughter is fast on the path to an independent life . There 's a perhaps unnecessarily pedantic scene in Josephine 's classroom , when students debate Third World debt policies , but otherwise the film is delicately calibrated . Auds unwilling or unable to follow the narrative intricacies of Denis ' \u201c The Intruder \u201d will have no problems here , although the helmer does n't detail every action or background \u2014 her script and thesps master the special depths of subtlety that make so many explanations unnecessary . Mixing some of her usual muses \u2014 noble , sensitive Descas and sexy , soulful Colin \u2014 with less well - known performers creates a sense of symmetry . Diop , a fledgling helmer and niece of Senegalese director Djibril Diop Mambety , brings a sympathetic , assertive personality to Josephine , while Dogue 's thousand - watt smile exudes kindness and care . Ingrid Caven has a small role , shot in Luebeck , as Jo 's aunt , a more disillusioned creature looking back at the past . By now , Denis has perfected her crew family , crafting a flawless package . Masterful d.p. Agnes Godard 's confidence is both restrained and thrilling : Ancillary will be difficult here , since such subtle work wo n't have the same impact on DVD . Costume designer Judy Shrewsbury 's contributions are often overlooked , but there 's a white piqued dress at the end that 's too special to ignore , not just in its simple beauty but also in the way it perfectly matches Josephine 's character . Denis ' signature sensitivity to music is beautifully demonstrated , not only with Tindersticks ' original compositions but also with songs heard on the radio or in the cafe , where the Commodores ' \u201c Nightshift \u201d envelops characters and audience in its warm , soulful sounds .","annotations":[{"text":"the love between a father and daughter","span":[326,363],"token_span":[59,65],"role":"Plan","label":"Plan","role_definition":"The Plan is a goal or purpose that the Agent carries out."},{"text":"most people","span":[424,434],"token_span":[74,75],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent, often an institution or governmental organization, puts a Plan into effect.

Two others were shot as they tried to escape . Although the affair reached its climax in Cooke County , men were killed in neighboring Grayson , Wise , and Denton counties . Most were accused of treason or insurrection , but evidently few had actually conspired against the Confederacy , and many were innocent of the abolitionist sentiments for which they were tried . The Great Hanging was the result of several years of building tension . The completion of the Butterfield Overland Mail route from St. Louis through Gainesville brought many new people from the upper South and Midwest into Cooke County . By 1860 fewer than 10 percent of the heads of households owned slaves . The slaveholders increasingly feared the influence of Kansas abolitionists in every unrest . In the summer of 1860 several slaves and a northern Methodist minister were lynched in North Texas . Cooke and the surrounding counties voted against secession and thus focused the fears of planters on the nonslaveholders in the region . Rumors of Unionist alliances with Kansas Jayhawkers and Indians along the Red River , together with the petition of E. Junius Foster , editor of the Sherman Patriot , to separate North Texas as a new free state , brought emotions to a fever pitch . Actual opposition to the Confederacy in Cooke County began with the Conscription Acts of April 1862 . Thirty men signed a petition protesting the exemption of large slaveholders from the draft and sent it to the Congress at Richmond . Brig. Gen. William Hudson , commander of the militia district around Gainesville , exiled their leader , but others who remained used the petition to enlist a nucleus for a Union League in Cooke and nearby counties . The members were not highly unified , and their purposes differed with each clique . Most joined to resist the draft and provide common defense against roving Indians and renegades . Rumors began to circulate , however , of a membership of over 1,700 and of plans for an assault when the group had recruited enough men . Fearing that the stories of Unionist plots to storm the militia arsenals at Gainesville and Sherman might prove to be true , Hudson activated the state troops in North Texas in late September 1862 and ordered the arrest of all able- bodied men who did not report for duty . Texas state troops led by Col. James G. Bourland arrested more than 150 men on the morning of October 1 . In Gainesville he and Col. William C. Young of the Eleventh Texas Cavalry , home on sick leave , supervised the collection of a \" citizen 's court \" of twelve jurors . Bourland and Young together owned nearly a fourth of the slaves in Cooke County , and seven of the jurors chosen were slaveholders . Their decision to convict on a majority vote was a bad omen for the prisoners , all of whom were accused of insurrection or treason and none of whom owned slaves . The military achieved its goal of eliminating the leadership of the Union League in Cooke County when the jury condemned seven influential Unionists , but an angry mob took matters into its own hands and lynched fourteen more before the jurors recessed . Violence in Gainesville peaked the next week when unknown assassins killed Young and James Dickson . The decision already made to release the rest of the prisoners was reversed , and many were tried again . Nineteen more men were convicted and hanged . Their execution was supervised by Capt. Jim Young , Colonel Young 's son . Brig. Gen. James W. Throckmorton prevented the execution of all but five men in Sherman , but in Decatur , Capt . John Hale supervised a committee that hanged five suspects . A Southern partisan shot a prisoner in Denton . Texas newspapers generally applauded the hangings , disparaged the Unionists as traitors and common thieves , and insisted they had material support from Kansas abolitionists and the Lincoln administration . The state government condoned the affair . Gov. Francis Richard Lubbock , an ardent Confederate , praised Hudson for his actions , and the legislature paid the expenses of the troops in Gainesville . Articles from the Texas press were reprinted across the South . President Jefferson Davis , embarrassed , abandoned his demand for an inquiry into a similar incident involving northern troops in Palmyra , Missouri , and dismissed Gen. Paul Octave H\u00e9bert as military commander of Texas for his improper use of martial law in several instances , including the hangings . The northern press heralded the story as another example of Rebel barbarism . Andrew Jackson Hamilton , a former congressman from Texas and a Unionist , had been speaking in the North warning of the danger to loyal citizens in Texas . Reports of the Great Hanging and other incidents lent support to his campaign and led to his appointment as military governor of Texas and the disastrous Red River campaign of 1864 . The unrest did not end with the hangings in North Texas . Albert Pike , Confederate brigadier general in charge of Indian Territory , was implicated in testimony and arrested . Although later released , Pike continued to be regarded with suspicion and served the rest of the war in civilian offices . Capt. Jim Young killed E. Junius Foster for applauding the death of his father . He also tracked down Dan Welch , the man he believed to be his father 's assassin , then returned with him to Cooke County and had him lynched by some of the family slaves . The Union League was powerless to exact revenge ; many members fled along with the families of the slain prisoners , leaving bodies unclaimed for burial in a mass grave . A North Texas company of Confederate soldiers in Arkansas learned of the executions and almost mutinied , but tempers were defused by Brig. Gen. Joseph O. Shelby , their commander . Several men later deserted to return home , but Shelby prevented a mass assault on Gainesville . The half - hearted prosecution of those responsible for the hangings after the war , resulting in the conviction of only one man in Denton , increased resentment among the remaining Unionists in North Texas , but the failure of a Union League march on Decatur indicated the futility of further attempts at retaliation .

Click here for our followup story about how the town of Erwin , Tennessee has come to peace with these events from its past \u2013 and even transformed them into a story rich with redemption , creativity , and momentum .

It 's a place where many of the Main Street businesses mark the Fourth of July by closing down for four days , and nobody seems to mind the inconvenience . Mary The Elephant Mary the Elephant . The town considered guns , electrocution and dismemberment before settling on hanging . In 1916 , Erwin was a railroad boom town , home to the Cincinnati , Clinchfield , and Ohio Railroad 's repair facilities , \" sprouting like a boy growing too fast for his own britches , \" according to longtime resident Hank S. Johnson . The population of Erwin ( which was supposed to be called Ervin , in honor of the man who donated 15 acres of land for the town , but was misspelled by a postal worker ) nearly tripled in the first 16 years of the century . Makeshift boardwalks stretched above the ankle- deep yellow mud in the streets . The Clinchfield line used to carry coal out of the Tennessee mountains ; Clinchfield and Blue Ridge Pottery were the major employers in Erwin . For decades , the railroad yards were the busiest place in town . Now , the yards are quiet : pigeons roost in the old passenger station , and most of the tracks are dull from disuse . This is where Murderous Mary , a five - ton cow elephant with the Sparks Brothers Circus , was hung by the neck from Derrick Car 1400 on September 13 , 1916 . The story of why and how Mary died is , of course , obscured by time and countless retelling : an example of the best and worst of oral history . It is tragic , absurd , excessive : quintessential turn - of - the - century America . The Players Charlie Sparks , the owner of Sparks World Famous Shows , was a frustrated man . His circus was two -bit , compared to his southern rival , John Robinson 's Four Ring Circus and Menagerie . A circus 's net worth was measured in rolling stock and elephants : Sparks ' dog-and - pony show traveled in a mere 10 railroad cars , compared to Robinson 's 42 ; Sparks could boast of only five elephants compared to Robinson 's dozen . Never mind Barnum and Bailey -- 84 railroad cars was beyond Charlie Sparks ' reach . So Charlie did the best he could , traveling around the South , putting up advance posters and enticing folks with a noon circus parade prior to the day 's two performances . Sparks posters claimed a certain degree of moral superiority : \" Twenty - five years of honest dealing with the public ! \" \" Moral , entertaining , and instructive ! \" \" The show that never broke a promise ! \" What else did Sparks offer ? Educated sea lions . Greasepainted and powdered dogs and humans , posing like Greek statues . Clowns . The Man Who Walks Upon His Head . And elephants . Mary was billed as \" the largest living land animal on earth \" ; her owner claimed she was three inches bigger than Jumbo , P.T. Barnum 's famous pachyderm . At 30 years old , Mary was five tons of pure talent : she could \" play 25 tunes on the musical horns without missing a note \" ; the pitcher on the circus baseball - game routine , her .400 batting average \" astonished millions in New York . \" Rumor and exaggeration swarmed about Mary like flies . She was worth a small fortune : $ 20,000 , Charlie Sparks claimed . She was dangerous , having killed two men , or was it eight , or 18 ? She was Charlie Sparks ' favorite , his cash cow , his claim to circus fame . She was the leader of his small band of elephants , an exotic crowd - pleaser , an unpredictable giant . On Monday , September 11 , 1916 , Sparks World Famous Shows played St. Paul , Va. , a tiny mining town in the Clinch River Valley . Which is where drifter Red Eldridge made a fatal decision . Slight and flame - haired , Red had nothing to lose by signing up with Sparks World Famous Shows : he 'd dropped into St. Paul from a Norfolk and Western boxcar and decided to stay for a while . Taking a job as janitor at the Riverside Hotel , Eldridge found himself pushing a broom and , then , dreaming of moving on . Eldridge was hired as an elephant handler and marched in the circus parade that afternoon . It 's easy to imagine that what he lacked in skill and knowledge , he made up for with go-for-broke bravado . A small man carrying a big stick can be a dangerous thing . The Proceedings No one denies that Mary killed Eldridge in Kingsport , Tenn. on September 12 , 1916 . The details of why and how it happened , gathered from oral - history tapes from the Archives of Appalachia at East Tennessee State University , vary so wildly that they should be read with skepticism , and no small dose of chagrin . Version I. After the Kingsport performance , Red Eldridge was assigned to ride Mary to a pond , where she could drink and splash with the other elephants . According to W.H. Coleman , who at the tender age of 19 witnessed the \" murder \" : There was a big ditch at that time , run up through Center Street , ... And they 'd sent these boys to ride the elephants ... There was , oh , I do n't know now , seven or eight elephants ... and they went down to water them and on the way back each boy had a little stick -like , that was a spear or a hook in the end of it ... And this big old elephant reach over to get her a watermelon rind , about half a watermelon somebody eat and just laid it down there ; 'n he did , the boy give him a jerk . He pulled him away from 'em , and he just blowed real big , and when he did , he took him right around the waist ... and throwed him against the side of the drink stand and he just knocked the whole side out of it . I guess it killed him , but when he hit the ground the elephant just walked over and set his foot on his head ... and blood and brains and stuff just squirted all over the street . Version II . As reported in the September 13 , 1916 issue of the Johnson City Staff , Mary \" collided its trunk vice - like [ sic ] about [ Eldridge 's ] body , lifted him 10 feet in the air , then dashed him with fury to the ground ... and with the full force of her biestly [ sic ] fury is said to have sunk her giant tusks entirely through his body . The animal then trampled the dying form of Eldridge as if seeking a murderous triumph , then with a sudden ... swing of her massive foot hurled his body into the crowd . \" Version III . Maybe Mary was simply bored , as a staff writer for the Johnson City Press - Chronicle suggested in 1936 . \" The elephant 's keeper , while in the act of feeding her , walked unsuspectingly between her and the tent wall . For no reason that could be ascertained , Mary became angry and , with a vicious swish of her trunk , landed a fatal blow on his head . \" Version IV . Or did Mary kill Red Eldridge because she was in pain ? Erwin legend has it that Mary had two abscessed teeth , which caused her such agony that she went berserk when Eldridge tapped her with his elephant stick . The infections were , of course , discovered only after Mary was killed . Regardless of the details , the end was the same -- a man dead . Justice to be served . And besides , Charlie Sparks was no fool : no town in Tennessee would invite his circus to perform with a certifiably rogue elephant . Johnson City , where performances were scheduled for September 26 , had already passed a privilege - tax ordinance restricting carnivals ' oper- ations within city limits , in order to protect its citizens from wholesale fleecing ; it was common knowledge that Johnson City officials were looking for an excuse to ban all traveling shows . As valuable as Mary was , she had to go . The problem was , how ? Guns , of course , were the first course of action . Just after Eldridge 's death , blacksmith Hench Cox fired his 32 - 20 five times at Mary ; the story goes that the bullets hardly phased her . \" Kill the elephant . Let 's kill him , \" the crowd began chanting . Later , Sheriff Gallahan \" knocked chips out of her hide a little \" with his .45 , according to witness Bud Jones . But the circus manager stated , \" There ai n't gun enough in this country that he could be killed \" ; another approach would have to be attempted . Someone suggested electrocution : \" They tried to electrocute her in Kingsport -- they put 44,000 volts to her and she just danced a little bit , \" railroader Mont Lilly claimed . Others report that electrocution was never an option , because there was n't enough power running in the railroad yards to affect Mary . ( Since most American railroads continued to use steam locomotives until the 1930s , it 's curious that railroad electrocution was even a possibility . ) Other reports suggest a third execution method : hooking Mary to two opposing engines and dismembering her , or crushing her between two facing engines . Both were dismissed as too cruel . And so it was decided , instead , that Murderous Mary would be hung by the neck from a derrick car the next day . The Execution Mary The Elephant Clinchfield railyards . The elephant 's leg was chained to the rail before she was lifted by a chain around her neck . Mary did n't perform for the matinee performance the day she died . She was chained outside the circus tent , and folks say she spent the entire performance time swaying nervously . The crowd 's dissatisfaction with her absence was mollified by the announcement that Mary would be hung in the Clinchfield Railyards later in the afternoon -- with no additional charge for admission . More than 2,500 people gathered to watch Mary swing near the turn - table and powerhouse on that drizzly afternoon ; perhaps the number of eyewitnesses , as well as the unforgettable , sad spectacle of the event , explains the consensus on this part of the story . One of those witnesses , Myrtle Taylor , remembered that every child in Erwin was at the Clinchfield Yards . \" And they took the other elephants and Mary down Love Street from the performance to the railyards , trunk to tail . We kids hung back because we were scared to death , but still we wanted to see it . \" Wade Ambrose , who was 20 at the time Mary was hung , recalls that the roustabouts chained Mary 's leg to the rail , then drove her companions back around the roundhouse . \" They had a time getting the chain around her neck . Then they hooked the boom to the neck chain , and when they began to lift her up , I heard the bones and ligaments cracking in her foot . They finally discovered that she 'd not been released from the rail , so they did that . \" It does n't seem surprising that the chain from which Mary hung snapped shortly after she was raised off the ground . It was , after all , just a 7/8 \" chain , and Mary weighed 10,000 pounds . She hit the ground and sat upright , immobilized from the pain of a broken hip . \" It made a right smart little racket when the elephant hit the ground , \" says eyewitness George Ingram , with admirable understatement . Seeing Mary loose , not knowing that she had broken her hip and could n't move , the crowd panicked and ran for cover . Then one of the roustabouts \" ran up her back like he was climbing a small hill and attached a heavier chain \" ; the winch was put in motion a second time , and Mary died . They left her hanging for a half - hour , witnesses say , and then they dumped her in the grave they 'd dug with a steam shovel 400 feet up the tracks . ( The reports of the grave size vary from a too-small 10 by 12 feet to \" big as a barn . \" ) When Mary 's massive and valuable tusks were sawed off is a matter of debate . Some , such as eyewitness M.D. Clark , claim that \" they dug down that night and cut her tushes off . \" Mont Lilly , who helped hang Mary , claims someone made a pair of dice from the tusks . A careful observer of the one photograph allegedly taken at Mary 's hanging will notice that the elephant suspended there has no tusks . So either Mary 's tusks were removed before she was hung -- or they were removed after the hanging and Mary was \" rehung \" for a photo -op . A third possibility -- that the photograph was a hoax -- ought not to be discounted ; when it was submitted to Argosy magazine for publication , the photo was rejected as a phony . Tusks or no tusks , Mary or a superimposed substitute : The photograph revealing the hung elephant is a mirror of the times , in which Old Testament , frontier justice was served ( Mary had , after all , killed two or three or 18 men ) , and people 's insatiable hunger for grotesquery was , at least temporarily , satisfied . Eighty Years Later ... Mary The Elephant Antique shop . Ruth Piper 's store commemorates Mary the Elephant . There is an antique shop in Erwin memorializing -- or capitalizing -- on Mary 's death . The owners of the Hanging Elephant Antique Shop sell T-shirts emblazoned with Mary 's likeness , which also graces the side of their building . There is also in Erwin a woman named Ruth Piper , who has made it her mission to memorialize Mary , to wash the town clean of elephant blood . Piper believes that Erwin has for too long taken the rap for Mary 's death . \" Kingsport , the railroad , and Mr. Sparks are to blame for what happened to Mary -- not Erwin . People feel so guilty about it -- we 've got to release it . It is a sad , sad thing that happened , but we have to let it go . \" Somewhat paradoxically , Piper wants an elephant statue and fountain built in town , a movie at the visitor center , a memorial wreath laid in the railroad yards . In October 1995 , she presented her proposal to the Erwin Bicentennial Committee . Nothing came of it . There is a final irony clinging to the story of Murderous Mary , one that firmly places Mary 's murder in a time and place . In an article published in the March 1971 issue of the Tennessee Folklore Society Bulletin , author Thomas Burton reports that some local residents recall \" two Negro keepers \" being hung alongside Mary , and that others remember Mary 's corpse being burned on a pile of crossties . \" This belief , \" Burton writes , \" may stem from a fusion of the hanging with another incident that occurred in Erwin , the burning on a pile of crossties of a Negro who allegedly abducted a white girl . \" The murder of an elephant : a spectacle . The murder of \" a Negro \" : another spectacle .

It was told that it was a Pakistani boat that was probably coming to India with explosives , with their objective of committing ' something like 26/11 attack ' . I had visited Diu on the west coast few months ago and I met with Indian fishermen who were released by Pakistan before the swearing in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister .

Most of the Indian media houses are in a \u201c hurry \u201d and publish anything without caring about the need to verify the facts or analysis .

During my visit , I had been told by the fishermen and Indian officers that fishing boats of Pakistan are less advanced than Indian mechanised boats . The reason was not linked with the lagging in technological advancement , but with the requirement . For Pakistani fishing boats , they need to travel less for a good catch of fish , while for Indian boats , they need to go longer in deep sea . Most of the good fish catch is near the Indo - Pak maritime boundary and very often , fishermen of both sides cross this boundary for this catch , and get trapped . Also , consumption and margin over fish market in India is more than in Pakistan and it therefore keeps Indian boats more advanced . An average Indian boat can run faster than any Pakistani boat and can carry as many people as 11 - 15 crew members , while generally a Pakistani boat is able to carry as 3 - 7 crew members . It was also told that in case coast guards of India or Pakistan chase even if the advance mechanised boats , the boat cannot run away as the speed of coast guard boats is many times more than these mechanised boats . Now , in the case of the present ' terror boat ' , It was told that dronier aircraft first intercepted that a boat on slow speed was inside in Indian boundary and then ' Raj Rattan ' coast guard ship was diverted towards it . If it is the practical sea situation , then how and why the Indian coast guards could not catch the ' terror boat ' ? Reply by Indian narrative is that , they fired ' warning ' shots . It is to be noted that no firing or attack was done by the ' terror boat ' . It was told that the warning shots were fired by coast guards . Contrary to what some media houses are stating , no clear evidence about ' carrying explosives ' has been found yet . It is a fact that few boats roam in the sea carrying diesel cans as they sell diesel to other fishing boats in the sea . This ' terror boat ' may be the same kind of boat that had may have got blown up with the bullets of coast guard . It is unclear if the boat burnt itself , or by the crew members , or by the bullets of coast guards . It was told that the boat was intercepted and fired within 15 km of Indo - Pak maritime boundary , it was presented in such a way that it was near west coast of India and it was written as 365 km from Porbandar ( India ) almost everywhere . Also , being inside few kilometers of maritime boundary happens many times by fishing boats of each other in each other 's boundary . Even if the boat was a ' terror boat ' and was carrying explosives and has been intercepted , even the coastal police could be informed to track the same and it could be caught red-handed , with all evidences in hand and also to be ready for any situation , in case the intercepted boat may reach till coast . Media reports that police officials also expressed that they were not informed about any such thing . Due to sinking of the boat and that no recovery of any dead body could be done , it is again unsure to say about nationality about persons . It could be any body , Indian or Pakistani . Even if Pakistani , then an ordinary and innocent Pakistani fishermen crew , or a small group of smugglers of diesel or even terrorists , but the third one is hard to believe with the available facts while cannot be completely ruled out . Indo - Pak maritime boiundary is still not completely finalised and due to conflicts in deciding borders also , few times boats were caught . There are other reasons too . Indian Express ( http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/little-evidence-of-terror-link-may-have-been-petty-smugglers/) reports that Ministry of Defence in its Press Release said that intelligence inputs were received that a fishing boat from Keti Bunder near Karachi was planning some illicit transaction in Arabian sea ' . Also , the news reports says that National Technical Research Organisation just intercepted mobile phone traffic involving small time smugglers operating out of the fishing port of Keti Bunder . It was also told that no link with any threat to India or of terrorism was provided . Reports also said that no information to gujrat and Maharastra coastal police were given while they claim that information should be shared to avoid any casualty or failure in case the boat was actually carrying explosives . IBN news channel in its report ( http://ibnlive.in.com/news/coast-guard-patrolling-still-on-area-where-pakistan-terror-boat-sank-under-surveillance/521036-3-238.html) stated that the Coast guard IG , Kuldeep Singh said they positively identified a suspected boat 265 km . south west of Porbandar . He further told that ' They switched on light for sometime and when we saw that those on board did not look like fishermen , the boat did not respond to out repeated signals but after sometimes they themselves blew up the boat ' . I think it is essential that we inquire from the Coast Guard that how a fisherman looks ? When I went to meet the fishermen , I personally found it hard to tell them apart . Also , how in the midnight , a coast guard can identify some one on another boat that they were not looking like fishermen ? Times of India in its report describes 10 ' interesting ' points ( http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Pak-terror-boat-intercepted-off-Gujarat-coast-What-we-know-so-far-10-interesting-points/articleshow/45731626.cms) where in its first point it tells that '\u2026 This is an incident that comes a month after sixth anniversary of Mumbai Terror attack ' . And the last 10th point only tells ' ten terrorists involved in 2008 terror attack had reached Mumbai in a boat from Karachi . The attack had left 166 people dead . ' We really do n't know how and why it is linking with such a time scenario ? It means that if the incident would happen in March , it could link it again saying after three months of sixth anniversary \u2026 , or even can link it with Kargil , Lakhvi etc etc . Also , the last point is no where any information regarding present boat and only written for sensitization or ' opinion ' making for forced ' link ' of a reader of this incident with the 26/11 . It is still unclear that what was there in boat . Everybody have their own narratives and probably it will remain so , like in many other blame games India and Pakistan play with each other . It could be and even it could not be . At a point where we see media as mostly irresponsible in covering such an important news , we also see that few media later analysed the news and tried to bring the critical analysis . With the reports like First post ( http://www.firstpost.com/india/terror-boat-or-not-all-you-need-to-know-about-pakistan-vessel-that-exploded-2028573.html), Indian Express ( http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/little-evidence-of-terror-link-may-have-been-petty-smugglers/) and DNA ( http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-was-it-indeed-a-terror-boat-2049139), some hope re-affirms as they not only tried to look critically and with investigative way of journalism , but they also provided the rules and international protocols of ' intercepting ' and ' chasing ' and foreign vessel , that probably violated by Indian coast guards . It is true that on land borders of India and Pakistan , continuous ceasefire violations are taking place . It was also observed that the frequency of these violations have been increased , however still it is unclear that who initiate it . It was also told that many times , even ministries of both sides do n't know the real situation of who initiated first , as everything happens on ground , on borders . A friend of border area describes that how even without reasons , these firings start sometimes and increases during cricket match and other such events . It is sad and a reason to protest against the governments that while people in both countries got affected with such incidents indirectly and become involved in jingoism , media only propagates it and everything remains clueless . Peace groups appeal with people to remain calm . These groups also appeal with both the governments to not only stop such things , but also to make a joint inquiry and to public the report . The logic behind is that , both countries only blame each other and their citizens become confuse and start fighting among them , common people and soldiers on both sides lost their lives and huge amount of tax payers money spent over all such conflict management and counter operations , arms and ammunition . As all these are happening with money of common citizens and affecting them too , then it is their right to know the truth behind it and the ways to stop it . It was also told that Pakistan is doing it in wake of Obama visit to India , Pakistan blames it that India is doing this just to make sensitivity about Pakistan and diverting the attention of ceasefire violations by India . The ministers are also out of patience and rather than talking about solution , are talking about giving a \u201c befitting reply \u201d as if it can make the concrete path of peace . Ministries of foreign affairs are just issuing summons to high commissioners of each other . Rather than such an approach of postponing the resolution , it is a time when governments must understand that ' business of conflict ' should be stopped and solutions and negotiations must take place .

One week later , on 7 July , tens of thousands marched in Kowloon - an area popular with mainland tourists - in a bid to explain their concerns . Until this point the protests had received little if any coverage in state - run mainland media . On 9 July , Carrie Lam reiterated that the extradition bill was \" dead \" urging protesters to stop their actions . She still refrained from fully withdrawing the bill . On 21 July , protesters defaced China 's Liaison Office in Hong Kong . That same night , mobs of men wearing white - shirts attack commuters in Yuen Long underground station - near mainland China - in a new escalation of violence . Some suspected these were members of gangs called triads and pointed out that police arrived very late to stop them . On 27 July , thousands demonstrated in Yuen Long condemning the station attack . Police responded by firing tear gas at the unauthorised protests . On 2 August , even civil servants - supposed to be politically neutral - joined demonstrations in their thousands . It 's not just about extradition any more By this point it had become clear the protests had evolved well beyond the initial demand of the withdrawal of the extradition bill . Some protesters said it was now about what they saw as the erosion of the special freedoms Hong Kong has . A former British colony and now part of China , Hong Kong is run under a \" one country , two systems \" agreement that guarantees it a level of autonomy , its own judiciary and a separate legal system from the mainland . But there was also a lot of anger towards how the police had handled the situation , and their use of force . Violent clashes become the norm On 3 August , protests took place for the ninth consecutive weekend . Police again fired tear gas , rubber bullets and bean bag rounds at protesters , something many had now come to expect . By this time protesters were wearing masks and protective gear at every demonstration . On 5 August , yet another city - wide strike was held , bringing services across Hong Kong to a standstill . Carrie Lam gave her first media address in two weeks , saying Hong Kong was \" on the verge of a very dangerous situation \" . On 6 August , China warned the protesters not to \" play with fire , \" not to \" underestimate the firm resolve [ of ] the central government \" and not to \" mistake restraint for weakness \" . It was one of the strongest warnings Beijing had issued over the protests . Airport shut down by protesters Protests moved into a 10th week without showing signs of dying down . On 11 August , police stormed enclosed railway stations , firing tear gas at protesters , leading yet again to dramatic scenes of confrontation . During the violence that Sunday , one protester was injured in her eye - it remains unclear how - becoming a symbol of the protest movement . The next day , on 12 August , protesters gathered at the airport , leading to hundreds of flights being cancelled . The protest again saw violent clashes between the activists and police and China condemned them as \" behaviour that is close to terrorism \" - in a sign of Beijing 's rhetoric hardening . As the airport standoff was under way , Hong Kong police admitted deploying officers disguised as anti-government protesters during the unrest the previous day . Some officers disguised themselves as \" different characters \" , a spokesman said , adding that the \" decoy operation \" had targeted \" extreme violent rioters \" . The targeting of suspected under cover officers at the airport by protesters , one of whom turned out to be a reporter , tarnished the image of the protesters . The first peaceful weekend ... One week after the airport clashes , a new rally took place on 18 August . Amid reports of Chinese police and military gathering across the border in Shenzhen , tensions were high . But the protest remained peaceful , and for the first time in weeks , there were no major clashes between police and activists . ... but not for long Violence resumed the following weekend , with police using tear gas and water cannon against protesters , who returned fire with projectiles , including bricks and petrol bombs . For the first time in the unrest police fired a live round . Several days later a number of prominent pro-democracy activists and lawmakers were arrested by police in Hong Kong . Another weekend of worsening violence followed , with police accused of brutality on the city metro and activists closing roads to the airport , a major transport hub . Finally , the bill is withdrawn On 4 September Hong Kong 's leader Carrie Lam announced she would withdraw the highly controversial extradition bill which had started the protests . She also unveiled other measures that appeared to be designed to soothe unrest , but her opponents said it was too little , too late . What the protesters want now The movement is largely leaderless and not everyone has the same end goals . Over the weeks , new demands have been added . By this point , here is what protesters still want : - The withdrawal of the \" riot \" description used about the 12 June protests - An amnesty for all arrested protesters - An independent inquiry into alleged police brutality - Universal suffrage in elections for Hong Kong 's chief executive ( the territory 's leader ) , and Legislative Council Some are still calling for the resignation of Carrie Lam , whom they view as a puppet of Beijing .","annotations":[{"text":"Hong Kong","span":[58,66],"token_span":[10,11],"role":"Current_jurisdiction","label":"Current_jurisdiction","role_definition":"The jurisdiction (generally a nation) the Suspect starts off in."},{"text":"Hong Kongers","span":[277,288],"token_span":[49,50],"role":"Suspect","label":"Suspect","role_definition":"The Suspect is forced to go to the jurisdiction where a crime he or she is suspected of took place or is being tried."},{"text":"Hong Kong 's government","span":[305,327],"token_span":[56,59],"role":"Authorities","label":"Authorities","role_definition":"The Authorities act on behalf of the Current_jurisdiction, giving up the Suspect to the Crime_jurisdiction."},{"text":"to China","span":[441,448],"token_span":[76,77],"role":"Crime_jurisdiction","label":"Crime_jurisdiction","role_definition":"The jurisdiction (generally a nation) to which the Suspect is sent."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"The latter has led democracy advocates and some Hong Kong residents to argue , after the fact , that the territory has yet to achieve universal suffrage as promised by the Basic Law , leading to mass demonstrations in 2014 .

Police responded by firing tear gas at the unauthorised protests . On 2 August , even civil servants - supposed to be politically neutral - joined demonstrations in their thousands . It 's not just about extradition any more By this point it had become clear the protests had evolved well beyond the initial demand of the withdrawal of the extradition bill . Some protesters said it was now about what they saw as the erosion of the special freedoms Hong Kong has . A former British colony and now part of China , Hong Kong is run under a \" one country , two systems \" agreement that guarantees it a level of autonomy , its own judiciary and a separate legal system from the mainland . But there was also a lot of anger towards how the police had handled the situation , and their use of force . Violent clashes become the norm On 3 August , protests took place for the ninth consecutive weekend . Police again fired tear gas , rubber bullets and bean bag rounds at protesters , something many had now come to expect . By this time protesters were wearing masks and protective gear at every demonstration . On 5 August , yet another city - wide strike was held , bringing services across Hong Kong to a standstill . Carrie Lam gave her first media address in two weeks , saying Hong Kong was \" on the verge of a very dangerous situation \" . On 6 August , China warned the protesters not to \" play with fire , \" not to \" underestimate the firm resolve [ of ] the central government \" and not to \" mistake restraint for weakness \" . It was one of the strongest warnings Beijing had issued over the protests . Airport shut down by protesters Protests moved into a 10th week without showing signs of dying down . On 11 August , police stormed enclosed railway stations , firing tear gas at protesters , leading yet again to dramatic scenes of confrontation . During the violence that Sunday , one protester was injured in her eye - it remains unclear how - becoming a symbol of the protest movement . The next day , on 12 August , protesters gathered at the airport , leading to hundreds of flights being cancelled . The protest again saw violent clashes between the activists and police and China condemned them as \" behaviour that is close to terrorism \" - in a sign of Beijing 's rhetoric hardening . As the airport standoff was under way , Hong Kong police admitted deploying officers disguised as anti-government protesters during the unrest the previous day . Some officers disguised themselves as \" different characters \" , a spokesman said , adding that the \" decoy operation \" had targeted \" extreme violent rioters \" . The targeting of suspected under cover officers at the airport by protesters , one of whom turned out to be a reporter , tarnished the image of the protesters . The first peaceful weekend ... One week after the airport clashes , a new rally took place on 18 August . Amid reports of Chinese police and military gathering across the border in Shenzhen , tensions were high . But the protest remained peaceful , and for the first time in weeks , there were no major clashes between police and activists . ... but not for long Violence resumed the following weekend , with police using tear gas and water cannon against protesters , who returned fire with projectiles , including bricks and petrol bombs . For the first time in the unrest police fired a live round . Several days later a number of prominent pro-democracy activists and lawmakers were arrested by police in Hong Kong . Another weekend of worsening violence followed , with police accused of brutality on the city metro and activists closing roads to the airport , a major transport hub . Finally , the bill is withdrawn On 4 September Hong Kong 's leader Carrie Lam announced she would withdraw the highly controversial extradition bill which had started the protests . She also unveiled other measures that appeared to be designed to soothe unrest , but her opponents said it was too little , too late . What the protesters want now The movement is largely leaderless and not everyone has the same end goals . Over the weeks , new demands have been added . By this point , here is what protesters still want : - The withdrawal of the \" riot \" description used about the 12 June protests - An amnesty for all arrested protesters - An independent inquiry into alleged police brutality - Universal suffrage in elections for Hong Kong 's chief executive ( the territory 's leader ) , and Legislative Council Some are still calling for the resignation of Carrie Lam , whom they view as a puppet of Beijing .","annotations":[{"text":"Hong Kong 's government","span":[305,327],"token_span":[56,59],"role":"Authorities","label":"Authorities","role_definition":"The Authorities act on behalf of the Current_jurisdiction, giving up the Suspect to the Crime_jurisdiction."},{"text":"Hong Kong","span":[58,66],"token_span":[10,11],"role":"Current_jurisdiction","label":"Current_jurisdiction","role_definition":"The jurisdiction (generally a nation) the Suspect starts off in."},{"text":"to China","span":[441,448],"token_span":[76,77],"role":"Crime_jurisdiction","label":"Crime_jurisdiction","role_definition":"The jurisdiction (generally a nation) to which the Suspect is sent."},{"text":"criminal suspects","span":[394,410],"token_span":[70,71],"role":"Suspect","label":"Suspect","role_definition":"The Suspect is forced to go to the jurisdiction where a crime he or she is suspected of took place or is being tried."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-0179-543-frame-Extradition","frame":"Extradition","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Suspect in a Current_jurisdiction is forced by Authorities (of the Current_jurisdiction) to go to the Crime_jurisdiction, i.e. the jurisdiction which requested that the Suspect be handed over for trial for a crime which he or she is suspected to have committed in the Crime_jurisdiction.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Mehserle waived extradition , and was held in protective custody at the Santa Rita Jail in Dublin , California .

The conclusion by Oakland police , contained in a legal filing made public Wednesday , contributed to Alameda County prosecutors ' decision to charge Mehserle , 27 , with murdering 22 - year - old Oscar Grant of Hayward . It was an extraordinary decision . Several legal experts said they could recall no instance of a police officer in California being charged with murder for an on-duty incident , and Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff said he had never brought such a case in his 14 years on the job . But the circumstances of the case are equally extraordinary , in that the shooting was filmed by several BART passengers and Mehserle has refused to talk to investigators about why he shot Grant . Orloff said Wednesday that both factors played into his decision to charge Mehserle with murder . Mehserle waived extradition in a court hearing in Douglas County , Nev. , on Wednesday , a day after he was arrested at a friend 's home near Lake Tahoe , where his attorney said he had gone after receiving death threats in the Bay Area . The Lafayette resident was driven to the Santa Rita Jail in Dublin , where he was placed in \" protective custody , \" sheriff 's Sgt. J.D. Nelson said . He is scheduled to be arraigned today in Oakland . His attorney , Christopher Miller , said he expects Mehserle to be cleared . The former officer was not available for an interview . Orloff said Mehserle had committed murder because he killed Grant in an intentional , unlawful act . Orloff said no evidence his office reviewed - witness statements and video shot by BART passengers , including footage that the public has not yet seen but that the district attorney called \" very helpful \" - indicated the shooting was justified . Grant was shot at the Fruitvale BART Station about 2 a.m. Jan. 1 after he and several other young men were pulled off a train by police investigating reports of a fight . In a court filing justifying Mehserle 's arrest , an Oakland police sergeant said video footage showed that \" a struggle ensued \" between Grant and two BART officers , including Mehserle . Both hands behind back The filing adds that the other officer was holding Grant down on his stomach , with his knee on Grant 's head and neck . Mehserle was \" seen trying to pull Grant 's right arm , which appeared to be underneath Grant 's body , \" before abruptly shooting him , police said . \" After careful analysis of the video , it is clear that both Grant 's hands were behind his back , a position hands are commonly placed in by police officers in order to handcuff individuals , \" the police filing said . It concluded that Grant had been \" restrained and unarmed \" when he was shot . Mehserle 's subsequent refusal to talk to detectives about the shooting , Orloff said , left authorities with no window into his state of mind . \" When you basically have a situation of an unlawful , intentional killing of one individual by another , and that 's all you know - and that 's really all we know in this case - then that 's a murder , \" the district attorney said at an Oakland news conference . Mehserle 's silence , Orloff said , \" made it more difficult in the sense that his statement could or could not have given me some insight into his thought process , and I did n't have that insight . The videos are very powerful on what act was committed . The issue likely to be in this case is , what was the mental state at the time that act was committed ? \" Miller , Mehserle 's attorney , said at a news conference later in Sacramento that his client was \" a fine young man \" and an excellent police officer . Miller declined to say why Mehserle shot Grant . The officer resigned from the BART police force Jan. 7 rather than talk to internal affairs inspectors who could have built a disciplinary case against him . \" As the case moves forward through the justice system and all of the circumstances of that chaotic night become clear , I fully expect Mr. Mehserle will be cleared of the charges against him , \" Miller said . Grant family pleased Grant 's family members were pleased by the murder charge , said their attorney , John Burris , who has filed a $ 25 million legal claim against BART . He said he doubted the shooting would have led to charges if it had not been caught on video . \" Anything less than murder would not have been satisfying , \" Burris said . He quoted Grant 's mother , Wanda Johnson , as saying , \" That 's very good , but it does n't bring my son back . \" Although more than 100 people are killed by police officers each year in California , officers are rarely charged with serious crimes . Several law enforcement officials and experts said Wednesday they could not recall the last time a California police officer was charged with murder after an on-duty incident . \" It has n't been studied , \" said Bob Stresak , a spokesman for the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training . \" The occurrence of that is so rare , there 's not a lot to study . \" Some Oakland civic and community leaders have called for charges against the other BART officers who were on the Fruitvale Station platform when Grant was shot , but Orloff said he had found no evidence to justify such an action . Sources said the other officers - including Tony Pirone , the officer whose knee was on Grant 's head - remained on paid administrative leave Wednesday . BART Police Chief Gary Gee , appearing with Orloff at the Oakland news conference , said none of them was the subject of internal affairs investigations . Orloff said he expected the case against Mehserle to go to trial , where a jury would probably have the option of convicting the former officer of first - or second - degree murder ; convicting him of a lesser charge of voluntary or involuntary manslaughter ; or acquitting him . Orloff said he would fight any defense effort to move the case out of Alameda County . Not considered flight risk Mehserle appeared stoic Wednesday morning as he was brought into a courtroom in Minden , Nev. , southeast of Lake Tahoe .

It is unusual when the other half of the bus is filled with longtime city residents and community activists , and the purpose of the tour is not so much to plot the city 's future as it is to make sure its past is understood . On Saturday , Richmond 's Rosie the Riveter / World War II Home Front National Historical Park held its fourth such tour of the city 's World War II era sites , with participants who lived through the era encouraged to add their commentary to the park service 's tour guide . The result was an exercise in living history . In one of Richmond 's Latino sections , the bus passed the Mexican Baptist Church near the Atchison Village housing projects , with tour guide Naomi Torres of the National Park Service talking about how the village was once an open field where Mexican - American farmers grazed their livestock and then was built as housing for Kaiser shipyard workers who flocked to Richmond during the war years . When Torres was finished , Contra Costa Grand Jury Foreman Antonio Medrano , who grew up in Richmond , pointed to the Mexican Baptist Church and said , \u201c I bet you thought all Mexicans were Catholic , \u201d which began his telling of the history of Mexico 's evangelical Protestant movement that later migrated north into the United States . At the Winters Building off of MacDonald Avenue , which served as both a dance hall and an air raid shelter during the war and which now houses the East Bay Center for The Performing Arts , another Park Ranger asked if anyone on the bus remembered attending any dances there . \u201c That place was for white folks , \u201d one of the older black participants pointed out . \u201c You have to remember who was welcome and who was n't welcome on MacDonald Avenue in those days . \u201d There followed stories of Richmond 's deeply segregated days when young white drivers cruised the city 's main street with impunity but black drivers were cited and arrested by police . And at a stop along the wharf next to the enormous closed Ford Assembly Plant , some five football fields long , which once housed a tank production factory and is now being prepared for commercial and housing redevelopment by the City of Richmond , one longtime Parchester Village resident recalled how she and her neighbors could see the lights from munitions loading accident explosions on the docks from their windows . Rosie the Riveter National Park community liaison Betty Reid Soskin , who conceived and designed the tours and works on them jointly with National Park Service Outreach Specialist Naomi Torres , calls them \u201c resoundingly successful , \u201d and says they came out of a desire to \u201c raise the awareness in the City of Richmond that they are in the middle of a national park . There is a misconception that the park is just down by the shoreline but the heart of it is in the Iron Triangle , which is one of the most troubled parts of the city . We 're hoping that the tours can help Richmond form a new identity of itself . We have such a rich history here . \u201d Soskin says she has resisted suggestions to simply have officials take the tours by themselves , without the longtime residents . \u201c Without the residents telling their stories , \u201d Soskin said , \u201c we 'd simply be passing by building sites that we pass by every day , without knowing their historic significance . \u201d Included on the tours was the Galileo Club on South 23rd Street , where Richmond 's largest single ethnic group before World War II \u2014 Italians \u2014 had a social club ( one of the participants explained that because of Richmond 's sensitive wartime industries , only American citizens could live in the city , and many Italian families were broken up when the elders who were non-citizen immigrants were forced to move out ) . Other areas visited were the Pullman District , which includes the still -standing , New Orleans - style hotel where Pullman porters stayed between runs as well as buildings where Pullman passenger cars were repaired and restored ; the Park Florist on MacDonald , which was once owned by a Japanese family who were forced to sell the business when they were relocated to an internment camp ; and the Kaiser Field Hospital , one of the first structures shipbuilding magnate Henry J. Kaiser used as part of his health care system for his shipyard workers , a system that eventually grew into Kaiser Permanente . The tours start at the headquarters of the Rosie the Riveter park at Richmond City Hall , where participants view some of the historic memorabilia . Among them are ID badges , ration stamps , welder 's guns , and a welder 's mask used by a Japanese - American welder \u201c until the day he went into an internment camp , \u201d according to park officials . The photo I.D. badges are especially poignant , giving a human face to an era that is close to us in time , but often forgotten . Housed on a single table in the back of the City Hall complex , the items are being collected for a permanent park museum . While the location for the museum has yet to be determined , park officials say that some of the memorabilia in the park 's projected new Visitors Center at the Ford Assembly Plant . A park official explained that the park is both a collection of World War II - era historical cites as well as a documentation of activities on what was called \u201c the home front \u201d during the war . \u201c And we 're using home front in its broadest possible term , \u201d he said . \u201c We 're referring to anything that happened domestically during the war years . Whatever people were doing at that time was affected by the war , or had an effect on the war . \u201d The official said that while the Rosie the Riveter Park was headquartered in Richmond , the park is a collection of all the west coast wartime history , from Washington State to Southern California . The fifth and final tour is scheduled for later this summer , but Soskin says the park is seeking more funding to extend the events . The tours have been funded by a grant from PG&E . Slots for the fifth tour are already filled , but at a feedback session following Saturday 's tour , park officials said they were open to suggestions to expand the tours and make them available to more community residents , groups , and officials .

It is unusual when the other half of the bus is filled with longtime city residents and community activists , and the purpose of the tour is not so much to plot the city 's future as it is to make sure its past is understood . On Saturday , Richmond 's Rosie the Riveter / World War II Home Front National Historical Park held its fourth such tour of the city 's World War II era sites , with participants who lived through the era encouraged to add their commentary to the park service 's tour guide . The result was an exercise in living history . In one of Richmond 's Latino sections , the bus passed the Mexican Baptist Church near the Atchison Village housing projects , with tour guide Naomi Torres of the National Park Service talking about how the village was once an open field where Mexican - American farmers grazed their livestock and then was built as housing for Kaiser shipyard workers who flocked to Richmond during the war years . When Torres was finished , Contra Costa Grand Jury Foreman Antonio Medrano , who grew up in Richmond , pointed to the Mexican Baptist Church and said , \u201c I bet you thought all Mexicans were Catholic , \u201d which began his telling of the history of Mexico 's evangelical Protestant movement that later migrated north into the United States . At the Winters Building off of MacDonald Avenue , which served as both a dance hall and an air raid shelter during the war and which now houses the East Bay Center for The Performing Arts , another Park Ranger asked if anyone on the bus remembered attending any dances there . \u201c That place was for white folks , \u201d one of the older black participants pointed out . \u201c You have to remember who was welcome and who was n't welcome on MacDonald Avenue in those days . \u201d There followed stories of Richmond 's deeply segregated days when young white drivers cruised the city 's main street with impunity but black drivers were cited and arrested by police . And at a stop along the wharf next to the enormous closed Ford Assembly Plant , some five football fields long , which once housed a tank production factory and is now being prepared for commercial and housing redevelopment by the City of Richmond , one longtime Parchester Village resident recalled how she and her neighbors could see the lights from munitions loading accident explosions on the docks from their windows . Rosie the Riveter National Park community liaison Betty Reid Soskin , who conceived and designed the tours and works on them jointly with National Park Service Outreach Specialist Naomi Torres , calls them \u201c resoundingly successful , \u201d and says they came out of a desire to \u201c raise the awareness in the City of Richmond that they are in the middle of a national park . There is a misconception that the park is just down by the shoreline but the heart of it is in the Iron Triangle , which is one of the most troubled parts of the city . We 're hoping that the tours can help Richmond form a new identity of itself . We have such a rich history here . \u201d Soskin says she has resisted suggestions to simply have officials take the tours by themselves , without the longtime residents . \u201c Without the residents telling their stories , \u201d Soskin said , \u201c we 'd simply be passing by building sites that we pass by every day , without knowing their historic significance . \u201d Included on the tours was the Galileo Club on South 23rd Street , where Richmond 's largest single ethnic group before World War II \u2014 Italians \u2014 had a social club ( one of the participants explained that because of Richmond 's sensitive wartime industries , only American citizens could live in the city , and many Italian families were broken up when the elders who were non-citizen immigrants were forced to move out ) . Other areas visited were the Pullman District , which includes the still -standing , New Orleans - style hotel where Pullman porters stayed between runs as well as buildings where Pullman passenger cars were repaired and restored ; the Park Florist on MacDonald , which was once owned by a Japanese family who were forced to sell the business when they were relocated to an internment camp ; and the Kaiser Field Hospital , one of the first structures shipbuilding magnate Henry J. Kaiser used as part of his health care system for his shipyard workers , a system that eventually grew into Kaiser Permanente . The tours start at the headquarters of the Rosie the Riveter park at Richmond City Hall , where participants view some of the historic memorabilia . Among them are ID badges , ration stamps , welder 's guns , and a welder 's mask used by a Japanese - American welder \u201c until the day he went into an internment camp , \u201d according to park officials . The photo I.D. badges are especially poignant , giving a human face to an era that is close to us in time , but often forgotten . Housed on a single table in the back of the City Hall complex , the items are being collected for a permanent park museum . While the location for the museum has yet to be determined , park officials say that some of the memorabilia in the park 's projected new Visitors Center at the Ford Assembly Plant . A park official explained that the park is both a collection of World War II - era historical cites as well as a documentation of activities on what was called \u201c the home front \u201d during the war . \u201c And we 're using home front in its broadest possible term , \u201d he said . \u201c We 're referring to anything that happened domestically during the war years . Whatever people were doing at that time was affected by the war , or had an effect on the war . \u201d The official said that while the Rosie the Riveter Park was headquartered in Richmond , the park is a collection of all the west coast wartime history , from Washington State to Southern California . The fifth and final tour is scheduled for later this summer , but Soskin says the park is seeking more funding to extend the events . The tours have been funded by a grant from PG&E . Slots for the fifth tour are already filled , but at a feedback session following Saturday 's tour , park officials said they were open to suggestions to expand the tours and make them available to more community residents , groups , and officials .

Slater might have become a top executive in the British car industry , but worries about his health prompted him to seek a less stressful life in the investment world . He had already developed a successful sideline as a share columnist for The Sunday Telegraph when in 1964 he left Leyland Motors to team up with the Conservative MP Peter Walker ( later Lord Walker of Worcester ) . Their company , Slater Walker Securities , became an icon of the British financial scene of the 1960s and 1970s . The key to Slater Walker 's early rise was its ability to use clients ' money to acquire control of companies and to make quick profits out of those companies by disposing of under-performing assets \u2013 the practice known as \u201c asset-stripping \u201d . In an interview in 1992 Slater said : \u201c I do n't deny asset-stripping , though the phrase is used as a smear , usually by spineless people who cannot manage their companies . If a firm has its assets stripped it means they have not been properly used . \u201d Some observers saw Slater as a compulsive dealer whose success had more to do with manipulation of share prices than with management genius . But to others he was a hero and role model : as the City historian David Kynaston put it , \u201c a self - made man uniquely in tune with the Zeitgeist of big-is - best , industrial efficiency and general go - go \u201d . In the bull market of 1967 - 68 , Slater Walker expanded at a ferocious rate , offering its own highly valued shares in exchange for the under-valued assets of its targets : as soon as the ink was dry on one bid , it launched another . By 1972 , Slater Walker 's activities encompassed banking , insurance and property at home and abroad , as well as stakes in hundreds of industrial companies . The Financial Times was moved to observe that \u201c there have been success stories in the City before \u2026 but never has there been anything quite so big , so successful and so singular as the growth of Slater Walker \u201d . As the group 's market value passed \u00a3 200 million , Slater declared his aim to make it worth \u00a3 1 billion within 10 years , and to own \u201c a significant percentage of every major asset situation in Britain \u201d . This , he said , would have a profound effect on British industry , by helping transfer assets from the inefficient to the efficient . \u201c It 's like a knife and butter . And we 're the knife . \u201d The failure of the Hill Samuel deal was a turning point in Slater Walker 's fortunes . As the stock and property markets began to tumble later in 1973 , the company strove to turn assets into cash . Slater told his shareholders at their annual meeting in 1974 : \u201c Cash you can always turn into other things . \u201d But a portfolio of large loans to companies in which it also held share stakes made Slater Walker unusually vulnerable when those companies \u2013 particularly in the property sector \u2013 fell into difficulties . As the crisis deepened in 1975 , a much - reduced Slater Walker was kept afloat by a \u00a3 70 million line of credit and another \u00a3 40 million of guarantees from the Bank of England 's \u201c lifeboat \u201d operation . Slater himself stood down as chairman , making way for Sir James Goldsmith . More trouble was to come . In the autumn of 1976 Slater faced criminal charges brought against him by the DTI for minor Companies Act offences ( on which he was eventually fined \u00a3 15 per count ) and an arrest warrant for extradition to Singapore on fraud charges connected with a company called Haw Par Brothers , in which Slater Walker had an interest . It was alleged that an incentive scheme set up for the benefit of a group of Slater Walker executives , including Slater himself , represented a fraud against Haw Par 's other shareholders . The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate in London concluded in January 1977 that the charges did not stand up and that he could not be extradited for trial . By then , however \u2013 though he was to make a comeback as an investment guru \u2013 Slater 's name in the City was permanently tarnished . The son of a sales manager , James Derrick Slater was born at Heswall , Cheshire , on March 13 1929 , and was brought up in the suburbs of north London . He was educated at Preston Manor secondary school , where his chief passions were chess and stamp collecting . At 16 he became an articled clerk with a small firm of accountants , Croydon & King . After National Service as an Army pay clerk ( having turned down a commission ) Slater qualified as a chartered accountant in 1953 . He left Croydon & King to become chief accountant to a group of private companies in the metal industry , owned by an entrepreneur called Svend Dohm . He learnt how to turn around loss - making companies , and from Dohm himself he learnt \u201c contrary thinking \u201d , notably in picking investments . Dohm 's maxim \u201c always try to turn a disadvantage to an advantage \u201d was one which Slater always carried with him . Leaving Dohm in 1955 , Slater briefly launched an industrial venture of his own , but it was not a success . He also ventured into the stock market for the first time , buying a gold share which failed to rise . In debt and in need of a steady job , he applied to become secretary of Park Royal Vehicles , which made bus and coach bodies . Here Slater honed his eye for inefficiency and excess cost , and in 1959 he was promoted on to the sales side of the parent company , Associated Commercial Vehicles ( ACV ) , travelling 50,000 miles a year in pursuit of export contracts . \u2022 The rigours of this schedule caused him to succumb to a viral illness , and during a convalescence at Bournemouth he turned to the stock market . It was at this stage that he developed what he later called the \u201c Zulu Principle \u201d of investment . If you read every book in the library about Zulus , he observed , you will soon know more about them than anyone else around you : focusing on a relatively narrow field can give you an investment advantage . Slater 's chosen field was smaller companies which showed unusual earnings growth , and after a fortnight 's intensive study of back numbers of Investors Chronicle he homed in on one \u2013 a motor industry supplier , Bernard Wardle \u2013 in which he invested \u00a3 10,000 ( \u00a3 2,000 of his own and \u00a3 8,000 borrowed ) . The shares duly soared . In 1962 ACV was merged into Leyland Motors , and Slater became deputy sales director of the group under Donald ( later Lord ) Stokes . But he continued to develop his investment skills \u2013 turning his initial \u00a3 2,000 stake into \u00a3 50,000 \u2013 and in March 1963 he persuaded the City editor of The Sunday Telegraph , Nigel Lawson , to give him a share column under the pseudonym \u201c Capitalist \u201d . Over the two years of the column 's life its \u201c ghost portfolio \u201d appreciated by 69 per cent , against a market average of only 4 per cent . It was at about this time that a Brighton fortune - teller told Slater he would leave his present job , become famous , make a great deal of money and marry his secretary . Another fortune - teller the same day told him to avoid games of chance because he was unlucky ; Slater challenged the soothsayer to double or quits on his 10 shilling fee \u2013 and won . Though he had good prospects at Leyland , Slater worried that his health would not stand a senior executive role . He left to join forces with Peter Walker \u2013 who had made his name in insurance and unit trust ventures , and was also at that time shadow minister of transport ; the two met as a result of a newspaper article in which both had featured as up - and - coming under-forties . The vehicle for their partnership was a property company called H Lotery & Co , which they took over in July 1964 and renamed Slater Walker \u2013 though Walker was to sever his connections with the business when he became a minister in 1970 . The final stage of Slater Walker 's demise , after Slater 's own departure , was the takeover of its banking arm in 1977 by the Bank of England to save it from insolvency ; what remained of the group 's investment management operation was renamed Britannia Arrow . Slater himself was by then , as he famously put it , a \u201c minus millionaire \u201d , with assets of \u00a3 2 million but debts of \u00a3 3 million \u2013 but he declared that he would pay off all his creditors within three years , and proceeded to do so . \u2022 His fortune was rebuilt by quiet stock picking and property dealing \u2013 in part financed by his friend Tiny Rowland of Lonrho \u2013 and by writing children 's books . He had always enjoyed making puppet shows and telling stories for his own children , and his first story in print , Goldenrod , about a boy with magical powers , sold a respectable 35,000 copies . His next effort , the A. Mazing Monster series for younger children , became a huge hit . He also published , in 1977 , his autobiography , Return To Go , in which he expressed the hope that \u201c youth , ambition , risk - taking and innovative thinking \u201d would not be discredited by the outcome of the Slater Walker saga . He re-emerged in business in the 1980s as the chairman of a venture which bought up fishing beats and sold them as time - shares . In the 1990s he acquired a new following as a share tipster , through newspaper columns and a private- circulation newsletter , and brought his laser -eyed scrutiny to bear as a director of a number of smaller companies . Jim Slater remained a chess enthusiast all his life , and counted his sponsorship of British chess as one of his proudest achievements . Through his charitable foundation he also sponsored young British tennis players , though he preferred playing table tennis . He was also a competitive bridge player and keen fisherman . He married , in 1965 , Helen Goodwyn , who had been his secretary at Leyland Motors and whom he liked to describe as \u201c a long - term hold \u201d . She survives him with their two sons and two daughters .

Dunk was not in the squad for the Capital One Cup first round clash at Southend on August 11 , which Albion won 1 - 0 . The centre-half played in the opening Championship win against Nottingham Forest at the Amex four nights earlier . Fulham had already made two bids at that stage . It has now emerged that Dunk was fined two weeks wages by the club for refusing to play against Southend . He was on the bench at Fulham four days later and remained among the substitutes at Huddersfield last Tuesday and for Saturday 's home game against Blackburn Rovers following the signing of German central defender Uwe Huenemeier . Fulham had two further offers for Dunk of \u00a3 5 million and another in excess of \u00a3 5 million rejected by Albion in recent days . They have until 6 pm on September 1 , when the transfer window closes , to make another bid . Albion have responded to the interest from Fulham and an un-named Premier League club lurking in the background by offering Dunk , 23 , an improved contract over a longer term than the three years remaining on his existing deal .

Dunk was not in the squad for the Capital One Cup first round clash at Southend on August 11 , which Albion won 1 - 0 . The centre-half played in the opening Championship win against Nottingham Forest at the Amex four nights earlier . Fulham had already made two bids at that stage . It has now emerged that Dunk was fined two weeks wages by the club for refusing to play against Southend . He was on the bench at Fulham four days later and remained among the substitutes at Huddersfield last Tuesday and for Saturday 's home game against Blackburn Rovers following the signing of German central defender Uwe Huenemeier . Fulham had two further offers for Dunk of \u00a3 5 million and another in excess of \u00a3 5 million rejected by Albion in recent days . They have until 6 pm on September 1 , when the transfer window closes , to make another bid . Albion have responded to the interest from Fulham and an un-named Premier League club lurking in the background by offering Dunk , 23 , an improved contract over a longer term than the three years remaining on his existing deal . It is unclear whether Dunk will start tomorrow night 's Capital One Cup second round tie at Walsall .

Peter talks to her about how he turned up a lead at the Daily Bugle about an underworld doctor , which he gave to Ben. Neither Peter nor MJ notices a shadowy figure following them .

He can hurt Spider - Man all he wants , but no more than that . Shortly after Gaunt leaves , Spider - Man arrives and goes after the Hobgoblin .

Although his first instinct is to strike back , Spider - Man realizes that the abductor could be a friend of Peter 's , which is one of the downsides of being out of action for so long . He 's not sure what sort of reputation Spider - Man has now and who his friends and enemies are . The stranger , who Peter later tells Ben is Will o' the Wisp , has had an implant put into him by Jonas Harrow , and is being forced to commit crimes . Ben uses Peter 's contacts at the Bugle to find out more information about Wisp and what he may be up to . Ben thinks how good it is that Peter and MJ have decided to move back to New York . He appreciates the help in his crime fighting duties , plus he ca n't wait to be an uncle . Spider - Man goes searching for Wisp and ends up finding him as he 's ready to begin another minor crime spree . While Spidey tries to convince Wisp to take control , Wisp explains that if he does n't succeed in following Harrow 's orders , his molecules will be scattered .

Following the release of the episode , Kochhar tweeted : \" It 's sad to see that you [ Chopra ] have not respected the sentiments of Hindus who have been terrorised by Islam over 2000 years . Shame on You . \" Get The Caterer every week on your smartphone , tablet , or even in good old - fashioned hard copy ( or all three ! ) .","annotations":[{"text":"Atul Kochhar","span":[0,11],"token_span":[0,1],"role":"Employee","label":"Employee","role_definition":"The person who is let go by their Employer."},{"text":"Benares","span":[50,56],"token_span":[10,10],"role":"Employer","label":"Employer","role_definition":"The person (or institution) that end an employment relationship with an Employee."},{"text":"chef - patron","span":[197,209],"token_span":[36,38],"role":"Position","label":"Position","role_definition":"The label given to a particular type of employment."},{"text":"Mayfair","span":[162,168],"token_span":[30,30],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the Employer fires the Employee."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-1323-309-frame-Fleeing","frame":"Fleeing","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Self_mover responds to a (real or imagined) danger by moving away from it.","frame_ancestors":["Self_motion","Intentionally_act","Event","Motion"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Other countries Venezuela : An estimated 200,000 Colombians have fled the Colombian civil war and sought safety in Venezuela .
