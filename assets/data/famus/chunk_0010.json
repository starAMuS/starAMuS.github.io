Bancroft , National Center for Environmental Prediction Typhoon Nida : Nida entered OPC 's oceanic area for ( Mercator ) radiofacsimile charts near 29N 136E at 1200 UTC May 20 with maximum sustained winds of 80 KT and gusts to 100 KT . The cyclone moved northeast and weakened to a tropical storm six hours later . By 0600 UTC on the 21st Nida was about 250 nmi northeast of Tokyo with maximum winds 45 KT with gusts to 55 KT , about to become extratropical . Figure 1 shows Typhoon Nida approaching a frontal zone and becoming an extratropical storm at 1200 UTC May 21 east of Japan . While Nida was still a typhoon , the Mokihanai ( WNRD ) encountered southwest winds of 50 KT and 10.5 m seas ( 35 ft ) near 22N 132E at 0000 UTC May 20 . The vessel CMA CGM Alabama ( DGGV ) ( 24N 137E ) reported south winds of 40 KT and 6.5 m seas ( 21 ft ) six hours later . The Sea- Land Reliance ( WFLH ) reported east winds of 45 KT near 39N 149E at 0000 UTC on the 21st , and east winds at 50 KT near 41N 153E twelve hours later . The extratropical storm attained a central pressure of 988 h Pa near 40N 148E at 1800 UTC May 21 , when the President Jackson ( WRYC ) encountered east winds of 50 KT 60 nmi to the north . After that , the system that was Nida continued to move northeast and weakened . Tropical Storm Omais : Omais followed Nida on a similar track south of Japan as a minimal tropical storm on May 21 , with maximum sustained winds of 35 KT with gusts to 45 KT . The cyclone then weakened to a tropical depression near 21N 136E at 0600 UTC May 22 , before becoming extratropical and merging with a frontal zone near 40N 150E two days later . By 0000 UTC May 27 the low- pressure area that was Omais redeveloped into a gale with a central pressure of 985 hPa just south of the western Aleutians . The system then tracked east-northeast , stalled and weakened in the central Gulf of Alaska late on May 29 . Super Typhoon Dianmu : Dianmu appeared on OPC 's Mercator oceanic analysis area near 16N 135E , or 1000 nmi south of Japan , at 1800 UTC June 16 with maximum sustained winds of 155 KT with gusts to 190 KT , the strongest typhoon of the period . The cyclone then tracked west-northwest , west of the area while gradually weakening , before recurving to the northeast on the 20th and weakening to a tropical storm near the southwest coast of Japan at 1800 UTC on June 20 . The President Trumani ( WNDP ) encountered southeast winds of 40 KT near 33N 136E six hours later . Dianmu then moved northeast into the Sea of Japan near 39N 138E at 1200 UTC on the 21st with maximum winds of 40 KT with gusts to 50 KT . The cyclone became an extratropical gale over northern Japan later on the 21st , followed by weakening in the Sea of Okhotsk on June 23 . The remains of Dianmu then dissipated over the northwest Bering Sea late on June 25 . Tropical Storm Mindulle : Tropical Depression 10W formed near 16N 144E at 0600 UTC June 23 and moved west-northwest , becoming Tropical Storm Mindulle six hours later with maximum sustained winds of 35 KT with gusts to 45 KT . The cyclone reached 17N 140E at 0000 UTC on the 24th before turning more southwest and passing west of 135E late on June 24 , with maximum sustained winds of 55 KT with gusts to 70 KT . Typhoon Tingting : Tingting entered OPC 's map area near 16N 146E as a minimal typhoon while moving northwest , and developed maximum sustained winds as high as 80 KT with gusts to 100 KT when the center was near 19N 144E at 1800 UTC June 28 . By month 's end an approaching cold front from the northwest turned Tingting more to the north . By 1200 UTC July 1 the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm near 30N 144E with maximum winds of 55 KT with gusts to 70 KT , and began a turn toward the northeast . Tingting weakened to an extratropical gale ( 990 h Pa ) near 38N 156E at 0000 UTC July 4 , and then re-intensified into a storm - force low with a central pressure as low as 980 hPa ( Figure 2 ) near 48N 164E , where it stalled . Some ship observations taken during the passage of Tingting are listed in Table 1 . The second part of Figure 2 shows only some ship reports of gale - force winds east of the front associated with extratropical Tingting , but the QuikSCAT image in Figure 3 has a 50 KT wind barb near 45N 167E , supporting the classification of the system as a storm . | OBSERVATION ||POSITION||DATA / TIME ( UTC ) ||WIND||SEAS ( M/FT ) | | Sea - Land Trader | ( KIRH ) | 35N 143E | |02/0000||NE 40 ||8.0/26 | | Brooklyn Bridge | ( 3EZJ9 ) | 36N 143E | |02/000||N 40 ||6.0/20 | | Aichi Maru | ( JEGI ) | 29N 149E||02/0900||S 35 | | Century Leader No. 3 | ( JADY ) | 33N 154E||03/0600 ||S 47||6.5/22 | | 33.5N 154E||03/1200||SW 50 | Table 1 . Some notable ship observations taken during Tropical Storm Tingting . The strong low that was Tingting then remained stationary and weakened to below gale strength early on July 6 , before becoming absorbed by a developing low passing to the south late on the same day . Typhoon Namtheun : Tropical Depression 13W formed near 23N 150E at 0600 UTC July 25 and moved northwest while rapidly intensifying , becoming Typhoon Namtheun only eighteen hours later near 25N 148E with maximum sustained winds of 65 KT with gusts to 80 KT . Namtheun attained a peak intensity of 115 KT sustained winds with gusts to 140 KT at 1800 UTC on the 26th when the center reached 27N 147E . Gradual weakening followed while the cyclone continued to move northwest , and Namtheun passed west of 135E , about 100 nmi south of Japan , as a strong tropical storm by month 's end , implying maximum sustained winds of 60 KT with gusts to 75 KT . The Bishu Marui ( JGAC ) encountered southeast winds of 40 KT near 30N 140E and 31N 140E at 1800 UTC July 29 and 0000 UTC July 30 , respectively . Namtheun later recurved northeast into the Sea of Japan and became extratropical west of northern Japan early on August 2 , before becoming absorbed by a larger low inland over Asia on the 3rd. Typhoon Meranti : Tropical Depression 14W formed near 19N 166E at 1800 UTC August 3 and intensified to a tropical storm six hours later while moving north . Tropical Storm 14W appears in the lower part of Figure 4 . The cyclone was named Meranti near 26N 166E at 0600 UTC August 5 and it continued to strengthen , becoming a typhoon six hours later near 27N 167E with maximum winds of 65 KT with gusts to 80 KT . The peak intensity came at 1800 UTC August 5 near 28N 167E , with maximum sustained winds of 90 KT and gusts to 110 KT . The cyclone then weakened to a tropical storm twenty - four hours later while turning more northeast into OPC 's high seas area ( Reference 2 ) , near 32N 170E . Meranti then continued to weaken and became extratropical near 38N 172E early on August 8 , where it stalled and later became absorbed by a larger Bering Sea low by the 13th . Tropical Depression 15W : This cyclone made a brief appearance , moving from west of the area into the Sea of Japan near 38N 135E at 0000 UTC August 5 ( Figure 4 ) with maximum winds of 30 KT with gusts to 40 KT . The cyclone moved northeast and became extratropical , and was absorbed by a frontal system over northern Japan on the 5th . Tropical Storm Malakas : A northeastward - moving weak low developed into Tropical Depression 17 W at 1800 UTC August 10 near 25N 156E , and Tropical Storm Malakas six hours later near 27N 158E . Following a track similar to that of Meranti , Malakas remained a minimal tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 35 KT and gusts to 45 KT , until becoming an extratropical gale near 33N 167E early on August 12 . The low that was Malakas then moved north into the Bering Sea and became absorbed by a larger Bering Sea system by the 15th . Tropical Depression 18W : This cyclone moved northwest to near 16N 143E at 0600 UTC August 14 with maximum winds 25 KT with gusts to 35 KT , and later passed west of 135E as a tropical depression early on the 15th . Tropical Storm Megi : Megi moved northeast into the Sea of Japan early on August 19 , to near 40N 136E at 1200 UTC on the 19th with maximum winds of 50 KT and gusts to 65 KT . Megi then became an extratropical storm six hours later in the northern Sea of Japan with a central pressure of 985 hPa. Figure 5 shows extratropical Megi as the 986 hPa compact storm crossing northern Japan . The Humber Bridgei ( JKRK ) reported a southwest wind of 50 KT near 40N 150E at 1200 UTC August 20 while the storm center passed 150 nmi to the northwest . The system then tracked east-northeast and weakened to a gale about 400 nmi south of the western Aleutians late on the 21st , and later ended up near the Queen Charlotte Islands on August 24 . Super Typhoon Chaba : Chaba moved northwest into OPC 's oceanic surface map area near 16N 141E early on August 23 as a super typhoon with maximum sustained winds of 155 KT and gusts to 190 KT , matching the intensity of Dianmu in June . Slow weakening followed , but the cyclone remained a super typhoon through 1200 UTC on the 25th , when the center was at 22N 137E . Typhoon Chaba then passed west of 135W , about 500 nmi south of Japan , at 1800 UTC August 26 with maximum winds of 110 KT and gusts to 135 KT . Chaba then passed over western Japan early on the 30th as a minimal typhoon before turning north into the Sea of Japan as a tropical storm . Figure 6 shows Tropical Storm Chaba losing tropical characteristics and becoming the extratropical storm ( 977 hPa ) in the second part of the figure , only twelve hours later . Table 2 has a listing of some notable reports , mostly from ships , taken during the passage of Chaba . | OBSERVATION || POSITION ||DATE / TIME ( UTC ) ||WIND ||SEAS ( m/ ft ) | | Northwest Shearwater | ( ZCAO7 ) | 28N 139E||28/1800 ||S 40 | | Cho Yang Atlas | ( DQVH ) | 33N 134E| |30/1200||S 50 ||12.0/39 | | OOCL Fedelity | ( VRWG5 ) | 34N 139E | |30/1800 ||S 45 | | Polar Eagle | ( ELPT3 ) | 34N 140E||31/0000 ||S 45 | | Martorell | ( HPNE ) | 36N 143E| |31/0000 ||S 40 ||5.0/16 | | Hanjin Pretoria | ( A8CP6 ) | 41N 147E||31/1200||SW 35||7.5/25 | | Buoy 21600||33.5N 136.8E||30/1500 ||8.0/26 | Table 2 . List of selected observations taken during passage of Tropical Cyclone Chaba . Typhoon Songda : Rapidly intensifying Typhoon Songda appeared near 16N 150E at 1800 UTC August 30 while moving northwest , with maximum sustained winds of 95 KT and gusts to 115 KT . By month 's end the cyclone was near 18N 147E with maximum winds up to 130 KT and gusts up to 160 KT . See Figure 6 . Also see the next issue of MWL ( April 2005 ) for more information on this typhoon which persisted into September . Other Significant Events Western North Pacific Storm , May 2 - 3 : A low- pressure area moved east from near northern Japan early on May 1 and intensified into a storm near 45N 165E with a 981 hPa central pressure at 1200 UTC May 2 , before looping to the southeast . The central pressure reached 979 hPa as the center crossed 43N 167E at 0600 UTC on the 3rd . The ship Sea - Land Racer ( MCDW2 ) ( 40N 162E ) encountered northwest winds xi of 45 KT at that time . The system then drifted east and weakened . Northwest Pacific Storm of August 4 - 5 : This system developed from a frontal wave of low pressure inland over northeast China late on August 3 and rapidly intensified into the 974 hPa storm shown in the Sea of Okhotsk ( Figure 4 ) . The cyclone was deepest six hours later when the center was analyzed with a 973 hPa central pressure , unusually intense for early August . The QuikSCAT image of the storm in Figure 7 was even more impressive , showing winds of 50 to as high as 80 KT north and northwest of the center at a time several hours before the valid time of the second part of Figure 4 . It is very unusual to get hurricane - force winds in a non-tropical system in summer . The Sioux ( WBN7617 ) reported west winds of 52 KT near 51N 144E at 2100 UTC August 4 . Another ship , UCEF , encountered south winds of 50 KT near 57N 156E fifteen hours later . This storm was short -lived , and moved quickly into eastern Russia and weakened rapidly by August 6 . Western North Pacific Storm of August 19 - 20 : Figure 5 depicts this development which was relatively far south for late summer , at the latitude of Japan . The 998 hPa low near 41N 158E deepened 23 hPa in 24 hours , resulting in the relatively compact 975 hPa storm in the second part of Figure 5 . Ship reports were sparse in the area . The cyclone then deepened slightly to 973 hPa in the following twenty - four hours while turning northeast , but winds decreased to gale force as the circulation of the low expanded in area . The system then stalled near the central Aleutians and weakened late on August 21 . References 1 .

Bancroft , National Center for Environmental Prediction Typhoon Nida : Nida entered OPC 's oceanic area for ( Mercator ) radiofacsimile charts near 29N 136E at 1200 UTC May 20 with maximum sustained winds of 80 KT and gusts to 100 KT . The cyclone moved northeast and weakened to a tropical storm six hours later . By 0600 UTC on the 21st Nida was about 250 nmi northeast of Tokyo with maximum winds 45 KT with gusts to 55 KT , about to become extratropical . Figure 1 shows Typhoon Nida approaching a frontal zone and becoming an extratropical storm at 1200 UTC May 21 east of Japan . While Nida was still a typhoon , the Mokihanai ( WNRD ) encountered southwest winds of 50 KT and 10.5 m seas ( 35 ft ) near 22N 132E at 0000 UTC May 20 . The vessel CMA CGM Alabama ( DGGV ) ( 24N 137E ) reported south winds of 40 KT and 6.5 m seas ( 21 ft ) six hours later . The Sea- Land Reliance ( WFLH ) reported east winds of 45 KT near 39N 149E at 0000 UTC on the 21st , and east winds at 50 KT near 41N 153E twelve hours later . The extratropical storm attained a central pressure of 988 h Pa near 40N 148E at 1800 UTC May 21 , when the President Jackson ( WRYC ) encountered east winds of 50 KT 60 nmi to the north . After that , the system that was Nida continued to move northeast and weakened . Tropical Storm Omais : Omais followed Nida on a similar track south of Japan as a minimal tropical storm on May 21 , with maximum sustained winds of 35 KT with gusts to 45 KT . The cyclone then weakened to a tropical depression near 21N 136E at 0600 UTC May 22 , before becoming extratropical and merging with a frontal zone near 40N 150E two days later . By 0000 UTC May 27 the low- pressure area that was Omais redeveloped into a gale with a central pressure of 985 hPa just south of the western Aleutians . The system then tracked east-northeast , stalled and weakened in the central Gulf of Alaska late on May 29 . Super Typhoon Dianmu : Dianmu appeared on OPC 's Mercator oceanic analysis area near 16N 135E , or 1000 nmi south of Japan , at 1800 UTC June 16 with maximum sustained winds of 155 KT with gusts to 190 KT , the strongest typhoon of the period . The cyclone then tracked west-northwest , west of the area while gradually weakening , before recurving to the northeast on the 20th and weakening to a tropical storm near the southwest coast of Japan at 1800 UTC on June 20 . The President Trumani ( WNDP ) encountered southeast winds of 40 KT near 33N 136E six hours later . Dianmu then moved northeast into the Sea of Japan near 39N 138E at 1200 UTC on the 21st with maximum winds of 40 KT with gusts to 50 KT . The cyclone became an extratropical gale over northern Japan later on the 21st , followed by weakening in the Sea of Okhotsk on June 23 . The remains of Dianmu then dissipated over the northwest Bering Sea late on June 25 . Tropical Storm Mindulle : Tropical Depression 10W formed near 16N 144E at 0600 UTC June 23 and moved west-northwest , becoming Tropical Storm Mindulle six hours later with maximum sustained winds of 35 KT with gusts to 45 KT . The cyclone reached 17N 140E at 0000 UTC on the 24th before turning more southwest and passing west of 135E late on June 24 , with maximum sustained winds of 55 KT with gusts to 70 KT . Typhoon Tingting : Tingting entered OPC 's map area near 16N 146E as a minimal typhoon while moving northwest , and developed maximum sustained winds as high as 80 KT with gusts to 100 KT when the center was near 19N 144E at 1800 UTC June 28 . By month 's end an approaching cold front from the northwest turned Tingting more to the north . By 1200 UTC July 1 the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm near 30N 144E with maximum winds of 55 KT with gusts to 70 KT , and began a turn toward the northeast . Tingting weakened to an extratropical gale ( 990 h Pa ) near 38N 156E at 0000 UTC July 4 , and then re-intensified into a storm - force low with a central pressure as low as 980 hPa ( Figure 2 ) near 48N 164E , where it stalled . Some ship observations taken during the passage of Tingting are listed in Table 1 . The second part of Figure 2 shows only some ship reports of gale - force winds east of the front associated with extratropical Tingting , but the QuikSCAT image in Figure 3 has a 50 KT wind barb near 45N 167E , supporting the classification of the system as a storm . | OBSERVATION ||POSITION||DATA / TIME ( UTC ) ||WIND||SEAS ( M/FT ) | | Sea - Land Trader | ( KIRH ) | 35N 143E | |02/0000||NE 40 ||8.0/26 | | Brooklyn Bridge | ( 3EZJ9 ) | 36N 143E | |02/000||N 40 ||6.0/20 | | Aichi Maru | ( JEGI ) | 29N 149E||02/0900||S 35 | | Century Leader No. 3 | ( JADY ) | 33N 154E||03/0600 ||S 47||6.5/22 | | 33.5N 154E||03/1200||SW 50 | Table 1 . Some notable ship observations taken during Tropical Storm Tingting . The strong low that was Tingting then remained stationary and weakened to below gale strength early on July 6 , before becoming absorbed by a developing low passing to the south late on the same day . Typhoon Namtheun : Tropical Depression 13W formed near 23N 150E at 0600 UTC July 25 and moved northwest while rapidly intensifying , becoming Typhoon Namtheun only eighteen hours later near 25N 148E with maximum sustained winds of 65 KT with gusts to 80 KT . Namtheun attained a peak intensity of 115 KT sustained winds with gusts to 140 KT at 1800 UTC on the 26th when the center reached 27N 147E . Gradual weakening followed while the cyclone continued to move northwest , and Namtheun passed west of 135E , about 100 nmi south of Japan , as a strong tropical storm by month 's end , implying maximum sustained winds of 60 KT with gusts to 75 KT . The Bishu Marui ( JGAC ) encountered southeast winds of 40 KT near 30N 140E and 31N 140E at 1800 UTC July 29 and 0000 UTC July 30 , respectively . Namtheun later recurved northeast into the Sea of Japan and became extratropical west of northern Japan early on August 2 , before becoming absorbed by a larger low inland over Asia on the 3rd. Typhoon Meranti : Tropical Depression 14W formed near 19N 166E at 1800 UTC August 3 and intensified to a tropical storm six hours later while moving north . Tropical Storm 14W appears in the lower part of Figure 4 . The cyclone was named Meranti near 26N 166E at 0600 UTC August 5 and it continued to strengthen , becoming a typhoon six hours later near 27N 167E with maximum winds of 65 KT with gusts to 80 KT . The peak intensity came at 1800 UTC August 5 near 28N 167E , with maximum sustained winds of 90 KT and gusts to 110 KT . The cyclone then weakened to a tropical storm twenty - four hours later while turning more northeast into OPC 's high seas area ( Reference 2 ) , near 32N 170E . Meranti then continued to weaken and became extratropical near 38N 172E early on August 8 , where it stalled and later became absorbed by a larger Bering Sea low by the 13th . Tropical Depression 15W : This cyclone made a brief appearance , moving from west of the area into the Sea of Japan near 38N 135E at 0000 UTC August 5 ( Figure 4 ) with maximum winds of 30 KT with gusts to 40 KT . The cyclone moved northeast and became extratropical , and was absorbed by a frontal system over northern Japan on the 5th . Tropical Storm Malakas : A northeastward - moving weak low developed into Tropical Depression 17 W at 1800 UTC August 10 near 25N 156E , and Tropical Storm Malakas six hours later near 27N 158E . Following a track similar to that of Meranti , Malakas remained a minimal tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 35 KT and gusts to 45 KT , until becoming an extratropical gale near 33N 167E early on August 12 . The low that was Malakas then moved north into the Bering Sea and became absorbed by a larger Bering Sea system by the 15th . Tropical Depression 18W : This cyclone moved northwest to near 16N 143E at 0600 UTC August 14 with maximum winds 25 KT with gusts to 35 KT , and later passed west of 135E as a tropical depression early on the 15th . Tropical Storm Megi : Megi moved northeast into the Sea of Japan early on August 19 , to near 40N 136E at 1200 UTC on the 19th with maximum winds of 50 KT and gusts to 65 KT . Megi then became an extratropical storm six hours later in the northern Sea of Japan with a central pressure of 985 hPa. Figure 5 shows extratropical Megi as the 986 hPa compact storm crossing northern Japan . The Humber Bridgei ( JKRK ) reported a southwest wind of 50 KT near 40N 150E at 1200 UTC August 20 while the storm center passed 150 nmi to the northwest . The system then tracked east-northeast and weakened to a gale about 400 nmi south of the western Aleutians late on the 21st , and later ended up near the Queen Charlotte Islands on August 24 . Super Typhoon Chaba : Chaba moved northwest into OPC 's oceanic surface map area near 16N 141E early on August 23 as a super typhoon with maximum sustained winds of 155 KT and gusts to 190 KT , matching the intensity of Dianmu in June . Slow weakening followed , but the cyclone remained a super typhoon through 1200 UTC on the 25th , when the center was at 22N 137E . Typhoon Chaba then passed west of 135W , about 500 nmi south of Japan , at 1800 UTC August 26 with maximum winds of 110 KT and gusts to 135 KT . Chaba then passed over western Japan early on the 30th as a minimal typhoon before turning north into the Sea of Japan as a tropical storm . Figure 6 shows Tropical Storm Chaba losing tropical characteristics and becoming the extratropical storm ( 977 hPa ) in the second part of the figure , only twelve hours later . Table 2 has a listing of some notable reports , mostly from ships , taken during the passage of Chaba . | OBSERVATION || POSITION ||DATE / TIME ( UTC ) ||WIND ||SEAS ( m/ ft ) | | Northwest Shearwater | ( ZCAO7 ) | 28N 139E||28/1800 ||S 40 | | Cho Yang Atlas | ( DQVH ) | 33N 134E| |30/1200||S 50 ||12.0/39 | | OOCL Fedelity | ( VRWG5 ) | 34N 139E | |30/1800 ||S 45 | | Polar Eagle | ( ELPT3 ) | 34N 140E||31/0000 ||S 45 | | Martorell | ( HPNE ) | 36N 143E| |31/0000 ||S 40 ||5.0/16 | | Hanjin Pretoria | ( A8CP6 ) | 41N 147E||31/1200||SW 35||7.5/25 | | Buoy 21600||33.5N 136.8E||30/1500 ||8.0/26 | Table 2 . List of selected observations taken during passage of Tropical Cyclone Chaba . Typhoon Songda : Rapidly intensifying Typhoon Songda appeared near 16N 150E at 1800 UTC August 30 while moving northwest , with maximum sustained winds of 95 KT and gusts to 115 KT . By month 's end the cyclone was near 18N 147E with maximum winds up to 130 KT and gusts up to 160 KT . See Figure 6 . Also see the next issue of MWL ( April 2005 ) for more information on this typhoon which persisted into September . Other Significant Events Western North Pacific Storm , May 2 - 3 : A low- pressure area moved east from near northern Japan early on May 1 and intensified into a storm near 45N 165E with a 981 hPa central pressure at 1200 UTC May 2 , before looping to the southeast . The central pressure reached 979 hPa as the center crossed 43N 167E at 0600 UTC on the 3rd . The ship Sea - Land Racer ( MCDW2 ) ( 40N 162E ) encountered northwest winds xi of 45 KT at that time . The system then drifted east and weakened . Northwest Pacific Storm of August 4 - 5 : This system developed from a frontal wave of low pressure inland over northeast China late on August 3 and rapidly intensified into the 974 hPa storm shown in the Sea of Okhotsk ( Figure 4 ) . The cyclone was deepest six hours later when the center was analyzed with a 973 hPa central pressure , unusually intense for early August . The QuikSCAT image of the storm in Figure 7 was even more impressive , showing winds of 50 to as high as 80 KT north and northwest of the center at a time several hours before the valid time of the second part of Figure 4 . It is very unusual to get hurricane - force winds in a non-tropical system in summer . The Sioux ( WBN7617 ) reported west winds of 52 KT near 51N 144E at 2100 UTC August 4 . Another ship , UCEF , encountered south winds of 50 KT near 57N 156E fifteen hours later . This storm was short -lived , and moved quickly into eastern Russia and weakened rapidly by August 6 . Western North Pacific Storm of August 19 - 20 : Figure 5 depicts this development which was relatively far south for late summer , at the latitude of Japan . The 998 hPa low near 41N 158E deepened 23 hPa in 24 hours , resulting in the relatively compact 975 hPa storm in the second part of Figure 5 . Ship reports were sparse in the area . The cyclone then deepened slightly to 973 hPa in the following twenty - four hours while turning northeast , but winds decreased to gale force as the circulation of the low expanded in area . The system then stalled near the central Aleutians and weakened late on August 21 . References 1 .

For several decades of contemporary Amman 's existence , this center constituted the whole of Amman . Even when the city grew , the center retained its distinguishing feature as a public sphere in which all of the capital 's residents would gather , as well as all of the arrivals from different areas of the country . Here , there were relatively splendid hotels and Faisal square , in which celebrations and public shows were held . Here was Al - Husseini mosque , in which the king would lead Friday prayer amid a throng of people . Here was the Roman Theater and its various events such as wrestling and boxing matches , in which Fairuz sang , and where an ice-skating show was held ! Similarly , the national celebration of the victory of the Algerian revolution was also held there . And in this center , markets were established and were frequented by all classes of society . Until recently , for example , the gold market in Al - Shabsough area still attracted the brides of Amman . Likewise , the rest of the markets that later took the name \u201c popular markets \u201d were previously just considered central markets . It was also here that the first market following the emergence of the poverty phenomenon in Amman was established . It is called the \u201c Yamaniya Market , \u201d and it started as a marketplace for secondhand European clothes that piqued people 's curiosity and their imaginations , and continued to the present with a short interruption of two years . The interruption was due to the new market owner 's attempt to transform it into a modern marketplace like the rest of the nearby markets . He put a large sign up bearing a new name . Longtime workers remember however , that customers refused the market name change via a popular protest that was neither organized nor officially announced , and that manifested as a boycott of the shops in the new market . This hindered the attempt to replace the market 's content , which soon recovered its characteristics , and these remain essentially the same to this day . Slowly , but notably , Amman began to flee from its center , which took shape as the \u201c bottom of the city . \u201d This term , when referring to Amman , was a new terminology . The city was alienating itself from its center and exalting itself from it . It is true that , from an early period , a number of markets were established in parts of central Amman with marginal ( urban ) activity : the Halal market was established to buy and sell livestock near Ras Al - Ain , then the Al - Haddada and Al - Samkara markets were established . A market for street vendors was set up , and recently became known as \u201c Al - Jora , \u201d as well as a market commonly called \u201c Souq Al - Haramia , \u201d in which the business of selling used commodities spread . However , the center of the city remained a generally active and popular place for different residents in the 1970s and for most of the 1980s . In the \u201c public mind \u201d of Amman residents and Jordanians generally , the city was united to a great degree at that time . It should be noted that at the start of the 1980s , journalist Fakhri Kawar wrote an article titled \u201c East Amman and West Amman . \u201d The title alone was guaranteed to provoke a storm of protest and intense debate about the matter , due to the strangeness of that characterization at the time . According to the late novelist Abdelrahman Munif , who wrote in his book , \u201c Story of a City : Amman in the 1940s \u201d , the most beautiful and accurate description of Amman at that time , the marginalized people of Amman were a major and present part of the life of all social classes . The Adaptability of the Marginalized The preceding paragraphs are not a precise history of the center of Amman , but they are an attempt to pave the way for the subject of this article , namely the shifts in marginalization in Amman 's center during the last few years . The press archive clarifies that at the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s , a broad debate revolved around the problem of Amman 's center , and especially the issue of public transportation and public and private modes of transportation . As part of confronting the problem , the Raghadan Transportation Complex was established in 1974 and hosted many transportation routes , especially those that connect the center of the capital to the southern and eastern regions , including Zarqa and Al - Rasifa and their villages and camps . I still maintain the detailed written description that I wrote in 1997 about socio-economic life on the popular level in the Amman center area , specifically in the area extending between the ( old ) Raghadan Tourist Complex and the \u201c Saqif Al - Sail \u201d area . This was in the context of a scientific anthropological study that discussed the informal \u201c marginalized \u201d economy in that location . At the time , life proceeded in this place 24 hours a day , especially in the space stretching between the Raghadan Tourist Complex and the Hashemite Plaza , arriving at the Al- Husseini Mosque . Transportation service east to Zarqa was continuous and available non-stop , including medium size buses , and restaurants offered their services to customers perpetually as well . During this period , arrivals from Iraq after the Gulf War ( 1991 ) and the years of siege that followed distinguished the public scene of central Amman . Since a large number of Egyptian migrant workers were living there , the Iraqi and Egyptian elements blended together . Naturally , the Iraqis in this place were not generally from affluent sections of the population , so they joined working - class Amman residents in settling their families in nearby areas and overlooking hills . During field research that lasted nine months , I was able to survey the social components of this area . Since my research targeted the informal sector and especially street vendors in the area , I became acquainted with the degree of complexity of the internal organization of this popular market , which extends along the pavements and sidewalks of the streets . The marginalized people of the city were greatly present in this space on all weekdays , especially on Friday , which forms the peak of their activity . During that time , the whole area took shape and reshaped itself to assist the changes taking place . Every morning , the area witnessed the movement of hundreds of thousands of citizens , just as it saw their return in the evening . In response , the market sought to match their needs , and this effort included the formal and informal sectors . Thus , as required services and shops were set up , vegetable stands became numerous at the last spots before people climbed onto buses and taxis . That way , customers did n't have to carry their purchases for long distances . In the westernmost part of the area , at the end of \u201c Saqif Al - Sail , \u201d there is a relatively large plaza located next to the public street , which drops by two meters in some places . Called \u201c Al - Jora , \u201d it is the biggest market for street vendors . At the start of the 1980s , the vendors were ordered to leave the area due to the need to build a commercial building there . Another space was allocated for them , located exactly at the east of the Al - Mahatta bridge , and a building was erected there . It was divided into \u201c numbers , \u201d and the space of each was six square meters . These were distributed to the owners of the street vendor stands expelled from \u201c Al - Jora . \u201d And with this , one of the first sites of marginalization to the east was established , and would expand later . However , \u201c Al - Jora \u201d remained empty , and the construction of the commercial building did not begin until 2018 , 45 years since the evacuation of the original street vendors . During that time , other marginalized activities were undertaken in \u201c Al - Jora , \u201d especially the business of selling secondhand goods . It was also occasionally used as a taxi parking lot , and in some years , vendors were permitted to set up stands there in exchange for fees . The \u201c Solidere \u201d Project of Amman From the beginning of the 2000s , the scene changed gradually but continuously . In 2003 , the Greater Amman Municipality announced the launch of a project to rebuild the Raghadan Complex with a Japanese grant of eight million dinars . For this purpose , the place was sealed with metal fences , and the Municipality allocated three years to finish the project . During that time , necessary facilities were built in the public space located near Al - Mahatta bridge in eastern central Amman to gather traffic temporarily , in anticipation of the Raghadan Complex 's completion . Indeed , after three years , the completion of the project was announced . The metal fences were removed , and May 25 , 2006 ( Independence Day ) was set as the inauguration of the project . But days before the set date , Omar Al - Ma'ani , the mayor of Amman at the time , announced the cancellation of the inauguration , and then the repeal of the idea of the Complex itself . At the time , it was said that the large ultra-modern building would be rehabilitated for tourism purposes , and it was said literally that the center of the capital must not be just a corridor for road crossings and users of public transportation . During those three years , many people readied themselves to respond to the return of the Complex . They constructed new buildings , merchants updated their existing shops , and the owners of licensed kiosks signed new contracts with the Municipality , which allocated places for them in the new building . Thus , the relinquishment of the Raghadan Complex constituted a surprise to many , and entered everyone in a debate that resulted in instances of protest that included the formal and informal sectors . Thereafter , the Municipality implemented a series of measures . Among these was permitting people to use the complex as a parking lot , and an attempt to redirect some traffic routes to it . This measure failed immediately , despite the pressures and police intervention , and the Municipality issued more than one promise to resolve the plight of market vendors . Subsequently , the most prominent plan the Municipality announced had the objective of comprising Raghadan Complex in a massive project spread over 400 dunams . It was to be made up of the island located between Al - Mahatta street and Al - Jaish street , which begins at the historical Amman Municipality building ( the public library now ) and ends at Al - Mahatta bridge . At first , the project was called \u201c Solidere Amman , \u201d named after the Solidere company , which built a similar project in the old center of Beirut . The old Municipality building was even going to be transformed into a hotel . The project also consisted of markets , cafes , wide pools , and expensive residential buildings . On its website , the Municipality provided photo models of the project , and called it \u201c Wadi Amman \u201d ( Amman Valley ) , which was to be part of a larger project carrying the name \u201c Sahin Amman \u201d ( Plate of Amman ) . It included all of central Amman , which comprises most of the city 's roots . The Municipality did indeed undertake a wide appropriation of land , and demolished many facilities and terminated the licenses of many workshops and stores located within the area of the project . Work on the project stopped once again , and then the whole framework of ideas that took the name \u201c comprehensive Amman plan \u201d collapsed . The department that formed the factory for all of those ideas ( Urban Amman Institute ) was terminated , and the activities of its famous director Jerry Post , who came from the Canadian Bearing Point company , were halted . Modern Ruins On the periphery of this modernization drama in central Amman , people with a vested interest in this place were not on the mind of the city planner nor on that of the executor of the plans . People were , in reality , the last to know and the first to be injured . And these people include large swathes of the business sector and its various industries , since the area counts as a base for the food supplies business generally . Also within the area there is a concentration of the oldest central markets for vegetables , clothes , and secondhand clothes . The area is a core place for the informal commercial and service sector , via hundreds of street vendors ( thousands during the peak time ) , and a specialized market for the Asian migrant workforce , especially on Friday . This is because it contains much of the secondhand business in Amman , especially that of the furniture sector . On top of that , the shopping public , whether daily commuters or visitors of the town center , makes a habit of depending on this market . The closure of the Raghadan Complex in 2003 represented a point of clear transformation , and which immediately split \u201c Wast Al - Balad \u201d ( the city center ) into two primary sections : east of Al - Husseini mosque and west of Al - Husseini mosque . The impact is focused on the east of the mosque , since the traffic that ran to and from the Raghadan Complex and that used to attract activity and various jobs stopped . In 2009 , the Municipality executed a project to redesign and rebuild the Hashemite Plaza . For this purpose , it shuttered numerous restaurants and cafes that were open 24 hours in order to serve the needs of their visitors and especially those of migrants . This is at odds with the situation today , because today these businesses are popular with families . Gradually , but notably and hasteningly , silence prevailed in this lively area . Though an observer from afar could believe that the people had moved to the new complex in Al - Mahatta , this complex now sees quiet since the first hours of the evening , and the activity within it has no comparison with that of the previous Raghadan Complex . So where did the people disappear to ? This question was not asked by the city planner nor by the decision maker . However , the city planner began to bemoan the traffic in other locations . This traffic was a result of the transportation choices that people made in response to the malfunction that these changes brought about . The modes of transportation of residents became fragmented . For example , the decision makers did not notice that despite the gradual increase in the number of residents in the capital , the number of cars active on the \u201c Service \u201d routes towards East Amman shrank , since the drivers used their public car licenses to work in other locations . If someone walked to Al - Mahatta street , ( King Abdullah I Street ) in the area between Raghadan Tourist Complex and Al - Nasha bridge , and took a long look to their right , towards the area where the Municipality proposed to place its fanciful plans ( restaurants , hotels , swimming pools , markets , playgrounds and recreation ) , their eye would receive many scenes of what would appear to be ruins . The Municipality did not have the time to remove the majority of them after it had appropriated and demolished the establishments and old buildings . As usual , the adaptability of poor workers in the informal sector allowed them to spread and to respread continuously in empty urban spaces , and this is indeed what occurred in this area . Between the places that vacated , a space was formed . It is located between Al - Mahatta complex for transportation , \u201c the new complex , \u201d and between the secondhand clothes market of Al - Mahatta , which was established in 1984 after the evacuation of secondhand clothes sellers from \u201c Al - Jora \u201d area in Saqif Al - Sail , as I mentioned . Activity located on the margin of the margin quickly spread to it , represented by dozens of tool stands and semi-damaged goods that were usually gathered by dumpster divers , brought to the market , reclassified , and presented to poor customers of the surrounding area , and the poor last users of public transportation . Meeting Again The recently persecuted and marginalized and laid off from the center of Amman gradually met in a nearby location which soon united , and quickly formed the biggest market for simple secondhand goods . These products are usually abandoned where they lie by their owners if no one is found to buy them . One example is makeup tools and used red lipstick . Naturally , another activity emerged comprising of stands selling unassembled parts , which enable the expert customer to gather the complementing parts they need . When I undertook the first study of the informal sector in 1997/1998 , the number of \u201c dumpster divers \u201d was limited and they hardly knew one another . They were called \u201c night divers \u201d as opposed to \u201c day divers , \u201d who gathered furniture and used tools from houses . Night dumpster diving began after midnight and ended at sunrise in the known streets , and one or two people specialized in each street . That was before this activity grew to include the dumpsters of all neighborhoods of the capital and many shifts daily . Dumpster diving was no longer limited to nighttime . Persecution campaigns against the marginalized have not stopped in central Amman in twenty years . Despite the perseverance of the marginalized , they do n't have the power to negotiate , and therefore they never grow weary of responding in a pragmatic way . So they modify their ways of work , and some of them might move to the mountains , and many work in the licensed popular markets on some days of the week , and they might switch the type of goods or services that they work in . The decision maker of central Amman sees a decline in human presence there , and believes that the development plan succeeded , but he does not ask : where did the people go ? To be fair , some of the urban and administrative changes promoted other significant activity in the center of Amman . This is represented by the great number of popular cafes . Professor of architecture Rami Dahir describes this as \u201c Bab Al - Hara Decorations , \u201d the famous Syrian series , because in his opinion it does not reflect a particular popular dimension . Less than a year ago , I visited an old man who has worked as a shoemaker in central Amman for more than a half century . Thanks to his career , he knows the types of passersby and pedestrians in central Amman . He said to me : the people that we know disappeared , and they are not passing by anymore .","annotations":[{"text":"Amman","span":[43,47],"token_span":[8,8],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location that the change takes place."},{"text":"in the 1960s","span":[155,166],"token_span":[26,28],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the Entity undergoes the transformation."},{"text":"markets","span":[1177,1183],"token_span":[218,218],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The concrete or abstract entity that undergoes a change."},{"text":"by all classes of society","span":[1222,1246],"token_span":[224,228],"role":"Attribute","label":"Attribute","role_definition":"A characteristic of the Entity for which a quality can be assigned or determined by calculation, measurement, or observation."},{"text":"\u201c popular markets","span":[1418,1434],"token_span":[263,265],"role":"Final_category","label":"Final_category","role_definition":"The type of Entity that results from the change."},{"text":"central markets","span":[1470,1484],"token_span":[271,272],"role":"Initial_category","label":"Initial_category","role_definition":"The category that the Entity belongs to before it undergoes the change."},{"text":"a marketplace for secondhand European clothes","span":[1661,1705],"token_span":[307,312],"role":"Final_quality","label":"Final_quality","role_definition":"The quality of the Attribute that results from the change."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"Markets in the Balad were trafficked by Ammanis of all stripes throughout most of the 20th century .

For several decades of contemporary Amman 's existence , this center constituted the whole of Amman . Even when the city grew , the center retained its distinguishing feature as a public sphere in which all of the capital 's residents would gather , as well as all of the arrivals from different areas of the country . Here , there were relatively splendid hotels and Faisal square , in which celebrations and public shows were held . Here was Al - Husseini mosque , in which the king would lead Friday prayer amid a throng of people . Here was the Roman Theater and its various events such as wrestling and boxing matches , in which Fairuz sang , and where an ice-skating show was held ! Similarly , the national celebration of the victory of the Algerian revolution was also held there . And in this center , markets were established and were frequented by all classes of society . Until recently , for example , the gold market in Al - Shabsough area still attracted the brides of Amman . Likewise , the rest of the markets that later took the name \u201c popular markets \u201d were previously just considered central markets . It was also here that the first market following the emergence of the poverty phenomenon in Amman was established . It is called the \u201c Yamaniya Market , \u201d and it started as a marketplace for secondhand European clothes that piqued people 's curiosity and their imaginations , and continued to the present with a short interruption of two years . The interruption was due to the new market owner 's attempt to transform it into a modern marketplace like the rest of the nearby markets . He put a large sign up bearing a new name . Longtime workers remember however , that customers refused the market name change via a popular protest that was neither organized nor officially announced , and that manifested as a boycott of the shops in the new market . This hindered the attempt to replace the market 's content , which soon recovered its characteristics , and these remain essentially the same to this day . Slowly , but notably , Amman began to flee from its center , which took shape as the \u201c bottom of the city . \u201d This term , when referring to Amman , was a new terminology . The city was alienating itself from its center and exalting itself from it . It is true that , from an early period , a number of markets were established in parts of central Amman with marginal ( urban ) activity : the Halal market was established to buy and sell livestock near Ras Al - Ain , then the Al - Haddada and Al - Samkara markets were established . A market for street vendors was set up , and recently became known as \u201c Al - Jora , \u201d as well as a market commonly called \u201c Souq Al - Haramia , \u201d in which the business of selling used commodities spread . However , the center of the city remained a generally active and popular place for different residents in the 1970s and for most of the 1980s . In the \u201c public mind \u201d of Amman residents and Jordanians generally , the city was united to a great degree at that time . It should be noted that at the start of the 1980s , journalist Fakhri Kawar wrote an article titled \u201c East Amman and West Amman . \u201d The title alone was guaranteed to provoke a storm of protest and intense debate about the matter , due to the strangeness of that characterization at the time . According to the late novelist Abdelrahman Munif , who wrote in his book , \u201c Story of a City : Amman in the 1940s \u201d , the most beautiful and accurate description of Amman at that time , the marginalized people of Amman were a major and present part of the life of all social classes . The Adaptability of the Marginalized The preceding paragraphs are not a precise history of the center of Amman , but they are an attempt to pave the way for the subject of this article , namely the shifts in marginalization in Amman 's center during the last few years . The press archive clarifies that at the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s , a broad debate revolved around the problem of Amman 's center , and especially the issue of public transportation and public and private modes of transportation . As part of confronting the problem , the Raghadan Transportation Complex was established in 1974 and hosted many transportation routes , especially those that connect the center of the capital to the southern and eastern regions , including Zarqa and Al - Rasifa and their villages and camps . I still maintain the detailed written description that I wrote in 1997 about socio-economic life on the popular level in the Amman center area , specifically in the area extending between the ( old ) Raghadan Tourist Complex and the \u201c Saqif Al - Sail \u201d area . This was in the context of a scientific anthropological study that discussed the informal \u201c marginalized \u201d economy in that location . At the time , life proceeded in this place 24 hours a day , especially in the space stretching between the Raghadan Tourist Complex and the Hashemite Plaza , arriving at the Al- Husseini Mosque . Transportation service east to Zarqa was continuous and available non-stop , including medium size buses , and restaurants offered their services to customers perpetually as well . During this period , arrivals from Iraq after the Gulf War ( 1991 ) and the years of siege that followed distinguished the public scene of central Amman . Since a large number of Egyptian migrant workers were living there , the Iraqi and Egyptian elements blended together . Naturally , the Iraqis in this place were not generally from affluent sections of the population , so they joined working - class Amman residents in settling their families in nearby areas and overlooking hills . During field research that lasted nine months , I was able to survey the social components of this area . Since my research targeted the informal sector and especially street vendors in the area , I became acquainted with the degree of complexity of the internal organization of this popular market , which extends along the pavements and sidewalks of the streets . The marginalized people of the city were greatly present in this space on all weekdays , especially on Friday , which forms the peak of their activity . During that time , the whole area took shape and reshaped itself to assist the changes taking place . Every morning , the area witnessed the movement of hundreds of thousands of citizens , just as it saw their return in the evening . In response , the market sought to match their needs , and this effort included the formal and informal sectors . Thus , as required services and shops were set up , vegetable stands became numerous at the last spots before people climbed onto buses and taxis . That way , customers did n't have to carry their purchases for long distances . In the westernmost part of the area , at the end of \u201c Saqif Al - Sail , \u201d there is a relatively large plaza located next to the public street , which drops by two meters in some places . Called \u201c Al - Jora , \u201d it is the biggest market for street vendors . At the start of the 1980s , the vendors were ordered to leave the area due to the need to build a commercial building there . Another space was allocated for them , located exactly at the east of the Al - Mahatta bridge , and a building was erected there . It was divided into \u201c numbers , \u201d and the space of each was six square meters . These were distributed to the owners of the street vendor stands expelled from \u201c Al - Jora . \u201d And with this , one of the first sites of marginalization to the east was established , and would expand later . However , \u201c Al - Jora \u201d remained empty , and the construction of the commercial building did not begin until 2018 , 45 years since the evacuation of the original street vendors . During that time , other marginalized activities were undertaken in \u201c Al - Jora , \u201d especially the business of selling secondhand goods . It was also occasionally used as a taxi parking lot , and in some years , vendors were permitted to set up stands there in exchange for fees . The \u201c Solidere \u201d Project of Amman From the beginning of the 2000s , the scene changed gradually but continuously . In 2003 , the Greater Amman Municipality announced the launch of a project to rebuild the Raghadan Complex with a Japanese grant of eight million dinars . For this purpose , the place was sealed with metal fences , and the Municipality allocated three years to finish the project . During that time , necessary facilities were built in the public space located near Al - Mahatta bridge in eastern central Amman to gather traffic temporarily , in anticipation of the Raghadan Complex 's completion . Indeed , after three years , the completion of the project was announced . The metal fences were removed , and May 25 , 2006 ( Independence Day ) was set as the inauguration of the project . But days before the set date , Omar Al - Ma'ani , the mayor of Amman at the time , announced the cancellation of the inauguration , and then the repeal of the idea of the Complex itself . At the time , it was said that the large ultra-modern building would be rehabilitated for tourism purposes , and it was said literally that the center of the capital must not be just a corridor for road crossings and users of public transportation . During those three years , many people readied themselves to respond to the return of the Complex . They constructed new buildings , merchants updated their existing shops , and the owners of licensed kiosks signed new contracts with the Municipality , which allocated places for them in the new building . Thus , the relinquishment of the Raghadan Complex constituted a surprise to many , and entered everyone in a debate that resulted in instances of protest that included the formal and informal sectors . Thereafter , the Municipality implemented a series of measures . Among these was permitting people to use the complex as a parking lot , and an attempt to redirect some traffic routes to it . This measure failed immediately , despite the pressures and police intervention , and the Municipality issued more than one promise to resolve the plight of market vendors . Subsequently , the most prominent plan the Municipality announced had the objective of comprising Raghadan Complex in a massive project spread over 400 dunams . It was to be made up of the island located between Al - Mahatta street and Al - Jaish street , which begins at the historical Amman Municipality building ( the public library now ) and ends at Al - Mahatta bridge . At first , the project was called \u201c Solidere Amman , \u201d named after the Solidere company , which built a similar project in the old center of Beirut . The old Municipality building was even going to be transformed into a hotel . The project also consisted of markets , cafes , wide pools , and expensive residential buildings . On its website , the Municipality provided photo models of the project , and called it \u201c Wadi Amman \u201d ( Amman Valley ) , which was to be part of a larger project carrying the name \u201c Sahin Amman \u201d ( Plate of Amman ) . It included all of central Amman , which comprises most of the city 's roots . The Municipality did indeed undertake a wide appropriation of land , and demolished many facilities and terminated the licenses of many workshops and stores located within the area of the project . Work on the project stopped once again , and then the whole framework of ideas that took the name \u201c comprehensive Amman plan \u201d collapsed . The department that formed the factory for all of those ideas ( Urban Amman Institute ) was terminated , and the activities of its famous director Jerry Post , who came from the Canadian Bearing Point company , were halted . Modern Ruins On the periphery of this modernization drama in central Amman , people with a vested interest in this place were not on the mind of the city planner nor on that of the executor of the plans . People were , in reality , the last to know and the first to be injured . And these people include large swathes of the business sector and its various industries , since the area counts as a base for the food supplies business generally . Also within the area there is a concentration of the oldest central markets for vegetables , clothes , and secondhand clothes . The area is a core place for the informal commercial and service sector , via hundreds of street vendors ( thousands during the peak time ) , and a specialized market for the Asian migrant workforce , especially on Friday . This is because it contains much of the secondhand business in Amman , especially that of the furniture sector . On top of that , the shopping public , whether daily commuters or visitors of the town center , makes a habit of depending on this market . The closure of the Raghadan Complex in 2003 represented a point of clear transformation , and which immediately split \u201c Wast Al - Balad \u201d ( the city center ) into two primary sections : east of Al - Husseini mosque and west of Al - Husseini mosque . The impact is focused on the east of the mosque , since the traffic that ran to and from the Raghadan Complex and that used to attract activity and various jobs stopped . In 2009 , the Municipality executed a project to redesign and rebuild the Hashemite Plaza . For this purpose , it shuttered numerous restaurants and cafes that were open 24 hours in order to serve the needs of their visitors and especially those of migrants . This is at odds with the situation today , because today these businesses are popular with families . Gradually , but notably and hasteningly , silence prevailed in this lively area . Though an observer from afar could believe that the people had moved to the new complex in Al - Mahatta , this complex now sees quiet since the first hours of the evening , and the activity within it has no comparison with that of the previous Raghadan Complex . So where did the people disappear to ? This question was not asked by the city planner nor by the decision maker . However , the city planner began to bemoan the traffic in other locations . This traffic was a result of the transportation choices that people made in response to the malfunction that these changes brought about . The modes of transportation of residents became fragmented . For example , the decision makers did not notice that despite the gradual increase in the number of residents in the capital , the number of cars active on the \u201c Service \u201d routes towards East Amman shrank , since the drivers used their public car licenses to work in other locations . If someone walked to Al - Mahatta street , ( King Abdullah I Street ) in the area between Raghadan Tourist Complex and Al - Nasha bridge , and took a long look to their right , towards the area where the Municipality proposed to place its fanciful plans ( restaurants , hotels , swimming pools , markets , playgrounds and recreation ) , their eye would receive many scenes of what would appear to be ruins . The Municipality did not have the time to remove the majority of them after it had appropriated and demolished the establishments and old buildings . As usual , the adaptability of poor workers in the informal sector allowed them to spread and to respread continuously in empty urban spaces , and this is indeed what occurred in this area . Between the places that vacated , a space was formed . It is located between Al - Mahatta complex for transportation , \u201c the new complex , \u201d and between the secondhand clothes market of Al - Mahatta , which was established in 1984 after the evacuation of secondhand clothes sellers from \u201c Al - Jora \u201d area in Saqif Al - Sail , as I mentioned . Activity located on the margin of the margin quickly spread to it , represented by dozens of tool stands and semi-damaged goods that were usually gathered by dumpster divers , brought to the market , reclassified , and presented to poor customers of the surrounding area , and the poor last users of public transportation . Meeting Again The recently persecuted and marginalized and laid off from the center of Amman gradually met in a nearby location which soon united , and quickly formed the biggest market for simple secondhand goods . These products are usually abandoned where they lie by their owners if no one is found to buy them . One example is makeup tools and used red lipstick . Naturally , another activity emerged comprising of stands selling unassembled parts , which enable the expert customer to gather the complementing parts they need . When I undertook the first study of the informal sector in 1997/1998 , the number of \u201c dumpster divers \u201d was limited and they hardly knew one another . They were called \u201c night divers \u201d as opposed to \u201c day divers , \u201d who gathered furniture and used tools from houses . Night dumpster diving began after midnight and ended at sunrise in the known streets , and one or two people specialized in each street . That was before this activity grew to include the dumpsters of all neighborhoods of the capital and many shifts daily . Dumpster diving was no longer limited to nighttime . Persecution campaigns against the marginalized have not stopped in central Amman in twenty years . Despite the perseverance of the marginalized , they do n't have the power to negotiate , and therefore they never grow weary of responding in a pragmatic way . So they modify their ways of work , and some of them might move to the mountains , and many work in the licensed popular markets on some days of the week , and they might switch the type of goods or services that they work in . The decision maker of central Amman sees a decline in human presence there , and believes that the development plan succeeded , but he does not ask : where did the people go ? To be fair , some of the urban and administrative changes promoted other significant activity in the center of Amman . This is represented by the great number of popular cafes . Professor of architecture Rami Dahir describes this as \u201c Bab Al - Hara Decorations , \u201d the famous Syrian series , because in his opinion it does not reflect a particular popular dimension . Less than a year ago , I visited an old man who has worked as a shoemaker in central Amman for more than a half century . Thanks to his career , he knows the types of passersby and pedestrians in central Amman . He said to me : the people that we know disappeared , and they are not passing by anymore .","annotations":[{"text":"markets","span":[1177,1183],"token_span":[218,218],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The concrete or abstract entity that undergoes a change."},{"text":"frequented by all classes of society","span":[1211,1246],"token_span":[223,228],"role":"Initial_situation","label":"Initial_situation","role_definition":"The situation that the Entity began in."},{"text":"the 1960s","span":[158,166],"token_span":[27,28],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the Entity undergoes the transformation."},{"text":"Amman","span":[43,47],"token_span":[8,8],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location that the change takes place."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-0213-433-frame-Undergo_transformation","frame":"Undergo_transformation","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Entity changes from one kind of thing (Initial_category) to another kind of thing (Final_category).","frame_ancestors":["Undergo_change","Transition_to_state","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"In mid-1996 , sales of Hanes / L'eggs hosiery had dropped another 9 percent in the past year , and they closed a distribution center in Illinois .

McGuire 's company last year loosened its dress code , permitting pants in the office . McGuire 's switch to a blazer , trousers and flats instead of a suit with a skirt , stockings and high heels for work is being repeated millions of times around the country with varying degrees of informality . The trend has , of course , changed the business of apparel retailing forever . But it also is hurting sales in the $ 2.2 billion sheer - hosiery market . Chicago - based Sara Lee Corp. , the country 's leading manufacturer and marketer of sheer hosiery , has been feeling the negative impact of the casual trend for several years . Sara Lee 's mass - marketed L'Eggs brand , its department store brand Hanes , and its up - market Donna Karan and DKNY hosiery lines together have about 47 percent of the market , according to a recent report from Prudential Securities . Sara Lee also is a leading hosiery company in Europe with brands including Dim in France , Pretty Polly in the United Kingdom and Vatter in Germany . In June 1994 , after watching hosiery sales drop 5 to 7 percent a year for the previous three years , Sara Lee restructured and eliminated 8,300 jobs , cutting U.S. hosiery capacity by 5 percent and making cuts in European manufacturing as well . Since then , casual dress in the workplace has become even more firmly entrenched , and an increasing number of women are taking advantage of communications technology to work at home . The downward trend has continued to be reflected in Sara Lee 's numbers . In fiscal 1996 ended June 30 , the company reported legwear volumes declined 9 percent . This month Sara Lee closed a distribution center , which employed 110 people , in Champaign . The company attributed the move to excess capacity . Sara Lee certainly is n't alone in feeling the pinch . Hosiery manufacturers at all levels of the market are having to find new ways to attract customers . Stores now must stock a wide variety of sheers , opaques and figure - enhancing styles to meet customers ' varied modes of dressing . And in department stores , each of these styles must be represented in a range of prices -- from $ 4 to as much as $ 50 . \" Being in the sheer - hosiery business now is a struggle , \" said Kathy Reynolds , president of Kenosha , Ill . - based Jockey International 's women 's division . Jockey , whose Jockey for Her line of underwear boosted the company 's fortunes , has been in the hosiery business since 1988 , just in time for the casual trend to take its toll .

McGuire 's company last year loosened its dress code , permitting pants in the office . McGuire 's switch to a blazer , trousers and flats instead of a suit with a skirt , stockings and high heels for work is being repeated millions of times around the country with varying degrees of informality . The trend has , of course , changed the business of apparel retailing forever . But it also is hurting sales in the $ 2.2 billion sheer - hosiery market . Chicago - based Sara Lee Corp. , the country 's leading manufacturer and marketer of sheer hosiery , has been feeling the negative impact of the casual trend for several years . Sara Lee 's mass - marketed L'Eggs brand , its department store brand Hanes , and its up - market Donna Karan and DKNY hosiery lines together have about 47 percent of the market , according to a recent report from Prudential Securities . Sara Lee also is a leading hosiery company in Europe with brands including Dim in France , Pretty Polly in the United Kingdom and Vatter in Germany . In June 1994 , after watching hosiery sales drop 5 to 7 percent a year for the previous three years , Sara Lee restructured and eliminated 8,300 jobs , cutting U.S. hosiery capacity by 5 percent and making cuts in European manufacturing as well . Since then , casual dress in the workplace has become even more firmly entrenched , and an increasing number of women are taking advantage of communications technology to work at home . The downward trend has continued to be reflected in Sara Lee 's numbers . In fiscal 1996 ended June 30 , the company reported legwear volumes declined 9 percent . This month Sara Lee closed a distribution center , which employed 110 people , in Champaign . The company attributed the move to excess capacity . Sara Lee certainly is n't alone in feeling the pinch . Hosiery manufacturers at all levels of the market are having to find new ways to attract customers . Stores now must stock a wide variety of sheers , opaques and figure - enhancing styles to meet customers ' varied modes of dressing . And in department stores , each of these styles must be represented in a range of prices -- from $ 4 to as much as $ 50 . \" Being in the sheer - hosiery business now is a struggle , \" said Kathy Reynolds , president of Kenosha , Ill . - based Jockey International 's women 's division . Jockey , whose Jockey for Her line of underwear boosted the company 's fortunes , has been in the hosiery business since 1988 , just in time for the casual trend to take its toll .

His parents were Russian Jewish immigrants who had arrived in Britain from Lithuania in 1909 . Joseph 's original surname was Naviprutsky . The surname was changed when they immigrated . He was one of thirteen brothers and sisters , who chose to stay and perished in the Holocaust . Two younger brothers escaped with the Polish army in 1939 , and eventually reached Israel , where their families still live . The Newmans were married at New Briggate Synagogue , Leeds on the 11th June 1912 , prior to which Joseph had been living at 8 Gledhow Terrace and Tilly at 22 Whitlock Street . Both were tailors and pressers . They lived at 11 Kepler Street ( or Grove ) , Leeds , at the time of Isidore 's birth . Isodore was the middle of three brothers . The older was Benny ( Bernard ) , born in 1914 , who although extremely clever developed acute mental illness as a young man . He had to leave school in the sixth form having shown great promise and was in and out of institutions much of his life . He died in Hull in the 1970s or 80s . The other brother Montague , seventeen months younger , was slightly physically disabled . He eventually became a medical technician at the Royal Victoria Infirmary at Newcastle -upon - Tyne , married a non - Jewish woman and appears to have lost touch with the family after Joseph and Tilly died . The family moved to Durham in 1922 when Isidore was six years old . An old friend , Dr Nat Cannon ( living in Vancouver aged 94 , in 2007 ) remembers [ that ] the family lived at 6 Cross Street and Isidore 's uncle Isaac Cohen ( Tilly 's brother ) resided at 9 Cross Street . The Durham City Directory for 1913 listed Joseph and Isaac as ' general dealers ' . Both Isidore and Nat attended St Margaret 's Elementary School ( on the honours board at the school , listing the pupils who went on to Grammar School , Isidore 's name was added in 1927 ) and later Johnston 's Grammar School . Isidore attended the Synagogue at 107 Laburnum Avenue of the small Durham community , where his father was a cantor . Isidore was a keen athlete , enjoying cricket , football , swimming and cycling , but was especially interested in learning French . He successfully completed his matriculation , aged sixteen and Higher School Certificate , at eighteen and went up to Armstrong College Newcastle -upon - Tyne , then part of Durham University in 1934 to read French , English and Latin . He and Nat Cannon , studying Medicine , with their slight Geordie accents , met on occasion , although Nat was four years older . As Isidore wrote in his SOE file on the 18th August 1941 : - The exciting life of a young student began for me ; I studied , I played games , I was interested in everything French language , literature and customs was my special study . In June 1936 , at the beginning of the holiday , I decided to go to Belgium with a friend ( I corresponded with a young Belgian student at the time ) . We left over for Ostend , then Brussels . As it was necessary for us to write a thesis for our BA degree , we installed ourselves at the University there - in the ' Cite estugiantine ' in order to use the books in the library . When the thesis was finished , we went to Bruges and to Blankenberghe , then to the French coast for a few days ; finally from Antwerp , we returned to England . In 1937 , I obtained my BA Degree ( 2nd class honours ) and in 1938 , after a year of study , I obtained the DThPT ( Diploma in the Theory and Practice of Teaching ) from Kings College Newcastle . I left the University and settled in Hull as a teacher in a Primary School . Meanwhile , Isidore 's father was bankrupt by 1938 ( though he later became a successful cloth merchant ) and moved with his family to Hull , where he was able to find a poorly paid job . This was as shomer ( literally , ' guard ' or ' keeper ' , who ensures that food sold in the community 's shops and prepared for weddings , bar mitzvahs and other events , is strictly kosher ) . They lived at 62 Etherington Drive then later at 137 Clumber Street , Princess Avenue . Joseph died 10th April 1966 and Tilly died 28th March 1956 . Isidore became engaged in Hull , and was teaching at Middleton Street Boy 's School from September 1938 . ( The school was demolished in 1994 . ) Isidore joined the army on he 29th August 1940 ( 2350538 ) and trained as a radio telegraphist with the Royal Corps of Signals at Catterick for six months . Posted to Scarborough , he then was posted to Kent for four months as a signalman . He was commissioned as a First Lieutenant ( 216306 ) and finished training on July 1941 , moved to Sheffield with the 12th Light Anti Aircraft Regiment . Stationed with a Royal Artillery battery in Hull . On 1st August 1941 , Isidore was sent for Wireless Officer Training with SOE . He broke his leg whilst training in Scotland . Isidore Newman was sent to Wanborough Manor near Guildford , taking on the pseudonym of ' Matthieu Elliot ' to disguise his identity from other recruits . The course instructors soon noticed his less than perfect French - he 'd studied the language at university , but had only spent a couple of weeks on the Continent , travelling across Belgium and northern France - and they also had some concerns over his moodiness during his commando training in Scotland , but there was no question about his technical abilities and he proved himself a determined and dedicated student . On the 9th March 1944 , Newman was arrested by the Gestapo , following the capture of Claude Malraux . As well as these two , a total of some 80 members of the SALESMAN circuit were taken by the Germans . In the same roundup eighteen tons of arms were also seized . At the beginning of September 1944 Newman 's group was transferred to Mauthausen concentration camp , along with three other ' F ' Section inmates , Sidney Jones , Marcus Bloom and Georges Clement . During 6th and 7th September Newman and his group were shot at or near the camp 's quarry , along with 40 agents from SOE 's Dutch section . His full story is told in Captain Isidore Newman SOE , Martin Sugarman , Jewish Historical Studies , 2007 . See also SOE Profiles by Nigel Perrin , for a more detailed history of his operations as an SOE agent . Isidore Newman was awarded a posthumous M.B.E. in 1946 , and is commemorated at the Brookwood Memorial in Surrey , the SOE memorial at Mauthausen and the ' F ' Section memorial at Valen\u00e7ay in France .

He eventually became a medical technician at the Royal Victoria Infirmary at Newcastle -upon - Tyne , married a non - Jewish woman and appears to have lost touch with the family after Joseph and Tilly died . The family moved to Durham in 1922 when Isidore was six years old . An old friend , Dr Nat Cannon ( living in Vancouver aged 94 , in 2007 ) remembers [ that ] the family lived at 6 Cross Street and Isidore 's uncle Isaac Cohen ( Tilly 's brother ) resided at 9 Cross Street . The Durham City Directory for 1913 listed Joseph and Isaac as ' general dealers ' . Both Isidore and Nat attended St Margaret 's Elementary School ( on the honours board at the school , listing the pupils who went on to Grammar School , Isidore 's name was added in 1927 ) and later Johnston 's Grammar School . Isidore attended the Synagogue at 107 Laburnum Avenue of the small Durham community , where his father was a cantor . Isidore was a keen athlete , enjoying cricket , football , swimming and cycling , but was especially interested in learning French . He successfully completed his matriculation , aged sixteen and Higher School Certificate , at eighteen and went up to Armstrong College Newcastle -upon - Tyne , then part of Durham University in 1934 to read French , English and Latin . He and Nat Cannon , studying Medicine , with their slight Geordie accents , met on occasion , although Nat was four years older . As Isidore wrote in his SOE file on the 18th August 1941 : - The exciting life of a young student began for me ; I studied , I played games , I was interested in everything French language , literature and customs was my special study . In June 1936 , at the beginning of the holiday , I decided to go to Belgium with a friend ( I corresponded with a young Belgian student at the time ) . We left over for Ostend , then Brussels . As it was necessary for us to write a thesis for our BA degree , we installed ourselves at the University there - in the ' Cite estugiantine ' in order to use the books in the library . When the thesis was finished , we went to Bruges and to Blankenberghe , then to the French coast for a few days ; finally from Antwerp , we returned to England . In 1937 , I obtained my BA Degree ( 2nd class honours ) and in 1938 , after a year of study , I obtained the DThPT ( Diploma in the Theory and Practice of Teaching ) from Kings College Newcastle . I left the University and settled in Hull as a teacher in a Primary School . Meanwhile , Isidore 's father was bankrupt by 1938 ( though he later became a successful cloth merchant ) and moved with his family to Hull , where he was able to find a poorly paid job . This was as shomer ( literally , ' guard ' or ' keeper ' , who ensures that food sold in the community 's shops and prepared for weddings , bar mitzvahs and other events , is strictly kosher ) . They lived at 62 Etherington Drive then later at 137 Clumber Street , Princess Avenue . Joseph died 10th April 1966 and Tilly died 28th March 1956 . Isidore became engaged in Hull , and was teaching at Middleton Street Boy 's School from September 1938 . ( The school was demolished in 1994 . ) Isidore joined the army on he 29th August 1940 ( 2350538 ) and trained as a radio telegraphist with the Royal Corps of Signals at Catterick for six months . Posted to Scarborough , he then was posted to Kent for four months as a signalman . He was commissioned as a First Lieutenant ( 216306 ) and finished training on July 1941 , moved to Sheffield with the 12th Light Anti Aircraft Regiment . Stationed with a Royal Artillery battery in Hull . On 1st August 1941 , Isidore was sent for Wireless Officer Training with SOE . He broke his leg whilst training in Scotland . Isidore Newman was sent to Wanborough Manor near Guildford , taking on the pseudonym of ' Matthieu Elliot ' to disguise his identity from other recruits . The course instructors soon noticed his less than perfect French - he 'd studied the language at university , but had only spent a couple of weeks on the Continent , travelling across Belgium and northern France - and they also had some concerns over his moodiness during his commando training in Scotland , but there was no question about his technical abilities and he proved himself a determined and dedicated student . On the 9th March 1944 , Newman was arrested by the Gestapo , following the capture of Claude Malraux . As well as these two , a total of some 80 members of the SALESMAN circuit were taken by the Germans . In the same roundup eighteen tons of arms were also seized . At the beginning of September 1944 Newman 's group was transferred to Mauthausen concentration camp , along with three other ' F ' Section inmates , Sidney Jones , Marcus Bloom and Georges Clement . During 6th and 7th September Newman and his group were shot at or near the camp 's quarry , along with 40 agents from SOE 's Dutch section . His full story is told in Captain Isidore Newman SOE , Martin Sugarman , Jewish Historical Studies , 2007 . See also SOE Profiles by Nigel Perrin , for a more detailed history of his operations as an SOE agent . Isidore Newman was awarded a posthumous M.B.E. in 1946 , and is commemorated at the Brookwood Memorial in Surrey , the SOE memorial at Mauthausen and the ' F ' Section memorial at Valen\u00e7ay in France .

Here 's Why A short time later , as he and Conrad continued to inspect Surveyor , Bean found it was not tan , or brown , after all . \" We thought this thing had changed color , but I think it 's just dust , \" said Bean . \" We rubbed into that battery , and it 's good and shiny again . \" Following their training and checklists , the astronauts collected a scoop from the probe 's soil mechanics - surface sampler , a section of unpainted aluminum tube from a strut supporting the Surveyor 's radar altimeter and Doppler velocity sensor , another section of aluminum tube that was coated with inorganic white paint and a segment of television cable wrapped in aluminized plastic film . And there was the Surveyor 's camera . \" That 's ours ! \" exclaimed Conrad , as the camera came loose . \" We got her ! \" replied Bean . The Apollo 12 moonwalkers returned the camera and other parts to their lunar module , \" Intrepid . \" Later that same day , 31 hours after they arrived , Conrad and Bean lifted off of the moon to rendezvous with their third crewmate , Richard \" Dick \" Gordon , on the command module \" Yankee Clipper \" and begin their journey back to Earth . Accompanying them were 75 pounds ( 34 kilograms ) of moon rocks and 20 pounds ( 9 kilograms ) of probe hardware . Related : Truth of the Moon : The Brave Voyage of Apollo 12 | Video Show Surveying Surveyor Like the moon rocks , the Surveyor 3 parts were returned to Earth for study . For the first time , scientists and engineers had an opportunity to analyze equipment after it being subjected to long - term exposure on the lunar surface . \" The returned material and photographs have been studied and evaluated by 40 teams of engineering and scientific investigators over a period of more than one year , \" wrote Surveyor program manager Benjamin Milwitzky in the 1971 report on the studies ' findings . More than 80 researchers carefully examined the returned Surveyor parts for the effects of radiation and lunar dust exposure . As it turned out , Conrad and Bean had been correct \u2014 Surveyor 3 did change color and it was partly due to lunar dust adhesion . Sun exposure , over the course of 32 lunar days , had also caused paint to fade . Related : How a Passionate Scientist 's Eye Led to the 1st Pinpoint Moon Landing The engineering studies found that the TV camera and other hardware exhibited no signs of failure , which led Milwitzky to conclude , \" that the state of technology , even as it existed [ prior to the Surveyor 3 launch in 1966 ] , is capable of producing reliable hardware that makes feasible long - life lunar and planetary installations . \" Other studies looked at the probe 's equipment for the effects of the solar wind and micrometeorite impacts . About the latter , the research concluded that none of the visible surface features were of meteoritic origin . Bacteria that was found within the television camera was initially thought to have been deposited before Surveyor 3 was launched to the moon , meaning that it had survived for 31 months on the moon . Later studies found that it was more likely to have been the result of contamination from the team inspecting the camera after it was returned to Earth , as a result of poor clean room procedures . Surveyor souvenirs After the studies were complete , NASA placed some of the Surveyor 3 parts into storage , alongside the moon rock and soil samples being preserved by the Lunar Receiving Laboratory ( later , Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility ) at Johnson Space Center in Houston . Others made their way to museums \u2014 and elsewhere . \" NASA treats them as lunar samples , not as artifacts , \" said Michael Neufeld , a senior curator in the space history department at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington , DC . \" We have the Surveyor 3 camera on loan . \" The television camera is currently in storage , as the gallery where it has been exhibited is being renovated . It is expected to return to display with the opening of the new Exploring the Planets exhibition in 2022 . The Cosmosphere space museum in Hutchinson , Kansas exhibits the scoop from the soil sampler , which is also on loan from NASA . Another piece of the sampler is on display at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , California . NASA also loaned or gifted Surveyor 3 parts to some of its leaders . Before arriving at the Smithsonian , the Surveyor 3 camera was presented to William Pickering on his retirement as the director of JPL in 1976 . The sampler scoop 's motor gear box cover was placed with an American flag that was flown on Apollo 12 in a clear tube and mounted on a wooden base for presentation to NASA 's chief scientist John Naugle for his \" many contributions to the nation 's scientific efforts in space . \" After Naugle 's death in 2013 , his family returned the display to NASA 's headquarters in Washington , DC , where it is today . \" When John Naugle 's daughter returned the Surveyor 3 memento to us , it had a sticker on the bottom that said something like , ' To be returned to NASA , ' \" wrote Bill Barry , NASA 's chief historian , in an email to collectSPACE.com . Another piece , the color filter wheel from the television camera , remains in private hands . NASA presented the Surveyor 3 artifact to Edgar Cortright , director of Langley Research Center in Hampton , Virginia , from 1968 to 1975 . After he died in 2014 , Cortright 's son confirmed that NASA considers the filter wheel to be his family 's property , but has plans to eventually share it with the public . \" While I do intend to donate it at some point as I think it belongs at the museum , I decided to hold onto it for a while as a memory of my father , \" said Dave Cortright . That pieces were loaned or gifted as souvenirs is not unheard of , said Neufeld . \" There is some precedent from human [ spaceflight ] missions , people would take things out of the spacecraft and turn them into gifts or the astronauts would take things home , \" he said . \" So there has been this tradition of turning these things into awards for people at NASA . \" That said , both Barry and Neufeld agree that having the Surveyor 3 parts available today , 50 years after they were returned to Earth , has merit . \" There is much to be learned from Surveyor 3 , \" said Barry . \" Studying the Surveyor artifacts currently on Earth again with new techniques could , I presume , bear new information . \" \" [ They are ] something that were on the moon that you can look at , something that was recovered from the moon and is in the spectacular pictures from Apollo 12 of the astronauts at Surveyor , \" said Neufeld . \" You can say , ' That thing in this photo is this object that is sitting right in front of you . \u201d Click through to collect SPACE to see more photos of the Apollo 12 - retrieved parts of the Surveyor 3 probe . - Apollo 12 Was Struck By Lightning Right After Launch ...

The Apollo 12 moonwalkers returned the camera and other parts to their lunar module , \" Intrepid . \" Later that same day , 31 hours after they arrived , Conrad and Bean lifted off of the moon to rendezvous with their third crewmate , Richard \" Dick \" Gordon , on the command module \" Yankee Clipper \" and begin their journey back to Earth . Accompanying them were 75 pounds ( 34 kilograms ) of moon rocks and 20 pounds ( 9 kilograms ) of probe hardware . Related : Truth of the Moon : The Brave Voyage of Apollo 12 | Video Show Surveying Surveyor Like the moon rocks , the Surveyor 3 parts were returned to Earth for study . For the first time , scientists and engineers had an opportunity to analyze equipment after it being subjected to long - term exposure on the lunar surface . \" The returned material and photographs have been studied and evaluated by 40 teams of engineering and scientific investigators over a period of more than one year , \" wrote Surveyor program manager Benjamin Milwitzky in the 1971 report on the studies ' findings . More than 80 researchers carefully examined the returned Surveyor parts for the effects of radiation and lunar dust exposure . As it turned out , Conrad and Bean had been correct \u2014 Surveyor 3 did change color and it was partly due to lunar dust adhesion . Sun exposure , over the course of 32 lunar days , had also caused paint to fade . Related : How a Passionate Scientist 's Eye Led to the 1st Pinpoint Moon Landing The engineering studies found that the TV camera and other hardware exhibited no signs of failure , which led Milwitzky to conclude , \" that the state of technology , even as it existed [ prior to the Surveyor 3 launch in 1966 ] , is capable of producing reliable hardware that makes feasible long - life lunar and planetary installations . \" Other studies looked at the probe 's equipment for the effects of the solar wind and micrometeorite impacts . About the latter , the research concluded that none of the visible surface features were of meteoritic origin . Bacteria that was found within the television camera was initially thought to have been deposited before Surveyor 3 was launched to the moon , meaning that it had survived for 31 months on the moon . Later studies found that it was more likely to have been the result of contamination from the team inspecting the camera after it was returned to Earth , as a result of poor clean room procedures . Surveyor souvenirs After the studies were complete , NASA placed some of the Surveyor 3 parts into storage , alongside the moon rock and soil samples being preserved by the Lunar Receiving Laboratory ( later , Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility ) at Johnson Space Center in Houston . Others made their way to museums \u2014 and elsewhere . \" NASA treats them as lunar samples , not as artifacts , \" said Michael Neufeld , a senior curator in the space history department at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington , DC . \" We have the Surveyor 3 camera on loan . \" The television camera is currently in storage , as the gallery where it has been exhibited is being renovated . It is expected to return to display with the opening of the new Exploring the Planets exhibition in 2022 . The Cosmosphere space museum in Hutchinson , Kansas exhibits the scoop from the soil sampler , which is also on loan from NASA . Another piece of the sampler is on display at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , California . NASA also loaned or gifted Surveyor 3 parts to some of its leaders . Before arriving at the Smithsonian , the Surveyor 3 camera was presented to William Pickering on his retirement as the director of JPL in 1976 . The sampler scoop 's motor gear box cover was placed with an American flag that was flown on Apollo 12 in a clear tube and mounted on a wooden base for presentation to NASA 's chief scientist John Naugle for his \" many contributions to the nation 's scientific efforts in space . \" After Naugle 's death in 2013 , his family returned the display to NASA 's headquarters in Washington , DC , where it is today . \" When John Naugle 's daughter returned the Surveyor 3 memento to us , it had a sticker on the bottom that said something like , ' To be returned to NASA , ' \" wrote Bill Barry , NASA 's chief historian , in an email to collectSPACE.com . Another piece , the color filter wheel from the television camera , remains in private hands . NASA presented the Surveyor 3 artifact to Edgar Cortright , director of Langley Research Center in Hampton , Virginia , from 1968 to 1975 . After he died in 2014 , Cortright 's son confirmed that NASA considers the filter wheel to be his family 's property , but has plans to eventually share it with the public . \" While I do intend to donate it at some point as I think it belongs at the museum , I decided to hold onto it for a while as a memory of my father , \" said Dave Cortright . That pieces were loaned or gifted as souvenirs is not unheard of , said Neufeld . \" There is some precedent from human [ spaceflight ] missions , people would take things out of the spacecraft and turn them into gifts or the astronauts would take things home , \" he said . \" So there has been this tradition of turning these things into awards for people at NASA . \" That said , both Barry and Neufeld agree that having the Surveyor 3 parts available today , 50 years after they were returned to Earth , has merit . \" There is much to be learned from Surveyor 3 , \" said Barry . \" Studying the Surveyor artifacts currently on Earth again with new techniques could , I presume , bear new information . \" \" [ They are ] something that were on the moon that you can look at , something that was recovered from the moon and is in the spectacular pictures from Apollo 12 of the astronauts at Surveyor , \" said Neufeld . \" You can say , ' That thing in this photo is this object that is sitting right in front of you . \u201d Click through to collect SPACE to see more photos of the Apollo 12 - retrieved parts of the Surveyor 3 probe . - Apollo 12 Was Struck By Lightning Right After Launch ...

U.S. forces have massed ships and helicopters near the disaster areas and devoted their efforts to cargo transportation , search , rescue and recovery work and carrying SDF members to their destinations . These coordinated relief activities at the disaster sites are expected to deepen the Japan - U.S. alliance . Especially noteworthy among the various relief activities are early efforts by the U.S. military to restore the damaged Sendai Airport , one of the most important transportation bases in the devastated region . The airport , directly hit by tsunami , could not be used due to the rubble and wrecked automobiles strewn across its runways . U.S. marines stationed in Okinawa Prefecture arrived there and started to remove the debris . Thanks to their efforts , the airport could resume part of its functions and serve as an emergency landing field for helicopters and other aircraft carrying relief materials . An expert said the action was based on the military principle that troops cannot conduct operations unless materials move first . The U.S. military also was transporting food , water , medicine , blankets , clothes and supplies by helicopters belonging to its fleet , including the USS Ronald Reagan , a nuclear - powered aircraft carrier , in seas off the Sanriku coast . A U.S. Marine Corps amphibious landing ship , the USS Tortuga , transported about 280 members and 94 vehicles of the Ground Self - Defense Force from Tomakomai , Hokkaido , to Ominato , Aomori Prefecture , on Wednesday and Thursday . On Saturday , U.S. forces supported helicopter transportation in seas off Hachinohe , Aomori Prefecture . U.S. marines based in Okinawa Prefecture have also participated in relief activities . Three U.S. naval vessels , including the amphibious assault ship USS Essex with 2,200 members of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard , are involved in relief activities in the Sea of Japan off Akita Prefecture . The troops use Yamagata Airport as a base for transporting fuel and materials to the disaster areas . This is the first time that the U.S. military has used a private airport in Japan for anything other than emergency landings , according to a senior member of the Defense Ministry . Sources close to the ministry commented that deployment of U.S. forces around Japan might be similar if a contingency were to occur on the Korean Peninsula . The U.S. military is also helping Japan deal with the reactor accidents at the Fukushima nuclear power plant . They have loaned 100 sets of nuclear protective gear to members of the SDF and other organizations involved . However , the U.S. Defense Department announced that it has prohibited U.S. soldiers from coming within 50 miles ( about 80 kilometers ) of the Fukushima nuclear power plant . The announcement reflects the apparent seriousness with which the U.S. government views the situation of the stricken reactors . Meanwhile , Adm .

U.S. forces have massed ships and helicopters near the disaster areas and devoted their efforts to cargo transportation , search , rescue and recovery work and carrying SDF members to their destinations . These coordinated relief activities at the disaster sites are expected to deepen the Japan - U.S. alliance . Especially noteworthy among the various relief activities are early efforts by the U.S. military to restore the damaged Sendai Airport , one of the most important transportation bases in the devastated region . The airport , directly hit by tsunami , could not be used due to the rubble and wrecked automobiles strewn across its runways . U.S. marines stationed in Okinawa Prefecture arrived there and started to remove the debris . Thanks to their efforts , the airport could resume part of its functions and serve as an emergency landing field for helicopters and other aircraft carrying relief materials . An expert said the action was based on the military principle that troops cannot conduct operations unless materials move first . The U.S. military also was transporting food , water , medicine , blankets , clothes and supplies by helicopters belonging to its fleet , including the USS Ronald Reagan , a nuclear - powered aircraft carrier , in seas off the Sanriku coast . A U.S. Marine Corps amphibious landing ship , the USS Tortuga , transported about 280 members and 94 vehicles of the Ground Self - Defense Force from Tomakomai , Hokkaido , to Ominato , Aomori Prefecture , on Wednesday and Thursday . On Saturday , U.S. forces supported helicopter transportation in seas off Hachinohe , Aomori Prefecture . U.S. marines based in Okinawa Prefecture have also participated in relief activities . Three U.S. naval vessels , including the amphibious assault ship USS Essex with 2,200 members of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard , are involved in relief activities in the Sea of Japan off Akita Prefecture . The troops use Yamagata Airport as a base for transporting fuel and materials to the disaster areas . This is the first time that the U.S. military has used a private airport in Japan for anything other than emergency landings , according to a senior member of the Defense Ministry . Sources close to the ministry commented that deployment of U.S. forces around Japan might be similar if a contingency were to occur on the Korean Peninsula . The U.S. military is also helping Japan deal with the reactor accidents at the Fukushima nuclear power plant . They have loaned 100 sets of nuclear protective gear to members of the SDF and other organizations involved . However , the U.S. Defense Department announced that it has prohibited U.S. soldiers from coming within 50 miles ( about 80 kilometers ) of the Fukushima nuclear power plant . The announcement reflects the apparent seriousness with which the U.S. government views the situation of the stricken reactors . Meanwhile , Adm . Robert Willard , commander of the U.S. Pacific Command , was planning to leave the United States for Japan on Saturday . In Japan , he will meet Gen. Ryoichi Oriki , chief of staff of the Self - Defense Force 's Joint Staff .

To anyone with no idea what Red Orchestra is , let me help out : It 's a multiplayer FPS , set on the Eastern front of World War 2 , which captures above all else the grayness and desperation of those nightmare battlefields . Red Orchestra is a game of wincing at suppressive fire , of bayonet attacks , and of struggling to figure out whether that figure is a German or a Russian because muddy gray and muddy brown often look the same in dim lighting . The sequel 's looking to expand on everything that made the original game great , including its horrific tank combat . Here , we present an exclusive interview with Tripwire President John Gibson , in which he talks freely on the as-of - yesterday unrevealed vehicle combat coming in the sequel . RPS : You mentioned that you plan to set the standard of tank combat in FPS games for years to come . How , exactly ? John Gibson : The big thing we 're doing with tanking for ROHOS is to really immerse the player in what it was like to be an actual soldier inside of one of these lumbering beasts in World War 2 . The typical FPS tanking experience generally has the player viewing the tank from third person , and the player essentially feels like they ARE the tank rather than feeling like they are a person in a tank . For ROHOS our goal is to move beyond that and provide the player with an immersive and robust first person experience . For starters we have fully modeled the entire interior of every tank in the game . At any position in the tank the player will see what a real person in the tank would see . Look down and you 'll see your hands operating all of the levers . Move between positions and it will be fully animated in first person . And your tank will have a full crew of either AI NPC 's or human players to fight alongside you . Look to your right and you will see the hull machine gunner blasting away at the enemy . Fire the main cannon , and you 'll see an NPC crewman reloading the cannon shell beside you . You have a living breathing crew all around you and you can see all of the elements of the tank operating . When a shell penetrates your armor , you 'll see your crewmates die around you , and hear their screams as the tank catches fire . Beyond this we have added a whole new level of functionality and interaction to the tanks . The first thing that we 've done is what we call a virtual interior . The player can actually look around in the interior and very easily interact with the interior . Want to look out of a view slit , just look at the slit and press a button . Want to stick your head out of the hatch , look up and press a button . It is all very streamlined and allows the player to do a lot of things but very simply . We 're actual giving players very near to a tank simulation 's level of functionality , but streamlined so it is easy to use and accessible . Speaking of view , one of the things we discovered after we shipped the original Red Orchestra was that while the view inside a tank is somewhat limited , there are a LOT of view ports , view slits , and periscopes that the tank crew had at their disposal to get a better view of what is happening outside of the tank . So for ROHOS we have added the ability to very easily interact with any of these and get a better view of the situation . Another area which we 've greatly expanded on is the damage system . The original RO had a generalized damage system with just a few key damageable components . For ROHOS we 've expanded this to include a very broad range of damageable components with accompanying gameplay effects . Things such as damaging optics , damaging the engine and transmission , damaging the turret rotation mechanism , hitting the fuel tank , drive sprocket , treads and more are now included . And now shots that penetrate the tank armor can hit the crewmembers inside . RPS : Can you repair tank damage ? And what amount of damage can be repaired ? JG : We are actually a bit torn on repairing damage on the tanks . Realistically there are n't a lot of repairs that you could do to a tank within the time frame of a match in ROHOS . But not allowing repairs leads to unrealistic gameplay where everyone always fights to the death , instead of retreating for repairs when they are too damaged to continue fighting . We 're looking at the idea of allowing tanks to be repaired at the resupply areas . This is something we 're still prototyping and trying different things , so we 'll have to wait and see what the final system ends up being . RPS : Will we see any playable vehicles other than tanks ? JG : For the initial release we 're going to ship with two medium tanks \u2013 the T34 76 and the Panzer IV . I know that might not seem like a lot , but for ROHOS our goal with the vehicles was to focus on quality over quantity . In tank simulations you typically only see a couple of drivable tank in the game . This is due to the sheer amount of work required to implement a vehicle at that level of detail . And for ROHOS , we 're actually implemented tanks at a level of detail and functionality far beyond tank sims or any existing game . Tripwire has a philosophy though when it comes to releasing games . We like to give gamers a lot of value for their money when they buy a game from us at launch , but they can also count on getting even more out of their game in the form of free content packs . We 've put out a LOT of free additional content for the original Red Orchestra as well as Killing Floor . So we do already have four additional vehicles in production and those will likely come out in our first free content pack not long after the launch . The four additional vehicles will be two more tanks and two troop transports . RPS : Awesome as they were , in the past I 've found tanks in RO can be a source of frustration - either getting slaughtered by them as a fleshy little infantryman , or finding yourself inside one with a crew that does n't know what they 're doing . Were you planning to address either of these situations ? JG : A lot of our work for ROHOS for both tanks and infantry has been to make a game that stays true to its realism roots while also being much more accessible than the original game . Infantry versus tanks is a tricky thing to balance in a game that aims to be both realistic and accessible , because tanks really should do very well against infantry . For us one of the things we learned during and after the release of RO : Ostfront was that making good combined arms gameplay is about putting tanks in situations where they are vulnerable to infantry . We found that in the right setting , tanks can be at a serious disadvantage to infantry . In the first game we put infantry in a lot of scenarios fighting tanks in their element \u2013 wide open landscapes fighting infantry . These scenarios end up with happy tankers and unhappy infantrymen . So we 've taken what we 've learned from the first game and applied that to the levels in ROHOS . Now when we do combined arms levels , we make sure that there is plenty of cover and concealment so that the infantry can more easily get the drop on the tanks . We 've also given the infantry some additional tools for their tank fighting arsenal in the form of semi-automatic anti tank rifles , and anti tank grenades . Regarding making tanks less frustrating , let me just say \u2013 we hear you . Tanking in RO : Ostfront at its best was an amazing experience you could n't get anywhere else , but at its worst could be an exercise in frustration . The biggest issue we found was that tanking with other random public players was extremely frustrating , especially if they did n't know what they were doing or were n't using their microphone . To address this we 've made a lot of changes for ROHOS . First off , players will never have to tank with some one that they do n't want to . When a player chooses a tank role they have the option of locking the tank , or allowing other people to join their crew . Another frustrating thing was standing around waiting for a tank to spawn . Tankers now always spawn inside their tank , and respawn with their tank . Additionally every level will feature enough tanks so that every tanker will have a tank . Since tanking with random public players was frustrating in the first game players usually ended up tanking by themselves . Because the tanks in the game were designed to be crewed by three people , tanking by yourself was cumbersome requiring the player to constantly switch between positions . This was neither realistic nor fun , as a tank would never leave base in a real battle with just one tank crewman . So to address this the big feature we 're adding that I 've touched on a little bit already is the AI crew . When you choose to tank by yourself you will now have a fully functional intelligent AI crew at your disposal . You can choose to play any of the main positions in the tank still , but now the AI will handle the rest for you . If you just want to drive around , the AI crew will man the MGs and take out infantry for you , or fire the main cannon at enemy tanks . If you want to operate the main cannon , you can use your movement keys to easily give orders to the driver to move the tank . If commanding is your thing , you can take the command position and designate targets for the AI crew to attack , give locational movement orders to the tank driver using a 3d command widget or the overhead map , give normal movement commands using the movement keys , spot artillery targets with your binoculars , and more . And with a full live AI crew the player can instantly switch between any of these positions assuming the role of that AI crewmember , and the AI will dynamically take over the functionality in the position you just left . Now there is a catch . If an AI crewmember is killed the player will need to move to the position of the dead crewmember to perform the function of that crewmember . And transitions to the position of a dead crewmember will be a real first person animated transition that will take time . The good news is , if you lose a crew member you can go to a vehicle resupply station and get your tank reinforced with fresh crewmembers . And the player can mix and match other human players with the AI crew members . There are a lot of other things we 've done to refine tanking and make it more accessible . In the first game people found the in tank view very limiting , either because they did n't understand that you could zoom in on the view slits or open the hatches , or because we did n't provide all of the views that the real tank actually had . So for the new game we will have a training mission that will familiarize the player with the tank functionality , including the use of the view system so they do n't get in the battlefield and think the only view they have is a tiny slit that is feet from their face . Additionally , as I mentioned before we 've added a lot of additional view ports that the real tanks actually had , and created a system to easily look out of them . This makes the view system a lot more robust and tanking in general easier in the new game . There are a lot of small things too like refining the controls . One example would be we now use a more intuitive mouse based aiming system which better mimics how players aim with their first person weapon as an infantry soldier . RPS : Hang on . If you can choose to lock your tank with an AI crew , do the AI count towards your team 's playercount ? Because if they do n't you 're giving your side a couple of bots , for free , no ? And if they do , you 're limiting how many people get to tank on your team . JG : The AI Crew does n't count toward the playercount . On combined arms maps , the infantry are good for fighting in the buildings and the tanks are good in the open areas . So for the players it will be a decision of where they want to allocate their human players . For example , let 's say you are playing with 64 players and there are ten tanks . You could have 1 human player in each tank with a full AI Crew and then have 54 infantry players . Or you could have 30 human players in tanks ( 3 human players filling the playable positions in each tank ) and then only have 24 infantry players . Or you could do something in between . It all sounds pretty complicated , but the way it is presented to the players in game is pretty simple and streamlined . The key thing here is that every tank rolls out with a full crew either human or AI NPC , and no one is ever left standing around at the base waiting for a tank to appear . RPS : I 'd guess that finding statistics to build a simulation of WW2 small arms is a lot easier than finding info on tanks . How 's researching this been ? JG : Basically , small arms were around in huge quantities and can even be bought in working order today . People still use them . Tanks were n't \u2013 and are n't . The tanks of the period were practically obsolete by the end of the war and there are very few left running today . Tech was moving so fast that there was also relatively limited research conducted on the \u201c old tech \u201d \u2013 everyone was too busy gearing up for the cold war . The research and documentation that WAS done had been done under war-time conditions , was sketchy , too much guess - work \u2013 and half of it got lost anyway . All this adds up to making research on tanks a complete nightmare \u2013 certainly at the level of detail we needed . Exteriors were n't too bad . The interiors were really difficult \u2013 mostly some old photos , a few bits of plans , plus recent photos of the interior of ( mostly ) trashed old tanks . The T-34 is easier \u2013 there are at least more modern examples still around , although that means interpreting what the 1942 version was like . Add to that the whole business of armor technology and penetration in the 1940s , of course , and we 'd have to say it has been very hard . We worked with museums and archives ( Bovington , Littlefield 's , Patton Museum for a start ) to dig out the info , as well as some individuals who have made WWII armor tech their life 's work ! And all of that is just to get the information \u2013 after that we 've done a lot of additional work interpreting it and turning it into meaningful , working , accurate models in game ! RPS : If you were a tank , what kind of tank would you be ? JG : If you are talking about the tanks that are in ROHOS , the tanks are pretty well matched . If you are talking about WWII tanks in general , I would say the Panther . It was a great balance of armor , mobility , and firepower . Funny you should ask this though , as there is a long standing debate on the Red Orchestra forums about what the greatest tank of WWII was that has almost taken on a life of its own . As a matter of fact , it has gotten so big , that if you google \u201c greatest tank of ww 2 \u201d the discussion on the Red Orchestra forums is the top link that pops up . This thread has been going on for 4 years and has reached over 30 pages . Most people there will say that the Russian IS - 2 heavy tank is the best tank of WWII . It has reached the point where it is almost an inside joke among RO fans . We even have an IS - 2 emoticon in our forums ( http://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/images/smilies/is2.gif).

Since tanking with random public players was frustrating in the first game players usually ended up tanking by themselves . Because the tanks in the game were designed to be crewed by three people , tanking by yourself was cumbersome requiring the player to constantly switch between positions . This was neither realistic nor fun , as a tank would never leave base in a real battle with just one tank crewman . So to address this the big feature we 're adding that I 've touched on a little bit already is the AI crew . When you choose to tank by yourself you will now have a fully functional intelligent AI crew at your disposal . You can choose to play any of the main positions in the tank still , but now the AI will handle the rest for you . If you just want to drive around , the AI crew will man the MGs and take out infantry for you , or fire the main cannon at enemy tanks . If you want to operate the main cannon , you can use your movement keys to easily give orders to the driver to move the tank . If commanding is your thing , you can take the command position and designate targets for the AI crew to attack , give locational movement orders to the tank driver using a 3d command widget or the overhead map , give normal movement commands using the movement keys , spot artillery targets with your binoculars , and more . And with a full live AI crew the player can instantly switch between any of these positions assuming the role of that AI crewmember , and the AI will dynamically take over the functionality in the position you just left . Now there is a catch . If an AI crewmember is killed the player will need to move to the position of the dead crewmember to perform the function of that crewmember . And transitions to the position of a dead crewmember will be a real first person animated transition that will take time . The good news is , if you lose a crew member you can go to a vehicle resupply station and get your tank reinforced with fresh crewmembers . And the player can mix and match other human players with the AI crew members . There are a lot of other things we 've done to refine tanking and make it more accessible . In the first game people found the in tank view very limiting , either because they did n't understand that you could zoom in on the view slits or open the hatches , or because we did n't provide all of the views that the real tank actually had . So for the new game we will have a training mission that will familiarize the player with the tank functionality , including the use of the view system so they do n't get in the battlefield and think the only view they have is a tiny slit that is feet from their face . Additionally , as I mentioned before we 've added a lot of additional view ports that the real tanks actually had , and created a system to easily look out of them . This makes the view system a lot more robust and tanking in general easier in the new game . There are a lot of small things too like refining the controls . One example would be we now use a more intuitive mouse based aiming system which better mimics how players aim with their first person weapon as an infantry soldier . RPS : Hang on . If you can choose to lock your tank with an AI crew , do the AI count towards your team 's playercount ? Because if they do n't you 're giving your side a couple of bots , for free , no ? And if they do , you 're limiting how many people get to tank on your team . JG : The AI Crew does n't count toward the playercount . On combined arms maps , the infantry are good for fighting in the buildings and the tanks are good in the open areas . So for the players it will be a decision of where they want to allocate their human players . For example , let 's say you are playing with 64 players and there are ten tanks . You could have 1 human player in each tank with a full AI Crew and then have 54 infantry players . Or you could have 30 human players in tanks ( 3 human players filling the playable positions in each tank ) and then only have 24 infantry players . Or you could do something in between . It all sounds pretty complicated , but the way it is presented to the players in game is pretty simple and streamlined . The key thing here is that every tank rolls out with a full crew either human or AI NPC , and no one is ever left standing around at the base waiting for a tank to appear . RPS : I 'd guess that finding statistics to build a simulation of WW2 small arms is a lot easier than finding info on tanks . How 's researching this been ? JG : Basically , small arms were around in huge quantities and can even be bought in working order today . People still use them . Tanks were n't \u2013 and are n't . The tanks of the period were practically obsolete by the end of the war and there are very few left running today . Tech was moving so fast that there was also relatively limited research conducted on the \u201c old tech \u201d \u2013 everyone was too busy gearing up for the cold war . The research and documentation that WAS done had been done under war-time conditions , was sketchy , too much guess - work \u2013 and half of it got lost anyway . All this adds up to making research on tanks a complete nightmare \u2013 certainly at the level of detail we needed . Exteriors were n't too bad . The interiors were really difficult \u2013 mostly some old photos , a few bits of plans , plus recent photos of the interior of ( mostly ) trashed old tanks . The T-34 is easier \u2013 there are at least more modern examples still around , although that means interpreting what the 1942 version was like . Add to that the whole business of armor technology and penetration in the 1940s , of course , and we 'd have to say it has been very hard . We worked with museums and archives ( Bovington , Littlefield 's , Patton Museum for a start ) to dig out the info , as well as some individuals who have made WWII armor tech their life 's work ! And all of that is just to get the information \u2013 after that we 've done a lot of additional work interpreting it and turning it into meaningful , working , accurate models in game ! RPS : If you were a tank , what kind of tank would you be ? JG : If you are talking about the tanks that are in ROHOS , the tanks are pretty well matched . If you are talking about WWII tanks in general , I would say the Panther . It was a great balance of armor , mobility , and firepower . Funny you should ask this though , as there is a long standing debate on the Red Orchestra forums about what the greatest tank of WWII was that has almost taken on a life of its own . As a matter of fact , it has gotten so big , that if you google \u201c greatest tank of ww 2 \u201d the discussion on the Red Orchestra forums is the top link that pops up . This thread has been going on for 4 years and has reached over 30 pages . Most people there will say that the Russian IS - 2 heavy tank is the best tank of WWII . It has reached the point where it is almost an inside joke among RO fans . We even have an IS - 2 emoticon in our forums ( http://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/images/smilies/is2.gif).

Quate , 1923 - Printer Friendly Calvin F. Quate was born on 7 December 1923 in Baker , Nevada . He received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Utah in 1944 , and the Ph.D. degree from Stanford University in 1950 . In 1949 , he joined the technical staff at Bell Telephone Laboratories , Murray Hill , New Jersey , and soon became Department Head and then Associate Director of Electronics Research . He transferred to Sandia Corporation in Albuquerque , New Mexico in 1959 . In 1960 he was appointed Vice - President and Director of Research . Quate joined Stanford University in 1961 as Professor of Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering . He has served as Chairman of the Applied Physics Department , as Acting Chairman of the Electrical Engineering Department , and as Associate Dean in the School of Humanities and Science . Presently he holds the Leland T. Edwards Chair in Engineering at Stanford , and since 1984 has been a Senior Research Fellow at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center ( PARC ) . Quate has worked on acoustic amplifiers , interaction of acoustics with semiconductors and acoustic correlators , all of which have become important fields of research . His early work led to an understanding of noise space charge waves on electron beams , practical systems of periodic focusing of electron beams , coupled helixes in traveling wave tubes , and the design of practical microwave amplifiers and oscillators . He initiated the activity on acoustics that led to the scanning acoustic microscope . His microscope has resolution exceeding that of optical microscopes . It sharply reveals structure in optically opaque or even transparent materials . One can \" see \" things with sharp contrast that are not easily seen with optics and can examine sub-surface structure in integrated circuits that is not at all visible with optics . His judgment and enthusiasm is infectious and has led many of his colleagues to work in acoustics and related fields . His more recent work on electron tunneling microscopy reveals the atomic scale structure of crystalline substances .

He has served as Chairman of the Applied Physics Department , as Acting Chairman of the Electrical Engineering Department , and as Associate Dean in the School of Humanities and Science . Presently he holds the Leland T. Edwards Chair in Engineering at Stanford , and since 1984 has been a Senior Research Fellow at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center ( PARC ) . Quate has worked on acoustic amplifiers , interaction of acoustics with semiconductors and acoustic correlators , all of which have become important fields of research . His early work led to an understanding of noise space charge waves on electron beams , practical systems of periodic focusing of electron beams , coupled helixes in traveling wave tubes , and the design of practical microwave amplifiers and oscillators . He initiated the activity on acoustics that led to the scanning acoustic microscope . His microscope has resolution exceeding that of optical microscopes . It sharply reveals structure in optically opaque or even transparent materials . One can \" see \" things with sharp contrast that are not easily seen with optics and can examine sub-surface structure in integrated circuits that is not at all visible with optics . His judgment and enthusiasm is infectious and has led many of his colleagues to work in acoustics and related fields . His more recent work on electron tunneling microscopy reveals the atomic scale structure of crystalline substances .

Following a comprehensive review of the rail project , which ought to have commenced passenger operation but had been hindered by unforeseen third party issues and other challenges , the state government said the Marina to Mile 2 section of the project known as the Blue Line Rail , would now be ready for passenger operation by 2022 . The state government had engaged consultants to carry out a technical review and due diligence on the implementation of the project , which substantially had focused on civil works , and reported back to government that operation of the first phase may only commence in 2022 . Alstom SA France , a foreign firm with over 100 years of railway experience covering 60 countries , was subsequently engaged to review the report of the consultants , while the firm in its report agreed that the first phase of the rail project could only become operational in 2022 based on proposed funding pattern . Speaking at the signing of the agreement with Alstom SA , Managing Director of Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority ( LAMATA ) , Abiodun Dabiri , who signed on behalf of the state government , said the partnership was the result of the commitment of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode towards the transformation of public transportation in the state . He said a consortium of experts engaged by the state government to undertake a technical due diligence on the LRMT Blue Line Project ( Mile 2 \u2013 Marina ) had developed a roadmap which was accepted by the state government to bring the railway project to passenger operations . The consortium , according to Mr Dabiri , in a final report , outlined their findings and proposed a roadmap to complete the civil infrastructure works and the Operation & Maintenance ( O&M ) infrastructure that will be needed for the commencement of passenger operation . According to him , \u201c Based on the final report submitted , the consortium of Alstom Transport SA France has been engaged for the procurement , engineering , construction , installation of Operation & Maintenance ( O&M ) moveable infrastructure and commissioning of railway systems towards the commencement of passenger operations for LRMT Blue Line project from Marina to Mile 2 . \u201d While highlighting the extent of works to be carried out by Alstom SA , Mr Dabiri said for ease of implementation , the work plan had been divided into two phases , with phase one aimed at demonstrating the non-public operation of the existing rolling stock before end of second quarter of 2019 . \u201c For this purpose , a track length of about 3.0 km from Iganmu Station to National Theatre will be electrified . This operation would be done with the rolling stocks already supplied for the Blue Line project . \u201c This phase would allow the completion of all the preliminary works that would lead to the financing of the main works in Phase two . Phase one will be fully financed by Lagos State Government through Internally Generated Revenue ( IGR ) . \u201c Phase two , which is expected to be completed in 39 months , would entail the provision and installation of railway operations ' systems for the project from Marina to Mile 2 and the delivery of a passenger - ready Lagos Blue Rail Line by 2022 , \u201d he said . Mr Dabiri further said that the current efforts of Governor Ambode 's administration on the rail project was to bring to fruition the State Government 's commitment to deliver a multi-modal transport system and transform the State 's public transportation landscape with the view to moving it closer to the achievement of the first integrated and multi-modal transport system in Nigeria . The LAMATA boss specifically appealed to businesses and Lagosians to trust the Akinwunmi Ambode 's administration to bring the Blue Rail Line to passenger operation by paying their taxes since the rail project is solely financed by the state government through its IGR . \u201c We had highlighted earlier that what we are doing currently to bring the rail project to passenger operation would be funded through IGR . This is your project ; it is designed to ease the movement of Lagosians , it is designed to improve and increase our competitiveness in the comity of smart cities , it is designed to improve our lifestyle and regenerate our environment . Let us support it , \u201d Mr Dabiri said . Responding , Guy Jean- Pierre , a Director of Alstom SA , thanked the state government for the confidence reposed in the firm and the opportunity given to partner with the state on the Blue Line Rail project . He assured that Alstom would work to ensure the delivery of the Blue Line to passenger operation by bringing on board required expertise and experience in rail system management .

Following a comprehensive review of the rail project , which ought to have commenced passenger operation but had been hindered by unforeseen third party issues and other challenges , the state government said the Marina to Mile 2 section of the project known as the Blue Line Rail , would now be ready for passenger operation by 2022 . The state government had engaged consultants to carry out a technical review and due diligence on the implementation of the project , which substantially had focused on civil works , and reported back to government that operation of the first phase may only commence in 2022 . Alstom SA France , a foreign firm with over 100 years of railway experience covering 60 countries , was subsequently engaged to review the report of the consultants , while the firm in its report agreed that the first phase of the rail project could only become operational in 2022 based on proposed funding pattern . Speaking at the signing of the agreement with Alstom SA , Managing Director of Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority ( LAMATA ) , Abiodun Dabiri , who signed on behalf of the state government , said the partnership was the result of the commitment of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode towards the transformation of public transportation in the state . He said a consortium of experts engaged by the state government to undertake a technical due diligence on the LRMT Blue Line Project ( Mile 2 \u2013 Marina ) had developed a roadmap which was accepted by the state government to bring the railway project to passenger operations . The consortium , according to Mr Dabiri , in a final report , outlined their findings and proposed a roadmap to complete the civil infrastructure works and the Operation & Maintenance ( O&M ) infrastructure that will be needed for the commencement of passenger operation . According to him , \u201c Based on the final report submitted , the consortium of Alstom Transport SA France has been engaged for the procurement , engineering , construction , installation of Operation & Maintenance ( O&M ) moveable infrastructure and commissioning of railway systems towards the commencement of passenger operations for LRMT Blue Line project from Marina to Mile 2 . \u201d While highlighting the extent of works to be carried out by Alstom SA , Mr Dabiri said for ease of implementation , the work plan had been divided into two phases , with phase one aimed at demonstrating the non-public operation of the existing rolling stock before end of second quarter of 2019 . \u201c For this purpose , a track length of about 3.0 km from Iganmu Station to National Theatre will be electrified . This operation would be done with the rolling stocks already supplied for the Blue Line project . \u201c This phase would allow the completion of all the preliminary works that would lead to the financing of the main works in Phase two . Phase one will be fully financed by Lagos State Government through Internally Generated Revenue ( IGR ) . \u201c Phase two , which is expected to be completed in 39 months , would entail the provision and installation of railway operations ' systems for the project from Marina to Mile 2 and the delivery of a passenger - ready Lagos Blue Rail Line by 2022 , \u201d he said . Mr Dabiri further said that the current efforts of Governor Ambode 's administration on the rail project was to bring to fruition the State Government 's commitment to deliver a multi-modal transport system and transform the State 's public transportation landscape with the view to moving it closer to the achievement of the first integrated and multi-modal transport system in Nigeria . The LAMATA boss specifically appealed to businesses and Lagosians to trust the Akinwunmi Ambode 's administration to bring the Blue Rail Line to passenger operation by paying their taxes since the rail project is solely financed by the state government through its IGR . \u201c We had highlighted earlier that what we are doing currently to bring the rail project to passenger operation would be funded through IGR . This is your project ; it is designed to ease the movement of Lagosians , it is designed to improve and increase our competitiveness in the comity of smart cities , it is designed to improve our lifestyle and regenerate our environment . Let us support it , \u201d Mr Dabiri said . Responding , Guy Jean- Pierre , a Director of Alstom SA , thanked the state government for the confidence reposed in the firm and the opportunity given to partner with the state on the Blue Line Rail project . He assured that Alstom would work to ensure the delivery of the Blue Line to passenger operation by bringing on board required expertise and experience in rail system management .

Advertisement When it was announced that the beloved TV series would be ending with its fifth season , fans worried that they would miss out on the end of the story . Thankfully , we have all since learned that there will be a sequel film to the series titled Seven Kings Must Die . The film is intended to serve as a \" standalone \" epilogue inspired by the final novels in the series by Bernard Cornwell : War of the Wolf , Sword of Kings and War Lord . Thanks to The Last Kingdom season 5 ending we have some idea of what direction this film will take the story , but many will be wondering whether we will ever get a full sixth season and why this was not the initial plan .. Uhtred of Bebbanburg star Alexander Dreymon and the series ' executive producer Nigel Marchant have revealed to RadioTimes.com why their current plan came about . The decision to end The Last Kingdom with season 5 actually dates back to when the show first went into development and a longterm plan for the overarching narrative was mapped out . At the time of the series premiere , only nine The Last Kingdom books had been published , with author Bernard Cornwell busy writing the 10th during filming on the television adaptation . As a result , the creative team had always intended for the show to wrap up after its fifth season , with Dreymon explaining that it certainly was n't cancelled as some viewers had feared . \" That press release was slightly misconstrued , \" he said . \" We had always planned for it to be five seasons only so it came as a surprise to no one really . When we started off there were only 10 books and so that was the arc that we had planned out ... I 'm quite happy with the way that it went . \" Executive producer Marchant said that the endpoint was a \" joint decision \" between production company Carnival and distributor Netflix , which he feels came at the \" right time \" . \" You always want to keep on top and improving season upon season and 10 hours is ... it 's a lot of story you tell within that and you have to be careful not to repeat , \" he explained in July 2021 . \" It 's always a challenge : how do we do a battle differently ? How do we make sure the battles are told through emotion and not just loads of people fighting that you do n't care about ? And how long can you keep going with those two themes without ever getting to a climax ? \" Marchant added : \" What we really wanted to do was finish [ in a way ] that everyone thought was satisfactory \u2013 which I hope we 've done \u2013 and that we had nearly 50 episodes that felt that you had a beginning , middle and end . I think it 's always nicer if you curate that , rather than it just finishes and you do n't finish telling the story . \" \" When we started shooting the show there were 10 books that Bernard Cornwell had written , and we had structured the show in a way that season 5 was always going to be the last season , \" said Dreymon at The Last Kingdom 's MCM London Comic - Con panel , hosted by RadioTimes.com writer David Craig . \" However , for a good while now we 've been in talks about maybe a little extension ... because it felt like it could n't quite yet be the end . And then we 've seen such a big appetite from the fans for an encore that we have decided , along with Netflix , to do a special which is going to be a ' movie version ' of the show and which we are going to be shooting next year [ 2022 ] . \" At the time of writing , Seven Kings Must Die is midway through filming in Hungary , with a number of cast members from the television series reprising their roles for the project . However , fans are advised not to get their hopes up for a full 10 - episode The Last Kingdom season 6 , as Marchant has pitched this sequel special as more like an epilogue to the main story than the start of a whole new era . \" Season 5 does feel like the end of the TV series , and the movie will be much more standalone , \" he said . \" It 'll be an extra treat for the fans of the TV series , but you could also watch it even if you 've never seen the TV show . \"","annotations":[{"text":"The Last Kingdom series","span":[43,65],"token_span":[9,12],"role":"Activity","label":"Activity","role_definition":"This role identifies the Activity that the Agent stops."},{"text":"Netflix","span":[1927,1933],"token_span":[368,368],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"This role identifies Agent that stops the Activity."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"The third , fourth and fifth , each with ten episodes , were released exclusively by its sole producer Netflix ; the BBC was no longer involved .

Thanks to The Last Kingdom season 5 ending we have some idea of what direction this film will take the story , but many will be wondering whether we will ever get a full sixth season and why this was not the initial plan .. Uhtred of Bebbanburg star Alexander Dreymon and the series ' executive producer Nigel Marchant have revealed to RadioTimes.com why their current plan came about . The decision to end The Last Kingdom with season 5 actually dates back to when the show first went into development and a longterm plan for the overarching narrative was mapped out . At the time of the series premiere , only nine The Last Kingdom books had been published , with author Bernard Cornwell busy writing the 10th during filming on the television adaptation . As a result , the creative team had always intended for the show to wrap up after its fifth season , with Dreymon explaining that it certainly was n't cancelled as some viewers had feared . \" That press release was slightly misconstrued , \" he said . \" We had always planned for it to be five seasons only so it came as a surprise to no one really . When we started off there were only 10 books and so that was the arc that we had planned out ... I 'm quite happy with the way that it went . \" Executive producer Marchant said that the endpoint was a \" joint decision \" between production company Carnival and distributor Netflix , which he feels came at the \" right time \" . \" You always want to keep on top and improving season upon season and 10 hours is ... it 's a lot of story you tell within that and you have to be careful not to repeat , \" he explained in July 2021 . \" It 's always a challenge : how do we do a battle differently ? How do we make sure the battles are told through emotion and not just loads of people fighting that you do n't care about ? And how long can you keep going with those two themes without ever getting to a climax ? \" Marchant added : \" What we really wanted to do was finish [ in a way ] that everyone thought was satisfactory \u2013 which I hope we 've done \u2013 and that we had nearly 50 episodes that felt that you had a beginning , middle and end . I think it 's always nicer if you curate that , rather than it just finishes and you do n't finish telling the story . \" \" When we started shooting the show there were 10 books that Bernard Cornwell had written , and we had structured the show in a way that season 5 was always going to be the last season , \" said Dreymon at The Last Kingdom 's MCM London Comic - Con panel , hosted by RadioTimes.com writer David Craig . \" However , for a good while now we 've been in talks about maybe a little extension ... because it felt like it could n't quite yet be the end . And then we 've seen such a big appetite from the fans for an encore that we have decided , along with Netflix , to do a special which is going to be a ' movie version ' of the show and which we are going to be shooting next year [ 2022 ] . \" At the time of writing , Seven Kings Must Die is midway through filming in Hungary , with a number of cast members from the television series reprising their roles for the project . However , fans are advised not to get their hopes up for a full 10 - episode The Last Kingdom season 6 , as Marchant has pitched this sequel special as more like an epilogue to the main story than the start of a whole new era . \" Season 5 does feel like the end of the TV series , and the movie will be much more standalone , \" he said . \" It 'll be an extra treat for the fans of the TV series , but you could also watch it even if you 've never seen the TV show . \"","annotations":[{"text":"Netflix","span":[1927,1933],"token_span":[368,368],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"This role identifies Agent that stops the Activity."},{"text":"The Last Kingdom series","span":[43,65],"token_span":[9,12],"role":"Activity","label":"Activity","role_definition":"This role identifies the Activity that the Agent stops."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"test"},{"instance_id":"EN-4067-1138-frame-Adjusting","frame":"Adjusting","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Agent changes a Part of a complex entity with regard to some Feature in order to achieve some Imposed_purpose affected by the Feature.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"In 2020 , Tama introduced the Sizzle Touch Drop Clutch .

But now anyone can serve up a buttered lobster freshly cooked in their own kitchen , safe in the knowledge that it has been humanely killed , thanks to a British entrepreneur . Simon Buckhaven has created a machine that takes less than a second to efficiently and painlessly zap a lobster , crab or other crustacea to death . The price \u2013 at \u00a3 2,500 \u2013 may deter some but many an animal lover or restaurant chef will think it a small price to pay for a cruelty - free death . Plus , according to the manufacturer , the CrustaStun also makes the meat taste better . Inside one of the little machines that are going on sale this week , a lobster takes just 0.3 seconds to die , whereas it can live for three minutes in boiling water . A crab takes even longer to die as it is boiled to death \u2013 up to four and a half minutes . After several trials here and in the US , Mr Buckhaven 's firm , Studham Technologies , in Bedfordshire , has developed a machine that takes five seconds to use , and meets health and safety and other regulations on both sides of the Atlantic . The entrepreneur is firmly in the \" yes \" camp in the old argument about whether lobsters feel pain . One side is that their nervous systems are not complex enough to experience what humans would recognise as pain , implying that , for a lobster , being placed in boiling water would be like being sent gently to sleep in a warm whirlpool bath . This conclusion was buttressed by research published in Norway in 2005 , but in November 2007 , Professor Robert Elwood , of Queen 's University , Belfast , published the results of an experiment which involved daubing acid on the antennae of prawns . The animals immediately reacted by touching the affected areas , a reaction consistent with experiencing pain , although other specialists in the same field argued that the prawns may simply have been cleaning their antennae , without suffering distress . Mr Buckhaven is in no doubt that research like Professor Elwood 's is conclusive , and means that the practice of subjecting crustaceans to a slow death will have to end . \" These are sentient animals , who feel pain and distress , and you should not boil them alive , or drown them in fresh water , or cut them in half while they 're alive , \" he said . \" A lot of people who love to eat lobster do not like preparing it at home because they have to cook it in boiling water . And restaurants are more frequently hearing questions from customers about how their lobster will be killed . \" He added that in one blind test , customers were given lobsters killed in boiling water and lobster that had died in a CrustaStun , and every participant said that they preferred the meat from the electrocuted animals . \" It was sweeter meat and better consistency , \" he said . \" If you eat an animal which had been under stress before it died , it affects the meat quality . \" However , a planned demonstration of the CrustaStun turned into an unmitigated disaster \u2013 not least for 1,800 lobsters . It was a charity event for 600 guests in Tucson , Arizona , whose organisers had consulted the animal welfare group Peta , to see if there would be any objection to having lobster on the menu . Peta said it would be acceptable , if the lobsters were killed in the CrustaStun machines rather than being boiled or drowned in fresh water . Peta bought two of the machines and paid for Mr Buckhaven to travel out to demonstrate them . The machines were shipped out separately . Sadly , the delivery company let them down , 1,800 lobsters died horribly , and the machines turned up in Tucson two days late . \" We were completely let down , and are suing to get the money back , \" Mr Buckhaven said . Despite that catastrophe , he is convinced that there will be a growing demand for his machines . His company is now offering two types of lobster zappers . The larger industrial models , which cost over \u00a3 60,000 each , are already in use in the UK , Ireland , Norway and Portugal . Some supermarkets are now stocking lobster only if it has been killed by electrocution .

But now anyone can serve up a buttered lobster freshly cooked in their own kitchen , safe in the knowledge that it has been humanely killed , thanks to a British entrepreneur . Simon Buckhaven has created a machine that takes less than a second to efficiently and painlessly zap a lobster , crab or other crustacea to death . The price \u2013 at \u00a3 2,500 \u2013 may deter some but many an animal lover or restaurant chef will think it a small price to pay for a cruelty - free death . Plus , according to the manufacturer , the CrustaStun also makes the meat taste better . Inside one of the little machines that are going on sale this week , a lobster takes just 0.3 seconds to die , whereas it can live for three minutes in boiling water . A crab takes even longer to die as it is boiled to death \u2013 up to four and a half minutes . After several trials here and in the US , Mr Buckhaven 's firm , Studham Technologies , in Bedfordshire , has developed a machine that takes five seconds to use , and meets health and safety and other regulations on both sides of the Atlantic . The entrepreneur is firmly in the \" yes \" camp in the old argument about whether lobsters feel pain . One side is that their nervous systems are not complex enough to experience what humans would recognise as pain , implying that , for a lobster , being placed in boiling water would be like being sent gently to sleep in a warm whirlpool bath . This conclusion was buttressed by research published in Norway in 2005 , but in November 2007 , Professor Robert Elwood , of Queen 's University , Belfast , published the results of an experiment which involved daubing acid on the antennae of prawns . The animals immediately reacted by touching the affected areas , a reaction consistent with experiencing pain , although other specialists in the same field argued that the prawns may simply have been cleaning their antennae , without suffering distress . Mr Buckhaven is in no doubt that research like Professor Elwood 's is conclusive , and means that the practice of subjecting crustaceans to a slow death will have to end . \" These are sentient animals , who feel pain and distress , and you should not boil them alive , or drown them in fresh water , or cut them in half while they 're alive , \" he said . \" A lot of people who love to eat lobster do not like preparing it at home because they have to cook it in boiling water . And restaurants are more frequently hearing questions from customers about how their lobster will be killed . \" He added that in one blind test , customers were given lobsters killed in boiling water and lobster that had died in a CrustaStun , and every participant said that they preferred the meat from the electrocuted animals . \" It was sweeter meat and better consistency , \" he said . \" If you eat an animal which had been under stress before it died , it affects the meat quality . \" However , a planned demonstration of the CrustaStun turned into an unmitigated disaster \u2013 not least for 1,800 lobsters . It was a charity event for 600 guests in Tucson , Arizona , whose organisers had consulted the animal welfare group Peta , to see if there would be any objection to having lobster on the menu . Peta said it would be acceptable , if the lobsters were killed in the CrustaStun machines rather than being boiled or drowned in fresh water . Peta bought two of the machines and paid for Mr Buckhaven to travel out to demonstrate them . The machines were shipped out separately . Sadly , the delivery company let them down , 1,800 lobsters died horribly , and the machines turned up in Tucson two days late . \" We were completely let down , and are suing to get the money back , \" Mr Buckhaven said . Despite that catastrophe , he is convinced that there will be a growing demand for his machines . His company is now offering two types of lobster zappers . The larger industrial models , which cost over \u00a3 60,000 each , are already in use in the UK , Ireland , Norway and Portugal . Some supermarkets are now stocking lobster only if it has been killed by electrocution .

Under the recently passed $ 1.9 trillion stimulus law , the federal government will pay the entire cost of unemployment benefits for the first week people are out of work . But Assembly Speaker Robin Vos suggested suspending the one - week waiting period for benefits might discourage people from getting back into the workforce . \" I think the problem is not the suspension of a one - week waiting period . It 's getting more people into the workforce to fill the huge number of jobs that are going unresponsive to employers who need folks , \" the Rochester Republican told reporters . Vos stressed that he had not talked to other Republicans who control the Legislature and said no final decisions have been made . Republicans a decade ago instituted the one - week waiting period to help shore up the state 's unemployment fund . They agreed to temporarily end it last year because the federal government began paying for benefits during the first week of unemployment during the coronavirus pandemic . The state 's one - week waiting period recently went back into effect because the federal aid for benefits was coming to an end . But the new stimulus law , known as the American Rescue Plan , will continue to have the federal government pay for the first week of benefits because the pandemic is ongoing . If the Wisconsin Legislature again suspends the waiting period , those who lose their jobs could receive hundreds of dollars during their first week of unemployment at no cost to the state or its employers . But Vos said suspending the one - week waiting period could have the \" unintended consequence \" of keeping people on the sidelines when businesses are looking for workers . Suspending the one - week waiting period would require the support of the Assembly and Senate , both of which are controlled by Republicans . Democratic Gov. Tony Evers backs the idea and has called for permanently ending the waiting period . Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu , a Republican from Oostburg , declined to say what he thought of suspending the waiting period as he stepped off the Senate floor after a session Tuesday . Democratic Rep. Daniel Riemer of Milwaukee said it was a bad idea to give up millions of dollars in federal aid that could help people as soon as they lose their jobs . \" The fact that you lose a job does n't mean you lose the requirement to pay rent , the requirement to pay your mortgage , the requirement to pay for day care , which is so expensive , or for groceries , \" he said . Wisconsin 's unemployment system has caused some of the state 's biggest problems throughout the pandemic . The state Department of Workforce Development was crushed by the high volume of claims at the beginning of the outbreak as unemployed Wisconsinites applied for benefits .

Under the recently passed $ 1.9 trillion stimulus law , the federal government will pay the entire cost of unemployment benefits for the first week people are out of work . But Assembly Speaker Robin Vos suggested suspending the one - week waiting period for benefits might discourage people from getting back into the workforce . \" I think the problem is not the suspension of a one - week waiting period . It 's getting more people into the workforce to fill the huge number of jobs that are going unresponsive to employers who need folks , \" the Rochester Republican told reporters . Vos stressed that he had not talked to other Republicans who control the Legislature and said no final decisions have been made . Republicans a decade ago instituted the one - week waiting period to help shore up the state 's unemployment fund . They agreed to temporarily end it last year because the federal government began paying for benefits during the first week of unemployment during the coronavirus pandemic . The state 's one - week waiting period recently went back into effect because the federal aid for benefits was coming to an end . But the new stimulus law , known as the American Rescue Plan , will continue to have the federal government pay for the first week of benefits because the pandemic is ongoing . If the Wisconsin Legislature again suspends the waiting period , those who lose their jobs could receive hundreds of dollars during their first week of unemployment at no cost to the state or its employers . But Vos said suspending the one - week waiting period could have the \" unintended consequence \" of keeping people on the sidelines when businesses are looking for workers . Suspending the one - week waiting period would require the support of the Assembly and Senate , both of which are controlled by Republicans . Democratic Gov. Tony Evers backs the idea and has called for permanently ending the waiting period . Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu , a Republican from Oostburg , declined to say what he thought of suspending the waiting period as he stepped off the Senate floor after a session Tuesday . Democratic Rep. Daniel Riemer of Milwaukee said it was a bad idea to give up millions of dollars in federal aid that could help people as soon as they lose their jobs . \" The fact that you lose a job does n't mean you lose the requirement to pay rent , the requirement to pay your mortgage , the requirement to pay for day care , which is so expensive , or for groceries , \" he said . Wisconsin 's unemployment system has caused some of the state 's biggest problems throughout the pandemic . The state Department of Workforce Development was crushed by the high volume of claims at the beginning of the outbreak as unemployed Wisconsinites applied for benefits . The department tried to quickly hire employees but struggled to implement new federal benefit programs with its outdated computer system . Thousands of unemployed people waited months for their payments , with some struggling to feed families , pay rent and keep the lights on . At one point , more than 100,000 claims were caught in the backlog . The department was able to catch up on the claims in December , but some applicants are still waiting for an adjudicator or judge to determine whether they qualify for benefits .

We 'll be focusing on recreational use and growing for personal use \u2014 if you 're a dealer and you get busted , that 's on you . Last time , we covered the essential bud - law you need to know for getting stoned in WA . This week : South Australia . Minor Possession and Expiation There 's a common misconception when it comes to cannabis law in SA , so let me clarify : weed is still very much illegal . To possess , smoke , or distribute it constitutes an offence under the Controlled Substances Act 1984 . That said , the expiation system in place there makes it far less of a risk to possess small amounts than in other states . Under the Expiation of Offences Act 1996 , simple cannabis offences can be expiated by a police officer . An expiation is a small fine , given in lieu of prosecution , to be paid within 28 days . They can be given for possession for the following : - Cultivating one cannabis plant without artificial enhancement ( non-hydro , no artificial lighting , no commercial fertilizers ) - Possession of up to 100 grams of cannabis - Possession of up to 20 grams of cannabis resin - Smoking cannabis ( except in a public place ) - Possession of smoking implements Expiation notices are subject to the following conditions : - The recipient must be aged 18 or over - They may relate to up to three offences arising from the same incident - They wo n't be given for charges of possession / cultivation for commercial purpose or supply , even if the total amount is less than the ' simple cannabis offence ' threshold - If given an expiation notice you may choose to opt for prosecution instead ( Dunno why you would ever do this , but maybe $ 300 is worth more to you than a criminal record ) Expiation fines are currently as follows based on the Controlled Substances ( Controlled Drugs , Precursors and Plants ) Regulations 2014 . Fine amounts : Possession : - Less than 25 grams of cannabis : $ 150 - Between 25 and 100 grams of cannabis : $ 300 - Less than 5 grams of resin : $ 150 - Between 5 and 20 grams of resin : $ 300 - Equipment for preparing or consuming cannabis or resin : $ 150 ( + $ 30 when accompanied by another simple cannabis offence ) Cultivation : - One cannabis plant : $ 300 Smoking / consumption - Smoking or consuming cannabis or resin ( except in a public place ) : $ 150 Expiation notices must be given if found committing those offences in SA , so you are relatively safe from prosecution so long as you keep your quantities low and do n't smoke in public places . And pay your expiation fines on time ! Taking more than 28 days will incur a late notice and another fine , any longer than that and you 're risking prosecution . Cultivation Once you move beyond one plant , or you start using ' artificial enhancement ' in your growing , you become subject to much harsher penalties in SA courts . Artificial enhancement is defined in the Controlled Substances Act ( 1984 ) as : - cultivation in a solution comprised wholly or principally of water enriched with nutrients ; or - cultivation involving the application of an artificial source of light or heat ; Quantities and maximum penalties for cultivation offences are as follows : - 1 plant ( no artificial enhancement ) : expiation notice & fine of $ 300 - 2 to 4 plants : $ 1000 fine and / or 6 months imprisonment - 6 to 9 plants : $ 2000 fine and / or 2 years imprisonment - trafficable quantity ( 10 to 19 plants ) : $ 75,000 fine and / or 15 years imprisonment - commercial quantity ( 20 to 99 plants ) : $ 500,000 and / or life imprisonment - large commercial quantity ( 100 + plants ) : $ 500,000 and / or life imprisonment These maximums are rarely if ever reached . Actual penalties tend to be significantly lower , except in cases involving organised crime or seriously negligent legal advice . Further Charges - Supply and low-level cultivation offences ( growing hydro ) will be prosecuted in SA , and each carry a maximum $ 2000 fine and / or 2 years imprisonment . - Charges for trafficking or cultivating cannabis are tried summarily ( by a judge without a jury ) in the Magistrates Court . If the sentence is likely to exceed 5 years , cases will be transferred to the District Court . You 'll be indicted and tried before a jury . The maximum penalty for an offence in this case is up to $ 50,000 and 10 years imprisonment \u2014 $ 75,000 and 15 years for an aggravated offence . - Trafficking , sale , or cultivation or a commercial or ' large commercial ' quantity can carry sentences of up to $ 200,000 and 25 years imprisonment . Charges in this range are generally applied for entire grow houses , so recreational stoners have nothing to worry about here . - If an expiation notice is not paid , simple cannabis offence charges typically carry a $ 500 - $ 1000 maximum fine . The criminal record that comes with prosecution will likely be much worse than the damage to your bank account . Case Studies Due to the non-prosecutorial nature of South Australian cannabis legislation , small offences are hard to study . I 've included two examples of larger offences listed in the courts \u2014 useful examples of the sorts of sentences that are handed down for larger - scale possession and trafficking charges .

I am a 39 year old male of average build and reasonable health . I have no allergies , that I know of , but have had an allergic reaction to a previous spider bite ( Steatoda grossa ) . I had drunk around three pints of Guinness earlier that evening . I have been diagnosed as Asthmatic , but have only ever had to use my inhaler 5 - 6 times in the 12 + years since my asthma was first diagnosed . 10th September 1:55 am . Tingling sensation in finger , feels hot ( due to the squeezing ? ) , tip swollen , numb and with slight reddening , only a shade or two darker than the finger next to it , not noticeably different . The spider was captured and returned to her container and books containing information on spider bites were gathered , ( there would be a good chance I would have more information than the people attending to me at the Hospital , as spider bites are a rare occurrence ) . I then woke Lesley up to tell her the good news . 2:35 am . We set off to Hospital , just in case . 2:50 am . Slight pain in left elbow , finger almost stiff - feels as if I have wrenched my finger back and has the same painful pins and needles feeling one gets when the hands have been in the cold too long . 3:00 am . Arrive at hospital . Slight pain under arm and triceps . Under Hospital recommendation I take two aspirin , these were taken at 3:30 am . While at hospital the nurse and I looked in Toxbase where no mention of any spider bites was to be found . We then rang Guys Hospital where another nurse found some reference to spider bites , but not Poecilotheria . All we had as a guide was the comments in Schultz & Schultz and Verdez , where one person bitten by P. regalis had a sore finger and the other was in hospital for five weeks - nothing really sound for the nursing staff to work from . Since I had been bitten almost two hours ago and was still standing , the nursing staff decided to administer two aspirin to relieve the pain ( uncomfortable , but not agonising ) . 3:45 am . Left hospital . At this point in time there was no visible tracking from the bite ; no sense of euphoria , nausea ; no hallucinations ; no bowel movements and no sign of any necropsy around the bite ( I remained calm at all times ) . When I returned home I had a cup of coffee . No dressing or cream / ointment was ever put on the wound . 4:30 am . Went to bed . The sub-adult , female P. pederseni was feeding and showed no signs of stress . 4:00 pm . Finger and knuckle was still stiff and had that wrenched , pins and needles feeling . I did some gardening and found it painful to grip with my left hand , but this did not prevent me using my hand . 11:30 pm . I had a warm bath and took my watch off ( I always keep my watch on , except for swimming and bathing . I like to wear my watch tight on my wrist ) . 12:55 am . The knuckle of my wedding finger was stiff ( exercise from gardening or venom ? ) . I then went to bed . 11th September , 8:30 am . The finger was still stiff as I set off to work . 11:00 am . Felt flu like . My breathing was a bit heavy and my left armpit glands were swollen and painful . 2:00 pm . Requested to be taken back to hospital as my breathing was now much heavier . 2:20 pm . Back in hospital we tried to get in touch with Jean Lou Dorne at Southampton University ( the other people who I would have sought help from were in India ) . 4:30 pm . Discovered Jean Lou was on holiday , the person I spoke to suggested I might be having an allergic reaction to the venom . I explained this to Andy , the nurse attending me , he agreed with this and prescribed Cetirizine ( 10mg tablets ) , and Prednisolone ( 5mg tablets ) a steroid and an anti-histamine respectively . I had to take 10mg of each tablet each day , for five days . 12th September , 10:30 am . Woke up to find that my finger was still stiff . Most of the pain had gone , but I felt very rough and still flu like . I walked up to the Post Office to pick up a parcel ( the walk was around 600 m , but up-hill ) . When I got to the Post Office I could only pick up one package and had to go home for proof of identity for the other one . As I returned to the Post Office I had a mild asthma attack and had to sit down for 20 minutes , and use my inhaler , before I could pick up the parcel . I was given a lift home where , after a drink of water and my pills , I sat down and fell asleep . 4:30 pm . Woke up , still feeling pretty groggy . For the next day I refrained from any strenuous activity . I felt worn out and my stool was of a softer consistency than normal . This could have been due to the steroids and anti-histamines ( there was also no sign of blood or mucus ) . My urine was normal too - no blood or marked discoloration . My breathing was still noticeable , but not as heavy as before . I did not feel like eating and went off even mildly spicy food . I regularly used my inhaler , both the blue and the brown ones . 15th September . Woke up early with pain in my lower sides - could be due either to a mixture of German beer and Tequila , or more allergic reactions to the venom . ~ 1:30 pm . I felt as if I had really bad heartburn . I then had a drink and took the last of my pills . ~ 1:45 pm . Felt slightly better . 5:30 pm . The little finger on my left hand was flicking under the wedding finger at the knuckle . I found this painful , but bearable and had to push the knuckle back out again . In the following minutes this happened three more times , only staying out in its normal position on the third push out . I then massaged my finger . 17th September 9:05 am . Woke up with severe cramp in my lower , left leg and to a lesser degree , in my right foot behind the toes . 10:45 am . Attended a Doctors appointment . The cramp in my left leg was still there . A urine sample was also given . By now I was starting to feel less flu like . As I had no steroids or anti-histamine to take I asked the Doctor for a re-prescription , which was declined . Every time I stretched or yawned , I could feel some of my muscles tighten up almost cramp like . 18th September . Back to work . My finger was still a little stiff and I felt better , but my leg muscles were still not fully relaxed causing me to walk with a slight limp ( right foot still hurt too ) . 19th September , ~ 6:00 pm . I managed to speak to Jean Lou , who agreed that I had had an allergic reaction to the spiders venom . It was suggested that I take Ibuprofen , as an anti inflammatory . He also informed me that the allergic reaction could last a couple of weeks . I started taking the Ibuprofen that night and continued for the next couple of days . By the evening of the 21st I was no longer walking with a limp as my calf muscle was now back to normal . Although I still had the pain in my right foot , I could feel it was residing .

All eight ferry employees - including a husband - and - wife team in Chester - Hadlyme - received notices Thursday that their positions will be eliminated as of Aug. 25 , Chester - Hadlyme ferry employees said Thursday . But do n't expect the ferries to run until then ; they 'll be shut down a few days before that in order to get the boats off the water and store them , likely for good , said John Marshall , master captain of the Chester - Hadlyme ferry . \" If you 're going to take it out of service , it needs to go somewhere . It ca n't just sit , \" Marshall said . Department of Transportation spokesman Kevin Nursick would not confirm news of the layoffs and referred all questions to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy 's office . The layoffs are part of Malloy 's plan to reduce the state work force by about 13 percent to fill a $ 1.6 billion hole in the state budget . The state today will unveil what the 6,560 job eliminations - including 884 in the DOT alone - will mean to state services . The DOT 's maritime manager , Chuck Beck , handed to the Chester - Hadlyme ferry 's five full - time employees letters detailing the job cuts during a meeting at noon Thursday , said Tom Darcy , one of three ferry captains who has a combined 22 years on both state ferries . Rocky Hill - Glastonbury 's three ferry employees received elimination notices earlier in the day , said Darcy 's wife Diane Darcy , a first mate in Chester - Hadlyme with 17 years on the job . The Darcys had been worried about losing their jobs since last year , when they first got word that the ferries were on a list of possible budget cuts . Diane Darcy 's first thoughts upon receiving the layoff notice Thursday were : How would they pay for their daughter 's last year of college ? Would they be able to afford their mortgage and keep their house on Ferry Road in Hadlyme ? But ultimately , she said , the disappointment Thursday was n't about the job losses . \" The saddest part of it is , they 're going to close this thing , and it 's never going to come back , \" she said . \" It 's not going to be there for our kids , it 's not going to be there for their kids , as it has been for 242 years . \" An illustrious past When Jonathan Warner started running the Chester - Hadlyme ferry in 1769 , it was pushed across the river with long poles .

All eight ferry employees - including a husband - and - wife team in Chester - Hadlyme - received notices Thursday that their positions will be eliminated as of Aug. 25 , Chester - Hadlyme ferry employees said Thursday .

The layoffs are part of Malloy 's plan to reduce the state work force by about 13 percent to fill a $ 1.6 billion hole in the state budget . The state today will unveil what the 6,560 job eliminations - including 884 in the DOT alone - will mean to state services . The DOT 's maritime manager , Chuck Beck , handed to the Chester - Hadlyme ferry 's five full - time employees letters detailing the job cuts during a meeting at noon Thursday , said Tom Darcy , one of three ferry captains who has a combined 22 years on both state ferries . Rocky Hill - Glastonbury 's three ferry employees received elimination notices earlier in the day , said Darcy 's wife Diane Darcy , a first mate in Chester - Hadlyme with 17 years on the job . The Darcys had been worried about losing their jobs since last year , when they first got word that the ferries were on a list of possible budget cuts . Diane Darcy 's first thoughts upon receiving the layoff notice Thursday were : How would they pay for their daughter 's last year of college ? Would they be able to afford their mortgage and keep their house on Ferry Road in Hadlyme ? But ultimately , she said , the disappointment Thursday was n't about the job losses . \" The saddest part of it is , they 're going to close this thing , and it 's never going to come back , \" she said . \" It 's not going to be there for our kids , it 's not going to be there for their kids , as it has been for 242 years . \" An illustrious past When Jonathan Warner started running the Chester - Hadlyme ferry in 1769 , it was pushed across the river with long poles .

In doing so , he questions the validity of our modern views of landscape and nature . This article is adapted from Gerard Reichel - Dolmatoff 's opening address to the First International Congress of Ethnobiology , which took place in Belem Do Para , Brazil , in July 1988 . It was published in The Ecologist Volume 29 Number 4 , July 1999 . Coming from Colombia , I can say that I come from the head - waters of the Amazon . When I leave the country , I fly over its many arms and branches stretching out from this great body of water . In saying this I have used the vocabulary of anatomy . In speaking of the river I have mentioned its head , its body , and its arms . Many languages use anatomical terms when describing landscape features , but most people , when being reminded of this fact , would find themselves at a loss when asked to explain the reasons for this choice of words . To people belonging to a scientific , technological , rationalistic age , it does not make much sense to use such animistic terminology , to speak of a river mouth , of the body of a lake , or the foothills of a mountain . If we come to think of it , there is something archaic , something romantic about this kind of language . Every part of the Indians ' dress is imbued with significance . \" Herbert Grade / Still pictures . But the Indians can tell us what is meant by all this , and we should heed the Indian words because they convey to us the true meaning of these terms , a meaning we have lost in the course of our frantic advance towards what we call progress . To most Colombian Indians , and especially to those of the north - west Amazon , the river is a human body , a living organism . The river is life itself , stretched out in a linear sequence of vital events , between two power spots : the headwaters and the river mouth . There has always been something strangely enticing about headwaters the world over . They are thought to be the sources of great energies , the sources of wisdom , the spots where essential transformations may occur under the guardianship of benevolent nature spirits . According to the Indians , people who live at the headwaters of a river are more tradition - oriented ; they have more esoteric knowledge than others . Besides , there is more wildlife at the headwaters and so they are good hunting grounds . But hunting , of course , is not devoid of danger because all game animals stand under the protection of powerful spirits that might cause harm to the hunter who kills too many of their species . So the headwaters are very sacred ; they are a very special part of a river drainage . The other extreme of the river 's lifeline is its mouth . The true power of a river is said to reside at its mouth . It is thought that both the headwaters and the mouth of a river are enclosed by invisible boundaries forming a hexagonal space , modelled on a rock crystal . The hexagon of a river mouth is larger and more powerful than that of the headwaters . When leaving the hexagonal space of the river mouth , shamans say that one has become a transformed person , that one is better and wiser , that from now on one will avoid noisy places and bad company . The Indians say that the river is life : this idea is expressed in many images . In the first place , in many Creation Myths , embryo - genesis is said to have taken place in a lake , in a riverbed , in a deep pool of the river . The slow evolution of embryonic and foetal development took place in a strictly sequential line of womb-like pools in which the incipient being acquired the faculties that made it human . In another image , the river is a model of ethnogenesis , of cultural origins . The Tukano Indians call themselves Anaconda people and believe that mankind was born at the river mouth and then travelled upstream in a huge canoe shaped like an anaconda . At certain spots , people went ashore and , one by one , acquired the fundamental institutions of their society and culture . There is a spot where they danced for the first time ; another spot where they learned the first songs ; a spot where they cleared the first fields ; a spot where they built the first maloca ; another spot where they had their first hallucinatory experience ; a spot where the rules of exogamy were established . In this manner the entire river landscape comes alive , because every spot along the river has its name , its place in myths and visions , its place in genealogies and its particular significance to the passer - by . Every bend in the river is a reminder of the great serpent 's coils and , at the same time , the anaconda of mankind 's and nature 's origin is a projection of the Milky Way . In another image , the river is a model for individual adult life , a metaphor which is explained in the following terms : a river always adapts its course to the relief of the landscape by flowing along its deepest parts : by sheer gravity it hollows out its bed , by moulding itself around mountains and hills , and across plains and swamps . This is how a person 's life should be : a slow process of adaptation to whatever circumstances that might arise . When the river meets an obstacle , a range of hills or a huge rock , it gently flows around it : but when it arrives at an abrupt drop , a steep decline of the surface , then it shoots straight ahead and throws itself in thundering falls and rapids over the boulders , only to expand again peaceably after it has reached flat ground . This is the way life ought to be . It should adapt itself , it must avoid head - on collisions , but it should also be prepared to run risks and push straight ahead until the landscape opens up again and the current flows undisturbed . The river is life because water is life . In some languages of the north - west Amazon , the word for river or water is the same as the word for health , for medicine . When the Indians see stagnant , polluted waters they say the river is ill : but when the current is swift and clear the river is healthy . When a man works hard and perspires profusely he is in good health because then \" the water circulates \" , as the Indians say . On a higher level of abstraction , the river becomes a model of man 's process of spiritual development . It is what the Indians call \" the path \" , what other religions or philosophies would call tao , the Way to Perfection , to fulfilment , to oblivion . In fact , in the shamanic idiom , the Vaup\u00e9s river is called \" river of transformation \" . We all have been marked by a cheap stereotype of Amazonian Indians : a man or a family peacefully paddling a canoe . But to the Indians , the meaning of this picture is immensely more complex . River travel is life but it is much more than life . On the river , man finds food ; it is there he meets his kinsmen and where he meets women ; it is on the river that he listens to the sounds of the waters and the forests and , often , it is on the river that he meets his death . River travel , the image of man penetrating upriver , over rapids and falls , over whirlpools and from one bend of the river to another , constitutes a recurrent visionary theme in dreams , hallucinations and myths . And then there is the forest . The forest has different dimensions ; it offers other resources and all of these have their spirit-owners and therefore require different behavioural norms . Above all , there are the game animals . Between the hunter and the animals he kills , there exists a relationship of reciprocity . The spirits of dead or frightened animals take their revenge by causing illness to the hunter and his family . In fact , the animals are \" hunters \" in their own right , in that they \" hunt \" people with diseases , accidents and nightmares . In order to establish and maintain a viable relationship between the hunter and the hunted , people must observe many dietary and sexual restrictions . The former have two complementary functions : on the one hand they act as controls , as deterrents to over-hunting ; on the other hand , they serve to mask human body odours . The consumption of peppers , for example , or the smoke of burning pitch will make the game animals disregard any human scent while the consumption of fatty or oily substances \" makes the hunter visible \" ( as the Indians say ) by his strong body odour . To the Indians of the north - west Amazon , the river and the forest are living organisms , kept alive and fertile by the cosmic energy of the Sun Father . This father figure is in continuous exchange with our Earth , which is a female principle . Between the two - solar energy and the Earth 's fertility potential - exists a circuit ; whatever man subtracts from it for his sustenance , be it fishing , hunting or harvesting , he must return by saving energy through personal sacrifice . This principle of \" saving \" is reflected in the conscious and planned conservation of natural resources . Must adult people are quite aware of this principle , but the true power of planning and decision - making in these ecological matters lies in the hands of shamans and elders . I have seen shamans carefully measuring out the adequate amount of fish poison to be put in a creek ; I have heard them interpret dreams in terms of game conservation , explaining that the frightening appearance in a dream , of a certain animal , was a warning that the species was being over-hunted . Shamans will control the felling of trees , the firing of clearings ; they will control house construction , canoe making , the brewing of beer , the processes of daily food preparation , and a great multitude of other activities . In the evening , the men will sit around their fires and talk , and in these nightly conversations they will refer to the change of seasons , the appearing in the sky , the water level and the current of the rivers and creeks , the animals they have seen and heard , the fruits that are ripening in the fields or in the forest . Every few weeks there will be a slight change in the subject matter of these nightly talks , and the seasonal cycle or rainy or dry months will mark major changes in emphasis . There will he talk of bird migrations and of fish runs ; fields must he fired and planted . And night after night people talk while the shamans and elders listen and occasionally ask some questions . In the shamans ' minds , all this information will be organised into structured knowledge which henceforward , for the next few weeks , determines their activities , be they expressed in ritual , in recommending hunting strategies or in arranging social gatherings . For each season of the year , for each distinct shorter time - span , and for each ecosystem , all behavioural norms have to be re-adapted and co-ordinated anew . And this is why the Indians ' knowledge is so vital . The great \" energy \" potential of soils , plants , game animals and fish has to he redistributed to the cosmic energy circuit by rituals , recitals , myths and admonitions which , in their totality , prescribe a way of life . If observed in their full context , these norms constitute an integrated system . For thousands of years , the Amazon Basin has been inhabited by Indians who knew how to conserve their habitat ; we have archaeological evidence for their demographic density and the cultural inventiveness of these peoples . Of course , I am quite aware of the fact that , occasionally , the Indians have contributed to the destruction and degradation of their lands , especially when acting under the pressure of encroaching mestizo peasants , but as a general rule they have managed their natural environment with ecologically - sound land use planning . But the pressure of outside forces upon the Amazon environment is increasing day by day . In the course of my travels , and of long years of field experience in Colombia , I have seen many irreparable changes in the natural environment brought about by human agency ; I have seen the ancient deserts of central Asia and I have seen the rapid expansion of modern deserts on the plains and mountains of Colombia . But no single case has impressed me more than what is happening , and what might be happening , in the Amazon Basin . In speaking of Colombian Indians , I have mentioned some isolated customs ; some animistic beliefs and shamanistic images such as might be described for many aboriginal societies of the tropical rainforest or the Andes . But what I want to emphasise is this : these beliefs and attitudes toward life , these visions of the universe , these hundreds of little things a person does or thinks or avoids , form a highly - structured order . In myth and ritual , in conversation and daily activities , the Indians express deeply - felt beliefs . During an Indian 's entire life , there is a constant , more or less conscious , interplay between the individual and the way in which he perceives the environment . There are shapes and colours , movements and gestures , sounds and smells ; there are different temperatures , different flavours to taste , things to touch , air to breathe . There is the power of the spoken word , the rhythm of music , the bond of kinship . All these manifold sensations , perceptions and feelings are consistently coded and carry specific meanings , the total message of which is life - a well - adapted life . Every single musical instrument , every single feather in a headdress , every dance - step or body gesture is imbued with a specific meaning . And to these are added dietary restrictions , the rules of food processing , hunting and fishing , the clearing of a field , the firing of a clay vessel or the manufacture of a basket . And then there are dreams and visions , visions induced by the controlled use of hallucinogenic drugs , or by deep meditation ; and from these visions , a person awakes with the certainty that what he has seen or heard and felt in that other dimension was true . The sounds of the river and the forest , at different times of day or night , may he warnings or encouragements ; the screech of a parrot , the eyespot pattern on a fish tail , the smell of rotten wood or of an aromatic herb may determine a man 's activities and thought for a day or a week . In this manner the person is continuously exposed to messages which , in all essence , are of a biological nature because they mainly refer to the following rules : to find the right person to marry , to find the right food to eat , and to obtain both in the right way , without upsetting the balance - \" the energy - circuit \" - that links man to his society and his environment . How to read the signals the environment is sending out , a person has to learn through myth and ritual , through the long recitals of genealogies , the casting of spells , and above all , through the nightlong conversations of shamans and elders who are the true suppliers and transmitters of knowledge made wisdom . We should never underestimate this learning process , because it is an exacting mental discipline which eventually enables people to live in nature and with nature , and in society . Our cosmovision is based upon our science ; the Indians ' is based upon their knowledge . Of course , we want to continue in our world which , for better or for worse , is our creation . But in order to live in it , here , today , tomorrow and in the future , we need the Indian 's knowledge . And here I am referring not only to the practical knowledge of the Indians , to the sort of things a peasant knows . What I am trying to say is that the Indians ' way of life reveals to us the possibility of a separate strategy of cultural development ; in other words , it presents us with alternatives on an intellectual level and on a philosophical level . We should keep in mind these alternative cognitive models . The conservation of the Amazonian is not a visionary scheme of ecologists and romanticising anthropologists ; it is a vital necessity for mankind on a global scale : for the study of biological evolution , the study of soil - plant co-evolution , the study of species diversity ; to understand the linguistic , ethnographic , and biological diversity of human societies . We need the Amazon for its enormous human potential , quite apart from its economic or technological promises . Up to this point , I have been writing this article as a humanist , as an intellectual , as an anthropologist who is profoundly concerned about the future of the Indians and their natural environment . But now I shall begin to write as a rationalist too : as a person who is acutely aware of the realities of our present times , and who knows that the future lies in the hands of the intelligentsia , of the technologists and bureaucrats . It is they who have the power , and according to them the Indians are primitives who have to be integrated ; according to them , nature is something that has to he exploited for the benefit of man . We may know that we need the Indians ; we may know that the ruthless exploitation of natural resources has limits ; but the leading intelligentsia and their development agencies recognise no limits to their all - embracing technology . We have to be realistic , and accept the fact that the Indian world is on the wane . The Amazon basin and many , many other , formerly remote , regions of the Third World are being opened to outside influences and to technological development . In some regions this process will be slower and less turbulent than in others ; some aboriginal societies will he able to re-adapt , but others will become profoundly modified , and some will perish altogether , biologically , culturally , linguistically . As anthropologists and biologists , we know only too well that these changes are part of the historical scheme of things . These are disturbing thoughts , to say the least , and I wish I could be more positive when thinking of the future of rainforest Indians and aboriginal peoples in general . But in fitly y ears , I have seen too many traditions being lost ; I have seen entire tribes disappear ; I have seen too much misery among gentle , helpless people . Although I know that the Indians ' world is on the wane , I believe that this knowledge does not exempt us from certain obligations . So , here , I shall attempt to suggest a few approaches to these problems ; I shall try to make an effort to envisage a better future for the Indians , by suggesting a few personal ideas . In the first place , I think we should make a combined effort to study the Indians ' knowledge of their biotype , taking into account not only our , but above all their , concepts of ecosystems . Every square kilometre of forest contains a library of important biological , cultural and psychological information , and if we study it in the company of the Indians our insights in all these fields will be enormously enriched . The death of an old Indian who never had the chance to share with us his knowledge of the forest and the river is the equivalent of a whole library disappearing . If we undertake this study alone , we will get a mere inventory but if we work together with the Indians our insights will be greatly enriched by a kind of knowledge which , at present , still lies beyond our experience . For 500 years we have witnessed and played along with , the destruction of the Indians ; now we are witnessing the destruction of the natural habitat . What are we waiting for ? There can also be no doubt that as anthropologists , biologists and ecologists we possess an enormous amount of information , or practical field experience , and of the many forms of human vulnerability and of the destruction of the natural environment . By transforming this information into practical knowledge , in a manner that would make it understandable and convincing to national leaders and planning agencies , we can influence the process of decision - making ; we can convince those in power of the biological and social necessity to Conserve these lands ; and we can convince them of the dignity and value of our Indian societies . It is not sufficient to say that what we owe to the Indians is potatoes , maize and quinine . It is not sufficient to retell their myths and tales in florid Portuguese or Spanish or to stage their dances in a pseudo-Indian setting on television . What we must show is the Indian 's philosophy of life , their cosmogonic and cosmological schemes , their ethical and aesthetical attitudes . What we must show is their courage of choice , their option of other ways of life , different from ours ; the courage and genius of having built their societies , their cultures based upon an astonishing combination of realism and imagery .","annotations":[{"text":"A View from the Headwaters","span":[4,29],"token_span":[2,6],"role":"Medium","label":"Medium","role_definition":"The written or spoken material that contains a message that potentially influences the Addressee towards the Content."},{"text":"Gerardo Reichel - Dolmatoff","span":[90,116],"token_span":[15,18],"role":"Speaker","label":"Speaker","role_definition":"The person who intends through the use of language to get another person to act."},{"text":"the validity of our modern views of landscape and nature","span":[234,289],"token_span":[42,51],"role":"Topic","label":"Topic","role_definition":"What the communication is about."},{"text":"The Ecologist Volume 29 Number 4","span":[502,533],"token_span":[91,96],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the Speaker attemtps susaion on an Addressee."},{"text":"July 1999","span":[537,545],"token_span":[98,99],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the lobbying occurs."},{"text":"heed the Indian words","span":[1596,1616],"token_span":[312,315],"role":"Content","label":"Content","role_definition":"The wish for action on the Addressee's part that the Speaker expresses."},{"text":"Colombian Indians","span":[1778,1794],"token_span":[348,349],"role":"Salient_entity","label":"Salient_entity","role_definition":"An entity which the Speaker believes should participate in the action."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"Ecological approaches and systems theory Gerardo Reichel - Dolmatoff relates these concepts to developments in the ways that modern science ( systems theory , ecology , new approaches in anthropology and archeology ) treats causality in a less linear fashion .

In doing so , he questions the validity of our modern views of landscape and nature . This article is adapted from Gerard Reichel - Dolmatoff 's opening address to the First International Congress of Ethnobiology , which took place in Belem Do Para , Brazil , in July 1988 . It was published in The Ecologist Volume 29 Number 4 , July 1999 . Coming from Colombia , I can say that I come from the head - waters of the Amazon . When I leave the country , I fly over its many arms and branches stretching out from this great body of water . In saying this I have used the vocabulary of anatomy . In speaking of the river I have mentioned its head , its body , and its arms . Many languages use anatomical terms when describing landscape features , but most people , when being reminded of this fact , would find themselves at a loss when asked to explain the reasons for this choice of words . To people belonging to a scientific , technological , rationalistic age , it does not make much sense to use such animistic terminology , to speak of a river mouth , of the body of a lake , or the foothills of a mountain . If we come to think of it , there is something archaic , something romantic about this kind of language . Every part of the Indians ' dress is imbued with significance . \" Herbert Grade / Still pictures . But the Indians can tell us what is meant by all this , and we should heed the Indian words because they convey to us the true meaning of these terms , a meaning we have lost in the course of our frantic advance towards what we call progress . To most Colombian Indians , and especially to those of the north - west Amazon , the river is a human body , a living organism . The river is life itself , stretched out in a linear sequence of vital events , between two power spots : the headwaters and the river mouth . There has always been something strangely enticing about headwaters the world over . They are thought to be the sources of great energies , the sources of wisdom , the spots where essential transformations may occur under the guardianship of benevolent nature spirits . According to the Indians , people who live at the headwaters of a river are more tradition - oriented ; they have more esoteric knowledge than others . Besides , there is more wildlife at the headwaters and so they are good hunting grounds . But hunting , of course , is not devoid of danger because all game animals stand under the protection of powerful spirits that might cause harm to the hunter who kills too many of their species . So the headwaters are very sacred ; they are a very special part of a river drainage . The other extreme of the river 's lifeline is its mouth . The true power of a river is said to reside at its mouth . It is thought that both the headwaters and the mouth of a river are enclosed by invisible boundaries forming a hexagonal space , modelled on a rock crystal . The hexagon of a river mouth is larger and more powerful than that of the headwaters . When leaving the hexagonal space of the river mouth , shamans say that one has become a transformed person , that one is better and wiser , that from now on one will avoid noisy places and bad company . The Indians say that the river is life : this idea is expressed in many images . In the first place , in many Creation Myths , embryo - genesis is said to have taken place in a lake , in a riverbed , in a deep pool of the river . The slow evolution of embryonic and foetal development took place in a strictly sequential line of womb-like pools in which the incipient being acquired the faculties that made it human . In another image , the river is a model of ethnogenesis , of cultural origins . The Tukano Indians call themselves Anaconda people and believe that mankind was born at the river mouth and then travelled upstream in a huge canoe shaped like an anaconda . At certain spots , people went ashore and , one by one , acquired the fundamental institutions of their society and culture . There is a spot where they danced for the first time ; another spot where they learned the first songs ; a spot where they cleared the first fields ; a spot where they built the first maloca ; another spot where they had their first hallucinatory experience ; a spot where the rules of exogamy were established . In this manner the entire river landscape comes alive , because every spot along the river has its name , its place in myths and visions , its place in genealogies and its particular significance to the passer - by . Every bend in the river is a reminder of the great serpent 's coils and , at the same time , the anaconda of mankind 's and nature 's origin is a projection of the Milky Way . In another image , the river is a model for individual adult life , a metaphor which is explained in the following terms : a river always adapts its course to the relief of the landscape by flowing along its deepest parts : by sheer gravity it hollows out its bed , by moulding itself around mountains and hills , and across plains and swamps . This is how a person 's life should be : a slow process of adaptation to whatever circumstances that might arise . When the river meets an obstacle , a range of hills or a huge rock , it gently flows around it : but when it arrives at an abrupt drop , a steep decline of the surface , then it shoots straight ahead and throws itself in thundering falls and rapids over the boulders , only to expand again peaceably after it has reached flat ground . This is the way life ought to be . It should adapt itself , it must avoid head - on collisions , but it should also be prepared to run risks and push straight ahead until the landscape opens up again and the current flows undisturbed . The river is life because water is life . In some languages of the north - west Amazon , the word for river or water is the same as the word for health , for medicine . When the Indians see stagnant , polluted waters they say the river is ill : but when the current is swift and clear the river is healthy . When a man works hard and perspires profusely he is in good health because then \" the water circulates \" , as the Indians say . On a higher level of abstraction , the river becomes a model of man 's process of spiritual development . It is what the Indians call \" the path \" , what other religions or philosophies would call tao , the Way to Perfection , to fulfilment , to oblivion . In fact , in the shamanic idiom , the Vaup\u00e9s river is called \" river of transformation \" . We all have been marked by a cheap stereotype of Amazonian Indians : a man or a family peacefully paddling a canoe . But to the Indians , the meaning of this picture is immensely more complex . River travel is life but it is much more than life . On the river , man finds food ; it is there he meets his kinsmen and where he meets women ; it is on the river that he listens to the sounds of the waters and the forests and , often , it is on the river that he meets his death . River travel , the image of man penetrating upriver , over rapids and falls , over whirlpools and from one bend of the river to another , constitutes a recurrent visionary theme in dreams , hallucinations and myths . And then there is the forest . The forest has different dimensions ; it offers other resources and all of these have their spirit-owners and therefore require different behavioural norms . Above all , there are the game animals . Between the hunter and the animals he kills , there exists a relationship of reciprocity . The spirits of dead or frightened animals take their revenge by causing illness to the hunter and his family . In fact , the animals are \" hunters \" in their own right , in that they \" hunt \" people with diseases , accidents and nightmares . In order to establish and maintain a viable relationship between the hunter and the hunted , people must observe many dietary and sexual restrictions . The former have two complementary functions : on the one hand they act as controls , as deterrents to over-hunting ; on the other hand , they serve to mask human body odours . The consumption of peppers , for example , or the smoke of burning pitch will make the game animals disregard any human scent while the consumption of fatty or oily substances \" makes the hunter visible \" ( as the Indians say ) by his strong body odour . To the Indians of the north - west Amazon , the river and the forest are living organisms , kept alive and fertile by the cosmic energy of the Sun Father . This father figure is in continuous exchange with our Earth , which is a female principle . Between the two - solar energy and the Earth 's fertility potential - exists a circuit ; whatever man subtracts from it for his sustenance , be it fishing , hunting or harvesting , he must return by saving energy through personal sacrifice . This principle of \" saving \" is reflected in the conscious and planned conservation of natural resources . Must adult people are quite aware of this principle , but the true power of planning and decision - making in these ecological matters lies in the hands of shamans and elders . I have seen shamans carefully measuring out the adequate amount of fish poison to be put in a creek ; I have heard them interpret dreams in terms of game conservation , explaining that the frightening appearance in a dream , of a certain animal , was a warning that the species was being over-hunted . Shamans will control the felling of trees , the firing of clearings ; they will control house construction , canoe making , the brewing of beer , the processes of daily food preparation , and a great multitude of other activities . In the evening , the men will sit around their fires and talk , and in these nightly conversations they will refer to the change of seasons , the appearing in the sky , the water level and the current of the rivers and creeks , the animals they have seen and heard , the fruits that are ripening in the fields or in the forest . Every few weeks there will be a slight change in the subject matter of these nightly talks , and the seasonal cycle or rainy or dry months will mark major changes in emphasis . There will he talk of bird migrations and of fish runs ; fields must he fired and planted . And night after night people talk while the shamans and elders listen and occasionally ask some questions . In the shamans ' minds , all this information will be organised into structured knowledge which henceforward , for the next few weeks , determines their activities , be they expressed in ritual , in recommending hunting strategies or in arranging social gatherings . For each season of the year , for each distinct shorter time - span , and for each ecosystem , all behavioural norms have to be re-adapted and co-ordinated anew . And this is why the Indians ' knowledge is so vital . The great \" energy \" potential of soils , plants , game animals and fish has to he redistributed to the cosmic energy circuit by rituals , recitals , myths and admonitions which , in their totality , prescribe a way of life . If observed in their full context , these norms constitute an integrated system . For thousands of years , the Amazon Basin has been inhabited by Indians who knew how to conserve their habitat ; we have archaeological evidence for their demographic density and the cultural inventiveness of these peoples . Of course , I am quite aware of the fact that , occasionally , the Indians have contributed to the destruction and degradation of their lands , especially when acting under the pressure of encroaching mestizo peasants , but as a general rule they have managed their natural environment with ecologically - sound land use planning . But the pressure of outside forces upon the Amazon environment is increasing day by day . In the course of my travels , and of long years of field experience in Colombia , I have seen many irreparable changes in the natural environment brought about by human agency ; I have seen the ancient deserts of central Asia and I have seen the rapid expansion of modern deserts on the plains and mountains of Colombia . But no single case has impressed me more than what is happening , and what might be happening , in the Amazon Basin . In speaking of Colombian Indians , I have mentioned some isolated customs ; some animistic beliefs and shamanistic images such as might be described for many aboriginal societies of the tropical rainforest or the Andes . But what I want to emphasise is this : these beliefs and attitudes toward life , these visions of the universe , these hundreds of little things a person does or thinks or avoids , form a highly - structured order . In myth and ritual , in conversation and daily activities , the Indians express deeply - felt beliefs . During an Indian 's entire life , there is a constant , more or less conscious , interplay between the individual and the way in which he perceives the environment . There are shapes and colours , movements and gestures , sounds and smells ; there are different temperatures , different flavours to taste , things to touch , air to breathe . There is the power of the spoken word , the rhythm of music , the bond of kinship . All these manifold sensations , perceptions and feelings are consistently coded and carry specific meanings , the total message of which is life - a well - adapted life . Every single musical instrument , every single feather in a headdress , every dance - step or body gesture is imbued with a specific meaning . And to these are added dietary restrictions , the rules of food processing , hunting and fishing , the clearing of a field , the firing of a clay vessel or the manufacture of a basket . And then there are dreams and visions , visions induced by the controlled use of hallucinogenic drugs , or by deep meditation ; and from these visions , a person awakes with the certainty that what he has seen or heard and felt in that other dimension was true . The sounds of the river and the forest , at different times of day or night , may he warnings or encouragements ; the screech of a parrot , the eyespot pattern on a fish tail , the smell of rotten wood or of an aromatic herb may determine a man 's activities and thought for a day or a week . In this manner the person is continuously exposed to messages which , in all essence , are of a biological nature because they mainly refer to the following rules : to find the right person to marry , to find the right food to eat , and to obtain both in the right way , without upsetting the balance - \" the energy - circuit \" - that links man to his society and his environment . How to read the signals the environment is sending out , a person has to learn through myth and ritual , through the long recitals of genealogies , the casting of spells , and above all , through the nightlong conversations of shamans and elders who are the true suppliers and transmitters of knowledge made wisdom . We should never underestimate this learning process , because it is an exacting mental discipline which eventually enables people to live in nature and with nature , and in society . Our cosmovision is based upon our science ; the Indians ' is based upon their knowledge . Of course , we want to continue in our world which , for better or for worse , is our creation . But in order to live in it , here , today , tomorrow and in the future , we need the Indian 's knowledge . And here I am referring not only to the practical knowledge of the Indians , to the sort of things a peasant knows . What I am trying to say is that the Indians ' way of life reveals to us the possibility of a separate strategy of cultural development ; in other words , it presents us with alternatives on an intellectual level and on a philosophical level . We should keep in mind these alternative cognitive models . The conservation of the Amazonian is not a visionary scheme of ecologists and romanticising anthropologists ; it is a vital necessity for mankind on a global scale : for the study of biological evolution , the study of soil - plant co-evolution , the study of species diversity ; to understand the linguistic , ethnographic , and biological diversity of human societies . We need the Amazon for its enormous human potential , quite apart from its economic or technological promises . Up to this point , I have been writing this article as a humanist , as an intellectual , as an anthropologist who is profoundly concerned about the future of the Indians and their natural environment . But now I shall begin to write as a rationalist too : as a person who is acutely aware of the realities of our present times , and who knows that the future lies in the hands of the intelligentsia , of the technologists and bureaucrats . It is they who have the power , and according to them the Indians are primitives who have to be integrated ; according to them , nature is something that has to he exploited for the benefit of man . We may know that we need the Indians ; we may know that the ruthless exploitation of natural resources has limits ; but the leading intelligentsia and their development agencies recognise no limits to their all - embracing technology . We have to be realistic , and accept the fact that the Indian world is on the wane . The Amazon basin and many , many other , formerly remote , regions of the Third World are being opened to outside influences and to technological development . In some regions this process will be slower and less turbulent than in others ; some aboriginal societies will he able to re-adapt , but others will become profoundly modified , and some will perish altogether , biologically , culturally , linguistically . As anthropologists and biologists , we know only too well that these changes are part of the historical scheme of things . These are disturbing thoughts , to say the least , and I wish I could be more positive when thinking of the future of rainforest Indians and aboriginal peoples in general . But in fitly y ears , I have seen too many traditions being lost ; I have seen entire tribes disappear ; I have seen too much misery among gentle , helpless people . Although I know that the Indians ' world is on the wane , I believe that this knowledge does not exempt us from certain obligations . So , here , I shall attempt to suggest a few approaches to these problems ; I shall try to make an effort to envisage a better future for the Indians , by suggesting a few personal ideas . In the first place , I think we should make a combined effort to study the Indians ' knowledge of their biotype , taking into account not only our , but above all their , concepts of ecosystems . Every square kilometre of forest contains a library of important biological , cultural and psychological information , and if we study it in the company of the Indians our insights in all these fields will be enormously enriched . The death of an old Indian who never had the chance to share with us his knowledge of the forest and the river is the equivalent of a whole library disappearing . If we undertake this study alone , we will get a mere inventory but if we work together with the Indians our insights will be greatly enriched by a kind of knowledge which , at present , still lies beyond our experience . For 500 years we have witnessed and played along with , the destruction of the Indians ; now we are witnessing the destruction of the natural habitat . What are we waiting for ? There can also be no doubt that as anthropologists , biologists and ecologists we possess an enormous amount of information , or practical field experience , and of the many forms of human vulnerability and of the destruction of the natural environment . By transforming this information into practical knowledge , in a manner that would make it understandable and convincing to national leaders and planning agencies , we can influence the process of decision - making ; we can convince those in power of the biological and social necessity to Conserve these lands ; and we can convince them of the dignity and value of our Indian societies . It is not sufficient to say that what we owe to the Indians is potatoes , maize and quinine . It is not sufficient to retell their myths and tales in florid Portuguese or Spanish or to stage their dances in a pseudo-Indian setting on television . What we must show is the Indian 's philosophy of life , their cosmogonic and cosmological schemes , their ethical and aesthetical attitudes . What we must show is their courage of choice , their option of other ways of life , different from ours ; the courage and genius of having built their societies , their cultures based upon an astonishing combination of realism and imagery .","annotations":[{"text":"heed the Indian words","span":[1596,1616],"token_span":[312,315],"role":"Content","label":"Content","role_definition":"The wish for action on the Addressee's part that the Speaker expresses."},{"text":"we","span":[1586,1587],"token_span":[310,310],"role":"Addressee","label":"Addressee","role_definition":"The person that the Speaker seeks to influence to act."},{"text":"Gerardo Reichel - Dolmatoff","span":[90,116],"token_span":[15,18],"role":"Speaker","label":"Speaker","role_definition":"The person who intends through the use of language to get another person to act."},{"text":"the validity of our modern views of landscape and nature","span":[234,289],"token_span":[42,51],"role":"Topic","label":"Topic","role_definition":"What the communication is about."},{"text":"A View from the Headwaters","span":[4,29],"token_span":[2,6],"role":"Medium","label":"Medium","role_definition":"The written or spoken material that contains a message that potentially influences the Addressee towards the Content."},{"text":"July 1999","span":[537,545],"token_span":[98,99],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the lobbying occurs."},{"text":"The Ecologist Volume 29 Number 4","span":[502,533],"token_span":[91,96],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the Speaker attemtps susaion on an Addressee."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"test"},{"instance_id":"EN-4923-53-frame-Attending","frame":"Attending","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Agent goes to an Event and is present in a relatively non-participatory way.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"In April 2014 , Grimes attended a Chicago meeting of the Democracy Alliance , a group of liberal donors who pool their resources in support of progressive causes , where she was a featured speaker at the event .","annotations":[{"text":"In April 2014","span":[0,12],"token_span":[0,2],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the Agent attends the Event."},{"text":"Grimes","span":[16,21],"token_span":[4,4],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent is the person who chooses to make himself present at the Event."},{"text":"a Chicago meeting of the Democracy Alliance , a group of liberal donors who pool their resources in support of progressive causes","span":[32,160],"token_span":[6,27],"role":"Event","label":"Event","role_definition":"The Event is the deliberate set of happenings given at a particular time and place."},{"text":"Chicago","span":[34,40],"token_span":[7,7],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the Agent attends the Event."}],"trigger":{"text":"attended","start_char":23,"end_char":30,"start_token":5,"end_token":5,"frame":"Attending"}},"source":{"text":"Kentucky Republicans want Alison Lundergan Grimes to choose between the liberal donors she met with in Chicago this week and the state 's coal industry that she has campaigned on supporting .

It was looking increasingly likely that one goal would settle it . But Darlington in particular needed better delivery into the penalty area as they had wasted some good positions , though Verma was not far off target with a rising drive from 20 yards . With 16 minutes remaining Darlington brought on Senior for Campbell to try and pep up theior attack , and Marriott had to scramble to prevent his low coss from reaching Wright in front of goal .

Zimbabwe update Jestina Mukoko released 2009-03-06 , Issue 422 http://pambazuka.org/en/category/zimbabwe/54628 Printer friendly version Human rights activist Jestina Mukoko was released on bail following three months of incarceration in Zimbabwe prisons . Africa Action welcomes this development and wishes to extend appreciation to hundreds of activists who responded to our calls over the last 3 months to take action demanding Jestina 's release . Jestina is ' free ' today due to the collective efforts of people of good conscience all over the world who stood in solidarity with her during months of unlawful incarceration . AFRICA ACTION WELCOMES JESTINA MUKOKO'S RELEASE Yesterday , human rights activist Jestina Mukoko was released on bail following three months of incarceration in Zimbabwe prisons . Africa Action welcomes this development and wishes to extend appreciation to hundreds of activists who responded to our calls over the last 3 months to take action demanding Jestina 's release . Jestina is ' free ' today due to the collective efforts of people of good conscience all over the world who stood in solidarity with her during months of unlawful incarceration . It is this outcry that made the government of Zimbabwe realize that the world is not just watching but is in fact , utterly outraged by cases of gross human rights violations . As we welcome Jestina 's release , we note with dismay that fabricated charges against her are still in place . We believe that these charges should be dropped immediately and Jestina must be allowed to go back to her life of civic activism without any intimidation or hindrance .

Zimbabwe update Jestina Mukoko released 2009-03-06 , Issue 422 http://pambazuka.org/en/category/zimbabwe/54628 Printer friendly version Human rights activist Jestina Mukoko was released on bail following three months of incarceration in Zimbabwe prisons . Africa Action welcomes this development and wishes to extend appreciation to hundreds of activists who responded to our calls over the last 3 months to take action demanding Jestina 's release . Jestina is ' free ' today due to the collective efforts of people of good conscience all over the world who stood in solidarity with her during months of unlawful incarceration . AFRICA ACTION WELCOMES JESTINA MUKOKO'S RELEASE Yesterday , human rights activist Jestina Mukoko was released on bail following three months of incarceration in Zimbabwe prisons . Africa Action welcomes this development and wishes to extend appreciation to hundreds of activists who responded to our calls over the last 3 months to take action demanding Jestina 's release . Jestina is ' free ' today due to the collective efforts of people of good conscience all over the world who stood in solidarity with her during months of unlawful incarceration . It is this outcry that made the government of Zimbabwe realize that the world is not just watching but is in fact , utterly outraged by cases of gross human rights violations . As we welcome Jestina 's release , we note with dismay that fabricated charges against her are still in place . We believe that these charges should be dropped immediately and Jestina must be allowed to go back to her life of civic activism without any intimidation or hindrance . Of great concern too is the fact that the government of Zimbabwe continues to hold other political prisoners . If the new inclusive government of Zimbabwe is serious , and wants to be taken seriously by the world its human rights , governance and democratic record must improve and that includes immediate release of all political prisoners . A notable case is that of Roy Bennett , the designate Deputy Minister for Agriculture in the inclusive government who has been in prison for almost a month now . Despite the fact that Roy Bennett was granted bail by the courts , he remains incarcerated because the government of Zimbabwe continues to manipulate the judicial system . All political detainees in Zimbabwe have told stories of torture and other forms of abuse at the hands of state agents . Jestina Mukoko had to be released to a hospital because of serious health problems from torture and horrible prison conditions . In the interest of justice , we believe that those responsible for torture and abuse must be brought to book .

I have n't been onstage with more than one other person in years . Last time I was in that situation was when I was in The Go in Detroit for about six months , and we never played to more than a hundred people . What prompted you to get together in the first place ? JW : Brendan said , ' I 've got this song that needs some lyrics ' . I took a listen to it and it was the music for \u201c Steady , As She Goes \u201d . So I wrote the lyrics for it and we recorded it , though it was kind of more reggae-sounding at that point . We really loved it and just kept playing it , so we said , ' Maybe it 's time to do this band we keep talking about ' . That song really was the trigger . The subject had nothing to do with your marriage , Jack ? JW : No , it was long before that . A year before , I would say . But it 's asking a question , which is , ' Is doing that \u2013 getting married and settling down \u2013 starting a new life or is it giving up ? ' Are you raconteurs ?

It sounds very sophisticated . Is it liberating playing with a proper rhythm section , Jack ? JW : When we started working , I knew I did n't want it to sound anything like The White Stripes . The easy way was to say it 's not going to have any of the constrictions that The White Stripes have . We were gonna take all that boxing - in away . So that helped 90 per cent of that . Is there something of The Stooges here that you can never achieve with Meg ? JW : There were tons of things like that , like synthesizers and guitar solos . It 's hard with The White Stripes when I put a guitar solo on something like \u201c Black Math \u201d , I 've got to stop playing the riff and try to play them both at once . You think , ' It sounds cool now but I hope it sounds cool live when we finally do it ' . With these songs I knew I 'd be able to do it , whatever we did .

Jack , you 've said that \u201c Brendan is a lot more song craftsman \u201d , whereas you 're \u201c more emotional and from the hip \u201d . Do you agree with that , Brendan ? BB : Yeah , he 's more commercial , I 'm more indie . [ Laughs ] Yeah , I might agree with that . JW : But we 're also learning that people think something sounds like Brendan or sounds like me , and in fact it turns out it was the other way round .

There are songs here that could have been on a Brendan Benson album and maybe songs that could even have been on a White Stripes album . Then there are tracks that really feel like you guys meeting halfway . JW : I had not one note of any song that I brought to the table , although the main organ riff on \u201c Store Bought Bones \u201d had sort of started life as something for Satan . Brendan had a couple of things that did n't have middle eights or did n't have lyrics .

JW : When we started the band , I knew that one thing I definitely wanted to do was two - or three - part harmonies , which I 'd never been able to do . Meg had done a little bit here and there , with \u201c Little Ghost \u201d and stuff like that , but we almost kind of kept it just for our country songs . \u201c Broken Boy Soldier \u201d is a great title and a great phrase .

I retain a true Sense of your kindnesses , and want nothing but oppertunity to give testimony of my willingness to oblige as far as my Life or fortune will extend . I cou'd not object to the Pay before I knew it . I dare say your Honour remembers the first Estimation allowd a Lieutt Colo. 15 / and Majr 12/6 which I then complaind very much off ; till your Honour assurd me that we were to be furnish 'd with proper necessary 's and offerd that as a reason why the pay was Less than British : 2 after this when you were so kind to preferr me to the Comn I now have , and at the same time acquainted me that I was to have but 12/6 \u2014 This , with some other Reason 's induced me to acquaint Colo . Fairfax with my intention of Resigning , which he must well remember as it happd at Belhaven ; 3 and was there that he disswaded me from it and promised to represent the trifling pay to your Honour , who would endeavour ( as I at the same time told him that the Speaker 4 thought the Officr 's pay too small ) to have it enlarg'd . As to the Number 's that applied for Commission 's and to whom we were preffer 'd ; I believe , had those Gentlemen been as knowing of this Country , and as Sensible of the difficulties that would attend a Campaign here as I then was \u2014 I concive your Honour wd not have been so troublesomly sollicited as you were ; yet , I do not offer this as a reason for quitting the Service . for my own part I can answer , I have a Constitution hardy enough to encounter and undergo the most severe tryals , and I flatter myself resolution to Face what any Man durst , as shall be prov'd when it comes to the Test , which I believe we are upon the Border 's off . There is nothing Sir ( I believe ) more certain than that the Officer 's on the Canada Expedition had British pay allowd , whilst they were in the Service , 5 Lieutt Wag [ gene ] r Captn Trent , and several other 's whom I have conversed with on tht Head , and were engagd in it , affirm it for truth : therefore Honble Sir , as this ca n't be allow'd ; suffer me to serve a Volunteer which I assure you will be the next reward to British pay , for As my Services , so far as I have knowledge will equal those of the best Officer , I make it a point of Honr to serve for less and accept a medium . Nevertheless , I have communicated your Honour 's Sentiments to them ; and as far as I could put on the Hipocrite , set forth the advantages that may accrue , and advis 'd them to accept the Terms , as a refusal might reflect dishonour upon their Character ; leaving it to the World to assign what reason 's they please for quitting the Service \u2014 I am very sensible of the pernicious consequenc\u27e8e\u27e9 that will attend their resigning , as they have by this gain 'd some experience of the Military Art , have a tolerable knowledge of the Country , being sent most of them out at different times with partys : and now are accustom'd to the hardships and fatiegue of Living as we do , which I believe were it truely stated , wd prevent your Honour from many troublesome Sollicitations from others for Comn\u27e8s\u27e9 [ . ] This last motive , has , and will induce me to do what I can to reconcile matter 's ; th\u00f4 I really believe there is some tht will not remain long witht an alteration . They have promis'd to consider of it , and give your Honour an answer . I was not ignorant of the allowe which Colo . Fry has for his Table , 6 but being a dependt there myself deprives me of the pleasure of inviting an Officer or Friend , which to me wd be more agreeable than the Nick Nacks I shall meet with there . And here I cannot forbear answering one thing more in your Honrs Letter on this head ; which ( too ) is more fully express 'd in a paragraph of Colo . Fairfax 's to me as follows \u201c If on the British Establishment Officer 's are allowd more Pay , the Regimentals they are oblig 'd annually to furnish , their necessary Table and other Incidents being considerd , little or no savings will be their Portion \u201d 7 \u2014 I believe it is well known we have been at the expence of Regimentals ( and it is still better known , that Regimentals , and every other necessary that we were under an indispensable necessity of purchasing for this Expedition , were not to be bought for less Virga curr [enc ]y , than British Officer 's cd get for sterling money ; 8 which they ought to have been , to put us upon a parity in this respect , then Colo . Fairfax observes that their Table and other Incident charges prevents them frm saving much : if they dont save much , they have the enjoyment of their Pay which we neither have in one sense nor the other : We are debarr 'd the pleasure of good Living , which Sir ( I dare say with me you will concur ) to one who has always been used to it ; must go somewhat hard to be confin'd to a little salt provision and Water : and do duty , hard , laborious duty that is almost inconsistent with that of a Soldier , and yet have the same Reductions as if we were allowd luxuriously : My Pay accordg to the British Establisht & common exchange is near 22 / pr Day , in the R[ oo ] m of that the Committee ( for I ca n't in the least imagine yr Hr had any h[ an ] d in it ) has provided 12/6 so long as the Service requires me , whereas , one half of the other is ascertain'd to the British Officer 's forever : now if we shd be fortunate enough to drive the French from Ohio \u2014 as far as your Honour wd please have them sent to \u2014 in any short time , our Pay will not be sufficient to discharge our first expences . I would not have your Honour imagine from this , that I have said all these things to have the Pay encreas 'd \u2014 but to justify myself , and shew your Honour that our complaints are not frivolous , but are founded upon strict Reason : for my own part , it is a matter almost indefferent whether I serve for full pay , or as a generous Volunteer ; indeed , did my circumstances corrispond with my Inclination , I shd not hesitate a moment to prefer the Latter : for the motives that lead me here were pure and Noble I had no view of acquisition but that of Honour , by serving faithfully my King and Country . As your Honour has recommended Mr Willis you may depend I shall with pleasure do all that I can for him . But above all Sir , you may depend I shall take all possible means of procureing intelligence , and guarding against surprises , and be assur 'd nothing but very unequal number 's shall engage me to submit or Retreat . Now Sir , as I have answer 'd your Honour 's Letter I shall beg leave to acqt you with what has happen'd since I wrote by Mr Gist ;9 I then acquainted you that I had detach 'd a party of 75 Men to meet with 50 of the French who we had Intelligence were upon their March towards us to Reconnoitre &ca [ . ] Abt 9 Oclock the same Night , I receivd an express from the Half King who was Incampd with several of His People abt 6 Miles of , that he had seen the Tract of two French Men xing the Road and believ'd the whole body were lying not far off , as he had an acct of that number passing Mr Gist \u2014 I set out with 40 Men before 10 , and was from that time till near Sun rise before we reach 'd the Indian 's Camp , havg Marched in small path , & heavy Rain , and a Night as Dark as it is possible to concieve \u2014 we were frequently tumbling one over another , and often so lost that 15 or 20 Minutes search would not find the path again . When we came to the Half King I council 'd with him , and got his assent to go hand in hand and strike the French . accordingly , himself , Monacatoocha , and a few other Indians set out with us , and when we came to the place where the Tracts were , the Half King sent Two Indians to follow their Tract and discover their lodgment which they did abt half a mile from the Road in a very obscure place surrounded with Rocks . 10 I thereupon in conjuction with the Half King & Monacatoocha , formd a disposion to attack them on all sides , which we accordingly did and after an Engagement of abt 15 Minutes we killd 10 , wounded one and took 21 Prisoner 's , 11 amongst those that were killd was Monsieur De Jumonville the Commander , Principl Officers taken is Monsieur Druillong and Monsr Laforc , who your Honour has often heard me speak of as a bold Enterprising Man , and a person of gt subtilty and cunning with these are two Cadets \u2014 These Officers pretend they were coming on an Embassy , but the absurdity of this pretext is too glaring as your Honour will see by the Instructions and summons inclos 'd : 12 There Instructions were to reconnoitre the Country , Roads , Creeks &ca to Potomack ; which they were abt to do , These Enterpriseing Men were purposely choose out to get intelligence , which they were to send Back by some brisk dispatches with mention of the Day that they were to serve the Summon's ; which could be through no other view , than to get sufficient Reinforcements to fall upon us imediately after . This with several other Reasons induc 'd all the Officers to beleive firmly that they were sent as spys rather than any thing else , and has occasiond my sending them as prisoners , tho they expected ( or at least had some faint hope of being continued as ambassadors ) They finding where we were Incamp 'd , instead of coming up in a Publick manner sought out one of the most secret Retirements ; fitter for a Deserter than an Ambassador to incamp in \u2014 s [ t ] ayd there two or 3 days sent Spies to Reconnoitre our Camp as we are told , tho they deny it \u2014 Their whole Body movd back near 2 Miles , sent off two runnors to acquaint Contracoeur with our Strength , and where we were Incamp 'd &ca now 36 Men wd almost have been a Retinue for a Princely Ambassador , instead of Petit , why did they , if there design 's were open stay so long within 5 Miles of us witht delivering his Ambassy , or acquainting me with it ; his waiting cd be with no other design than to get Detachts to enforce the Summons as soon as it was given , they had no occasion to send out Spy's ; for the Name of Ambassador is Sacred among all Nations ; but it was by the Tract of these Spy 's they were discoverd , and we got Intilligence of them \u2014 They wd not have retird two Miles back witht delivering the Summons and sought a sculking place ( which to do them justice was done with gt Judgment ) but for some especial Reason : Besides The Summon 's is so insolent , & savour 's so much of Gascoigny that if two Men only had come openly to deliver it . 13 It was too great Indulgence to have sent them back . The Sense of the Half King on this Subject is , that they have bad Hearts , and that this is a mere pretence , they never designd to have come to us but in a hostile manner , and if we were so foolish as to let them go again , he never would assist us in taking another of them [ . ] 14 Besides , looseing La Force I really think wd tend more to our disservice than 50 other Men , as he is a person whose active Spirit , leads him into all parlys , and brought him acquainted with all parts , add to this a perfect use of the Indian Tongue , and gt influence with the Indian He Ingenuously enough confessd that as soon as he saw the commission & Instructions that he believd and then said he expected some such tendency tho he pretends to say he does not believe the Commander had any other but a good design . In this Engagement we had only one Man killd , and two or three wounded , among which was Lieutt Waggener slightly \u2014 a most miraculous escape , as Our Right Wing was much exposd to their Fire and receivd it all . The Half King receiv'd your Honour 's speech very kind : but desird me to inform you that he could not leave his People at this time , thinking them in great Danger15 \u2014 He is now gone to the xing for their Familys to bring to our Camp & desird I wd send some Men and Horses to assist them up ; which I have accordingly done \u2014 sent 30 Men & upwards of 20 Horses . He say 's if your Honr has any thing to say you may communicate by me &ca ; and that if you have a present for them it may be kept to another occasion , after sending up some things for their imediate use , He has declar'd to send these Frenchmens Scalps with a Hatchet to all the Nations of Indian 's in union with them , and did that very day give a Hatchet and a large Belt of Wampum to a Delaware Man to carry to Shingiss : 16 he promis 'd me to send down the River for all the Mingo 's & Shawnesse to our camp , where I expect him to Morrow with 30 or 40 Men with their wives & Children , to confirm what he has said here , he has sent your Honour a String of Wampum . As these Runnors went of to the Fort on Sunday last , I shall expect every hour to be attackd and by unequal number 's , which I must withstand if there is 5 to 1 or else I fear the Consequence will be we shall loose the Indians if we suffer ourselves to be drove Back , I dispatchd an express imediately to Colo . Fry with this Intelligence desiring him to send me Reinforcements with all imaginable dispatch . 17 Your Honour may depend I will not be surprizd , let them come what hour they will \u2014 and this is as much as I can promise \u2014 but my best endeavour 's shall not be wanting to deserve more , I doubt not but if you hear I am beaten , but you will at the same hear that we have done our duty in fighting as long there was a possibility of hope . I have sent Lieutt West18 accompanied with Mr Sprilldorph19 & a Guard of 20 Men to conduct the Prisoners in , and I believe the Officer 's have acquainted him what answer to return yr Honour . Monsiur La-Force , and Monsieur Druillong beg to be recommend to your Honour 's Notice , and I have promis'd they will meet with all the favour that 's due to Impriso n'd Officer 's : I have shew 'd all the respect I cou'd to them here , and have given some necessary cloathing by which I have disfurnish 'd myself , for having brought no more than two or three Shirts from Wills Ck that we might be light I was ill provided to furnish them I am Yr Honour 's most Obt Hble Servt Go : Washington NB I have neither seen nor heard any particular acct of the Twigtwees since I came on these Water 's , we have already began a Palisadod Fort and hope to have it up tomorrow I must beg leave to acqt yr honr tht Captn Vanbraam & Monsr Peyrouney has behav 'd extreamely well since they came out \u2014 & I hope will meet wth yr Honrs favr . 20 ALS , ViHi. 1 .

He may be the same Thomas Burney who enlisted as a private in GW 's regiment on 28 Mar. 1754 and was killed in 1755 at Braddock 's defeat . 2 . For the amounts paid various ranks in the expedition 's complement , see GW to Dinwiddie , 9 May 1754 , n.6 . 4 . John Robinson was the speaker of the Virginia House of Burgesses from 1738 to 1765 and treasurer of the colony from 1738 until his death in 1766 . At this time he was a member of the assembly 's committee authorizing expenditures for the regiment . 7 . This quotation is probably taken from the letter , not found , written by William Fairfax to GW , which GW received on 26 May and in which Fairfax responded to complaints made to him by GW earlier in the month in another letter , also not found .

This rocky glen , since named Jumonville 's Rocks , lay near the trail to the Forks , just beyond Laurel Hill , and about midway between Great Meadows and Gist 's Settlement . 11 .

Joseph Coulon de Villiers , sieur de Jumonville ( 1718 \u2013 1754 ) , a 16 \u2013 year veteran of the French army in America , held the rank of ensign and in 1754 was assigned to Fort Duquesne . Ordered by the sieur de Contrecoeur to carry a \u201c summons \u201d to the English to vacate the Ohio country , he left the fort on 23 May in command of approximately 35 men . Among his officers was Pierre Jacques Drouillon ( Druillon ) , sieur de Mac\u00e9 ( b. 1725 ) , also an ensign , who returned to Canada after he was freed and became a lieutenant in the French army in 1759 . For La Force , see William Trent to GW , 19 Feb. 1754 , n.5 . The two cadets were named de Boucherville and Dusabl\u00e9 . The controversy concerning GW 's engagement with Jumonville has persisted until recent times . The French claimed that Jumonville 's role was that of ambassador and that while on a peaceful mission , similar to GW 's own mission to the French commandant a few months before , he and his party were ambushed by the Virginia troops . Contrecoeur recounted what was to become the French version of the affair in a letter to Duquesne , 2 June 1754 : \u201c I expected Mr. de Jumonville , within four Days ; the Indians have just now informed me , that that Party is taken and defeated ; they were Eight in Number , one whereof was Mr. de Jumonville . One of that Party , Monceau by Name , a Canadian , made his Escape , and tells us that they had built themselves Cabbins , in a low Bottom , where they sheltered themselves , as it rained hard . About seven o' Clock the next Morning , they saw themselves surrounded by the English on one Side and the Indians on the Other . The English gave them two Volleys , but the Indians did not fire . Mr. de Jumonville , by his Interpreter , told them to desist , that he had something to tell them . Upon which they ceased firing . Then Mr. de Jumonville ordered the Summons which I had sent them to retire , to be read . . . . The aforesaid Monceau , saw all our Frenchmen coming up close to Mr. de Jumonville , whilst they were reading the Summons , so that they were all in Platoons , between the English and the Indians , during which Time , said Monceau made the best of his Way to us , partly by Land through the Woods , and partly along the River Monaungahela , in a small Canoe . This is all , Sir , I could learn from said Monceau . The Misfortune is , that our People were surprized ; the English had incircled them , and came upon them unseen . . . . The Indians who were present when the Thing was done , say , that Mr. de Jumonville was killed by a Musket - Shot in the Head , whilst they were reading the Summons ; and that the English would afterwards have killed all our Men , had not the Indians who were present , by rushing in between them and the English , prevented their Design \u201d ( Memorial Containing a Summary View of Facts description begins [ Jacob Nicolas Moreau ] . A Memorial Containing a Summary View of Facts , with Their Authorities . In Answer to the Observations Sent by the English Ministry to the Courts of Europe . Translated from the French . New York , 1757 . description ends , 69 ) . 13 . A copy of the summons , 23 May 1754 , signed by Contrecoeur and addressed to the commander of any English troops that Jumonville might find in the lands claimed by the French is in P.R.O. , C.O. 5/1328 , f. 119 . A copy of Contrecoeur 's instructions to Jumonville , 23 May 1754 , is in P.R.O. , C.O. 5/1328 , f. 118 . 14 . The role of the Indians in the engagement remains obscure . An eyewitness on the French side claimed the Indians did not fire and the French casualties were the result of British volleys ( see note 12 ) . Similarly in his diary GW stated that \u201c we killed Mr. de Jumonville . . . as also nine others . . . . The Indians scalped the Dead \u201d ( Diaries description begins Donald Jackson and Dorothy Twohig , eds . The Diaries of George Washington . 6 vols . Charlottesville , Va. , 1976\u201379 . description ends , 1 :195 ) . In a letter to the Board of Trade of 18 June 1754 , however , Dinwiddie wrote that \u201c this little Skirmish was by the Half - King & their Indians , we were as auxiliaries to them , as my Orders to the Commander of our Forces [ were ] to be on the Defensive \u201d ( P.R.O. , C.O. 5/1328 , ff. 117 , 120 ) . John Shaw , a veteran of the surrender at Fort Necessity , claimed that Jumonville was killed with a tomahawk by the Half - King who then scalped the French commander ( McDowell , S.C. Indian Affairs description begins William L. McDowell , Jr. , ed. Documents relating to Indian Affairs . 2 vols. Columbia , S.C. , 1958 - 70 . In Colonial Records of South Carolina , 2d ser. , vols. 2 \u20133 . description ends , 4 ) . That the Indians may have been responsible for at least some of the French deaths is suggested by the fact that the French force which marched out of Fort Duquesne on 28 June in pursuit of the English found when they reached the site of the skirmish that a number of bodies had been left unburied , a custom often adopted by Indians hoping to discourage their enemies ( \u201c Journal of M. de Villiers , \u201d Memorial Containing a Summary View of Facts description begins [ Jacob Nicolas Moreau ] .

In the early 1750s he supported the British , but after going over to the French probably in late 1754 , he became the scourge of English settlements along the Pennsylvania frontier . In 1754 he was living in the vicinity of McKee 's Rocks in Allegheny County , Pa. 18 . John West , Jr. ( d. 1777 ) , was a surveyor for Fairfax County . The date of his commission as the fourth lieutenant in the Virginia Regiment was 27 Feb. 1754 . He resigned his commission in late summer following this campaign . He was the son of Hugh West ( 1705 \u2013 1754 ) . 19 . Carolus Gustavus de Spiltdorf , whom GW referred to as a \u201c Swedish Gentleman , who was a Volunteer \u201d ( Diaries description begins Donald Jackson and Dorothy Twohig , eds .

He was killed with Braddock 's forces at the Battle of the Monongahela , 9 July 1755 . 20 . William La P\u00e9ronie , a Frenchman with military experience , came to Virginia about 1750 . His name is variously spelled , even , apparently , by La P\u00e9ronie himself . See for example , his letter to GW , 5 Sept. 1754 . After he was wounded in the engagement at Fort Necessity , Dinwiddie made him adjutant of the regiment on GW 's recommendation ( GW to Dinwiddie , 10 June 1754 ) .

There is nothing Sir ( I believe ) more certain than that the Officer 's on the Canada Expedition had British pay allowd , whilst they were in the Service , 5 Lieutt Wag [ gene ] r Captn Trent , and several other 's whom I have conversed with on tht Head , and were engagd in it , affirm it for truth : therefore Honble Sir , as this ca n't be allow'd ; suffer me to serve a Volunteer which I assure you will be the next reward to British pay , for As my Services , so far as I have knowledge will equal those of the best Officer , I make it a point of Honr to serve for less and accept a medium . Nevertheless , I have communicated your Honour 's Sentiments to them ; and as far as I could put on the Hipocrite , set forth the advantages that may accrue , and advis 'd them to accept the Terms , as a refusal might reflect dishonour upon their Character ; leaving it to the World to assign what reason 's they please for quitting the Service \u2014 I am very sensible of the pernicious consequenc\u27e8e\u27e9 that will attend their resigning , as they have by this gain 'd some experience of the Military Art , have a tolerable knowledge of the Country , being sent most of them out at different times with partys : and now are accustom'd to the hardships and fatiegue of Living as we do , which I believe were it truely stated , wd prevent your Honour from many troublesome Sollicitations from others for Comn\u27e8s\u27e9 [ . ] This last motive , has , and will induce me to do what I can to reconcile matter 's ; th\u00f4 I really believe there is some tht will not remain long witht an alteration . They have promis'd to consider of it , and give your Honour an answer . I was not ignorant of the allowe which Colo . Fry has for his Table , 6 but being a dependt there myself deprives me of the pleasure of inviting an Officer or Friend , which to me wd be more agreeable than the Nick Nacks I shall meet with there . And here I cannot forbear answering one thing more in your Honrs Letter on this head ; which ( too ) is more fully express 'd in a paragraph of Colo . Fairfax 's to me as follows \u201c If on the British Establishment Officer 's are allowd more Pay , the Regimentals they are oblig 'd annually to furnish , their necessary Table and other Incidents being considerd , little or no savings will be their Portion \u201d 7 \u2014 I believe it is well known we have been at the expence of Regimentals ( and it is still better known , that Regimentals , and every other necessary that we were under an indispensable necessity of purchasing for this Expedition , were not to be bought for less Virga curr [enc ]y , than British Officer 's cd get for sterling money ; 8 which they ought to have been , to put us upon a parity in this respect , then Colo . Fairfax observes that their Table and other Incident charges prevents them frm saving much : if they dont save much , they have the enjoyment of their Pay which we neither have in one sense nor the other : We are debarr 'd the pleasure of good Living , which Sir ( I dare say with me you will concur ) to one who has always been used to it ; must go somewhat hard to be confin'd to a little salt provision and Water : and do duty , hard , laborious duty that is almost inconsistent with that of a Soldier , and yet have the same Reductions as if we were allowd luxuriously : My Pay accordg to the British Establisht & common exchange is near 22 / pr Day , in the R[ oo ] m of that the Committee ( for I ca n't in the least imagine yr Hr had any h[ an ] d in it ) has provided 12/6 so long as the Service requires me , whereas , one half of the other is ascertain'd to the British Officer 's forever : now if we shd be fortunate enough to drive the French from Ohio \u2014 as far as your Honour wd please have them sent to \u2014 in any short time , our Pay will not be sufficient to discharge our first expences . I would not have your Honour imagine from this , that I have said all these things to have the Pay encreas 'd \u2014 but to justify myself , and shew your Honour that our complaints are not frivolous , but are founded upon strict Reason : for my own part , it is a matter almost indefferent whether I serve for full pay , or as a generous Volunteer ; indeed , did my circumstances corrispond with my Inclination , I shd not hesitate a moment to prefer the Latter : for the motives that lead me here were pure and Noble I had no view of acquisition but that of Honour , by serving faithfully my King and Country . As your Honour has recommended Mr Willis you may depend I shall with pleasure do all that I can for him . But above all Sir , you may depend I shall take all possible means of procureing intelligence , and guarding against surprises , and be assur 'd nothing but very unequal number 's shall engage me to submit or Retreat . Now Sir , as I have answer 'd your Honour 's Letter I shall beg leave to acqt you with what has happen'd since I wrote by Mr Gist ;9 I then acquainted you that I had detach 'd a party of 75 Men to meet with 50 of the French who we had Intelligence were upon their March towards us to Reconnoitre &ca [ . ] Abt 9 Oclock the same Night , I receivd an express from the Half King who was Incampd with several of His People abt 6 Miles of , that he had seen the Tract of two French Men xing the Road and believ'd the whole body were lying not far off , as he had an acct of that number passing Mr Gist \u2014 I set out with 40 Men before 10 , and was from that time till near Sun rise before we reach 'd the Indian 's Camp , havg Marched in small path , & heavy Rain , and a Night as Dark as it is possible to concieve \u2014 we were frequently tumbling one over another , and often so lost that 15 or 20 Minutes search would not find the path again . When we came to the Half King I council 'd with him , and got his assent to go hand in hand and strike the French . accordingly , himself , Monacatoocha , and a few other Indians set out with us , and when we came to the place where the Tracts were , the Half King sent Two Indians to follow their Tract and discover their lodgment which they did abt half a mile from the Road in a very obscure place surrounded with Rocks . 10 I thereupon in conjuction with the Half King & Monacatoocha , formd a disposion to attack them on all sides , which we accordingly did and after an Engagement of abt 15 Minutes we killd 10 , wounded one and took 21 Prisoner 's , 11 amongst those that were killd was Monsieur De Jumonville the Commander , Principl Officers taken is Monsieur Druillong and Monsr Laforc , who your Honour has often heard me speak of as a bold Enterprising Man , and a person of gt subtilty and cunning with these are two Cadets \u2014 These Officers pretend they were coming on an Embassy , but the absurdity of this pretext is too glaring as your Honour will see by the Instructions and summons inclos 'd : 12 There Instructions were to reconnoitre the Country , Roads , Creeks &ca to Potomack ; which they were abt to do , These Enterpriseing Men were purposely choose out to get intelligence , which they were to send Back by some brisk dispatches with mention of the Day that they were to serve the Summon's ; which could be through no other view , than to get sufficient Reinforcements to fall upon us imediately after . This with several other Reasons induc 'd all the Officers to beleive firmly that they were sent as spys rather than any thing else , and has occasiond my sending them as prisoners , tho they expected ( or at least had some faint hope of being continued as ambassadors ) They finding where we were Incamp 'd , instead of coming up in a Publick manner sought out one of the most secret Retirements ; fitter for a Deserter than an Ambassador to incamp in \u2014 s [ t ] ayd there two or 3 days sent Spies to Reconnoitre our Camp as we are told , tho they deny it \u2014 Their whole Body movd back near 2 Miles , sent off two runnors to acquaint Contracoeur with our Strength , and where we were Incamp 'd &ca now 36 Men wd almost have been a Retinue for a Princely Ambassador , instead of Petit , why did they , if there design 's were open stay so long within 5 Miles of us witht delivering his Ambassy , or acquainting me with it ; his waiting cd be with no other design than to get Detachts to enforce the Summons as soon as it was given , they had no occasion to send out Spy's ; for the Name of Ambassador is Sacred among all Nations ; but it was by the Tract of these Spy 's they were discoverd , and we got Intilligence of them \u2014 They wd not have retird two Miles back witht delivering the Summons and sought a sculking place ( which to do them justice was done with gt Judgment ) but for some especial Reason : Besides The Summon 's is so insolent , & savour 's so much of Gascoigny that if two Men only had come openly to deliver it . 13 It was too great Indulgence to have sent them back . The Sense of the Half King on this Subject is , that they have bad Hearts , and that this is a mere pretence , they never designd to have come to us but in a hostile manner , and if we were so foolish as to let them go again , he never would assist us in taking another of them [ . ] 14 Besides , looseing La Force I really think wd tend more to our disservice than 50 other Men , as he is a person whose active Spirit , leads him into all parlys , and brought him acquainted with all parts , add to this a perfect use of the Indian Tongue , and gt influence with the Indian He Ingenuously enough confessd that as soon as he saw the commission & Instructions that he believd and then said he expected some such tendency tho he pretends to say he does not believe the Commander had any other but a good design . In this Engagement we had only one Man killd , and two or three wounded , among which was Lieutt Waggener slightly \u2014 a most miraculous escape , as Our Right Wing was much exposd to their Fire and receivd it all . The Half King receiv'd your Honour 's speech very kind : but desird me to inform you that he could not leave his People at this time , thinking them in great Danger15 \u2014 He is now gone to the xing for their Familys to bring to our Camp & desird I wd send some Men and Horses to assist them up ; which I have accordingly done \u2014 sent 30 Men & upwards of 20 Horses . He say 's if your Honr has any thing to say you may communicate by me &ca ; and that if you have a present for them it may be kept to another occasion , after sending up some things for their imediate use , He has declar'd to send these Frenchmens Scalps with a Hatchet to all the Nations of Indian 's in union with them , and did that very day give a Hatchet and a large Belt of Wampum to a Delaware Man to carry to Shingiss : 16 he promis 'd me to send down the River for all the Mingo 's & Shawnesse to our camp , where I expect him to Morrow with 30 or 40 Men with their wives & Children , to confirm what he has said here , he has sent your Honour a String of Wampum . As these Runnors went of to the Fort on Sunday last , I shall expect every hour to be attackd and by unequal number 's , which I must withstand if there is 5 to 1 or else I fear the Consequence will be we shall loose the Indians if we suffer ourselves to be drove Back , I dispatchd an express imediately to Colo . Fry with this Intelligence desiring him to send me Reinforcements with all imaginable dispatch . 17 Your Honour may depend I will not be surprizd , let them come what hour they will \u2014 and this is as much as I can promise \u2014 but my best endeavour 's shall not be wanting to deserve more , I doubt not but if you hear I am beaten , but you will at the same hear that we have done our duty in fighting as long there was a possibility of hope . I have sent Lieutt West18 accompanied with Mr Sprilldorph19 & a Guard of 20 Men to conduct the Prisoners in , and I believe the Officer 's have acquainted him what answer to return yr Honour . Monsiur La-Force , and Monsieur Druillong beg to be recommend to your Honour 's Notice , and I have promis'd they will meet with all the favour that 's due to Impriso n'd Officer 's : I have shew 'd all the respect I cou'd to them here , and have given some necessary cloathing by which I have disfurnish 'd myself , for having brought no more than two or three Shirts from Wills Ck that we might be light I was ill provided to furnish them I am Yr Honour 's most Obt Hble Servt Go : Washington NB I have neither seen nor heard any particular acct of the Twigtwees since I came on these Water 's , we have already began a Palisadod Fort and hope to have it up tomorrow I must beg leave to acqt yr honr tht Captn Vanbraam & Monsr Peyrouney has behav 'd extreamely well since they came out \u2014 & I hope will meet wth yr Honrs favr . 20 ALS , ViHi. 1 .

Joseph Coulon de Villiers , sieur de Jumonville ( 1718 \u2013 1754 ) , a 16 \u2013 year veteran of the French army in America , held the rank of ensign and in 1754 was assigned to Fort Duquesne . Ordered by the sieur de Contrecoeur to carry a \u201c summons \u201d to the English to vacate the Ohio country , he left the fort on 23 May in command of approximately 35 men . Among his officers was Pierre Jacques Drouillon ( Druillon ) , sieur de Mac\u00e9 ( b. 1725 ) , also an ensign , who returned to Canada after he was freed and became a lieutenant in the French army in 1759 . For La Force , see William Trent to GW , 19 Feb. 1754 , n.5 . The two cadets were named de Boucherville and Dusabl\u00e9 . The controversy concerning GW 's engagement with Jumonville has persisted until recent times . The French claimed that Jumonville 's role was that of ambassador and that while on a peaceful mission , similar to GW 's own mission to the French commandant a few months before , he and his party were ambushed by the Virginia troops . Contrecoeur recounted what was to become the French version of the affair in a letter to Duquesne , 2 June 1754 : \u201c I expected Mr. de Jumonville , within four Days ; the Indians have just now informed me , that that Party is taken and defeated ; they were Eight in Number , one whereof was Mr. de Jumonville . One of that Party , Monceau by Name , a Canadian , made his Escape , and tells us that they had built themselves Cabbins , in a low Bottom , where they sheltered themselves , as it rained hard . About seven o' Clock the next Morning , they saw themselves surrounded by the English on one Side and the Indians on the Other . The English gave them two Volleys , but the Indians did not fire . Mr. de Jumonville , by his Interpreter , told them to desist , that he had something to tell them . Upon which they ceased firing . Then Mr. de Jumonville ordered the Summons which I had sent them to retire , to be read . . . . The aforesaid Monceau , saw all our Frenchmen coming up close to Mr. de Jumonville , whilst they were reading the Summons , so that they were all in Platoons , between the English and the Indians , during which Time , said Monceau made the best of his Way to us , partly by Land through the Woods , and partly along the River Monaungahela , in a small Canoe . This is all , Sir , I could learn from said Monceau . The Misfortune is , that our People were surprized ; the English had incircled them , and came upon them unseen . . . . The Indians who were present when the Thing was done , say , that Mr. de Jumonville was killed by a Musket - Shot in the Head , whilst they were reading the Summons ; and that the English would afterwards have killed all our Men , had not the Indians who were present , by rushing in between them and the English , prevented their Design \u201d ( Memorial Containing a Summary View of Facts description begins [ Jacob Nicolas Moreau ] . A Memorial Containing a Summary View of Facts , with Their Authorities . In Answer to the Observations Sent by the English Ministry to the Courts of Europe . Translated from the French . New York , 1757 . description ends , 69 ) . 13 . A copy of the summons , 23 May 1754 , signed by Contrecoeur and addressed to the commander of any English troops that Jumonville might find in the lands claimed by the French is in P.R.O. , C.O. 5/1328 , f. 119 . A copy of Contrecoeur 's instructions to Jumonville , 23 May 1754 , is in P.R.O. , C.O. 5/1328 , f. 118 . 14 . The role of the Indians in the engagement remains obscure . An eyewitness on the French side claimed the Indians did not fire and the French casualties were the result of British volleys ( see note 12 ) . Similarly in his diary GW stated that \u201c we killed Mr. de Jumonville . . . as also nine others . . . . The Indians scalped the Dead \u201d ( Diaries description begins Donald Jackson and Dorothy Twohig , eds . The Diaries of George Washington . 6 vols . Charlottesville , Va. , 1976\u201379 . description ends , 1 :195 ) . In a letter to the Board of Trade of 18 June 1754 , however , Dinwiddie wrote that \u201c this little Skirmish was by the Half - King & their Indians , we were as auxiliaries to them , as my Orders to the Commander of our Forces [ were ] to be on the Defensive \u201d ( P.R.O. , C.O. 5/1328 , ff. 117 , 120 ) . John Shaw , a veteran of the surrender at Fort Necessity , claimed that Jumonville was killed with a tomahawk by the Half - King who then scalped the French commander ( McDowell , S.C. Indian Affairs description begins William L. McDowell , Jr. , ed. Documents relating to Indian Affairs . 2 vols. Columbia , S.C. , 1958 - 70 . In Colonial Records of South Carolina , 2d ser. , vols. 2 \u20133 . description ends , 4 ) . That the Indians may have been responsible for at least some of the French deaths is suggested by the fact that the French force which marched out of Fort Duquesne on 28 June in pursuit of the English found when they reached the site of the skirmish that a number of bodies had been left unburied , a custom often adopted by Indians hoping to discourage their enemies ( \u201c Journal of M. de Villiers , \u201d Memorial Containing a Summary View of Facts description begins [ Jacob Nicolas Moreau ] .

In the early 1750s he supported the British , but after going over to the French probably in late 1754 , he became the scourge of English settlements along the Pennsylvania frontier . In 1754 he was living in the vicinity of McKee 's Rocks in Allegheny County , Pa. 18 . John West , Jr. ( d. 1777 ) , was a surveyor for Fairfax County . The date of his commission as the fourth lieutenant in the Virginia Regiment was 27 Feb. 1754 . He resigned his commission in late summer following this campaign . He was the son of Hugh West ( 1705 \u2013 1754 ) . 19 . Carolus Gustavus de Spiltdorf , whom GW referred to as a \u201c Swedish Gentleman , who was a Volunteer \u201d ( Diaries description begins Donald Jackson and Dorothy Twohig , eds .

He was killed with Braddock 's forces at the Battle of the Monongahela , 9 July 1755 . 20 . William La P\u00e9ronie , a Frenchman with military experience , came to Virginia about 1750 . His name is variously spelled , even , apparently , by La P\u00e9ronie himself . See for example , his letter to GW , 5 Sept. 1754 . After he was wounded in the engagement at Fort Necessity , Dinwiddie made him adjutant of the regiment on GW 's recommendation ( GW to Dinwiddie , 10 June 1754 ) .

In 1989 Carson became art director at the magazine Beach Culture . Although he produced only six issues before the journal folded , his work there earned him more than 150 design awards . By that time , Carson 's work had caught the eye of Marvin Scott Jarrett , publisher of the alternative - music magazine Ray Gun , and he hired Carson as art director in 1992 . Over the next three years , with the help of Carson 's radical design vision , Ray Gun 's circulation tripled . Because Carson 's work clearly appealed to a youthful readership , corporations such as Nike and Levi Strauss & Co. commissioned him to design print ads , and he also began directing television commercials . After leaving Ray Gun in 1995 , Carson established David Carson Design . The firm was instantly successful and attracted well - known , wealthy corporate clients . In 1995 Carson produced The End of Print : The Graphic Design of David Carson ( revised edition issued in 2000 as The End of Print : The Grafik Design of David Carson ) , the first comprehensive collection of his distinctive graphic imagery .

Photographer Albert Watson , for example , declared , \u201c He uses type the way a painter uses paint , to create emotion , to express ideas . \u201d Others felt that the fractured presentation obscured the message it carried . In 1989 Carson became art director at the magazine Beach Culture . Although he produced only six issues before the journal folded , his work there earned him more than 150 design awards . By that time , Carson 's work had caught the eye of Marvin Scott Jarrett , publisher of the alternative - music magazine Ray Gun , and he hired Carson as art director in 1992 . Over the next three years , with the help of Carson 's radical design vision , Ray Gun 's circulation tripled . Because Carson 's work clearly appealed to a youthful readership , corporations such as Nike and Levi Strauss & Co. commissioned him to design print ads , and he also began directing television commercials . After leaving Ray Gun in 1995 , Carson established David Carson Design . The firm was instantly successful and attracted well - known , wealthy corporate clients . In 1995 Carson produced The End of Print : The Graphic Design of David Carson ( revised edition issued in 2000 as The End of Print : The Grafik Design of David Carson ) , the first comprehensive collection of his distinctive graphic imagery . This was followed by the boldly experimental books 2nd Sight ( 1997 ) , Fotografiks ( 1999 ) , and Trek ( 2003 ) . In 2014 Carson was awarded an AIGA Medal .

The battalion was part of the 20th Brigade of the newly formed 7th Division . It completed basic training at Ingleburn before marching to Bathurst army camp to undergo subunit field training . In October the 20th Brigade , comprising the 2/13th , 2/15th , and 2/17th Battalions , sailed from Sydney Harbour for the Middle East . The brigade transferred to the newly formed 9th Division en route to Egypt . Arriving in November the battalion travelled by train to Palestine and went into camp at Kilo 89 . Early in March 1941 the 9th Division moved into Cyrenaica replacing the 6th Division going to Greece . The Axis were also reorganising their forces . German forces landed at Tripoli , bolstering the Italians , and advanced east . The British were forced to evacuate Benghazi and fall back to Tobruk , referred to as the \" Benghazi handicap \" . The 2/13th covered the division 's withdrawal . The 2/13th was first complete Australian unit to fight German troops during the Second World War . The battle took place at Er Regima on 4 April 1941 . The battalion was thinly spread along an 11 kilometre front against a German force of about 3,000 men . The battle began mid-afternoon and continued into the night . Outnumbered and vulnerable the battalion fought on until 10 pm before withdrawing . They initially moved of on foot but were soon picked up by trucks and driven 16 km east of Barce to rest . By 9 April the 2/13th joined the rest of the division at Tobruk . It helped defend the \" fortress \" for eight months , being the only Australian battalion to see out the siege . It planned to evacuate in October but was delayed when their convey was forced to turn back from enemy air attack . The battalion remained in Tobruk until the siege was lifted in December . The 9th Division returned to Palestine before going to Syria to perform garrison duties . The 2/13th rejoined the division at Lattakia . By July 1942 the war in North Africa was critical for the British Eighth Army . German and Italian forces had reached El Alamein , about seventy miles from Alexandria . The 9th Division rushed to Alamein and held the northern sector for almost four months while the Eighth Army reinforced under new a commander . The 2/13th reached the forward British defences in mid-July and moved to Tel El Eisa in early - August . It fought in the Alamein battle from 23 October to 5 November 1942 . The 9th Division was recalled to Australia to face a new enemy - the Japanese . The 2/13th left Egypt in January 1943 and disembarked at Sydney in February . After leave and jungle training on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland in August the battalion embarked for Milne Bay in Papua . On 4 September the battalion departed Milne Bay on landing craft and landed on Red Beach , north - west of Lae , without casualties . It carried out subsequent jungle operations until Lae fell 12 days later . The battalion also landed at Scarlet Beach near Finschhafen on 22 September , helping defend the area against Japanese counter-attack . The 2/13th returned to Australia in March 1944 , disembarking in Brisbane . After leave , it reformed at Ravenshoe and did not return to action until the final months of the war . Towards the end of April the 9th Division was transported to Morotai to prepare for amphibious landings on Borneo as part of the OBOE operations . The 2/13th landed at Brunei on 10 June before making another landing in the Miri-Lutong area ten days later . The battalion captured the Lutong airfield and oil tanks and moved inland along the Pujut Road to the Pujut oilfields . It then moved along Canada Hill to Lobang , where it remained until the end of the war . Following Japan 's surrender , the 2/13th 's ranks thinned , as men were discharged or transferred . The battalion moved to Luban in November and in December sailed to Australia to \" wind up \" in preparation for disbandment .","annotations":[{"text":"Early in March 1941","span":[1039,1057],"token_span":[211,214],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the Assailant attacks the Victim."},{"text":"German forces","span":[1189,1201],"token_span":[237,238],"role":"Assailant","label":"Assailant","role_definition":"The Assailant is a group of armed forces (or, metonymically, their commander or the organization they represent) that encircles, surrounds, or otherwise cuts off the Beseiged in an attempt to force surrender."},{"text":"Tobruk","span":[1331,1336],"token_span":[262,262],"role":"Victim","label":"Victim","role_definition":"The Victim is the fortification or geopolitical entity that is being attacked."},{"text":"Tobruk","span":[1331,1336],"token_span":[262,262],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the place where the Assailant makes an assault on the Victim."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"A further move was undertaken to Er Regima , where the brigade was tasked with holding approaches around the Benghazi Plain .

Early in March 1941 the 9th Division moved into Cyrenaica replacing the 6th Division going to Greece . The Axis were also reorganising their forces . German forces landed at Tripoli , bolstering the Italians , and advanced east . The British were forced to evacuate Benghazi and fall back to Tobruk , referred to as the \" Benghazi handicap \" . The 2/13th covered the division 's withdrawal . The 2/13th was first complete Australian unit to fight German troops during the Second World War . The battle took place at Er Regima on 4 April 1941 . The battalion was thinly spread along an 11 kilometre front against a German force of about 3,000 men . The battle began mid-afternoon and continued into the night . Outnumbered and vulnerable the battalion fought on until 10 pm before withdrawing . They initially moved of on foot but were soon picked up by trucks and driven 16 km east of Barce to rest . By 9 April the 2/13th joined the rest of the division at Tobruk . It helped defend the \" fortress \" for eight months , being the only Australian battalion to see out the siege . It planned to evacuate in October but was delayed when their convey was forced to turn back from enemy air attack . The battalion remained in Tobruk until the siege was lifted in December . The 9th Division returned to Palestine before going to Syria to perform garrison duties . The 2/13th rejoined the division at Lattakia . By July 1942 the war in North Africa was critical for the British Eighth Army . German and Italian forces had reached El Alamein , about seventy miles from Alexandria . The 9th Division rushed to Alamein and held the northern sector for almost four months while the Eighth Army reinforced under new a commander . The 2/13th reached the forward British defences in mid-July and moved to Tel El Eisa in early - August . It fought in the Alamein battle from 23 October to 5 November 1942 . The 9th Division was recalled to Australia to face a new enemy - the Japanese . The 2/13th left Egypt in January 1943 and disembarked at Sydney in February . After leave and jungle training on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland in August the battalion embarked for Milne Bay in Papua . On 4 September the battalion departed Milne Bay on landing craft and landed on Red Beach , north - west of Lae , without casualties . It carried out subsequent jungle operations until Lae fell 12 days later . The battalion also landed at Scarlet Beach near Finschhafen on 22 September , helping defend the area against Japanese counter-attack . The 2/13th returned to Australia in March 1944 , disembarking in Brisbane . After leave , it reformed at Ravenshoe and did not return to action until the final months of the war . Towards the end of April the 9th Division was transported to Morotai to prepare for amphibious landings on Borneo as part of the OBOE operations . The 2/13th landed at Brunei on 10 June before making another landing in the Miri-Lutong area ten days later . The battalion captured the Lutong airfield and oil tanks and moved inland along the Pujut Road to the Pujut oilfields . It then moved along Canada Hill to Lobang , where it remained until the end of the war . Following Japan 's surrender , the 2/13th 's ranks thinned , as men were discharged or transferred . The battalion moved to Luban in November and in December sailed to Australia to \" wind up \" in preparation for disbandment .","annotations":[{"text":"German forces","span":[1189,1201],"token_span":[237,238],"role":"Assailant","label":"Assailant","role_definition":"The Assailant is a group of armed forces (or, metonymically, their commander or the organization they represent) that encircles, surrounds, or otherwise cuts off the Beseiged in an attempt to force surrender."},{"text":"Italians","span":[1238,1245],"token_span":[245,245],"role":"Assailant","label":"Assailant","role_definition":"The Assailant is a group of armed forces (or, metonymically, their commander or the organization they represent) that encircles, surrounds, or otherwise cuts off the Beseiged in an attempt to force surrender."},{"text":"The British","span":[1269,1279],"token_span":[251,252],"role":"Victim","label":"Victim","role_definition":"The Victim is the fortification or geopolitical entity that is being attacked."},{"text":"Tobruk","span":[1331,1336],"token_span":[262,262],"role":"Victim","label":"Victim","role_definition":"The Victim is the fortification or geopolitical entity that is being attacked."},{"text":"Early in March 1941","span":[1039,1057],"token_span":[211,214],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the Assailant attacks the Victim."},{"text":"Tobruk","span":[1331,1336],"token_span":[262,262],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the place where the Assailant makes an assault on the Victim."},{"text":"North Africa","span":[2469,2480],"token_span":[475,476],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the place where the Assailant makes an assault on the Victim."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"test"},{"instance_id":"EN-1571-51-frame-Borrowing","frame":"Borrowing","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"The Borrower takes possession of a Theme with the knowledge that the Borrower will have to give the Theme back to the Lender after a Duration of time.","frame_ancestors":["Receiving","Getting","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Personal life Hsu faded into obscurity in the aftermath of a legal quagmire involving contract breaches and negative press covers .

He clenched his pipe between his teeth till its tip bobbed up towards his nose , then turned towards the hotel manager , who was , at that precise moment in the early hours of the morning , dripping wet and hopping up and down on one foot . \" What , \" Willie John said to the manager , \" seems to be the problem ? \" The Lions might have got away with it if it had n't been for Bobby Windsor .

I could see hordes of them rushing through the door and I did n't think they 'd be asking for autographs from these drunken idiots . \" Willie John paused and saw the next morning 's headlines in his mind . \" Drunken Lions darken rugby 's name \" . He considered the situation . Sucked on his pipe . \" Excuse me , but if you are going to get the police , \" he said to the manager with a smile , \" do you think there will be many of them ? \" That was that . The Lions left the next morning , but not before they had completed one last little ritual , every bit as entrenched in Lions tradition as the selection of an uncapped player : the tour manager handed over a cheque to compensate the hotel owner for all the damage done . Both those rituals are long gone now . This is the fifth Lions tour of the professional era , and the last uncapped player to be picked for the squad was Will Greenwood in 1997 . Back then , as Keith Wood has said , \" the game had just turned professional , but there was still a lot of the amateur ethos \" . It was just wild enough to make the current trip to Australia seem pretty tame . The prop Adam Jones has described his average day in the camp before this tour as \" Wake up . Cryotherapy . Breakfast . Train . Cryotherapy . Lunch . Train. Cryotherapy . Dinner . Sleep . \" The dullest boys on tour , Jones says , are the teetotallers , who include the captain , Sam Warburton . Brian O'Driscoll says the only chance the drinkers do have to \" unwind and have a few beers together \" is on the evening after an afternoon kick -off . After the 22 - 12 win against Queensland Reds , he said , \" the non- playing 23 went home early . By the time the others got in , it was midnight . Some of the boys were already in bed . It is not as conducive to hanging out after games . \" Quite right too . Modern media coverage does not allow players to get away with much , and professionalism means that even if they could , many of them would n't want to . Under Gatland and Warburton , the Welsh turned all - but teetotal at the 2011 World Cup , allowing those who \" feel they need it \" a \" bottle or two \" of beer after a match to relax . You could n't wring too many war stories out of all that on the after-dinner speaking circuit . But everyone remembers England 's dwarf - tossing , ferry -diving escapades . Most people wo n't need reminding , either , which team was two points away from making the final and which was dumped out in disgrace in the quarters . The Lions , though , have seen it all before . When they toured New Zealand in 1908 the English forward Percy Down took a dive off the side of a ferry in the very same spot as Manu Tuilagi did , in Auckland harbour 103 years later . Down did a somersault over the railing . The main difference was that six of his team - mates followed him overboard , one of them giving himself such a bad case of concussion as he hit the water that he missed the next match . By then the Lions already had a reputation for making trouble . On their very first tour , in 1888 , the local papers in Australia carried reports complaining about their \" Rowdyism on the Railway \" between Newcastle and Armidale , when \" three galoots invaded a private first class carriage , guzzled tea without paying , smashed the cups and saucers , and left the solitary passenger to stand the racket \" . So began 109 years of raising Cain . The 1968 Lions were accused of being the \" worst - behaved team ever to tour South Africa \" by the Johannesburg Sunday Times . The sage rugby writer JBG Thomas refuted this on the grounds that , unlike at least one lot of their predecessors , \" they have never set fire to a railway carriage \" . That may have been true . But a couple of them did incinerate a pile of blazers belonging to their team - mates in a bonfire on the tarmac at Kimberley airport after what was described as an \" airborne cheese and wine party \" . \" They have left a trail of havoc and stunned incredulity after three days in East London , \" thundered the Sunday Times . \" Marked by severe drinking bouts , riotous behaviour at hotels and nightclubs . They left broken hotel doors , broken glasses by the dozen , unpaid liquor debts and girls in tears because of outright rudeness . \" In New Zealand in 1977 the local girls were crying again , out of boredom rather than rudeness . That was the tour when the infamous \" Wanda from Wanganui \" told the press that she had slept with four of the tourists and found them to be \" lousy lovers , boring , self - centred , ruthless , always on the make and anything but exciting bedmates . Give me the down to earth Kiwi male any day \" . The squad were called a \" pack of animals \" on that trip , which was the tour which featured the Irish pair of Moss Keane , nicknamed \" rent -a-storm \" , and Willie Duggan , perhaps the last of the real hell - raisers . Duggan had what he called \" a pathological dislike of training \" , his one concession to fitness being a breakfast of half a dozen raw eggs on the morning of the match . Ollie Campbell remembers how he used to be able to tell which dressing room toilet Duggan was in before a match by the clouds of smoke billowing over the cubicle door . \" I always had the philosophy , \" Duggan said , \" that if you took 30 players out for a night and made sure they were well pissed before they went to bed at 3 am , then got them up at 8 am , trained the bejaysus out of them , then you would know who was up to lasting 80 minutes in an international . \" Duggan 's great mate Keane would have passed easily enough . Keane cultivated a fear of flying just so , his team - mates reckoned , it was taken for granted that he had to have five or six pints before he got on a plane or he would n't be able to travel . In 1977 he was in such a state when he got a last - minute call - up that he had a crash on the way to the airport , then left a message for his mother saying \" the car is at the airport , it 's written off , see you in four months \" . The king of them all , though , was Blair \" Paddy \" Mayne , a man who has every claim to being the hardest-drinking , free-est-swinging firebrand in the long history of the Lions . Mayne was an Irish lock , and one- time university heavyweight boxing champion . He toured in 1938 , when his great running gag , the centre Harry McKibbin said , was to burst into his team - mates ' rooms in the middle of the night , knocking the doors off the hinges , and then systematically smash up all furniture , Keith Moon-style . \" Until , \" McKibbin said , \" all the chairs and tables and things were just so much bits of kindling around us in the room while we were still in bed . \" The management despaired of Mayne , who used to run around with the Welsh hooker ( what is it about Welsh hookers ? ) Bunner Travers . The two of them dressed up as sailors and snuck off to the Durban docks just so they could pick fights with the local longshoremen . When they got to Ellis Park , they found that the stands were being erected by a team of convicts from the local prison who were sleeping in a compound underneath the scaffolding . Blair and Bunner befriended one of them , and asked him what he had done to merit a prison sentence . \" Stealing chickens , \" he said . \" And I 've been given a seven - year stretch . \" Full of sympathy for their new companion , who they nicknamed \" Rooster \" , Blair and Bunner returned that night with a pair of bolt cutters and some spare clothes . They sprung Rooster , and set him free . When he was caught the next day , it turned out the jacket he was wearing still had Mayne 's name stitched inside the collar . In desperation , the management decided to make Mayne share a room with the fly-half George Cromey , who also happened to be a Presbyterian minister . Even Cromey could n't stop Mayne sneaking off from an official dinner to go on a late - night hunting trip with a group of men he 'd met who were carrying rifles and lamplights . Cromey waited up for his room - mate till 3 am , and then , just as he was nodding off , Mayne broke down the door and announced \" I 've just shot a springbok \" . Cromey said his blood ran cold . And then he turned on the light , and saw Mayne , still wearing his cummerbund , with a dead antelope draped over his shoulders . \" Jimmy Unwin has been complaining that the meat here is n't as fresh as it is back home , \" Mayne announced . So he took himself off to his team - mate Unwin 's room , broke down that door too , and tossed the beast into his bed . The trouble was that , in all the confusion , Unwin cut his leg on the antelope 's horn . That would n't do . So Mayne decided to deposit it outside the room of the South Africa manager , with a note saying : \" A gift of fresh meat from the British Isles touring team . \" Well , that did it . Even though the captain , Sammy Walker , was a great friend of his , Mayne knew that the management were going to tan his hide for that . So he scarpered . The team did n't see him for three days , till he turned up , still in his suit , to meet them on board the ship they were sailing home on . And if those stories sound a little far-fetched , as though , like all the best tales , they have gained a little in the telling , well , they 've nothing on what he did next . Mayne became one of the founding members of the SAS in the second world war . He was recruited out of a prison cell , where he had been sent after striking a senior officer \" because he bored me \" . His bravery won him the Distinguished Service Order with three bars , the L\u00e9gion d'honneur , and the Croix de Guerre . Rugby has gained a lot from professionalism but it has a lost a little something too . On the pitch the 2013 Lions may play better rugby than most of their predecessors managed \u2013 harder , faster , and tougher , but off it , they 're not a patch on the ones who came before them .","annotations":[{"text":"Blair \" Paddy \" Mayne","span":[8632,8652],"token_span":[1804,1808],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent is the individual who ends the confinement or captivity of the Theme."},{"text":"Bunner Travers","span":[9389,9402],"token_span":[1956,1957],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent is the individual who ends the confinement or captivity of the Theme."},{"text":"Ellis Park","span":[9556,9565],"token_span":[1989,1990],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the Theme ceases to be confined."},{"text":"in a compound underneath the scaffolding","span":[9677,9716],"token_span":[2012,2017],"role":"Location_of_confinement","label":"Location_of_confinement","role_definition":"The location to which the Theme's motion was formerly inhibited."},{"text":"Rooster","span":[9970,9976],"token_span":[2073,2073],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The Theme is the person or object in motion released by the Agent."},{"text":"that night","span":[10008,10017],"token_span":[2080,2081],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time identifies when the Agent release the Theme ."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"While on tour in South Africa with the Lions in 1938 , Mayne 's rambunctious nature came to the fore , smashing up colleagues ' hotel rooms , temporarily freeing a convict he had befriended and who was working on the construction of the Ellis Park Stadium and also sneaking off from a formal dinner to go antelope hunting .","annotations":[{"text":"Mayne","span":[55,59],"token_span":[12,12],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent is the individual who ends the confinement or captivity of the Theme."},{"text":"a convict he had befriended","span":[162,188],"token_span":[30,34],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The Theme is the person or object in motion released by the Agent."},{"text":"1938","span":[48,51],"token_span":[10,10],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time identifies when the Agent release the Theme ."}],"trigger":{"text":"freeing","start_char":154,"end_char":160,"start_token":29,"end_token":29,"frame":"Breaking_out_captive"}},"source":{"text":"Willie John McBride stood in his underpants and surveyed the scene in front of him .

I could see hordes of them rushing through the door and I did n't think they 'd be asking for autographs from these drunken idiots . \" Willie John paused and saw the next morning 's headlines in his mind . \" Drunken Lions darken rugby 's name \" . He considered the situation . Sucked on his pipe . \" Excuse me , but if you are going to get the police , \" he said to the manager with a smile , \" do you think there will be many of them ? \" That was that . The Lions left the next morning , but not before they had completed one last little ritual , every bit as entrenched in Lions tradition as the selection of an uncapped player : the tour manager handed over a cheque to compensate the hotel owner for all the damage done . Both those rituals are long gone now . This is the fifth Lions tour of the professional era , and the last uncapped player to be picked for the squad was Will Greenwood in 1997 . Back then , as Keith Wood has said , \" the game had just turned professional , but there was still a lot of the amateur ethos \" . It was just wild enough to make the current trip to Australia seem pretty tame . The prop Adam Jones has described his average day in the camp before this tour as \" Wake up . Cryotherapy . Breakfast . Train . Cryotherapy . Lunch . Train. Cryotherapy . Dinner . Sleep . \" The dullest boys on tour , Jones says , are the teetotallers , who include the captain , Sam Warburton . Brian O'Driscoll says the only chance the drinkers do have to \" unwind and have a few beers together \" is on the evening after an afternoon kick -off . After the 22 - 12 win against Queensland Reds , he said , \" the non- playing 23 went home early . By the time the others got in , it was midnight . Some of the boys were already in bed . It is not as conducive to hanging out after games . \" Quite right too . Modern media coverage does not allow players to get away with much , and professionalism means that even if they could , many of them would n't want to . Under Gatland and Warburton , the Welsh turned all - but teetotal at the 2011 World Cup , allowing those who \" feel they need it \" a \" bottle or two \" of beer after a match to relax . You could n't wring too many war stories out of all that on the after-dinner speaking circuit . But everyone remembers England 's dwarf - tossing , ferry -diving escapades . Most people wo n't need reminding , either , which team was two points away from making the final and which was dumped out in disgrace in the quarters . The Lions , though , have seen it all before . When they toured New Zealand in 1908 the English forward Percy Down took a dive off the side of a ferry in the very same spot as Manu Tuilagi did , in Auckland harbour 103 years later . Down did a somersault over the railing . The main difference was that six of his team - mates followed him overboard , one of them giving himself such a bad case of concussion as he hit the water that he missed the next match . By then the Lions already had a reputation for making trouble . On their very first tour , in 1888 , the local papers in Australia carried reports complaining about their \" Rowdyism on the Railway \" between Newcastle and Armidale , when \" three galoots invaded a private first class carriage , guzzled tea without paying , smashed the cups and saucers , and left the solitary passenger to stand the racket \" . So began 109 years of raising Cain . The 1968 Lions were accused of being the \" worst - behaved team ever to tour South Africa \" by the Johannesburg Sunday Times . The sage rugby writer JBG Thomas refuted this on the grounds that , unlike at least one lot of their predecessors , \" they have never set fire to a railway carriage \" . That may have been true . But a couple of them did incinerate a pile of blazers belonging to their team - mates in a bonfire on the tarmac at Kimberley airport after what was described as an \" airborne cheese and wine party \" . \" They have left a trail of havoc and stunned incredulity after three days in East London , \" thundered the Sunday Times . \" Marked by severe drinking bouts , riotous behaviour at hotels and nightclubs . They left broken hotel doors , broken glasses by the dozen , unpaid liquor debts and girls in tears because of outright rudeness . \" In New Zealand in 1977 the local girls were crying again , out of boredom rather than rudeness . That was the tour when the infamous \" Wanda from Wanganui \" told the press that she had slept with four of the tourists and found them to be \" lousy lovers , boring , self - centred , ruthless , always on the make and anything but exciting bedmates . Give me the down to earth Kiwi male any day \" . The squad were called a \" pack of animals \" on that trip , which was the tour which featured the Irish pair of Moss Keane , nicknamed \" rent -a-storm \" , and Willie Duggan , perhaps the last of the real hell - raisers . Duggan had what he called \" a pathological dislike of training \" , his one concession to fitness being a breakfast of half a dozen raw eggs on the morning of the match . Ollie Campbell remembers how he used to be able to tell which dressing room toilet Duggan was in before a match by the clouds of smoke billowing over the cubicle door . \" I always had the philosophy , \" Duggan said , \" that if you took 30 players out for a night and made sure they were well pissed before they went to bed at 3 am , then got them up at 8 am , trained the bejaysus out of them , then you would know who was up to lasting 80 minutes in an international . \" Duggan 's great mate Keane would have passed easily enough . Keane cultivated a fear of flying just so , his team - mates reckoned , it was taken for granted that he had to have five or six pints before he got on a plane or he would n't be able to travel . In 1977 he was in such a state when he got a last - minute call - up that he had a crash on the way to the airport , then left a message for his mother saying \" the car is at the airport , it 's written off , see you in four months \" . The king of them all , though , was Blair \" Paddy \" Mayne , a man who has every claim to being the hardest-drinking , free-est-swinging firebrand in the long history of the Lions . Mayne was an Irish lock , and one- time university heavyweight boxing champion . He toured in 1938 , when his great running gag , the centre Harry McKibbin said , was to burst into his team - mates ' rooms in the middle of the night , knocking the doors off the hinges , and then systematically smash up all furniture , Keith Moon-style . \" Until , \" McKibbin said , \" all the chairs and tables and things were just so much bits of kindling around us in the room while we were still in bed . \" The management despaired of Mayne , who used to run around with the Welsh hooker ( what is it about Welsh hookers ? ) Bunner Travers . The two of them dressed up as sailors and snuck off to the Durban docks just so they could pick fights with the local longshoremen . When they got to Ellis Park , they found that the stands were being erected by a team of convicts from the local prison who were sleeping in a compound underneath the scaffolding . Blair and Bunner befriended one of them , and asked him what he had done to merit a prison sentence . \" Stealing chickens , \" he said . \" And I 've been given a seven - year stretch . \" Full of sympathy for their new companion , who they nicknamed \" Rooster \" , Blair and Bunner returned that night with a pair of bolt cutters and some spare clothes . They sprung Rooster , and set him free . When he was caught the next day , it turned out the jacket he was wearing still had Mayne 's name stitched inside the collar . In desperation , the management decided to make Mayne share a room with the fly-half George Cromey , who also happened to be a Presbyterian minister . Even Cromey could n't stop Mayne sneaking off from an official dinner to go on a late - night hunting trip with a group of men he 'd met who were carrying rifles and lamplights . Cromey waited up for his room - mate till 3 am , and then , just as he was nodding off , Mayne broke down the door and announced \" I 've just shot a springbok \" . Cromey said his blood ran cold . And then he turned on the light , and saw Mayne , still wearing his cummerbund , with a dead antelope draped over his shoulders . \" Jimmy Unwin has been complaining that the meat here is n't as fresh as it is back home , \" Mayne announced . So he took himself off to his team - mate Unwin 's room , broke down that door too , and tossed the beast into his bed . The trouble was that , in all the confusion , Unwin cut his leg on the antelope 's horn . That would n't do . So Mayne decided to deposit it outside the room of the South Africa manager , with a note saying : \" A gift of fresh meat from the British Isles touring team . \" Well , that did it . Even though the captain , Sammy Walker , was a great friend of his , Mayne knew that the management were going to tan his hide for that . So he scarpered . The team did n't see him for three days , till he turned up , still in his suit , to meet them on board the ship they were sailing home on . And if those stories sound a little far-fetched , as though , like all the best tales , they have gained a little in the telling , well , they 've nothing on what he did next . Mayne became one of the founding members of the SAS in the second world war . He was recruited out of a prison cell , where he had been sent after striking a senior officer \" because he bored me \" . His bravery won him the Distinguished Service Order with three bars , the L\u00e9gion d'honneur , and the Croix de Guerre . Rugby has gained a lot from professionalism but it has a lost a little something too . On the pitch the 2013 Lions may play better rugby than most of their predecessors managed \u2013 harder , faster , and tougher , but off it , they 're not a patch on the ones who came before them .","annotations":[{"text":"Blair \" Paddy \" Mayne","span":[8632,8652],"token_span":[1804,1808],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent is the individual who ends the confinement or captivity of the Theme."},{"text":"Bunner Travers","span":[9389,9402],"token_span":[1956,1957],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent is the individual who ends the confinement or captivity of the Theme."},{"text":"Rooster","span":[9970,9976],"token_span":[2073,2073],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The Theme is the person or object in motion released by the Agent."},{"text":"in a compound underneath the scaffolding","span":[9677,9716],"token_span":[2012,2017],"role":"Location_of_confinement","label":"Location_of_confinement","role_definition":"The location to which the Theme's motion was formerly inhibited."},{"text":"that night","span":[10008,10017],"token_span":[2080,2081],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time identifies when the Agent release the Theme ."},{"text":"Ellis Park","span":[9556,9565],"token_span":[1989,1990],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the Theme ceases to be confined."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"test"},{"instance_id":"EN-2726-43-frame-Building","frame":"Building","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"This frame describes assembly or construction actions, where an Agent joins Components together to form a Created_entity, which is profiled, and hence the object of the verb.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_create","Creating","Transitive_action","Objective_influence","Event","Intentionally_act"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"The disaster was memorialized in songs such as \" Mississippi Fire Blues \" and \" Natchez Mississippi Blues \" , by the Lewis Bronzeville Five ; \" The Natchez Fire \" , by Gene Gilmore ; \" The Death of Walter Barnes \" , by Leonard Caston ; \" The Natchez Burnin \" , by Howlin ' Wolf ; and \" Natchez Fire \" , by John Lee Hooker .

Gray said the memorial to the 1940 tragedy that killed 209 people should be moved to the club 's original site on St. Catherine Street . The Natchez Civic and Social Club of Chicago privately funded the memorial , which has sat between the gazebo and Silver Street on the bluff since 1940 , said Darrell White , director of the Natchez cultural heritage tourism and the Natchez Association for the Preservation of Afro-American Museum . Major Jake Middleton said at Tuesday 's meeting that he has met with Monroe Sago , the owner of the recently erected Rhythm Night Club Museum about the memorial 's location . Middleton said Sago asked if it was possible to move the marker to the original site , where the museum sits . Sago told the mayor the Mississippi Department of Historic Archives and History indicated the city had jurisdiction over deciding if the monument could be moved , Middleton said . The Natchez Monument Company assessed the monument at the mayor 's request and determined the 70- year - old structure could probably not sustain a move , Middleton said . Middleton said Monday that the issue has become a moot point as far as relocating the monument , but that it 's possible the city could consider placing some other placard with the victims ' names or a smaller monument at the original site .

Jenkins said moving the monument would also present potential public relations and logistic issues because the original site is private property . \u201c By sitting in the city park on the bluff , the monument anchors the tragedy as a very important component in the span of Natchez history that affected hundreds of families throughout the entire community , \u201d Jenkins said .","annotations":[{"text":"the Rhythm Night Club memorial","span":[106,135],"token_span":[19,23],"role":"Created_entity","label":"Created_entity","role_definition":"Created_entity identifies the entity that is created in the act of building."},{"text":"The Natchez Civic and Social Club of Chicago","span":[478,521],"token_span":[89,96],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent builds a Created_entity."},{"text":"between the gazebo and Silver Street on the bluff","span":[569,617],"token_span":[105,113],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the building occurs."},{"text":"1940","span":[625,628],"token_span":[115,115],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time when the building occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"The disaster was memorialized in songs such as \" Mississippi Fire Blues \" and \" Natchez Mississippi Blues \" , by the Lewis Bronzeville Five ; \" The Natchez Fire \" , by Gene Gilmore ; \" The Death of Walter Barnes \" , by Leonard Caston ; \" The Natchez Burnin \" , by Howlin ' Wolf ; and \" Natchez Fire \" , by John Lee Hooker .

This is n't really the case with Plattchen : Twist 'n ' Paint . True , the game lives up to its sub-title , as you will be twisting with the Wii-mote or nunchuk , and you do inevitably \" paint \" in a sense , but the game is far from regular in about every single way . Everything from it 's insane ( and yes , at times very unintuitive ) interface , its story \u2013 focused around Earth , seven billion years from now , when life has evolved into gears \u2026 yeah , like car gears \u2013 and lack of any real direction or helpful tutorial is simply odd . Chisel away at its rougher , stranger aspects though , and you 'll find a pretty entertaining , brain - bending puzzler for WiiWare . It 's not the best on the download service by any means , but if you 're looking to take a chance on a game you simply wo n't find on any other platform , Plattchen is an interesting 1,000 point investment . For starters though , I need to make mention of the interface . Laid out in a grid system ( much like a chess board , really ) , all of the modes and options are placed as colored tiles with no real explanation as to what you 're selecting , or why . After a few point- and - clicks through the confusing setup though , you 'll find that there 's a grid based on what mode , skill level , and unlocked level you 're selecting , with other random modes and options across the bottom to fill in the gaps . All screen-to - screen movement is done with clicking initially , but scrolling through pages ( such as a tutorial , or high score boards ) is done by moving the cursor off-screen in that direction . If you want to arrow right , for example , you wo n't click on the on-screen arrow ; you 'll actually drag your cursor and exit the screen off to the right . It 's odd , and that 's just one of dozens of strange choices made by the team , and some of them , such as the cursor dragging , actually feel kind of rewarding after a few repetitions . Everything from cursor avatars ( little space men or butterflies that act as save files , and also follow your cursor around the screen as you play ) to the random modes and control styles make Plattchen a curious little package . At times it can be fun , at others you wonder what the hell the team was smoking when they came up with the design . Closing Comments Plattchen is an odd game , pure and simple . The core mechanic is essentially a mash - up of gravity - based puzzle games , Bejeweled or Othello , IR pointer control , and rotation - based color selection , but with so many strange rules , modes , and options the game is both amazingly robust and also completely random at the same time . Some modes require players to saw back and forth with the Wii-mote to flip tiles \u2013 it does n't feel very good \u2013 the main twist - based mechanic is a great concept , but some gamers will be instantly turned off at how odd and somewhat uncomfortable hand positions need to be to play it right . Random aspects like shooter elements and a very unique , but also challenging , scoring system make this one a game that only adventurous players will drop 1,000 points for and try to get into , but like me , you may find yourself finding a pretty entertaining game and some great ( but strange ) concepts buried within this very unconventional WiiWare offering . Download at your own risk , but if you 're looking for something truly original , and do n't mind taking a gamble , Plattchen is certainly a one - of - a- kind offering . | Rating ||Description | | out of 10 | | click here for ratings guide | | 6.5 | | Presentation | A total grab - bad of poor font , interesting style , thrown in lighting effects and a bizarre overall design .

After a few point- and - clicks through the confusing setup though , you 'll find that there 's a grid based on what mode , skill level , and unlocked level you 're selecting , with other random modes and options across the bottom to fill in the gaps . All screen-to - screen movement is done with clicking initially , but scrolling through pages ( such as a tutorial , or high score boards ) is done by moving the cursor off-screen in that direction . If you want to arrow right , for example , you wo n't click on the on-screen arrow ; you 'll actually drag your cursor and exit the screen off to the right . It 's odd , and that 's just one of dozens of strange choices made by the team , and some of them , such as the cursor dragging , actually feel kind of rewarding after a few repetitions . Everything from cursor avatars ( little space men or butterflies that act as save files , and also follow your cursor around the screen as you play ) to the random modes and control styles make Plattchen a curious little package . At times it can be fun , at others you wonder what the hell the team was smoking when they came up with the design . Closing Comments Plattchen is an odd game , pure and simple . The core mechanic is essentially a mash - up of gravity - based puzzle games , Bejeweled or Othello , IR pointer control , and rotation - based color selection , but with so many strange rules , modes , and options the game is both amazingly robust and also completely random at the same time . Some modes require players to saw back and forth with the Wii-mote to flip tiles \u2013 it does n't feel very good \u2013 the main twist - based mechanic is a great concept , but some gamers will be instantly turned off at how odd and somewhat uncomfortable hand positions need to be to play it right . Random aspects like shooter elements and a very unique , but also challenging , scoring system make this one a game that only adventurous players will drop 1,000 points for and try to get into , but like me , you may find yourself finding a pretty entertaining game and some great ( but strange ) concepts buried within this very unconventional WiiWare offering . Download at your own risk , but if you 're looking for something truly original , and do n't mind taking a gamble , Plattchen is certainly a one - of - a- kind offering . | Rating ||Description | | out of 10 | | click here for ratings guide | | 6.5 | | Presentation | A total grab - bad of poor font , interesting style , thrown in lighting effects and a bizarre overall design .

Now while for certain practical purposes we are accustomed to distinguish these forms of media of exchange from money proper as being mere substitutes for money , it is clear that , other things equal , any increase or decrease of these money substitutes will have exactly the same effects as an increase or decrease of the quantity of money proper , and should therefore , for the purposes of theoretical analysis , be counted as money . In particular , it is necessary to take account of certain forms of credit not connected with banks which help , as is commonly said , to economize money , or to do the work for which , if they did not exist , money in the narrower sense of the word would be required . The criterion by which we may distinguish these circulating credits from other forms of credit which do not act as substitutes for money is that they give to somebody the means of purchasing goods without at the same time diminishing the money-spending power of somebody else . This is most obviously the case when the creditor receives a bill of exchange which he may pass on in payment for other goods . It applies also to a number of other forms of commercial credit , as , for example , when book credit is simultaneously introduced in a number of successive stages of production in the place of cash payments , and so on . The characteristic peculiarity of these forms of credit is that they spring up without being subject to any central control , but once they have come into existence their convertibility into other forms of money must be possible if a collapse of credit is to be avoided . \" Great 500 + page read for a Sunday afternoon . As for some more generic , brief ( and modern ) thoughts , I provide a few personal observations . First , a run through the orthodox framework . A basic account of money supply starts with the monetary aggregates that matter most for CPI inflation : in the case of the US this includes cash balances in aggregates such as the M2 ( total deposits ) or MZM ( zero maturity money / cash plus bank claims and money market funds ) . The traditional recent definition of \" available stock \" of money consists of the cash notional of money printed by the central bank ( outside money ) and how much the banking system has created by making loans ( inside money ) . Of course , due to the deposit multiplier effect , the inside money is much bigger than outside money . For the purposes of this narrative , the impact of securitization and derivatives ( tier 3 and 4 ) will not be discussed currently as the complexity involved would take a big turn for the uglier . It will , however , be a topic pursued in the future . The chart below shows the relative composition of inside money ( mostly deposits ) was almost ten times the outside money ( monetary base ) prior to the recent crisis . Furthermore , as the historical chart demonstrates below , while rare , it has occurred , most notably during the Great Depression , that the broader money stock and monetary base moved in opposite directions . A looking at the other side of the equation : demand , is the desired cash balances held by the public . Money demand rises via transactions demand with a growing economy , and falls when interest rates rise as zero-yielding cash becomes less attractive . Some math : money demand is the inverse of the velocity of money . If MV=PY ( where M is money stock , V is velocity and PY is nominal GDP ) , then ( 1/V ) = ( M/ PY ) , which is the level of money stock relative to nominal GDP . For households , 1/ V can be represented as the desired money holdings as a share of nominal income . If a household decided to increase their money holding to 9 months of income from 6 months ( a process occuring pervasively in the current environmen tof job and otherwise insecurity and lack of trust ) , V would fall to 1.33 from 2x . This is , in simple terms , the standard approach . As the bolded section of Hayek 's quote demonstrates , however , it does not go far enough . What he is trying to convey , is that the economy , like any other constantly shifting \" ecosystem \" can create its own media of exchange in order to \" economize \" on the use of inside and outside money for use in the purchasing of assets . Once assets themselves can serve as collateral , allowing for leverage purchases , they also take on money-like properties . And , herein lies the rub , when financial assets serve as collateral for borrowing to purchase yet more assets ( margin purchasing ) , this kind of shadow money becomes especially potent in driving asset price overshoots and bubbles . The chart below demonstrates the various parts of the credit cycle from the perspective of shadow money . A good form summary of a credit bubble is presented below , compliments of Credit Suisse : It starts with some genuine investment opportunity almost always related to a real improvement in technology or fundamentals . As strong price performance turns into a boom , optimistic investors desire to buy more on margin . They leverage up , usually using the buoyant asset itself as collateral . Lenders are all too willing to benefit by funding these purchases \u2013 after all , in the worst case , they will be holding valuable collateral . Borrowing terms such as haircuts , loan - to - value ratios , or margin requirements get easier . New money flows in , and associated financial assets begin to take on money -like attributes . As buying on leverage accelerates , prices and credit conditions blow past what is warranted by fundamentals . There is a monetary expansion in the broad sense of shadow money , but when the bust comes this is quickly reversed . Lending conditions tighten , collateral prices plummet , and highly leveraged optimists are wiped out . Now cash is king ; investors do not want houses , stocks , tulips or asset-backed commercial paper . To accommodate this demand for cash the government / central bank must quickly and forcefully expand the monetary base or else the increase in money demand can lead to a painful general deflation . Meanwhile , the sudden disappearance of good collateral in the financial system has created a dangerous de-leveraging that could feed on itself . The government may respond by increasing its own debt , since public collateral in the forms of treasury bills and such do still have funding liquidity , and by flooding the market with government paper the leverage collapse can be better managed . In this example effective money ( meaning shadow money plus the conventional money stock ) falls sharply , but it would have fallen much more without aggressive policy actions . As shadow money is a pro-cyclical , boom - time phenomenon , serving as a medium of exchange to finance a bubble , it affects asset prices directly , but only indirectly affects goods and services prices . An approach to estimate shadow money is calculating the immediate cash embodied in various debt securities : this can be done using asset haircuts in repo markets as well as current market values at FMVs in four points in time : early ' 07 , 2008 Pre Lehman , 2008 Post Lehman , and currently . If the market had outstanding securities worth $ 100 billion and repo haircuts of 5 % , then effective money would be $ 95 billion . If prices fell 50 % and repo haircuts rose to 20 % , effective money would be ( $ 100 * 0.5 ) * ( 1 - 20 % ) = $ 40 billion . Some asset haircuts are presented below in the attempt to determine effective money . The exhibit below estimates the size of effective US money stock as a sum of inside and outside money as well as shadow money , broken by private and public . A simplified breakdown of public and private effective money stock is presented on the next chart . Lastly , in order to demonstrate the dramatic outflow in private shadow money in the immediately pre / post Lehman economy , and just how effectively subdued the public shadow money response has been in dealing with the pull back of the private sector . Credit Suisse estimates that since 2007 the shadow money in private debt securities ( IG , HY bonds , non- agency RMBS , CMBS and ABS ) has fallen by 38 % or $ 3.6 trillion to $ 5.9 trillion , mostly due to a drop in market values , a scarcity of new issuance and , most importantly , a huge increase in repo haircuts . To compensate for this , public shadow money represented by treasuries , agency bonds and agency RMBS , has risen by $ 2.8 trillion , driven by an unprecedented ramp up in treasury and MBS issuance , and an increase in relevant asset prices . It is immediately obvious that the expansion of public shadow money is no match for the massive contraction seen in the private side . In this light , the question of the efficacy of the QE rollout and other public shadow money expansion has a tinge of futility to it , and not just in terms of money supply inflection points . The continued risk aversion by banks means inside money contraction , and not outside money expansion , is the threat . Not just the wilful allowance of rising inflation by policy makers , but , much more relevantly , a recovery in loan creation is needed . As Keynes noted , in assessing money demand , in addition to interest rates and growth , the subject of \" liquidity preference \" is critical - the desire by the public to hold ( often abnormally large ) cash balances as buffers in times when bad economic outcomes are feared , such as currently . As liquidity preference is a mass psychology phenomenon , it is impossible to quantify and predict . A huge increase in cash demand at a time of weak growth is a rare , dangerous and deflationary occurrence , and tends to occur exactly at financial crises such as this one . The administration 's , and the media 's , massaging of mass psychology through the constant and repeated message that all is well , in order to rekindle the liquidity preference by the general public , makes all the sense in the world , as absent its intangible \" benefit \" the road to recovery is doomed from the onset . But is even this propaganda machine doomed , in a more subversive way ? As households whose HELOCs have been cut or whose home equity has diminished , firms whose commercial property has collapsed in value , and banks whole ability to borrow in collateral markets to raise cash has fallen , all face the same problem : as the ability to raise cash has fallen , actual cash holdings must rise . And , unfortunately for the Obama administration , this is not a temporary hoarding , this is a permanent rebalancing in the trillions of dollars order of magnitude . As money demand skyrockets , the velocity of money plummets . In the pro-cyclical boom of 2002 - 2007 many components of everyday lives became a derivative of the shadow money system : repo lending became critical to credit creation ; home equity extraction became a key means to smooth consumer spending during period of low or no income ; off - balance sheet funding of various assets became a major earnings generator for commercial banks . Yet the process appears not to have affected money demand and supply : regular bank loan growth was limited , keeping money stock from soaring , and money demand was held back by beliefs in easy availability of borrowing against collateral . Most dangerously , economic policy , first through Greenspan then Bernanke , was complicit in allowing the boom by emphasizing price level inflation and not effective money . With regular M2 and MZM money supply and demand effected only indirectly by the credit boom and a massive output gap following the 2001 recession , it was never an issue that inflation would soar . A similar credit boom occurred with no inflation in the 1920s also , another period where a major collateralized credit pyramid was built virtually on top of a reasonably stable money stock . The reason , then , as now , key decision - makers did not notice a massive credit pyramid was being built , is because traditional money indicators , which this post argues are essentially useless in the context of today 's much more sophisticated from a money and liquidity perspective economy , were fairly stable . If there is one \" crime \" for which the most two recent chairmen of the Fed should be held in ridicule in hsitory books , it is precisely this . And yet while Greenspan may be somewhat forgiven due to his less academic nature , Bernanke , who was a depression \" specialist \" , should have seen our current predicament coming from miles . That he failed to do so is why future historians and market pundits will not spare him the criticism of being among the primary culprits for the current , multi-generational crisis . In the meantime , the propaganda issuing from every media source is to be expected ( and in some ways welcomed ) - it merely demonstrates that the administration finally grasps the severity of the problem , and the need for confidence to rematerialize , even if it is through the current meme of Green Shoots ( whose very existence is flawed flawed upon more than a cursory examination , whether it is due to seasonal factors , subsequent economic data adjustments , or outright misrepresentations ) . Yet now that any hope of a preventative approach has failed and we are stuck with the consequnces , what happens ? In order for there to even be hope of recovery , money stock has to rebound . Not only Bernanke , or Geithner , but Obama himself has now demontrated that he is on the same page with regard to explanding the shadow money stock ( while presumably providing better oversight and supervision ) . For now , the immediate focus should be on whether confidence can return : in collateral , in lending , in risk taking , in entrepreneurship . In the meantime , any talk of inflation is premature . The deflationary shock has to wear off first , and in many asset classes it has not even accelerated yet . It is ironic that shadow money and credit are not just the dynamo that drives the free market , but also its Achilles heel . While most of the time they serve a useful purpose , currently their purpose is a destructive one as long as they continue to trendline away from recent asymptotes . If history is any indication , the overshoot to the downside will likely be just as severe as the upside overshoot was protracted . In that case , nothing the Fed does can accelerate inflation . Also , while possible that Bernanke has something up his sleeve , it is improbable . Thus while the market continues trading on a sepculative basis and conjecture rooted in the casino psychology that has gripped equity markets ( and recently credit markets as well ) , the long term picture is much less sanguine as the excesses of the credit cycle from the past 60 years wear off and not only asset prices but also repo haircuts find a new equilibrium . What is certain is that the near- term economy will be driven in spurts and starts as mass psychology shifts from one extreme to another . The next catalyst in my view will be the interplay of the impact of stimulus spending coupled with the failure of the green shoots materializing into anything worthwhile . And while this will make the life of daytraders interesting , the traditional buy and hold approach to asset accumulation must be delayed indefinitely , until the critical equilibrium discussed above is achieved .

Now while for certain practical purposes we are accustomed to distinguish these forms of media of exchange from money proper as being mere substitutes for money , it is clear that , other things equal , any increase or decrease of these money substitutes will have exactly the same effects as an increase or decrease of the quantity of money proper , and should therefore , for the purposes of theoretical analysis , be counted as money . In particular , it is necessary to take account of certain forms of credit not connected with banks which help , as is commonly said , to economize money , or to do the work for which , if they did not exist , money in the narrower sense of the word would be required . The criterion by which we may distinguish these circulating credits from other forms of credit which do not act as substitutes for money is that they give to somebody the means of purchasing goods without at the same time diminishing the money-spending power of somebody else . This is most obviously the case when the creditor receives a bill of exchange which he may pass on in payment for other goods . It applies also to a number of other forms of commercial credit , as , for example , when book credit is simultaneously introduced in a number of successive stages of production in the place of cash payments , and so on . The characteristic peculiarity of these forms of credit is that they spring up without being subject to any central control , but once they have come into existence their convertibility into other forms of money must be possible if a collapse of credit is to be avoided . \" Great 500 + page read for a Sunday afternoon . As for some more generic , brief ( and modern ) thoughts , I provide a few personal observations . First , a run through the orthodox framework . A basic account of money supply starts with the monetary aggregates that matter most for CPI inflation : in the case of the US this includes cash balances in aggregates such as the M2 ( total deposits ) or MZM ( zero maturity money / cash plus bank claims and money market funds ) . The traditional recent definition of \" available stock \" of money consists of the cash notional of money printed by the central bank ( outside money ) and how much the banking system has created by making loans ( inside money ) . Of course , due to the deposit multiplier effect , the inside money is much bigger than outside money . For the purposes of this narrative , the impact of securitization and derivatives ( tier 3 and 4 ) will not be discussed currently as the complexity involved would take a big turn for the uglier . It will , however , be a topic pursued in the future . The chart below shows the relative composition of inside money ( mostly deposits ) was almost ten times the outside money ( monetary base ) prior to the recent crisis . Furthermore , as the historical chart demonstrates below , while rare , it has occurred , most notably during the Great Depression , that the broader money stock and monetary base moved in opposite directions . A looking at the other side of the equation : demand , is the desired cash balances held by the public . Money demand rises via transactions demand with a growing economy , and falls when interest rates rise as zero-yielding cash becomes less attractive . Some math : money demand is the inverse of the velocity of money . If MV=PY ( where M is money stock , V is velocity and PY is nominal GDP ) , then ( 1/V ) = ( M/ PY ) , which is the level of money stock relative to nominal GDP . For households , 1/ V can be represented as the desired money holdings as a share of nominal income . If a household decided to increase their money holding to 9 months of income from 6 months ( a process occuring pervasively in the current environmen tof job and otherwise insecurity and lack of trust ) , V would fall to 1.33 from 2x . This is , in simple terms , the standard approach . As the bolded section of Hayek 's quote demonstrates , however , it does not go far enough . What he is trying to convey , is that the economy , like any other constantly shifting \" ecosystem \" can create its own media of exchange in order to \" economize \" on the use of inside and outside money for use in the purchasing of assets . Once assets themselves can serve as collateral , allowing for leverage purchases , they also take on money-like properties . And , herein lies the rub , when financial assets serve as collateral for borrowing to purchase yet more assets ( margin purchasing ) , this kind of shadow money becomes especially potent in driving asset price overshoots and bubbles . The chart below demonstrates the various parts of the credit cycle from the perspective of shadow money . A good form summary of a credit bubble is presented below , compliments of Credit Suisse : It starts with some genuine investment opportunity almost always related to a real improvement in technology or fundamentals . As strong price performance turns into a boom , optimistic investors desire to buy more on margin . They leverage up , usually using the buoyant asset itself as collateral . Lenders are all too willing to benefit by funding these purchases \u2013 after all , in the worst case , they will be holding valuable collateral . Borrowing terms such as haircuts , loan - to - value ratios , or margin requirements get easier . New money flows in , and associated financial assets begin to take on money -like attributes . As buying on leverage accelerates , prices and credit conditions blow past what is warranted by fundamentals . There is a monetary expansion in the broad sense of shadow money , but when the bust comes this is quickly reversed . Lending conditions tighten , collateral prices plummet , and highly leveraged optimists are wiped out . Now cash is king ; investors do not want houses , stocks , tulips or asset-backed commercial paper . To accommodate this demand for cash the government / central bank must quickly and forcefully expand the monetary base or else the increase in money demand can lead to a painful general deflation . Meanwhile , the sudden disappearance of good collateral in the financial system has created a dangerous de-leveraging that could feed on itself . The government may respond by increasing its own debt , since public collateral in the forms of treasury bills and such do still have funding liquidity , and by flooding the market with government paper the leverage collapse can be better managed . In this example effective money ( meaning shadow money plus the conventional money stock ) falls sharply , but it would have fallen much more without aggressive policy actions . As shadow money is a pro-cyclical , boom - time phenomenon , serving as a medium of exchange to finance a bubble , it affects asset prices directly , but only indirectly affects goods and services prices . An approach to estimate shadow money is calculating the immediate cash embodied in various debt securities : this can be done using asset haircuts in repo markets as well as current market values at FMVs in four points in time : early ' 07 , 2008 Pre Lehman , 2008 Post Lehman , and currently . If the market had outstanding securities worth $ 100 billion and repo haircuts of 5 % , then effective money would be $ 95 billion . If prices fell 50 % and repo haircuts rose to 20 % , effective money would be ( $ 100 * 0.5 ) * ( 1 - 20 % ) = $ 40 billion . Some asset haircuts are presented below in the attempt to determine effective money . The exhibit below estimates the size of effective US money stock as a sum of inside and outside money as well as shadow money , broken by private and public . A simplified breakdown of public and private effective money stock is presented on the next chart . Lastly , in order to demonstrate the dramatic outflow in private shadow money in the immediately pre / post Lehman economy , and just how effectively subdued the public shadow money response has been in dealing with the pull back of the private sector . Credit Suisse estimates that since 2007 the shadow money in private debt securities ( IG , HY bonds , non- agency RMBS , CMBS and ABS ) has fallen by 38 % or $ 3.6 trillion to $ 5.9 trillion , mostly due to a drop in market values , a scarcity of new issuance and , most importantly , a huge increase in repo haircuts . To compensate for this , public shadow money represented by treasuries , agency bonds and agency RMBS , has risen by $ 2.8 trillion , driven by an unprecedented ramp up in treasury and MBS issuance , and an increase in relevant asset prices . It is immediately obvious that the expansion of public shadow money is no match for the massive contraction seen in the private side . In this light , the question of the efficacy of the QE rollout and other public shadow money expansion has a tinge of futility to it , and not just in terms of money supply inflection points . The continued risk aversion by banks means inside money contraction , and not outside money expansion , is the threat . Not just the wilful allowance of rising inflation by policy makers , but , much more relevantly , a recovery in loan creation is needed . As Keynes noted , in assessing money demand , in addition to interest rates and growth , the subject of \" liquidity preference \" is critical - the desire by the public to hold ( often abnormally large ) cash balances as buffers in times when bad economic outcomes are feared , such as currently . As liquidity preference is a mass psychology phenomenon , it is impossible to quantify and predict . A huge increase in cash demand at a time of weak growth is a rare , dangerous and deflationary occurrence , and tends to occur exactly at financial crises such as this one . The administration 's , and the media 's , massaging of mass psychology through the constant and repeated message that all is well , in order to rekindle the liquidity preference by the general public , makes all the sense in the world , as absent its intangible \" benefit \" the road to recovery is doomed from the onset . But is even this propaganda machine doomed , in a more subversive way ? As households whose HELOCs have been cut or whose home equity has diminished , firms whose commercial property has collapsed in value , and banks whole ability to borrow in collateral markets to raise cash has fallen , all face the same problem : as the ability to raise cash has fallen , actual cash holdings must rise . And , unfortunately for the Obama administration , this is not a temporary hoarding , this is a permanent rebalancing in the trillions of dollars order of magnitude . As money demand skyrockets , the velocity of money plummets . In the pro-cyclical boom of 2002 - 2007 many components of everyday lives became a derivative of the shadow money system : repo lending became critical to credit creation ; home equity extraction became a key means to smooth consumer spending during period of low or no income ; off - balance sheet funding of various assets became a major earnings generator for commercial banks . Yet the process appears not to have affected money demand and supply : regular bank loan growth was limited , keeping money stock from soaring , and money demand was held back by beliefs in easy availability of borrowing against collateral . Most dangerously , economic policy , first through Greenspan then Bernanke , was complicit in allowing the boom by emphasizing price level inflation and not effective money . With regular M2 and MZM money supply and demand effected only indirectly by the credit boom and a massive output gap following the 2001 recession , it was never an issue that inflation would soar . A similar credit boom occurred with no inflation in the 1920s also , another period where a major collateralized credit pyramid was built virtually on top of a reasonably stable money stock . The reason , then , as now , key decision - makers did not notice a massive credit pyramid was being built , is because traditional money indicators , which this post argues are essentially useless in the context of today 's much more sophisticated from a money and liquidity perspective economy , were fairly stable . If there is one \" crime \" for which the most two recent chairmen of the Fed should be held in ridicule in hsitory books , it is precisely this . And yet while Greenspan may be somewhat forgiven due to his less academic nature , Bernanke , who was a depression \" specialist \" , should have seen our current predicament coming from miles . That he failed to do so is why future historians and market pundits will not spare him the criticism of being among the primary culprits for the current , multi-generational crisis . In the meantime , the propaganda issuing from every media source is to be expected ( and in some ways welcomed ) - it merely demonstrates that the administration finally grasps the severity of the problem , and the need for confidence to rematerialize , even if it is through the current meme of Green Shoots ( whose very existence is flawed flawed upon more than a cursory examination , whether it is due to seasonal factors , subsequent economic data adjustments , or outright misrepresentations ) . Yet now that any hope of a preventative approach has failed and we are stuck with the consequnces , what happens ? In order for there to even be hope of recovery , money stock has to rebound . Not only Bernanke , or Geithner , but Obama himself has now demontrated that he is on the same page with regard to explanding the shadow money stock ( while presumably providing better oversight and supervision ) . For now , the immediate focus should be on whether confidence can return : in collateral , in lending , in risk taking , in entrepreneurship . In the meantime , any talk of inflation is premature . The deflationary shock has to wear off first , and in many asset classes it has not even accelerated yet . It is ironic that shadow money and credit are not just the dynamo that drives the free market , but also its Achilles heel . While most of the time they serve a useful purpose , currently their purpose is a destructive one as long as they continue to trendline away from recent asymptotes . If history is any indication , the overshoot to the downside will likely be just as severe as the upside overshoot was protracted . In that case , nothing the Fed does can accelerate inflation . Also , while possible that Bernanke has something up his sleeve , it is improbable . Thus while the market continues trading on a sepculative basis and conjecture rooted in the casino psychology that has gripped equity markets ( and recently credit markets as well ) , the long term picture is much less sanguine as the excesses of the credit cycle from the past 60 years wear off and not only asset prices but also repo haircuts find a new equilibrium . What is certain is that the near- term economy will be driven in spurts and starts as mass psychology shifts from one extreme to another . The next catalyst in my view will be the interplay of the impact of stimulus spending coupled with the failure of the green shoots materializing into anything worthwhile . And while this will make the life of daytraders interesting , the traditional buy and hold approach to asset accumulation must be delayed indefinitely , until the critical equilibrium discussed above is achieved . Until that happens , anyone who claims the economy is headed in the right direction ( either much higher or much lower ) , is merely spreading their own agenda or has an opinion that is fundamentally not rooted in actual facts .

Terrifying . \" We toddle off to a nearby caf\u00e9 . He is instantly likeable , warm yet vulnerable , with a big baseball cap rammed on as if for protection . He is \" thrilled \" about the project in hand : a revival of his 2000 play , Vincent River , at Trafalgar Studios , starring Lynda Bellingham and Mark Field . It 's a timely revival , he says , because , as a play that centres around a homophobic murder , it is more relevant now than when it first opened . \" You walk around the East End now and you see homophobic graffiti . You see some extremely enlightened graffiti , but you also see swastikas . Lots of them . There 's anti-gay fundamentalism coming from both Islam and the Catholic right .

It 's scary stuff . \" So is Vincent River a play about gay issues ? \" No more than Suddenly Last Summer is about gay issues . \" The first time it was performed , theatre critic Benedict Nightingale called it Ridley 's \" best play to date \" , but its social realism was largely written off . \" People were quick to say , ' This kind of homophobia does n't exist any more , we 're all liberals now . ' Well , that 's not my experience . Since the play premiered we 've had a killing on Clapham Common , we 've had a nail - bomb in Soho . We 've seen photographs of beautiful young men being hanged from a crane in Iran , surrounded by cheering crowds . What was their crime ? They were having a relationship . We 're beginning to realise that liberal culture is a thin veneer . \" Ah yes . Civilisation , to Ridley , is paper-thin . His canon of plays , from The Pitchfork Disney ( which opened starring Rupert Graves in 1992 ) to Leaves of Glass ( Ben Whishaw and Maxine Peake took the leads at the Soho Theatre in 2006 ) , are all set in a distinctive half - world where society is deteriorating and apocalypse is just around the corner . Before meeting Ridley , I had always thought they were composites of the barbaric past and a dystopian future . Now I see that , to him , they are set in the present . \" My plays are about now . Or tomorrow morning . Artists I really admire , such as JG Ballard and David Cronenberg , their take on society is always a beat ahead of where it 's going . Not that I would compare myself with them , of course \" ( one of Ridley 's vices is modesty ) \" but my plays to a certain extent have that . \" The Fastest Clock in the Universe , his 1992 surreal study of male vanity and homoeroticism , was originally derided as fantasy , but directly after , along came Marky Mark Wahlberg in his pants , the cult of Calvin Klein , and the rise of the metrosexual . It is to be hoped that the nightmare vision of Mercury Fur is not equally prophetic . This seems unlikely \u2013 its premise being a uniquely and precisely horrifying combination of elements including torture tourism , a boy wearing a golden suit , and \u2013 the scariest word in the English language \u2013 meathooks . But Ridley is quick to point out that a parallel scenario occurred soon after in Iraq . \" It was Mercury Fur re-enacted . All - American farm boys from Idaho , going to church on Sundays and eating apple pie , and all it took was 10 weeks without moral responsibility for them to be raping small girls and filming it on their mobiles , by all accounts . \" If there is a whiff of defensiveness about his retort , it is because he is still scarred from the furore surrounding its first showing . Mercury Fur was Ridley 's fifth play for adults , commissioned by Paines Plough and performed at the Menier Chocolate Factory in 2005 . A now-legendary production , it was directed by John Tiffany and starred Whishaw , both of whom have since gone on to greatness . The play is gut -wrenching yet never graphic : as in a Greek tragedy , its violence is largely reported . Its characters grapple with questions of love and decency . It has a moral core ; a sense of redemption , even . Yet the outraged response to the play overlooked all this . It was as if Ridley was being arraigned for his own vivid gift . \" People said , ' It 's sick \u2013 you see a child being tortured on stage . ' You did n't , but people seemed to think you did . \" Most punishingly , drama critic Charles Spencer said Ridley was \" turned on by his own sick fantasies \" . \" That personal attack just floored me , \" says Ridley . \" It 's horrible when all you 're trying to do is work , and you hope you have something to say about the world and the times in which we live , and then people just call you ' sick ' and ' pervert ' . As if we 're living in some Utopia and I 'm trying to spoil it for everyone . What I did in Mercury Fur , I did for a reason . I like putting people on a ghost train , but I guide them safely through the other end ; I do n't want to keep them there , I want to take them on a ritual of exorcism . \" ' Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30 - day free trial Sign up Did the public censure make him feel he had gone too far ? \" In the act of writing it never occurs to me that anything is shocking or not shocking . It would have been moral cowardice not to take it to the conclusion that the play was setting up . \" Worst of all , Ridley 's publisher , Faber and Faber , refused the play . \" I could n't believe I 'd been caught up in that controversy in this day and age . The first comment that the editor at Faber said to me was , \" I 've got to tell you that several people here are seriously offended by this . \" I have a thing about dialogue , so I remember . Those were her words . It was as if they 'd all suddenly turned into a bunch of Cardinal Wolseys , deciding what was right and wrong . It 's not their job to be moral arbiters ; it 's their job to publish . I think Faber realised they could n't say this , so after a few weeks they decided to rephrase it as , ' It 's a piece of writing that I do not admire . ' \" Ridley moved to Methuen , taking his back - catalogue with him . Mercury Fur has since been in constant demand , with productions both amateur and professional taking place across the world . It is now touring Australia . A gift for savage prophecy is often unwelcome in society , and Ridley has it in abundance . It seems to bubble up out of him . \" I constantly think a lot of my DNA is alien . I look at people and I hear them talking and I think , ' I do n't get what you 're saying , I do n't see the world like you see it . ' And then I come out with one word and they look at me as though I 've just said the most shocking disgraceful thing . But I 've grown up with that . My nickname at school was ' alien ' . \" Sitting there in the cosy caf\u00e9 in Covent Garden , Ridley launches into a speech that brings a real chill , casting runes for the future of East London . \" I firmly believe that we will see something terrible happen , \" he says . \" Fundamentalism is on the rise , whether it 's from Islam or the Catholic right . It 's ' We are right , you are wrong . ' It 's ' Women should not show their faces . ' It 's ' Men should not go out with men . ' It 's a pressure cooker and the lid is screwed on so tight that anger will just erupt in a terrible way . I firmly believe that there will be killings on our streets . \" Ridley is something of a recluse . He has lived in the same Bethnal Green tower block since he was born , and his flat is \" minuscule \" , a Peabody dwelling crammed with paperbacks , model dinosaurs , skulls and skins . \" You have to take this Bond -esque route to get past the door \u2013 there 's literally no room to move . I constantly moan to my mates about my lack of space . About three times a year I have these ' avalanches ' where about 20 shelves will fall down . \" To him , it is heaven to close the door and unplug the phone . \" You could lock me in there forever with pens and paper and I 'd be happy . As a child I remember watching films where people got life sentences in solitary confinement and I 'd think , ' How lovely . ' \" His mother worked on a supermarket checkout ; his father was a lorry driver . \" My world was between five streets . You could n't make a bowl of gravy without someone reaching out to dip a bit of bread in it . \" It would all come in useful , starting with his screenplay for The Krays . As a child , he was very sick with asthma . \" I did n't talk much , so I grew up listening a lot while at home off school . I was in an oxygen tent for a lot of the time and people tended to think it was soundproofed and talked very openly in front of me . \" He used to hide a tape recorder under his parents ' sofa in the living - room , tape them all night , then write up transcripts . Now he eavesdrops professionally , recording conversations on the bus in Bethnal Green ( he mimes holding a Dictaphone surreptitiously over his shoulder ) . He is a real poet of place ; all his plays are set in the East End . \" A dilapidated room above an abandoned factory in the East End of London \" is the set direction for The Fastest Clock in the Universe ; Vincent River is full of references to \" Vicky Park \" and Mare Street . Ridley transcribes local graffiti and photographs passers - by . \" Some of the biggest influences on Mercury Fur were the snaps I 'd taken of people out and about in fur coats looking very bling , and suddenly this gang started to form in my mind . \" Everything feeds into his work . \" I never know where the life stops and the work starts or vice versa . \" When mates come round and we have a cup of tea , I 'm always asking them to read little bits of speeches or taking photographs \u2013 my ' studio ' is literally four squares of black paper pinned on the wall next to the fridge \u2013 or asking them to try on outfits . Most of my mates are actors . \" Might these actors include Mortensen or Whishaw ? Or Jude Law , who starred in The Fastest Clock in the Universe ? \" I have n't seen Jude for a bit \" he laughs . \" But the other two are both mates . How blessed am I ? They 'll be round here and it 's on with the sunglasses or the silly hat . We might take 1,000 digital photos in an afternoon , and one of them will just have something special that I can use in a play . \" The visual and verbal clearly synthesise in Ridley 's head ; as an art-school contemporary of Damien Hirst and the Chapman brothers , he sees himself as a Sensation artist , working in a linguistic medium . It 's only because theatre critics ca n't think outside the amphitheatre that they have n't noticed . \" It 's the most obvious thing to me . \" And indeed , the insects that recur through his work , variously tortured and vomited up by his characters , the butterfly motif , the shock and scandal : the parallels are all there . \" A lot of the stuff they are dealing with I am dealing with . Birds , insects , crocodiles , dinosaurs , dolphins \u2013 there 's a menagerie that keeps coming back in my work . I do n't plan it that way . Work is a lot like dreaming ; it 's whatever the unconscious throws up . I love it when you write furiously at night and then the next morning you go back and read it and it 's like , ' Oh my God , that 's bloody good , I did n't realise I 'd done that . ' \" Ridley 's existence is geared towards work . \" I've never earned much ; I do n't have a mortgage and I do n't want one . Everything is set up so I can do the work I want to do , and I do n't have to write six episodes of EastEnders to pay the bills . \" He writes , he says , to understand the world . \" My work is not cerebral at all . Telling stories and making images is how I make sense of the world , which is a very confusing place for me . Relationships are very confusing , sex is incredibly confusing . Perhaps I 'm not meeting the right people . I open the window and demons fly in . I think what I do in my work is try to make the demons feel welcome . \" I 'm at my happiest when I 'm alone at the desk in my back room , where I 've stuck black paper up at all the windows and I write by one lamp at this desk . I 'm at my least lonely when I 'm in that cocoon of writing . \" And there we shall leave Philip Ridley , to conjure his dark and comforting visions . * ' Vincent River ' : Trafalgar Studios , London SW1 ( 0870 060 6632 , www.theambassadors. com ) , from Tues to 17 November .

This seems unlikely \u2013 its premise being a uniquely and precisely horrifying combination of elements including torture tourism , a boy wearing a golden suit , and \u2013 the scariest word in the English language \u2013 meathooks . But Ridley is quick to point out that a parallel scenario occurred soon after in Iraq . \" It was Mercury Fur re-enacted . All - American farm boys from Idaho , going to church on Sundays and eating apple pie , and all it took was 10 weeks without moral responsibility for them to be raping small girls and filming it on their mobiles , by all accounts . \" If there is a whiff of defensiveness about his retort , it is because he is still scarred from the furore surrounding its first showing . Mercury Fur was Ridley 's fifth play for adults , commissioned by Paines Plough and performed at the Menier Chocolate Factory in 2005 . A now-legendary production , it was directed by John Tiffany and starred Whishaw , both of whom have since gone on to greatness . The play is gut -wrenching yet never graphic : as in a Greek tragedy , its violence is largely reported . Its characters grapple with questions of love and decency . It has a moral core ; a sense of redemption , even . Yet the outraged response to the play overlooked all this . It was as if Ridley was being arraigned for his own vivid gift . \" People said , ' It 's sick \u2013 you see a child being tortured on stage . ' You did n't , but people seemed to think you did . \" Most punishingly , drama critic Charles Spencer said Ridley was \" turned on by his own sick fantasies \" . \" That personal attack just floored me , \" says Ridley . \" It 's horrible when all you 're trying to do is work , and you hope you have something to say about the world and the times in which we live , and then people just call you ' sick ' and ' pervert ' . As if we 're living in some Utopia and I 'm trying to spoil it for everyone . What I did in Mercury Fur , I did for a reason . I like putting people on a ghost train , but I guide them safely through the other end ; I do n't want to keep them there , I want to take them on a ritual of exorcism . \" ' Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30 - day free trial Sign up Did the public censure make him feel he had gone too far ? \" In the act of writing it never occurs to me that anything is shocking or not shocking . It would have been moral cowardice not to take it to the conclusion that the play was setting up . \" Worst of all , Ridley 's publisher , Faber and Faber , refused the play . \" I could n't believe I 'd been caught up in that controversy in this day and age . The first comment that the editor at Faber said to me was , \" I 've got to tell you that several people here are seriously offended by this . \" I have a thing about dialogue , so I remember . Those were her words . It was as if they 'd all suddenly turned into a bunch of Cardinal Wolseys , deciding what was right and wrong . It 's not their job to be moral arbiters ; it 's their job to publish . I think Faber realised they could n't say this , so after a few weeks they decided to rephrase it as , ' It 's a piece of writing that I do not admire . ' \" Ridley moved to Methuen , taking his back - catalogue with him . Mercury Fur has since been in constant demand , with productions both amateur and professional taking place across the world . It is now touring Australia . A gift for savage prophecy is often unwelcome in society , and Ridley has it in abundance . It seems to bubble up out of him . \" I constantly think a lot of my DNA is alien . I look at people and I hear them talking and I think , ' I do n't get what you 're saying , I do n't see the world like you see it . ' And then I come out with one word and they look at me as though I 've just said the most shocking disgraceful thing . But I 've grown up with that . My nickname at school was ' alien ' . \" Sitting there in the cosy caf\u00e9 in Covent Garden , Ridley launches into a speech that brings a real chill , casting runes for the future of East London . \" I firmly believe that we will see something terrible happen , \" he says . \" Fundamentalism is on the rise , whether it 's from Islam or the Catholic right . It 's ' We are right , you are wrong . ' It 's ' Women should not show their faces . ' It 's ' Men should not go out with men . ' It 's a pressure cooker and the lid is screwed on so tight that anger will just erupt in a terrible way . I firmly believe that there will be killings on our streets . \" Ridley is something of a recluse . He has lived in the same Bethnal Green tower block since he was born , and his flat is \" minuscule \" , a Peabody dwelling crammed with paperbacks , model dinosaurs , skulls and skins . \" You have to take this Bond -esque route to get past the door \u2013 there 's literally no room to move . I constantly moan to my mates about my lack of space . About three times a year I have these ' avalanches ' where about 20 shelves will fall down . \" To him , it is heaven to close the door and unplug the phone . \" You could lock me in there forever with pens and paper and I 'd be happy . As a child I remember watching films where people got life sentences in solitary confinement and I 'd think , ' How lovely . ' \" His mother worked on a supermarket checkout ; his father was a lorry driver . \" My world was between five streets . You could n't make a bowl of gravy without someone reaching out to dip a bit of bread in it . \" It would all come in useful , starting with his screenplay for The Krays . As a child , he was very sick with asthma . \" I did n't talk much , so I grew up listening a lot while at home off school . I was in an oxygen tent for a lot of the time and people tended to think it was soundproofed and talked very openly in front of me . \" He used to hide a tape recorder under his parents ' sofa in the living - room , tape them all night , then write up transcripts . Now he eavesdrops professionally , recording conversations on the bus in Bethnal Green ( he mimes holding a Dictaphone surreptitiously over his shoulder ) . He is a real poet of place ; all his plays are set in the East End . \" A dilapidated room above an abandoned factory in the East End of London \" is the set direction for The Fastest Clock in the Universe ; Vincent River is full of references to \" Vicky Park \" and Mare Street . Ridley transcribes local graffiti and photographs passers - by . \" Some of the biggest influences on Mercury Fur were the snaps I 'd taken of people out and about in fur coats looking very bling , and suddenly this gang started to form in my mind . \" Everything feeds into his work . \" I never know where the life stops and the work starts or vice versa . \" When mates come round and we have a cup of tea , I 'm always asking them to read little bits of speeches or taking photographs \u2013 my ' studio ' is literally four squares of black paper pinned on the wall next to the fridge \u2013 or asking them to try on outfits . Most of my mates are actors . \" Might these actors include Mortensen or Whishaw ? Or Jude Law , who starred in The Fastest Clock in the Universe ? \" I have n't seen Jude for a bit \" he laughs . \" But the other two are both mates . How blessed am I ? They 'll be round here and it 's on with the sunglasses or the silly hat . We might take 1,000 digital photos in an afternoon , and one of them will just have something special that I can use in a play . \" The visual and verbal clearly synthesise in Ridley 's head ; as an art-school contemporary of Damien Hirst and the Chapman brothers , he sees himself as a Sensation artist , working in a linguistic medium . It 's only because theatre critics ca n't think outside the amphitheatre that they have n't noticed . \" It 's the most obvious thing to me . \" And indeed , the insects that recur through his work , variously tortured and vomited up by his characters , the butterfly motif , the shock and scandal : the parallels are all there . \" A lot of the stuff they are dealing with I am dealing with . Birds , insects , crocodiles , dinosaurs , dolphins \u2013 there 's a menagerie that keeps coming back in my work . I do n't plan it that way . Work is a lot like dreaming ; it 's whatever the unconscious throws up . I love it when you write furiously at night and then the next morning you go back and read it and it 's like , ' Oh my God , that 's bloody good , I did n't realise I 'd done that . ' \" Ridley 's existence is geared towards work . \" I've never earned much ; I do n't have a mortgage and I do n't want one . Everything is set up so I can do the work I want to do , and I do n't have to write six episodes of EastEnders to pay the bills . \" He writes , he says , to understand the world . \" My work is not cerebral at all . Telling stories and making images is how I make sense of the world , which is a very confusing place for me . Relationships are very confusing , sex is incredibly confusing . Perhaps I 'm not meeting the right people . I open the window and demons fly in . I think what I do in my work is try to make the demons feel welcome . \" I 'm at my happiest when I 'm alone at the desk in my back room , where I 've stuck black paper up at all the windows and I write by one lamp at this desk . I 'm at my least lonely when I 'm in that cocoon of writing . \" And there we shall leave Philip Ridley , to conjure his dark and comforting visions . * ' Vincent River ' : Trafalgar Studios , London SW1 ( 0870 060 6632 , www.theambassadors. com ) , from Tues to 17 November .

The fax cover sheet has a brief note , \" Dan , a generic description of the process . \" The name of the sender , based at the CIA , has been obliterated . You can view the document here . The document provides a step-by-step manual for extraordinary renditions . The process starts with \" capture shock . \" The detainee is subject to a medical examination prior to his flight . During the flight , the detainee is securely shackled , and is deprived of sight and sound through the use of blindfolds , earmuffs and hoods . The detainee is \" in the complete control of Americans . \" The detainee is stripped naked and shaved . A \" series of photographs are taken of the HVD while nude . \" A medical officer and a psychologist play key roles in the process ( though their professional ethics rules would prohibit such conduct . ) All of these practices are carefully engineered to facilitate the interrogation process . Nudity , sleep deprivation and dietary manipulation are used as standard preparatory steps . It then details the standard \" corrective techniques : \" these are a series of physical assaults labeled with innocuous titles like insult slap , abdominal slap , facial hold and attention grasp . \" Coercive techniques \" used include : walling ( slamming a prisoner 's head against the wall , with some protective measures to avoid severe injuries ) , water dousing , the use of the stress position ( known to the inquisition as the strapado , to the Germans in World War II as Pfahlbinden ) , wall standing ( referred to by the NKVD and KGB as stoika ) and cramped confinement . Because of substantial redactions , it seems unlikely that this list is complete . None of this information is surprising . In fact it all tallies perfectly with the description of the renditions program that can be derived from the report prepared by the International Committee of the Red Cross , which used the appropriate legal designation for these techniques : \" torture . \" But this is an historical document , right ? President Barack Obama shut down the black sites and the extraordinary renditions program immediately after taking office , right ? Well , not entirely . Consider the recent rendition of a Lebanese businessman accused of petty contract fraud , Raymond Azar . The first stage of these guidelines was followed with precision . He was seized in Afghanistan by U.S. Justice Department operatives . They claim they had the approval of the Afghan government . The Afghan government disagrees , saying it has no record of ever having permitted the \" snatch \" of Azar . According to papers filed by his lawyers , Azar was presented with \" capture shock , \" stripped naked , subjected to a body cavity search for \" health reasons , \" was shackled , subjected to hypothermia and sleep deprivation , and then was transported in a Gulfstream with the requisite hood , blindfold and earmuffs . When pressed on this in court , the Justice Department claimed it was only following \" standard procedures . \" The CIA memo shows that this claim is accurate : it was following standard procedures for extraordinary renditions , which were approved in a series of now-rescinded memoranda prepared by the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel . The Justice Department also claimed , in papers filed with the court , that the extraordinary measures were taken out of concern for the safety and security of the prisoners and the government agents involved . But on this point , the Justice Department is now revealed as being guilty of what at a minimum would be called a \" failure of the duty of candor \" to the court . The 2004 CIA memo delivered to the Justice Department explaining these procedures makes very explicit that the techniques employed have little if anything to do with the safety and security of the personnel involved . They explain the real function these techniques : \" To persuade High - Value Detainees ( HVDs ) to provide threat information and terrorist intelligence in a timely manner , to allow the US Government to identify and disrupt terrorist plots . \" The preparatory measures , such as capture shock , nudity , body cavity search , sleep deprivation and manipulation of nutrition are designed to put the prisoner in a position in which he can be effectively interrogated . They are geared to breaking down psychological resistance and making the prisoner pliable . Not every technique designed to wear down resistance and make a prisoner more willing to talk is , of course , \" torture . \" But in fact these techniques are highly coercive and have been held to be torture . Moreover , in the Azar case , the Justice Department agents used these techniques in precisely this fashion , moving to aggressive interrogation immediately after applying the preparatory measures . Azar even claims that one agent brandished a photo of his family taken from his wallet and threatened that he would never see them again -- something Azar interpreted as a threat against the safety of his family . The credibility of this account is boosted by the release this week of a 2004 CIA inspector general 's report , which documented numerous cases in which similar threats were made . After Azar 's allegations of torture became public , Justice Department prosecutors rushed to snatch a plea bargain deal with Azar , clearly motivated by a desire to put an end to that issue . But whatever deal was struck with Azar should not let the government avoid the question of accountability for what was done in this case . That should start with an examination of the Justice Department 's failure to candidly disclose to the court that the rendition techniques they applied to Azar were part of an effort to coerce a confession were explicitly engineered for that purpose . In sentencing Azar , the court will have to start with the recognition that the Justice Department began , overstepping the lawful constraints on its authority , to mete out punishment to him from the moment they seized him in Kabul . But the broader question is for the new panel that the Obama White House has set up to oversee renditions and interrogations policy : Why are procedures designed to secure intelligence from violent terrorists being used on businessmen involved in petty contract fraud cases ? If this was a conscious decision , it urgently requires a public justification .

The fax cover sheet has a brief note , \" Dan , a generic description of the process . \" The name of the sender , based at the CIA , has been obliterated . You can view the document here . The document provides a step-by-step manual for extraordinary renditions . The process starts with \" capture shock . \" The detainee is subject to a medical examination prior to his flight . During the flight , the detainee is securely shackled , and is deprived of sight and sound through the use of blindfolds , earmuffs and hoods . The detainee is \" in the complete control of Americans . \" The detainee is stripped naked and shaved . A \" series of photographs are taken of the HVD while nude . \" A medical officer and a psychologist play key roles in the process ( though their professional ethics rules would prohibit such conduct . ) All of these practices are carefully engineered to facilitate the interrogation process . Nudity , sleep deprivation and dietary manipulation are used as standard preparatory steps . It then details the standard \" corrective techniques : \" these are a series of physical assaults labeled with innocuous titles like insult slap , abdominal slap , facial hold and attention grasp . \" Coercive techniques \" used include : walling ( slamming a prisoner 's head against the wall , with some protective measures to avoid severe injuries ) , water dousing , the use of the stress position ( known to the inquisition as the strapado , to the Germans in World War II as Pfahlbinden ) , wall standing ( referred to by the NKVD and KGB as stoika ) and cramped confinement . Because of substantial redactions , it seems unlikely that this list is complete . None of this information is surprising . In fact it all tallies perfectly with the description of the renditions program that can be derived from the report prepared by the International Committee of the Red Cross , which used the appropriate legal designation for these techniques : \" torture . \" But this is an historical document , right ? President Barack Obama shut down the black sites and the extraordinary renditions program immediately after taking office , right ? Well , not entirely . Consider the recent rendition of a Lebanese businessman accused of petty contract fraud , Raymond Azar . The first stage of these guidelines was followed with precision . He was seized in Afghanistan by U.S. Justice Department operatives . They claim they had the approval of the Afghan government . The Afghan government disagrees , saying it has no record of ever having permitted the \" snatch \" of Azar . According to papers filed by his lawyers , Azar was presented with \" capture shock , \" stripped naked , subjected to a body cavity search for \" health reasons , \" was shackled , subjected to hypothermia and sleep deprivation , and then was transported in a Gulfstream with the requisite hood , blindfold and earmuffs . When pressed on this in court , the Justice Department claimed it was only following \" standard procedures . \" The CIA memo shows that this claim is accurate : it was following standard procedures for extraordinary renditions , which were approved in a series of now-rescinded memoranda prepared by the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel . The Justice Department also claimed , in papers filed with the court , that the extraordinary measures were taken out of concern for the safety and security of the prisoners and the government agents involved . But on this point , the Justice Department is now revealed as being guilty of what at a minimum would be called a \" failure of the duty of candor \" to the court . The 2004 CIA memo delivered to the Justice Department explaining these procedures makes very explicit that the techniques employed have little if anything to do with the safety and security of the personnel involved . They explain the real function these techniques : \" To persuade High - Value Detainees ( HVDs ) to provide threat information and terrorist intelligence in a timely manner , to allow the US Government to identify and disrupt terrorist plots . \" The preparatory measures , such as capture shock , nudity , body cavity search , sleep deprivation and manipulation of nutrition are designed to put the prisoner in a position in which he can be effectively interrogated . They are geared to breaking down psychological resistance and making the prisoner pliable . Not every technique designed to wear down resistance and make a prisoner more willing to talk is , of course , \" torture . \" But in fact these techniques are highly coercive and have been held to be torture . Moreover , in the Azar case , the Justice Department agents used these techniques in precisely this fashion , moving to aggressive interrogation immediately after applying the preparatory measures . Azar even claims that one agent brandished a photo of his family taken from his wallet and threatened that he would never see them again -- something Azar interpreted as a threat against the safety of his family . The credibility of this account is boosted by the release this week of a 2004 CIA inspector general 's report , which documented numerous cases in which similar threats were made . After Azar 's allegations of torture became public , Justice Department prosecutors rushed to snatch a plea bargain deal with Azar , clearly motivated by a desire to put an end to that issue . But whatever deal was struck with Azar should not let the government avoid the question of accountability for what was done in this case . That should start with an examination of the Justice Department 's failure to candidly disclose to the court that the rendition techniques they applied to Azar were part of an effort to coerce a confession were explicitly engineered for that purpose . In sentencing Azar , the court will have to start with the recognition that the Justice Department began , overstepping the lawful constraints on its authority , to mete out punishment to him from the moment they seized him in Kabul . But the broader question is for the new panel that the Obama White House has set up to oversee renditions and interrogations policy : Why are procedures designed to secure intelligence from violent terrorists being used on businessmen involved in petty contract fraud cases ? If this was a conscious decision , it urgently requires a public justification .

Kei Kamara leapt to head home in the 98th minute , but Shalrie Joseph popped up to head home a free kick in the 102nd . Then in the fifth round of penalty kicks , Khano Smith stepped up with a chance to give the Revolution the crown . But Pat Onstad saved the effort . The next six shooters all converted until Ashe fired off the bar . Nate Jaqua opened the scoring after 18 minutes after Amaechi Igwe turned the ball over inside his own box . Steve Ralston tied the score four minutes before halftime with a volley from a Mauricio Castro cross . Eddie Robinson ( hamstring ) and Richard Mulrooney ( knee ) did not travel for the Dynamo . Geoff Cameron continued at center back beside Bobby Boswell in Robinson 's absence . Nate Jaqua and Brian Ching partnered up top once again after Jaqua set up Ching for a goal in Saturday 's 2 - 0 win against Columbus . Selection problems also hampered the home team , with Jay Heaps suspended and Michael Parkhurst away on Olympic duty . Amaechi Igwe partnered Jeff Larentowicz in the center of defense .

Cameron lumped a free kick down the center of the field . No Dynamo player challenged and Reis looked likely to come out and collect it . Igwe decided to clear it with his back to the ball and shanked it right to Jaqua . The burly striker made no mistake to give the Dynamo the lead .

Ching did n't make good contact with his strike , but managed to knock it off before the ball trickled away from danger . Steve Ralston tested Onstad at his near post with a free kick , but the Canadian international reacted smartly to push it around the post for a corner kick . Sainey Nyassi should have tested Onstad minutes latter after a quick buildup from left wing to right wing gave him space at the far post , but Nyassi managed to drive his effort off the side netting . The Revs were growing in confidence and generated a penalty shout in the 33rd minute . Nyassi jumped to meet a corner kick at the far post only to see Craig Waibel barge him in the back . Referee Howard Webb was n't impressed , much to the chagrin of the Revolution players . Houston responded quickly through De Rosario . A thumping shot forced Reis into an acrobatic save at the near post after the Revs could n't hack it clear . De Rosario then got in behind the defense moments later with another route one service . After rounding Reis , De Rosario slid a ball towards goal before Larentowicz recovered and cleared the goal - bound effort . Tierney 's turn to clear off the line came quickly afterwards after Reis came for a corner kick and could n't collect . Jaqua shot towards goal , but Tierney managed to keep it out and get it clear .

Half - chances ruled as Jaqua shanked wide after Ching played him in and substitute Khano Smith cut inside and drove towards Onstad . Extra time loomed , and Igwe ensured it would arrive after tackling Davis as he shaped to shoot in second - half stoppage time . Kamara headed the Dynamo in front in the 98th minute .

In 1933 , the original movie was designed to beguile and distract a suffering US . President Roosevelt 's programmes for rebooting the economy had yet to take effect , and the movie 's audience was desperate for the temporary relief of big - budget effects , big - name stars and the 200 \u201c gorgeous girls \u201d that the trailer promised . 42nd Street proved more popular than the Warner Brothers studio bosses had dared imagine but credit was given less to director Lloyd Bacon than to Busby Berkeley , the actor and self -trained choreographer in charge of its musical numbers . Warner Brothers were taking something of a punt on Berkeley , who had no formal dance training and whose first experience of choreography had been organising marching drills during the first world war . But Berkeley had displayed some talent for working with chorus lines on Broadway , and spent two years with the Samuel Goldwyn studio , choreographing a number of low-budget musicals . During that period he 'd begun playing with new ways to put dance on screen . 42nd Street gave him the budget and freedom to let those ideas fly . When we look at a number such as Young and Healthy today , its structural devices may seem tame but at the time they embodied a bold new attempt to liberate dance from the physical conventions of the stage , and place it in a purely cinematic dimension . By constructing the choreography around a trio of hydraulically operated platforms , Berkeley transformed the spatial possibilities of his choreography . He could move his dancers between different levels , without the need for complex lifts or partnerwork ( 0.24 ) ; he could create effective shifts in pattern and speed with only minimal physical activity ( 0.40 ) . Even more radical were the visual possibilities created by his agile camera , which ranged from this tracking closeup of the dancers ' legs ( 1.23 ) , abstracting them to a V-shaped tunnel of stockinged flesh , to the dizzying overhead shots that turned the chorus line into a kaleidoscope of art deco patterns . Berkeley 's overhead shot became his signature device ( it was significant perhaps that he 'd been an aerial observer with the US air corps ) ; and he made even more dramatic use of it during the second half of the movie 's title number , which dramatised the \u201c naughty , gawdy , bawdy , sporty \u201d life of 42nd Street . Berkeley starts out by choreographing vivid vignettes of individual characters : a juggling street vendor , a fighting couple , a drunk , a barber , a cocktail waiter . But as these individuals are re-absorbed into the ensemble , and as the crowd then morphs into a street of dancing buildings , the camera soars higher and higher , until the scene is abstracted into a dreaming cityscape . The box-office success of 42nd Street propelled Berkeley to the top of his profession . He choreographed six more musicals during the next two years and his ideas grew exponentially \u2013 and expensively \u2013 more flamboyant . The By a Waterfall number in Footlight Parade ( 1933 ) featured giant water tanks in which its chorus could float though a riot of pin-wheeling , molecular patterns . In Gold Diggers of 1933 and Dames , Berkeley elaborated his dance numbers with an ever more inventive panoply of costumes , props and multi-level platforms . Berkeley helped make the 1930s a golden age for the Hollywood musical and the above compilation of clips illustrates just how brilliantly his imagination was suited to the silver screen . During that decade , Berkeley had a major rival in Fred Astaire , who was working for RKO , and even a basic comparison of the two men 's choreography reveals the limits of Berkeley 's style . Step for step , his vocabulary rarely deviates from a series of rudimentary leg kicks , shuffles and taps and a few simple , decorative movements of the arms . Lacking the musical phrasing , the grace notes , the full - bodied impetus of Astaire 's dancing , Berkeley 's choreography is memorable principally for the spectacle he was able to create out of large numbers of bodies moving in unison . Berkeley also became increasingly dependent on the interventions of the camera , for tracking closeups , witty angles and bird 's- eye views that added texture and substance to his choreography . Astaire once quipped of his own film performances , \u201c either the camera dances or I do \u201d , and while most of his own on - screen dancing could work just as well on the stage , Berkeley 's numbers would have palled rapidly without their cinematic box of tricks . If Astaire focused on the pure dancing body , and Berkeley on special effects , the other crucial difference between the two lay in their handling of sex . Back in 1930 , a strict code of censorship had been laid out for Hollywood and Astaire 's musicals , although swooningly glamorous , were chastely compliant . Berkeley 's early productions for Warner Bros , however , came with a strong subtext of erotic titillation . In 42nd Street 's Young and Healthy , the lingering pace of the camera as it travels between the women 's legs has the intensity of a voyeur 's gaze . More blatant still is the way the camera hovers over the dancers ' torsos in the By a Waterfall routine from Footlight Parade , revelling in the illusion of naked flesh created by the women 's clinging costumes . Berkeley offered his female actors and dancers up to the camera with a mathematical exactness that could border on ruthlessness . One of his signature tricks was to zoom , in rapid succession , over the faces of the chorus line , but far from individualising the women it simply confirmed their conformity to type ( usually blond and china - doll cute ) . As a device it was no more humanising than Berkeley 's favoured shots of disembodied legs , busts , feet or arms . Of course we look at old movies now with politically correct hindsight , but some among his original audience would have been made a little queasy by the sexual innuendo of Pettin ' in the Park , a choreographed guide book to the rules of seduction that featured in Gold Diggers of 1933 . Berkeley introduces a small boy ( Billy Barty ) into his cast \u2013 dressed up as a rollerskating baby and leading a chorus of policeman a frantic dance ; then chasing a football up the skirt of a beautiful woman , who lies on the grass with her stockings and suspenders in full view ; and finally leering suggestively to camera as he lifts up a window blind to reveal a chorus of women in visible states of undress . Berkeley always claimed there was nothing to read into his dances beyond his own ambition to make each better than the last . He resisted attempts to interpret his mass ensembles as an embodiment of Roosevelt 's New Deal collective spirit ; he shrugged off comparisons between his precision - tooled chorus lines and the monumental street parades beloved of Mussolini , Hitler and Stalin . However , one of the most powerful numbers he ever directed \u2013 Remember My Forgotten Man \u2013 was also the most political , as Berkeley drew on his wartime experiences to choreograph the heroism and suffering of his fellow veterans . In movement terms it could hardly have been more basic \u2013 little more than a marching column of men that Berkeley filmed against a succession of ironic backdrops ; a cheering , patriotic crowd , a rain - soaked battlefield , a postwar soup kitchen and a dole queue . But towards the end of the sequence ( around 5.40 ) he deployed all his cinematic knowhow to orchestrate an image that potently evoked the despair and the exaltation of the soldiers ' sacrifice : as lines of men tramp wearily across the screen they simultaneously look like victims of a military war machine and figures enshrined in a stained glass window . Berkeley 's brand of high - gloss musical gradually fell out of fashion and by the end of the 1930s he moved into straight directing . In the early 1970s , a revival of interest in the music , art and fashions of the 1930s restored movies such as 42nd Street to popularity . Berkeley 's influence is still felt in a whole range of choreographic creations . In Disney 's cartoon version of Beauty and the Beast , the Be Our Guest sequence pays a joyously overt homage , with its lines of dancing crockery and ditzy kaleidoscopic formations . The epic ensemble numbers in Riverdance are no less indebted to the choreographer in their machine - drilled , percussive unison . And the pure camp spectacle of synchronised swimming would surely have become a far lesser thing without the inspiration of Berkeley 's aquatically high - kicking chorus girls .","annotations":[{"text":"1933","span":[175,178],"token_span":[32,32],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the motion of the Theme occurs."},{"text":"Busby Berkeley","span":[654,667],"token_span":[119,120],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent is the one whose action causes the motion of a Theme.

The art of core making has its roots in circa 1300 BC , when sand casting was first developed in the form of clay molding . Since , then the crux of the process has remained the same , but the technical intricacies have evolved to match the requisites of the current era . But Core making was and still remains an integral part of the sand casting process . The process has evolved from crafting cores one at a time with skilled hands to production of thousands of cores with automated core shooters while moderating tolerances to as low as \u00b1 0.020 inches . In modern foundries , its amusing to even think of crafting cores with hand which will further be used for casting anything from centrifugal pump impellers to V8 engines . What are cores ? Cores are apparatus used to generate hollow cavities or internal features which cannot be formed using pattern alone in moulding , cores are majorly made using sand , but some processes also use permanent cores made of metal . In this article we will focus on sand core making process . The process of core making 1 . Selection of Core Sand Properties of core sand are highly crucial and are required to have characteristics like permeability , green strength , refractoriness , flowability , collapsibility , adhesiveness , cohesiveness , and fry strength . 2 . Mixing of sand with additives After an initial thorough mix of sand to ensure proper distribution of sand granules , binder is added to the silica sand with moisture content and other additives like coal dust , dextrin , or silica flour and together they create a mixture . This mixture should be uniform to create standardized sand cores with high production efficiency . 3 . Core Blowing or Shooting After the mixture is ready , next step includes blowing this flowable mixture into the core box , and depending on the type of process used , either the core box is heated , or the already heated sand mixture is blown into the core box and left to settle for a few seconds . This process is also referred to as core shooting process and modern foundries use dedicated core blowing / shooting machines for optimal production efficiency . 4 . Core Venting In the casting process , the core will be surrounded by molten metal which will stimulate gases inside the mold , and it is essential to provide a venting passage for these gases as if remain entrapped inside the mold , these gases can result in casting defects . Therefore , to obtain good permeability additional venting holes are made in the cores . 5 . Reinforcement of Cores Some cores , heavy & large cores in particular , might need additional reinforcement material like cast iron grids or low- carbon steel wires to maintain coherence . 6 . Baking of Cores Depending on the type of process used , baking of sand cores is done in convention oven with temperature between 200\u00b0 C to 250\u00b0 C ( 392\u00b0 F and 482\u00b0 F ) , the heat causes the binder to polymerize . 7 . Core Cleaning & Finishing After baking , cores are ready for cleaning & finishing . Following methods are used as per requirement : - Trimming of cores involve removing loose pieces and other unwanted projections - Brushing is used to remove loose sand off the core with fine wire brush - Coating is crucial step for finishing and involves coating of cores with refractory material to improve heat resistance . 8 . Core Inspection This step includes either manual or machine inspection of the cores for dimensional accuracy . 9 . Core assembling This includes assembling of multiple cores together with core glue in case of small and medium size cores and bolts in case of large cores . Feedback section 1 .

Reinforcement of Cores Some cores , heavy & large cores in particular , might need additional reinforcement material like cast iron grids or low- carbon steel wires to maintain coherence . 6 . Baking of Cores Depending on the type of process used , baking of sand cores is done in convention oven with temperature between 200\u00b0 C to 250\u00b0 C ( 392\u00b0 F and 482\u00b0 F ) , the heat causes the binder to polymerize . 7 . Core Cleaning & Finishing After baking , cores are ready for cleaning & finishing . Following methods are used as per requirement : - Trimming of cores involve removing loose pieces and other unwanted projections - Brushing is used to remove loose sand off the core with fine wire brush - Coating is crucial step for finishing and involves coating of cores with refractory material to improve heat resistance . 8 . Core Inspection This step includes either manual or machine inspection of the cores for dimensional accuracy . 9 . Core assembling This includes assembling of multiple cores together with core glue in case of small and medium size cores and bolts in case of large cores . Feedback section 1 .

Today this essential grain can also be found in a variety of processed foods , some with histories centuries old . Rice 's role in Japanese cuisine is not limited to its appearance on the table , a steaming bowlful around which the meal is planned . It is also the main ingredient in a number of well - known foods , beverages and seasonings . The final product depends on how the rice is processed and on what type of rice is used , whether uruchimai , the ordinary rice that is served with meals , or mochigome , a glutinous rice , most often prepared for special occasions and used to make snacks and sweets . Sake , Mirin and Vinegar The most popular processed rice product is sake , a brewed , highly alcoholic beverage with a mild aroma and delicate blend of flavors . Fourth - century records reveal its essential role as a sacred offering to soothe the gods . Three ingredients go into sake brewing - rice , water and the fermenting agent koji ( steamed rice inoculated with the yeast Aspergillus oryzae ) . The fermented liquor is put into cloth sacks and pressed to separate the sake from the lees ( the remains of the rice and koji ) , then heated to kill bacteria - a technique invented in Japan some 450 years ago , long before the discovery of pasteurization . While wine fermented from grapes is regarded as an accompaniment to a meal - to accent or bring out the flavors of foods - in Japan , sake is accompanied by small portions of food , or sakana , to enhance the flavors of this celebrated beverage . In other words , it can be said that Japanese cuisine developed as an accompaniment to sake . Mirin is a sweet , alcoholic flavoring , also made of rice ; namely , distilled rice spirits mixed with steamed glutinous rice and koji , which is fermented . Originally drunk as a liqueur with a rather tart taste , mirin has been refined over the years , becoming one of the mainstays of Japanese cooking . Combined with soy sauce , for example , it forms the basis of teriyaki sauce , a popular basting sauce for grilled foods . Before sake is heated to kill bacteria , it quickly sours , because bacteria converts the alcohol to acetic acid when it comes in contact with air . The result is vinegar , another essential in the Japanese larder , which can also be made from sake lees . Miso , Pickles and Mochi Another important flavor in Japanese cooking is provided by miso , a fermented paste of beans , rice or barley . Rice miso , made only of rice and koji , comes in two types , salty and sweet . The rather sweet , white miso is characteristically used in Kyoto cuisine . Rice also plays a major role in pickling and sushi production , the origins of which can be found in the Nara period , when fish , wild boar or deer were salted and pressed , then placed between layers of cooked , salted rice and pressed under stones to ferment . The rice soured because of the bacteria that produces lactic acid during fermentation , increasing its capacity to preserve the layered foods . The type of sushi that developed from this process is called narezushi - the early incarnation of the more familiar nigirizushi , a strip of seafood atop a small fistful of vinegared rice . Pickles , or tsukemono , a traditional sidedish to a Japanese meal , are said to stimulate the appetite and enhance the flavor of cooked rice . One method of pickling utilizes sake lees , while yet another uses rice bran ( nuka ) , a by-product of the rice - polishing process . Nukazuke , or pickling in bran , has been around for about 800 years . One of the most versatile rice products , mochi , is made with glutinous rice , which is steamed rather than boiled , and placed in a large wooden mortar while still hot , then beaten with a large pestle . Flipped and sprinkled with water between plunges until it becomes a coherent mass with a smooth , elastic texture , the ball of rice is then flattened and cut into pieces or shaped into rounds . Kagamimochi , for example , is a traditional New Year 's decoration that serves both as the dwelling place of the god of the harvest and the offering to that god . Small mochi balls , endowed with similar significance , go into zoni , a soup made from the symbolic offerings of seafood , fowl and vegetables that decorate the kagamimochi . In the past , most families pounded mochi whenever there was a special event , but today it is available in supermarkets , prepackaged . Households who prefer to make their own often use automatic mochi-pounding machines instead of the traditional wooden mortar and pestle . Sweets , Snacks and Instant Foods Glutinous rice flour is used to make another kind of rice - ball confection with a mochi-like consistency : the sweets served in the tea ceremony , or wagashi . Stuffed with sweet bean paste , or anko , and shaped and colored to suggest seasonal flowers or fruits , these delicacies have become a minor art form . The felicitous combination of anko ( made from red beans boiled with sugar ) wrapped in mochi was discovered about 500 years ago . Mochi may be cut into small pieces of varying shapes and designs and dried , then grilled or deep - fried as snack foods , often with soy sauce as the basic flavoring . Today , the crispness of these mochi snacks make them increasingly more popular among young people than grilled senbei , or rice crackers . For travelers in the Nara and Heian periods ( 710 - 1185 ) , another glutinous rice product , hoshii , was a lifesaver . The rice was steamed and dried , rather than pounded into mochi . The resulting product kept well and served as trail food in an era without inns , much less drive - in restaurants . The traveler would simply add an equal amount of boiling water to the hoshii , wait ten minutes , and the rice was ready to eat - instant food from a millennium ago . From the classic bowl of gleaming white rice to ancient emergency rations , the Japanese have centuries of experience in making full use of their rice crop . Even the bran left when rice is polished is used down to the last husk - in pickling beds , for bleaching root vegetables and as a source of oil . In the wide range of foods based on rice , and in the sacred character of rice itself , this fundamental grain has become the cornerstone of the culinary culture of Japan .

Today this essential grain can also be found in a variety of processed foods , some with histories centuries old . Rice 's role in Japanese cuisine is not limited to its appearance on the table , a steaming bowlful around which the meal is planned . It is also the main ingredient in a number of well - known foods , beverages and seasonings . The final product depends on how the rice is processed and on what type of rice is used , whether uruchimai , the ordinary rice that is served with meals , or mochigome , a glutinous rice , most often prepared for special occasions and used to make snacks and sweets . Sake , Mirin and Vinegar The most popular processed rice product is sake , a brewed , highly alcoholic beverage with a mild aroma and delicate blend of flavors . Fourth - century records reveal its essential role as a sacred offering to soothe the gods . Three ingredients go into sake brewing - rice , water and the fermenting agent koji ( steamed rice inoculated with the yeast Aspergillus oryzae ) . The fermented liquor is put into cloth sacks and pressed to separate the sake from the lees ( the remains of the rice and koji ) , then heated to kill bacteria - a technique invented in Japan some 450 years ago , long before the discovery of pasteurization . While wine fermented from grapes is regarded as an accompaniment to a meal - to accent or bring out the flavors of foods - in Japan , sake is accompanied by small portions of food , or sakana , to enhance the flavors of this celebrated beverage . In other words , it can be said that Japanese cuisine developed as an accompaniment to sake . Mirin is a sweet , alcoholic flavoring , also made of rice ; namely , distilled rice spirits mixed with steamed glutinous rice and koji , which is fermented . Originally drunk as a liqueur with a rather tart taste , mirin has been refined over the years , becoming one of the mainstays of Japanese cooking . Combined with soy sauce , for example , it forms the basis of teriyaki sauce , a popular basting sauce for grilled foods . Before sake is heated to kill bacteria , it quickly sours , because bacteria converts the alcohol to acetic acid when it comes in contact with air . The result is vinegar , another essential in the Japanese larder , which can also be made from sake lees . Miso , Pickles and Mochi Another important flavor in Japanese cooking is provided by miso , a fermented paste of beans , rice or barley . Rice miso , made only of rice and koji , comes in two types , salty and sweet . The rather sweet , white miso is characteristically used in Kyoto cuisine . Rice also plays a major role in pickling and sushi production , the origins of which can be found in the Nara period , when fish , wild boar or deer were salted and pressed , then placed between layers of cooked , salted rice and pressed under stones to ferment . The rice soured because of the bacteria that produces lactic acid during fermentation , increasing its capacity to preserve the layered foods . The type of sushi that developed from this process is called narezushi - the early incarnation of the more familiar nigirizushi , a strip of seafood atop a small fistful of vinegared rice . Pickles , or tsukemono , a traditional sidedish to a Japanese meal , are said to stimulate the appetite and enhance the flavor of cooked rice . One method of pickling utilizes sake lees , while yet another uses rice bran ( nuka ) , a by-product of the rice - polishing process . Nukazuke , or pickling in bran , has been around for about 800 years . One of the most versatile rice products , mochi , is made with glutinous rice , which is steamed rather than boiled , and placed in a large wooden mortar while still hot , then beaten with a large pestle . Flipped and sprinkled with water between plunges until it becomes a coherent mass with a smooth , elastic texture , the ball of rice is then flattened and cut into pieces or shaped into rounds . Kagamimochi , for example , is a traditional New Year 's decoration that serves both as the dwelling place of the god of the harvest and the offering to that god . Small mochi balls , endowed with similar significance , go into zoni , a soup made from the symbolic offerings of seafood , fowl and vegetables that decorate the kagamimochi . In the past , most families pounded mochi whenever there was a special event , but today it is available in supermarkets , prepackaged . Households who prefer to make their own often use automatic mochi-pounding machines instead of the traditional wooden mortar and pestle . Sweets , Snacks and Instant Foods Glutinous rice flour is used to make another kind of rice - ball confection with a mochi-like consistency : the sweets served in the tea ceremony , or wagashi . Stuffed with sweet bean paste , or anko , and shaped and colored to suggest seasonal flowers or fruits , these delicacies have become a minor art form . The felicitous combination of anko ( made from red beans boiled with sugar ) wrapped in mochi was discovered about 500 years ago . Mochi may be cut into small pieces of varying shapes and designs and dried , then grilled or deep - fried as snack foods , often with soy sauce as the basic flavoring . Today , the crispness of these mochi snacks make them increasingly more popular among young people than grilled senbei , or rice crackers . For travelers in the Nara and Heian periods ( 710 - 1185 ) , another glutinous rice product , hoshii , was a lifesaver . The rice was steamed and dried , rather than pounded into mochi . The resulting product kept well and served as trail food in an era without inns , much less drive - in restaurants . The traveler would simply add an equal amount of boiling water to the hoshii , wait ten minutes , and the rice was ready to eat - instant food from a millennium ago . From the classic bowl of gleaming white rice to ancient emergency rations , the Japanese have centuries of experience in making full use of their rice crop . Even the bran left when rice is polished is used down to the last husk - in pickling beds , for bleaching root vegetables and as a source of oil . In the wide range of foods based on rice , and in the sacred character of rice itself , this fundamental grain has become the cornerstone of the culinary culture of Japan .

Ferguson , Jr. To the University of Connecticut School of Business Graduate Learning Center and the SS&C Technologies Financial Accelerator , Hartford , Connecticut October 29 , 2004 Equilibrium Real Interest Rate : Theory and Application I want to thank the University of Connecticut for providing me this opportunity to comment on the important and challenging concept of the equilibrium real interest rate and its relevance to monetary policy . I will use this occasion to discuss the role that estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate can play in thinking about the desired degree of policy accommodation . Those views , I should add , are my own and are not necessarily shared by anyone else in the Federal Reserve System . I hope that at the end of this talk you will conclude , as I do , that while the concept of the equilibrium real rate is a useful aid in thinking about setting monetary policy , it is not measured and observed with such precision as to provide a practical guide to the appropriate stance of policy . Current Situation As the most recent statement of the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) made clear , the U.S. economy appears to have moved out of the soft patch that characterized the second quarter . Supported by ongoing advances in productivity and the attendant increases in real incomes , household spending has picked up . Businesses , for their part , seem to have shaken off at least some of their hesitancy to spend , although the subdued pace of hiring may signal that they still retain a wary attitude toward making important commitments . But the strengthened balance sheets of the business sector , along with buoyant cash flow , should provide firms with the wherewithal to fund a healthy expansion of the capital stock in coming quarters . No doubt the recent run - up in energy prices poses some challenges , but the evidence indicates that , without some further material shock , aggregate demand is on a track consistent with sustained economic growth . That should gradually return the economy to full utilization of its resources , while inflation remains subdued . The FOMC was confident enough about its assessment of the vigor of spending to indicate in its most recent statement that it continues to believe that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured . That begs the question , of course , of how the Committee can be sure that policy is currently accommodative . I find it instructive to first consider how not to measure policy accommodation . In particular , the fact that the nominal federal funds rate remains quite low does not , by itself and without context , signal that policy is loose . After all , spending decisions should depend on real , not nominal , determinants , including the real federal funds rate , which is the nominal federal funds rate less prevailing inflation expectations . Although backward - looking measures of inflation -- such as the four- quarter growth in core personal consumption expenditure ( PCE ) prices - - imply that the FOMC 's cumulative 75 basis points of tightening so far this year has moved the real federal funds rate into positive territory for the first time in almost three years , that observation is not sufficient to calibrate the stance of policy . For example , the U.S. economy expanded at about the same average pace from 1981 to 1990 and from 1991 to 2000 . In the earlier period , however , the real short - term rate averaged 4 - 3/4 percent whereas in the more recent one the real rate was 2 percentage points lower . Clearly , prevailing conditions matter in determining the degree of policy accommodation . It is only against a backdrop of an economy that seems poised to maintain sustained and solid economic growth , even as the funds rate rises , that the FOMC can determine that current policy is accommodative . The Equilibrium Rate in Theory What is needed is a benchmark summarizing the economic circumstances -- including , among other variables , the underlying strength of aggregate demand , the level of aggregate wealth , and economic developments in our trading partners -- combining to shape the expansion of activity and the extent of pressures on inflation . One way of providing that benchmark is to consider what level of the real federal funds rate , if allowed to prevail for several years , would place economic activity at its potential and keep inflation low and stable . If the actual real rate is below that benchmark level , policy can be viewed as accommodative , in that if that stance were maintained , ultimately pressures on resources would build . If the actual real rate is kept above that benchmark level , policy would seem to be contractionary . This definition makes clear that the most relevant aid in policymaking is an intermediate - run measure , in that there may be forces at work in the shorter run that push spending away from potential output even if the real rate were pegged at this benchmark rate . It also makes clear that the concept involves a good amount of judgment -- indeed , the same judgment that goes into making any economic forecast -- about the determinants of spending , the trend of productivity , and the forces affecting inflation in the intermediate term . Economists famously cannot agree on much . In this case , we cannot even agree on the name of the benchmark concept that I have just described . The real interest rate consistent with the eventual full utilization of resources has been called the equilibrium real federal funds rate , the natural rate of interest , and the neutral real rate . I prefer the first name , the equilibrium real federal funds rate , because , by using the word \" equilibrium , \" it reminds us that it is a concept related to the clearing of markets . Even if economists settled on a name , however , we are not likely to agree on a single model to describe a system as richly complicated as the U.S. economy . Thus , there are as many ways of estimating the equilibrium real federal funds rate as there are different economic models . There is , however , one way of estimating the equilibrium real rate that I do not find especially convincing . Some economists derive point estimates of the equilibrium real rate by taking averages of the actual real rate over long periods of time . True , over a long - enough sample period , resource slack probably averages near zero , which suggests that the sample average of the real interest equals the equilibrium real rate . But decisions about the sample period -- whether to include low-real - rate stretches , such as the 1950s , or high - rate periods , such as the early 1980s -- have material bearing on the estimate . This indicates to me that there can be significant and persistent deviations in the equilibrium real rate from the observed long - run average measured over decades . The average interest rate that seems to have brought aggregate demand and aggregate supply into rough balance in the past may not be the same rate required in every conjunctural setting . Our inability to equate the long - run average interest rate to the equilibrium real interest rate that is relevant for setting policy is not surprising given the manner in which economic behavior , technology , and government policy can change over time . Put another way , an estimate derived from long - run observations may not be relevant for policy for two reasons . First , economic conditions during the policy - relevant period might differ from the average conditions during the observation period . Second , the economy changes in ways that tend to limit the relevance of historical observations for policymaking . That said , policymakers do strive to understand what the equilibrium real interest rate will be over the long run , but that is a forward - looking notion that depends on our sense of how the forces of productivity and thrift will evolve over time as measured in decades . An understanding of a likely long - run level of the equilibrium real rate is useful , even though the level is not directly observable , because it provides a general sense of the level that would , over that longer period , allow aggregate supply and demand to move into balance , given the evaluation of secular forces such as productivity and population growth . Such an understanding of the longer - term prospects for the real interest rate aids in identifying variations in the concept over the intermediate run that is relevant for setting monetary policy --a period of several years , when cyclical forces dominate . Critically , such deviations in the intermediate run can be especially important for policy choice . For example , an unusual hesitancy on the part of businesses to hire and spend emerged in 2001 after the collapse of equity prices and was subsequently reinforced by corporate - governance concerns ; this hesitancy could be thought of as pulling the equilibrium real federal funds rate down temporarily below its longer-run value . In addition , other forces may also have weighed on growth , making it appropriate to move the real funds rate below the intermediate - run equilibrium for a time . From that perspective , the FOMC 's reduction in the actual nominal federal funds rate over this period from the level of 6 - 1/2 percent that prevailed at the beginning of 2001 to the forty - five - year low of 1 percent by mid-2003 had three components : ( 1 ) A reduction to match the decline in inflation expectations so as to prevent the real funds rate from rising inappropriately , ( 2 ) an effort to chase a downwardly moving equilibrium real rate given the pressures on aggregate demand , and ( 3 ) an effort to bring the actual real rate below its apparently lowered equilibrium to provide sufficient stimulus to cope with transitory adverse factors and to speed the recovery in production and employment . So while the real federal funds rate ultimately was pushed below zero , the extent of policy accommodation was less exceptional , in that many estimates of the equilibrium real rate had also fallen significantly . This is a tangible recent example of the need both to judge how the equilibrium real interest rate that is relevant for policy might have changed from a perceived long - run level and to set policy against the background of such an understanding . Indeed , in my judgment , the lingering hesitancy of businesses to make commitments , the restraint imposed on domestic consumers from an increase in the cost of energy , and the drag on domestic production from the excess of imports over exports all represent forces pulling the equilibrium real federal funds rate below its perceived longer-term level . And , in the context of well - contained inflation , the evidence of remaining underused resources gives us a good reason to hold the real rate below even the intermediate - run notion of its equilibrium to allow the economy to be firmly set on a path that will shrink the pool of these underused resources over a reasonable period . But as the expansion regains its footing and resource slack is worked down , we should expect both that the equilibrium real rate will move toward its longer- run level and that policymakers will no longer find it appropriate to keep the actual rate below its equilibrium . That is , the FOMC will likely be removing its policy accommodation over time . The Pace of Return to Equilibrium I have thus far argued that the equilibrium rate that is relevant for actual policy determination can only be judged in the context of forces influencing economic developments . Several aspects of the current outlook lead me to suspect that the return of the equilibrium real rate from its currently somewhat depressed level to its long - run value might plausibly be expected to be gradual and attenuated compared with historical experience . Let me highlight just three of these aspects . I have already mentioned the role of business hesitancy in determining the past trajectory of monetary policy . Clearly , if evidence of that hesitancy remains -- for example , if the labor market were to remain sluggish -- that might be one indication that the return of the equilibrium rate to its longer - run level is likely to be relatively gradual . Secondly , the household saving rate has fallen to less than 1 percent , quite low in its range of historical variation . If households , on net , take steps to return the saving rate closer to the middle of that range ( which , I might add , would provide welcome support to capital accumulation ) , then a sustained period in which consumption grows more slowly than income would result . Third , given government budgetary trends , some fiscal restraint is in order , and one might expect that those responsible for fiscal policy will move that policy to a more - balanced position ( another development I would welcome ) , thereby removing some fiscal impetus . I believe that the combined force of these three factors restraining aggregate demand , plus others that I have not mentioned , would require a lower real rate than otherwise to avoid economic slack . Let me add , however , that there is a powerful force tending to make the equilibrium real rate higher than it would otherwise be . The rapid expansion of labor productivity has raised the growth of economic potential , increased permanent income and wealth , and created an important inducement to add to the capital stock . All else equal , a higher growth rate of productivity will be associated with a more elevated equilibrium real rate . As long as productivity grows steadily at its recent pace , however , there is no reason to suspect that it will produce a change in the equilibrium real rate . In addition , the factors that I mentioned above might not unfold as hypothesized . Business hesitancy might lift abruptly and would be evidenced by large increases in business demand for capital and labor resources ; households might maintain a very low savings rate ; and government policy might not return quickly to a more-balanced posture . Any of these factors might imply that the equilibrium rate relevant for policy returns more quickly to , or even moves above , its long - run level as fewer forces weigh on aggregate demand . Recognizing the uncertainty regarding these various forces and the interplay among them , I believe it important that the FOMC calibrate the return of policy to the equilibrium real rate so that the process is neither hasty nor overly attenuated . Clearly , incoming data and the implications for the outlook should play a particularly important role in policy determination at this juncture . However , theory and practice both indicate that policy works with long and variable lags . Therefore , the actual stance of policy will have to approximate more closely the equilibrium real rate before the pool of underutilized resources is fully exhausted . Otherwise , we risk a buildup of inflationary pressures . Clearly the execution of policy will require careful evaluation as the FOMC attempts to judge both the equilibrium rate that is relevant and the pace of removal of accommodation that is appropriate . Estimating the Equilibrium Rate in Practice So much for the generality of theory . Economists have taken a variety of tacks to arrive at measures of the equilibrium real federal funds rate . I will touch on two techniques in particular . The first can be thought of as a mechanical attempt to implement my definition -- the level of the real federal funds rate that , if allowed to prevail for a couple of years , would place economic activity at its potential -- in models of the U.S. economy . For instance , we can use the many equations of a large - scale macroeconomic representation of the U.S. economy , such as the Federal Reserve Board 's staff model , FRB / US , to calculate at any point in time the level of the real rate that would eliminate economic slack in a reasonable period of time . Or we can rely on a reduced - form description of the economy that measures the output gap in terms of the actual real short rate . The value of the real rate that will move that gap to zero can be thought of as the equilibrium real rate . Besides the assumptions undergirding the construction of either model , such a calculation will require judgment in determining what is a \" reasonable \" period of time and how to cope with the run of prediction errors that are inevitable when trying to explain economic data . An attempt to employ a large model to calculate the equilibrium nominal federal funds rate can be found in an article by Antulio Bomfim . 1 Using the MPS model , the predecessor to the Board staff 's current model , Bomfim found that the equilibrium nominal funds rate varied in a range from 2 percent to 14 percent over the period from 1965 to 1994 , implying that his estimate of the equilibrium real rate turned negative at times . Laubach and Williams opted for the single - equation approach and estimated that the equilibrium real funds rate was around 3 percent in mid-2002 but that it varied from as low as 1 percent in the early 1990s to as high as 5 percent in the late 1960s . 2 In addition to exhibiting large swings , the Laubach - Williams point estimate of the equilibrium rate is a very uncertain statistic . The confidence interval around the estimate is such that there was a 70 percent probability that the actual value of the equilibrium real rate was between 0.5 percent and 5.5 percent . Clearly , this estimate is not measured sufficiently precisely to be a useful guide to policy . An alternative approach turns to financial markets to infer the market 's assessment of the longer - term prospects for real interest rates . Since 1997 , the U.S. Treasury has been issuing price- index - linked securities providing an assured real return . With about $ 250 billion of these inflation - protected securities now outstanding , we can get readings along the entire maturity structure of real interest rates . Currently , for instance , real short yields are close to zero , and longer - term rates are at about 1 - 5/8 percent . One could presume that the forward real rate of interest implied by yields on longer- term indexed debt -- or the real return provided , say , over the period five to ten years from now -- conveys a sense of market participants ' view of the long - run equilibrium real interest rate . 3 Unfortunately for such an inference , however , longer - term yields embody expectations of future interest rates , a term premium , and potentially a premium for the relative illiquidity of these instruments , so this technique will provide an overestimate of the equilibrium real rate . Conclusion This brief discussion highlights the uncertainties attending any attempt to measure the equilibrium real rate . I find these measures useful teaching tools to describe the complicated and iterative process of forecasting the path of the economy so as to arrive at the appropriate stance of policy . However , I believe it to be very important that the FOMC not go on a forced march to some point estimate of the equilibrium real federal funds rate . In my judgment , we should remove the current degree of accommodation at a pace that is importantly determined by incoming data and a changed outlook . Our knowledge of the workings of the economy is sufficiently imprecise that we could not attach much confidence to any single calculation that one might make of the equilibrium rate . Moreover , history provides a daunting record of challenges to economic forecasting associated with changes in economic behavior , the evolution of technology , and swings in governmental policy that would suggest that the equilibrium can vary over time . In such circumstances , the performance of the economy will provide feedback to assess the level of the equilibrium real federal funds rate over time . Footnotes 1 .

One way of providing that benchmark is to consider what level of the real federal funds rate , if allowed to prevail for several years , would place economic activity at its potential and keep inflation low and stable . If the actual real rate is below that benchmark level , policy can be viewed as accommodative , in that if that stance were maintained , ultimately pressures on resources would build . If the actual real rate is kept above that benchmark level , policy would seem to be contractionary . This definition makes clear that the most relevant aid in policymaking is an intermediate - run measure , in that there may be forces at work in the shorter run that push spending away from potential output even if the real rate were pegged at this benchmark rate . It also makes clear that the concept involves a good amount of judgment -- indeed , the same judgment that goes into making any economic forecast -- about the determinants of spending , the trend of productivity , and the forces affecting inflation in the intermediate term . Economists famously cannot agree on much . In this case , we cannot even agree on the name of the benchmark concept that I have just described . The real interest rate consistent with the eventual full utilization of resources has been called the equilibrium real federal funds rate , the natural rate of interest , and the neutral real rate . I prefer the first name , the equilibrium real federal funds rate , because , by using the word \" equilibrium , \" it reminds us that it is a concept related to the clearing of markets . Even if economists settled on a name , however , we are not likely to agree on a single model to describe a system as richly complicated as the U.S. economy . Thus , there are as many ways of estimating the equilibrium real federal funds rate as there are different economic models . There is , however , one way of estimating the equilibrium real rate that I do not find especially convincing . Some economists derive point estimates of the equilibrium real rate by taking averages of the actual real rate over long periods of time . True , over a long - enough sample period , resource slack probably averages near zero , which suggests that the sample average of the real interest equals the equilibrium real rate . But decisions about the sample period -- whether to include low-real - rate stretches , such as the 1950s , or high - rate periods , such as the early 1980s -- have material bearing on the estimate . This indicates to me that there can be significant and persistent deviations in the equilibrium real rate from the observed long - run average measured over decades . The average interest rate that seems to have brought aggregate demand and aggregate supply into rough balance in the past may not be the same rate required in every conjunctural setting . Our inability to equate the long - run average interest rate to the equilibrium real interest rate that is relevant for setting policy is not surprising given the manner in which economic behavior , technology , and government policy can change over time . Put another way , an estimate derived from long - run observations may not be relevant for policy for two reasons . First , economic conditions during the policy - relevant period might differ from the average conditions during the observation period . Second , the economy changes in ways that tend to limit the relevance of historical observations for policymaking . That said , policymakers do strive to understand what the equilibrium real interest rate will be over the long run , but that is a forward - looking notion that depends on our sense of how the forces of productivity and thrift will evolve over time as measured in decades . An understanding of a likely long - run level of the equilibrium real rate is useful , even though the level is not directly observable , because it provides a general sense of the level that would , over that longer period , allow aggregate supply and demand to move into balance , given the evaluation of secular forces such as productivity and population growth . Such an understanding of the longer - term prospects for the real interest rate aids in identifying variations in the concept over the intermediate run that is relevant for setting monetary policy --a period of several years , when cyclical forces dominate . Critically , such deviations in the intermediate run can be especially important for policy choice . For example , an unusual hesitancy on the part of businesses to hire and spend emerged in 2001 after the collapse of equity prices and was subsequently reinforced by corporate - governance concerns ; this hesitancy could be thought of as pulling the equilibrium real federal funds rate down temporarily below its longer-run value . In addition , other forces may also have weighed on growth , making it appropriate to move the real funds rate below the intermediate - run equilibrium for a time . From that perspective , the FOMC 's reduction in the actual nominal federal funds rate over this period from the level of 6 - 1/2 percent that prevailed at the beginning of 2001 to the forty - five - year low of 1 percent by mid-2003 had three components : ( 1 ) A reduction to match the decline in inflation expectations so as to prevent the real funds rate from rising inappropriately , ( 2 ) an effort to chase a downwardly moving equilibrium real rate given the pressures on aggregate demand , and ( 3 ) an effort to bring the actual real rate below its apparently lowered equilibrium to provide sufficient stimulus to cope with transitory adverse factors and to speed the recovery in production and employment . So while the real federal funds rate ultimately was pushed below zero , the extent of policy accommodation was less exceptional , in that many estimates of the equilibrium real rate had also fallen significantly . This is a tangible recent example of the need both to judge how the equilibrium real interest rate that is relevant for policy might have changed from a perceived long - run level and to set policy against the background of such an understanding . Indeed , in my judgment , the lingering hesitancy of businesses to make commitments , the restraint imposed on domestic consumers from an increase in the cost of energy , and the drag on domestic production from the excess of imports over exports all represent forces pulling the equilibrium real federal funds rate below its perceived longer-term level . And , in the context of well - contained inflation , the evidence of remaining underused resources gives us a good reason to hold the real rate below even the intermediate - run notion of its equilibrium to allow the economy to be firmly set on a path that will shrink the pool of these underused resources over a reasonable period . But as the expansion regains its footing and resource slack is worked down , we should expect both that the equilibrium real rate will move toward its longer- run level and that policymakers will no longer find it appropriate to keep the actual rate below its equilibrium . That is , the FOMC will likely be removing its policy accommodation over time . The Pace of Return to Equilibrium I have thus far argued that the equilibrium rate that is relevant for actual policy determination can only be judged in the context of forces influencing economic developments . Several aspects of the current outlook lead me to suspect that the return of the equilibrium real rate from its currently somewhat depressed level to its long - run value might plausibly be expected to be gradual and attenuated compared with historical experience . Let me highlight just three of these aspects . I have already mentioned the role of business hesitancy in determining the past trajectory of monetary policy . Clearly , if evidence of that hesitancy remains -- for example , if the labor market were to remain sluggish -- that might be one indication that the return of the equilibrium rate to its longer - run level is likely to be relatively gradual . Secondly , the household saving rate has fallen to less than 1 percent , quite low in its range of historical variation . If households , on net , take steps to return the saving rate closer to the middle of that range ( which , I might add , would provide welcome support to capital accumulation ) , then a sustained period in which consumption grows more slowly than income would result . Third , given government budgetary trends , some fiscal restraint is in order , and one might expect that those responsible for fiscal policy will move that policy to a more - balanced position ( another development I would welcome ) , thereby removing some fiscal impetus . I believe that the combined force of these three factors restraining aggregate demand , plus others that I have not mentioned , would require a lower real rate than otherwise to avoid economic slack . Let me add , however , that there is a powerful force tending to make the equilibrium real rate higher than it would otherwise be . The rapid expansion of labor productivity has raised the growth of economic potential , increased permanent income and wealth , and created an important inducement to add to the capital stock . All else equal , a higher growth rate of productivity will be associated with a more elevated equilibrium real rate . As long as productivity grows steadily at its recent pace , however , there is no reason to suspect that it will produce a change in the equilibrium real rate . In addition , the factors that I mentioned above might not unfold as hypothesized . Business hesitancy might lift abruptly and would be evidenced by large increases in business demand for capital and labor resources ; households might maintain a very low savings rate ; and government policy might not return quickly to a more-balanced posture . Any of these factors might imply that the equilibrium rate relevant for policy returns more quickly to , or even moves above , its long - run level as fewer forces weigh on aggregate demand . Recognizing the uncertainty regarding these various forces and the interplay among them , I believe it important that the FOMC calibrate the return of policy to the equilibrium real rate so that the process is neither hasty nor overly attenuated . Clearly , incoming data and the implications for the outlook should play a particularly important role in policy determination at this juncture . However , theory and practice both indicate that policy works with long and variable lags . Therefore , the actual stance of policy will have to approximate more closely the equilibrium real rate before the pool of underutilized resources is fully exhausted . Otherwise , we risk a buildup of inflationary pressures . Clearly the execution of policy will require careful evaluation as the FOMC attempts to judge both the equilibrium rate that is relevant and the pace of removal of accommodation that is appropriate . Estimating the Equilibrium Rate in Practice So much for the generality of theory . Economists have taken a variety of tacks to arrive at measures of the equilibrium real federal funds rate . I will touch on two techniques in particular . The first can be thought of as a mechanical attempt to implement my definition -- the level of the real federal funds rate that , if allowed to prevail for a couple of years , would place economic activity at its potential -- in models of the U.S. economy . For instance , we can use the many equations of a large - scale macroeconomic representation of the U.S. economy , such as the Federal Reserve Board 's staff model , FRB / US , to calculate at any point in time the level of the real rate that would eliminate economic slack in a reasonable period of time . Or we can rely on a reduced - form description of the economy that measures the output gap in terms of the actual real short rate . The value of the real rate that will move that gap to zero can be thought of as the equilibrium real rate . Besides the assumptions undergirding the construction of either model , such a calculation will require judgment in determining what is a \" reasonable \" period of time and how to cope with the run of prediction errors that are inevitable when trying to explain economic data . An attempt to employ a large model to calculate the equilibrium nominal federal funds rate can be found in an article by Antulio Bomfim . 1 Using the MPS model , the predecessor to the Board staff 's current model , Bomfim found that the equilibrium nominal funds rate varied in a range from 2 percent to 14 percent over the period from 1965 to 1994 , implying that his estimate of the equilibrium real rate turned negative at times . Laubach and Williams opted for the single - equation approach and estimated that the equilibrium real funds rate was around 3 percent in mid-2002 but that it varied from as low as 1 percent in the early 1990s to as high as 5 percent in the late 1960s . 2 In addition to exhibiting large swings , the Laubach - Williams point estimate of the equilibrium rate is a very uncertain statistic . The confidence interval around the estimate is such that there was a 70 percent probability that the actual value of the equilibrium real rate was between 0.5 percent and 5.5 percent . Clearly , this estimate is not measured sufficiently precisely to be a useful guide to policy . An alternative approach turns to financial markets to infer the market 's assessment of the longer - term prospects for real interest rates . Since 1997 , the U.S. Treasury has been issuing price- index - linked securities providing an assured real return . With about $ 250 billion of these inflation - protected securities now outstanding , we can get readings along the entire maturity structure of real interest rates . Currently , for instance , real short yields are close to zero , and longer - term rates are at about 1 - 5/8 percent . One could presume that the forward real rate of interest implied by yields on longer- term indexed debt -- or the real return provided , say , over the period five to ten years from now -- conveys a sense of market participants ' view of the long - run equilibrium real interest rate . 3 Unfortunately for such an inference , however , longer - term yields embody expectations of future interest rates , a term premium , and potentially a premium for the relative illiquidity of these instruments , so this technique will provide an overestimate of the equilibrium real rate . Conclusion This brief discussion highlights the uncertainties attending any attempt to measure the equilibrium real rate . I find these measures useful teaching tools to describe the complicated and iterative process of forecasting the path of the economy so as to arrive at the appropriate stance of policy . However , I believe it to be very important that the FOMC not go on a forced march to some point estimate of the equilibrium real federal funds rate . In my judgment , we should remove the current degree of accommodation at a pace that is importantly determined by incoming data and a changed outlook . Our knowledge of the workings of the economy is sufficiently imprecise that we could not attach much confidence to any single calculation that one might make of the equilibrium rate . Moreover , history provides a daunting record of challenges to economic forecasting associated with changes in economic behavior , the evolution of technology , and swings in governmental policy that would suggest that the equilibrium can vary over time . In such circumstances , the performance of the economy will provide feedback to assess the level of the equilibrium real federal funds rate over time . Footnotes 1 .

When Nike , Adidas , Puma and the rest grudgingly came round , it was hailed as a turning - point in the relationship of these companies to their sub-contractors in the developing world . Five years ago this newspaper spoke of \" the ethical revolution sweeping through the world 's sweatshops \" . It seems we spoke too soon : what was really under way was a revolution in these companies ' public relations departments . As our investigation published today reveals , conditions in hundreds of the factories in which the West 's favourite sportswear brands are manufactured remain highly unsatisfactory or appalling . None of the companies has committed to paying overseas workers a living wage , the paltry sum required for a worker to keep himself and his family in conditions of the most rudimentary decency . Many workers do not even make the derisory local minimum wage , which in China amounts to only two -thirds of a living wage . Some factories continue to use bonded , indentured , prison or child labour . Women working in others are subjected to compulsory pregnancy tests ; if they prove positive , they are summarily sacked . Supervisors terrorise workers into submission . These are the shocking facts revealed by a detailed examination of the reports submitted by the companies themselves \u2013 but as Puma breezily admits , the truth is certainly far worse than that , because some of the sub-contractors lie systematically about their employees ' conditions of labour , and in particular about the amount of overtime they work . Special software has been developed to falsify the records of working hours . The contrast these findings make with the codes of conduct the firms have embraced is startling . \" Our vision is for everyone in our supply chain to share a common set of values \" , declares Adidas . Nike 's code of conduct proposes that \" high ethics means success \" . It exhorts its workers \" to lead balanced personal and professional lives \" , and insists that \" Nike will strive to pay fair compensation \" . In the context of the gruesome shopfloor reality , these fine words are contemptible . Instead of trying to dazzle Western consumers with meaningless rhetoric , these firms must divert some of their vast financial muscle into bringing real improvements to the misery of the sweatshops . The industry 's pledge to reform remains dramatically unfulfilled .

When Nike , Adidas , Puma and the rest grudgingly came round , it was hailed as a turning - point in the relationship of these companies to their sub-contractors in the developing world . Five years ago this newspaper spoke of \" the ethical revolution sweeping through the world 's sweatshops \" . It seems we spoke too soon : what was really under way was a revolution in these companies ' public relations departments . As our investigation published today reveals , conditions in hundreds of the factories in which the West 's favourite sportswear brands are manufactured remain highly unsatisfactory or appalling . None of the companies has committed to paying overseas workers a living wage , the paltry sum required for a worker to keep himself and his family in conditions of the most rudimentary decency . Many workers do not even make the derisory local minimum wage , which in China amounts to only two -thirds of a living wage . Some factories continue to use bonded , indentured , prison or child labour . Women working in others are subjected to compulsory pregnancy tests ; if they prove positive , they are summarily sacked . Supervisors terrorise workers into submission . These are the shocking facts revealed by a detailed examination of the reports submitted by the companies themselves \u2013 but as Puma breezily admits , the truth is certainly far worse than that , because some of the sub-contractors lie systematically about their employees ' conditions of labour , and in particular about the amount of overtime they work . Special software has been developed to falsify the records of working hours . The contrast these findings make with the codes of conduct the firms have embraced is startling . \" Our vision is for everyone in our supply chain to share a common set of values \" , declares Adidas . Nike 's code of conduct proposes that \" high ethics means success \" . It exhorts its workers \" to lead balanced personal and professional lives \" , and insists that \" Nike will strive to pay fair compensation \" . In the context of the gruesome shopfloor reality , these fine words are contemptible . Instead of trying to dazzle Western consumers with meaningless rhetoric , these firms must divert some of their vast financial muscle into bringing real improvements to the misery of the sweatshops . The industry 's pledge to reform remains dramatically unfulfilled .

They ransacked the main chamber of the Legislative Council - known in Hong Kong as LegCo - in what Chief Executive Carrie Lam called an \" extreme use of violence \" . The group were a small branch of a largely leaderless protest movement sparked by a controversial , now suspended , extradition bill . The protesters were evicted after a few hours , but the graffiti they left behind tells us a lot about the evolving nature of these protests . The defacing of the emblem Hong Kong is a semi-autonomous part of China , and LegCo is where its government sits and bills are debated and passed . Central on the main wall of the chamber is the territory 's emblem . In English , it says Hong Kong , but in Chinese it reads : \" The Regional Emblem of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People 's Republic of China \" . The protesters defaced a portion of the emblem bearing the word \" China \" , leaving the Hong Kong part of the emblem untouched . Under the Basic Law , in place since Hong Kong was handed back to China by the UK in 1997 , Hong Kong is guaranteed a level of autonomy and has freedoms not available in mainland China . It keeps its own judicial independence , its own legislature and economic system . But critics say this is under threat from an increasingly assertive China . The extradition bill , that would have enabled suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to China , was cited as proof of this , sparking massive protests . The bill has been suspended - and is unlikely ever to pass . But the defacing of the bill is indicative of the anger many in Hong Kong have towards China . The colonial flag The protesters also draped a colonial - era Hong Kong flag on the podium inside LegCo . It 's a sign of Hong Kong 's history as a British colony and is being seen as a message to the former colonisers , calling on the UK to hold China to account . One Hong Kong journalist said the flag was not a sign , as some have suggested , that the protesters want a return to British rule . \" Whatever the British Hong Kong flag means today , Beijing would n't be pleased to see it . And that might have been the point of putting it in front of the world 's cameras , \" said Inkstone editor Alan Wong on Twitter . Tyranny banner This black banner which was installed over the podium reads : \" There are no rioters , only a tyranny . \" The Hong Kong government described violent clashes on 12 June between protesters and police as a riot - something else that has angered the demonstrators . The term rioting is a serious one , it 's an offence punishable by up to 10 years in jail . Protesters want the government to drop this term . The sunflower movement The phrase \" Hong Kong 's sunflower \" can also be seen on the walls . It 's a reference to the Sunflower Movement protests that took place in Taiwan in 2014 when a controversial trade agreement led students and activists to occupy Taiwan 's parliament . They were protesting against what they said was a sign of Beijing 's growing influence over Taiwan - the same thing they say is happening in Hong Kong right now . ' Dog officers ' References to the police being \" dogs \" were sprayed repeatedly on these glass doors and elsewhere . Protesters have frequently described the city 's police force as \" lapdogs \" of the government , occasionally of Beijing too . It was 12 June that proved to be a turning point in the relationship between the police and the people . It first started out as another protest , but protesters and police officers soon clashed on the streets . Protesters were seen throwing items at police , who responded by spraying tear gas and firing rubber bullets . Footage has been circulating showing some officers dragging protesters and beating them with batons . Human Rights Watch called it a \" well - documented use of excessive force against peaceful protesters \" . Protesters have been demanding an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality . But there have also been large demonstrations in support of the Hong Kong police . The police commissioner has rejected allegations of excessive force , saying many police officers have been injured in the unrest . ' It was you who taught me ' A slogan sprayed on one of the columns in the Legislative Council reads : \" It was you who taught me peaceful marches did not work . \" It appears to be directed at Hong Kong 's leader Carrie Lam , who despite protests of up to a million people prior to 12 June , had remained adamant that the extradition bill would not be suspended . The government later backed down and suspended the bill , and Ms Lam indicated that it would likely not pass . However the bill has been perceived as being part of a wider agenda that aims to move Hong Kong further down a path of becoming a fully \" Chinese city \" , without its unique freedoms . ' Freedom ' The Chinese characters for \" freedom \" - sprayed on this screen in LegCo - sum up why people in Hong Kong say they are protesting . Under a deal struck with Britain that saw Hong Kong return to China in 1997 , the city was guaranteed to enjoy \" a high degree of autonomy , except in foreign and defence affairs \" for 50 years . The Basic Law ends in 2047 , and what happens to Hong Kong 's autonomy after that is unclear , which is fuelling the protesters ' sense of urgency .","annotations":[{"text":"On Monday night","span":[50,64],"token_span":[9,11],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the Agent breaks up the Whole_patient."},{"text":"protesters in Hong Kong","span":[68,90],"token_span":[13,16],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The conscious entity, generally a person, that performs the intentional action that results in the Whole_patient being broken into Pieces."},{"text":"the parliamentary building","span":[103,128],"token_span":[19,21],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the place where the Agent breaks the Whole_patient into pieces."},{"text":"metal shutters","span":[141,154],"token_span":[24,25],"role":"Whole_patient","label":"Whole_patient","role_definition":"The entity which is destroyed by the Agent and that ends up broken into Pieces."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"At around 9 pm local time , hundreds of protesters stormed the legislature after breaking through the glass walls and metal doors of the building .

Born on 1932 Allan Fakir ( 1932\u20132000 ) , a Pakistani folk singer is a one of the foremost exponents of sufi music in Pakistan . He is particularly known for his ecstatic style of performance marked with extreme devotional rhetoric and sufi dance singing . His peculiarly funny body language and distinctively pleasing facial expressions marked with a broad smile , were always amusing for his audience at live performances . Allan Fakir was born in 1932 in the ancient village of Aamari in Jamshoro District , taluka Manjhand , Sindh . His mother died soon after his birth . He spent his childhood in Manjhand , a town between Sehwan and Hyderabad . He belongs to the Mangrasi tribe the Mangarhars are believed to bring happiness and welcomed on festive occasions for their gift of melody .

When he was only a teenager , Allan Fakir developed a habit of singing melancholy songs which his father did not like . Deprived of a mother 's love , he went off in search of someone who could replace that love . He arrived at the tomb of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai in Bhit Shah and started living there . Faqir 's memory was sharp even though he could not read and write . Hearing the traditional Latifi Raag sung every night touched his heart . Encouraged by Faqir Zawar Qurban Ali Lanjwani and Moolchand Maharaj , he began singing Bhitai 's poetry at the shrine and ultimately spent twenty years there until meeting Mumtaz Mirza , who introduced him to Radio Pakistan and ptv in Hyderabad and helped him to learn the correct pronunciation of Bhitai 's poetry . Eventually , he became a performing legend . His songs , mostly in Sindhi language except a few in Urdu , usually revolve around sufism and the devotional philosophy . But the characteristic which distinguishes him from many other folk singers is the depth of his feelings , which is very expressive in all his songs . One of his famous songs is a duet with Muhammad Ali Shehki , \" Allah Allah kar bhaiya \" which was a big hit and increased his popularity tremendously .

You may have followed all the rules : no caffeine before bed , an early bedtime , and all the rest . But your best efforts are oftentimes for naught , foiled by the mysterious ways of sleep cycles . There may be an answer : WakeMate , a Y Combinator - funded startup that 's launching today , is looking to help you catch that ever-elusive good night 's sleep ( and maybe even the perfect nap , too ) . Wake Mate is one of the few startups we 've see that actually involves its own physical product ( another that comes to mind is FitBit ) . To use the service , you first order the WakeMate wristband from the website , which costs $ 50 . Then , you download an application for your Bluetooth - enabled smartphone ( WakeMate is launching with support for i Phone , BlackBerry , Android , Windows Mobile , and a standard Java app for non-smart phones ; support for Palm 's WebOS is on the way ) . Once you 've installed the app and paired your wristband with your phone , you set your alarm ( more on that later ) and hit they hay . The wristband tracks the movement of your wrist through the night , which it can use to analyze your sleep patterns . If you 're raising your eyebrows you 're not alone \u2013 this sounded strange to me at first , but co-founder Greg Nemeth explains it 's a well established sleep-study technique called actigraphy . The WakeMate wristband collects data throughout the night and stores it on internal Flash storage . When it 's time to wake you up WakeMate does n't necessarily sound an alarm at exactly the time you set . Instead , it monitors your sleep patterns for the 20 minute window prior to that and sounds your alarm when you 're in the lightest sleep mode , which can help eliminate that groggy feeling you sometimes wake up with . The alarm does n't come from the wristband though \u2013 instead , the wristband uses Bluetooth to trigger your cell phone 's alarm .

You may have followed all the rules : no caffeine before bed , an early bedtime , and all the rest . But your best efforts are oftentimes for naught , foiled by the mysterious ways of sleep cycles . There may be an answer : WakeMate , a Y Combinator - funded startup that 's launching today , is looking to help you catch that ever-elusive good night 's sleep ( and maybe even the perfect nap , too ) . Wake Mate is one of the few startups we 've see that actually involves its own physical product ( another that comes to mind is FitBit ) . To use the service , you first order the WakeMate wristband from the website , which costs $ 50 . Then , you download an application for your Bluetooth - enabled smartphone ( WakeMate is launching with support for i Phone , BlackBerry , Android , Windows Mobile , and a standard Java app for non-smart phones ; support for Palm 's WebOS is on the way ) . Once you 've installed the app and paired your wristband with your phone , you set your alarm ( more on that later ) and hit they hay . The wristband tracks the movement of your wrist through the night , which it can use to analyze your sleep patterns . If you 're raising your eyebrows you 're not alone \u2013 this sounded strange to me at first , but co-founder Greg Nemeth explains it 's a well established sleep-study technique called actigraphy . The WakeMate wristband collects data throughout the night and stores it on internal Flash storage . When it 's time to wake you up WakeMate does n't necessarily sound an alarm at exactly the time you set . Instead , it monitors your sleep patterns for the 20 minute window prior to that and sounds your alarm when you 're in the lightest sleep mode , which can help eliminate that groggy feeling you sometimes wake up with . The alarm does n't come from the wristband though \u2013 instead , the wristband uses Bluetooth to trigger your cell phone 's alarm . It then transmits your sleep data to your phone , which in turn uses its cellular data connection to upload it to the WakeMate servers . You can then browse through your sleep history from the WakeMate website . Wake Mate will be facing off with a number of other sleep devices , including the Zeo Personal Sleep Coach , which was released over the summer .

If Union sea power did not win the war , it enabled the war to be won . When hostilities opened , the U.S. Navy numbered 90 warships , of which only 42 were in commission , and many of these were on foreign station . Fortunately for the Federals , Lincoln had , in the person of Gideon Welles , a wise secretary of the navy who was one of his most competent cabinet members . Welles was ably seconded by his assistant , Gustavus Vasa Fox . By the time of Lee 's surrender , Lincoln 's navy numbered 626 warships , of which 65 were ironclads . From a tiny force of nearly 9,000 seamen in 1861 , the Union navy increased by war 's end to about 59,000 sailors , whereas naval appropriations per year leaped from approximately $ 12 million to perhaps $ 123 million . The blockade of about 3,500 miles ( 5,600 km ) of Confederate coastline was a factor of incalculable value in the final defeat of the Davis government , although the blockade did not become truly effective before the end of 1863 . The Confederates , on the other hand , had to start from almost nothing in building a navy . That they did so well was largely because of untiring efforts by the capable secretary of the navy , Stephen Mallory . He dispatched agents to Europe to purchase warships , sought to refurbish captured or scuttled Federal vessels , and made every effort to arm and employ Southern - owned ships then in Confederate ports . Mallory 's only major omission was his delay in seeing the advantage of Confederate government control of blockade runners bringing in strategic supplies ; not until later in the war did the government begin closer supervision of blockade - running vessels . Eventually , the government commandeered space on all privately owned blockade runners and even built and operated some of its own late in the war . The naval side of the Civil War was a revolutionary one . In addition to their increasing use of steam power , the screw propeller , shell guns , and rifled ordnance , both sides built and employed ironclad warships . The notable clash on March 9 , 1862 , between the North 's Monitor and the South 's Virginia ( formerly the Merrimack ) was the first battle ever waged between ironclads . Also , the first sinking of a warship by a submarine occurred on February 17 , 1864 , when the Confederate submersible Hunley sank the blockader USS Housatonic . Daring Confederate sea raiders preyed upon Union commerce . Especially successful were the Sumter , commanded by Raphael Semmes , which captured 18 Northern merchantmen early in the war ; the Florida , captained by John Maffit , which in 1863 seized 37 Federal prizes in the North and South Atlantic ; and the Shenandoah , with James Waddell as skipper , which took 38 Union merchant ships , mostly in the Pacific . But the most famous of all the Confederate cruisers was the Alabama , commanded by Semmes , which captured 69 Federal ships in two years ; not until June 19 , 1864 , was the Alabama intercepted and sunk off Cherbourg , France , by the Federal warship Kearsarge , captained by John Winslow . A great many other Federal ships were captured , and marine insurance rates were driven to a prohibitive high by these Southern depredations . This led to a serious deterioration of the American merchant marine , the effects of which lasted into the 20th century . Besides fighting efficaciously with ironclads on the inland rivers , Lincoln 's navy played an important role in a series of coastal and amphibious operations , some in conjunction with the Federal army . As early as November 7 , 1861 , a Federal flotilla under Samuel Francis du Pont seized Port Royal , South Carolina , and another squadron under Louis M. Goldsborough assisted Burnside 's army in capturing Roanoke Island and New Bern on the North Carolina littoral in February \u2013 March 1862 . One month later , Savannah , Georgia , was closed to Confederate blockade runners when the Federal navy reduced Fort Pulaski guarding the city ; and on April 25 David Farragut , running the forts near the mouth of the Mississippi , took New Orleans , which was subsequently occupied by Benjamin F. Butler 's army . But in April 1863 and again in July and August , Federal warships were repelled at Fort Sumter when they descended upon Charleston , and a Federal army under Quincy A. Gillmore fared little better when it tried to assist . Farragut had better luck , however , when he rendered Mobile , Alabama , useless by reducing Fort Morgan and destroying several defending Confederate ships on August 5 , 1864 , in the hardest - fought naval action of the war . The Confederacy 's last open Atlantic port , Wilmington , North Carolina , successfully withstood a Federal naval attack by Porter on defending Fort Fisher when Butler 's army failed to coordinate its attack properly in December 1864 , but it fell one month later to Porter and to an ably conducted army assault led by Alfred H. Terry . Only Galveston remained open to the Confederates in the last months of the war .

However it was not until 1879 that money collected to commemorate the contribution of Sir James Young Simpson to obstetrics , ended the numerous moves to makeshift hospitals which had been made over the preceeding forty years , and enabled the City to open a purpose - built maternity hospital where the poor could have their children under medical supervision . Initially the hospital consisted of two lying - in wards , a labour ward , dispensary , kitchens and administrative quarters , as well as quarters for the matron , two house surgeons and seven or eight nurses . In 1895 Lady Tweedale opened the Married Women 's Pavilion . This was the west wing originally proposed by the architects MacGibbon and Ross , but postponed in 1879 because of insufficient funds . Four visiting physicians with their assistants undertook in rotation a three month term of duty . Besides hospital deliveries , medical students or pupil midwives , supervised by hospital staff , attended home deliveries . These are recorded in the Out - Door case books . The 1886 Amendment to the Medical Act made midwifery a compulsory course in the medical curriculum , and in 1890 women students were admitted to the hospital for clinical instruction . The risk of infection was always present and in 1899 the hospital closed becuase of puerperal septicaemia . Later cases were transferred as quickly as possible to the City Hospital to prevent cross-infection , and in 1924 Dr Nasmyth donated a new labour ward allowing the separation of infected cases .

After World War I three main - door basement flats in Lauriston Park and two flats in Graham Street were acquired to try to meet the increasing demands on the hospital . Throughout the first quarter of the twentieth century advances were made in obstetrics , pathology and paediatrics . In 1901 a pre-maternity bed was instituted at the hospital . William Ballantyne took a particular interest in the physiology and pathology of pregnancy and James Haig Ferguson furthered the cause of preventative medicine by stressing the benefits of routine antenatal supervision . As a result of his efforts the first out - patient antenatal clinic in Britain was opened in 1915 and in 1926 a postnatal clinic was opened . The Central Midwives Board for England and Wales ( established in 1902 ) recognised the Simpson as a training centre for midwives wishing to practice north of the border . In 1915 the Central Midwives Board for Scotland was established and the following year the hospital was recognised by them . Two years after the Notification of Births ( Extension ) Act of 1915 , The Edinburgh Local Authority launched a maternity and child welfare scheme in conjunction with the hospital . Seven antenatal out - patient clinics were opened in Edinburgh with the main consultative centre at the Maternity Hospital , for which the Corporation paid the hospital \u00a3 200 . In 1919 the Local Authority , acting on the recommendation of a Royal Commission report of 1916 , arranged with the hospital the establishment of an antenatal out - patient and in - patient venereal diseases department . In 1925 the first assistant paediatrics physician was appointed . With maternal deaths in Scotland reaching a peak of 651 in 1931 , a concerted effort was made to combat eclampsia and to generally reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality . This objective was achieved largely through advances in therapeutics such as the advent of chemotherapy and antibiotics , the work of the national blood transfusion service , and improved anaesthetics . From as early as 1910 overtures had been made to the RIE to alleviate pressure on the Maternity Hospital . Subsequent attempts had also come to nothing until in 1926 a conclusion was reached with the purchase of George Watson 's School from the Merchant Company .

In the new Pavilion the principle of isolation as a means of containing infection was fully implemented and by 1979 the number of beds had increased to 225 while the hazards of childbirth and perinatal mortality had been drastically reduced . From 1939 to 1948 the hospital was administered by the Managers of the RIE ; from 1948 to 1974 it formed part of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and Associated Hospitals group ; from 1974 to 1984 the hospital was part of the South Lothian District of Lothian Health Board .

This season has been a belter , so we ca n't wait to find out what happens next . To celebrate the show 's return , we called up the lovely John Noble - who plays Walter ( and Walternate ! ) - to have a little chat . Read on to find out what he had to say about those flashbacks , Peter and Walter , and whether he thinks the show will be renewed ... How has it been playing both Walter and Walternate this season ? \" It 's been gift , really . I mean , Walter himself is a wonderful character to play , but then to be given this other [ role as well ] ... He 's a version of Walter , but one very much in the terms of the Fringe mythology - ' what would happen if ' stuff . So what would happen if you had a son stolen instead of having stolen one ? So it 's been based on the same characters but taking off in different directions . I 've loved it . \" Do you sympathise with one Walter more than the other ? \" In a sense , intellectually I do n't , because obviously this Walter on our side , he 's a loveable old character but in fact he did do what he did . He did take into his own hands this thing of crossing over and taking the son , albeit for good intentions , to save the kid 's life . You kind of sympathise with that and then you see he 's gone through hell ever since . Walternate on the other hand was a man who had his son stolen , and I can totally understand how that would twist the mind and turn him into a vengeful and very powerful character . So I kind of understand both of them . \" Do you like the fact that both Walter and Walternate have good and bad sides ? \" Oh , absolutely . At the time we introduced Walternate , I said to the writers , ' Please , please do n't make him a two -dimensional baddie . Down the track , give us something to humanise him ' . I was really insistent on that . As time 's gone by they 've started to give aspects of Walternate that say , ' Oh yeah , I understand now why he did what he did ' , and I really requested that to happen . Two -dimensional characters are fairly forgettable . \" Have you enjoyed playing a younger Walter in the flashback episodes ? \" I have ! It 's been great fun . It 's quite a shock , really . I think the most interesting part is finding the energy of the younger man as opposed to what we see in Walter and Walternate . And the passion that they have , which gets tempered a little bit with age . It 's interesting walking around looking at yourself 20 years younger with all that strange hair . It 's really cool , but my wife says she likes me better as I am ! \" Does it take a long time to prepare for the flashbacks ? \" Yeah , it does . Our makeup lady , particularly for the second flashback , worked out some terrific techniques to get the skin softer so it loses the wrinkles and so forth . This year we 've come up with some terrific technology . And [ I have ] a beautiful handmade wig which at that stage was the right length - should we go on further we 'd need to trim it back . We 've looked at it really carefully . As we become more efficient it 's generally about three or four hours in makeup . \" Walter can be quite quirky and eccentric - how much of that is in the script and how much is it your performance ? \" It 's a combination , because obviously I 've brought what I bring to it . They wrote the initial stuff and then I played with it , and as I played they wrote to it . So it 's been a dual effort . The more that I was prepared to do , the more that they would write . I 've never said no to anything so if they said , ' Walk naked along a tightrope ' , I 'd say , ' OK , whatever ! ' At this stage Walter continues to do outrageous things and as long as they keep writing them I ca n't think of anything I would n't do . \" Are you pleased with how Walter and Peter 's relationship has developed over the three seasons ? \" Obviously Josh [ Jackson ] and I loved the development in the first two seasons until it all fell apart . This season , even though it 's essential it 's been this way , it 's been really hard because we want to play them as getting along really well . But we ca n't because there 's obviously this friction between the two of them . We had a really interesting struggle this year personally because we like the relationship . To play all that tension has been challenging . But it 's been good for the characters and it 's real that they should be so strained at this point . \" Where do you think the show will go in the future ? \" The future depends on whether we finish this year or play for six seasons or ten , whatever . The writers have scenarios for all of those options . The first thing we need to do is come to some resolution about the alternate universe and our universe in conflict . Obviously we ca n't destroy one of them because by the law of physics , if we destroy one we destroy the other . So there has to be a resolution of that and I think there will be some resolution of that in this season - we still have n't had the last two scripts though . Beyond that , if that did happen , I would see a pact being created and then some external threat of some description would make complete sense . I know the writers have so many ideas . One of them said to me the other day , ' We could play for 20 years just with the ideas we 've got ' . We 've certainly played out this conflict between the two universes this year and that will need to be resolved to some degree , not completely but resolved to some degree , by the end of the season . \" What else can fans expect as the season comes to a close ? \" There will be a tremendous build up of tension . It 's a very dark period because you 're looking at the end of the world essentially , unless something is done . So we 're going through the doomsday scenarios . Unless we 're going to blow the world up , there has to be a resolution and that 's really difficult and creates tremendous tension and pressure on all the characters . I guess by the end of season three it will be an enormous buildup to someone about to hit the button and then they either will hit the button or they wo n't . But I know already that the tension is enormous in the stories . \" Fringe has evolved from one - off episodes to a longer story arc - how do you feel about that ? \" On a personal level I like it . It probably makes it more difficult for fans to drop in and say , ' Oh I 'm going to watch the show ' and have any idea what 's going on , because it 's so mythology - based now . But for our hardcore fans it 's perfect because they have an investment in the mythology and the ongoing stories and the ongoing character arcs . I do n't think it could have stayed as a ' monster of the week ' - I do n't think it would have been interesting to continue forever doing that . They could have , but to me personally I prefer the way we 've gone with it . \" We 've heard rumours that William Bell will be back - can you say anything about that ? \" I've heard the same rumours ! In fact , I think Leonard [ Nimoy ] announced it on his Twitter or something . All I can say is that there will be a return of Leonard 's character in a way . In a way . It 's not going to be , ' Hey , here 's Leonard again ' . It will be something different but really quite bizarre . Very bizarre , in fact . \" What are your hopes for Walter in the future ? \" Walter is a man who has gone through certain periods in his life and is now in his golden years and is trying to resolve himself with his creator , with the people around him . It 's quite biblical in a sense , the way he 's trying to come to grips with what he 's done and seek a rounding out and forgiveness . That continues on and it has to continue on , simply because he is an older man . He just continues to evolve almost in a religious sense until he finds some sort of peace and resolution . It would be ridiculous to do it otherwise . So I guess there will be a continuing unravelling and maybe a growing wisdom in the old man . I think that 's what will happen . \" Fringe has controversially been moved to Friday nights in the US - what are your thoughts ? \" I kind of like the move to Friday nights . I thought it was a really good move for us because it gave us a home base . Thursday night in America was never a good night for us ... It was n't a great spot for us up against Grey 's Anatomy and all those things . This is perfect for us . This is the spot that The X Files made their own . And it was sitting there waiting to be taken to be honest with you , because nothing was working in there . So far , so good . I 'd be quite happy to stay on Friday nights . \" Do you think Fringe will be renewed for another season ? The fans want it . \" The fans do want it , and the interesting thing about Fringe is that I know the executives at Fox and the executives at Warner Bros really love Fringe , they 're very proud of it . The challenge they have is , ' Well , OK , do enough people watch it to justify it ? ' That 's where they 're sitting at present . They obviously have to drop some shows this year to let other shows in . The chances of Fringe returning I 'd say are pretty good , but I ca n't really say any more than that . I would n't like to be making the decision they have to make and I think they 're probably making that decision almost as we speak . I know that sentimentally they want Fringe to remain - I know that for a fact . \" Fringe returns in the UK on Wednesday at 10 pm on Sky1 . Are you pleased that Fringe is back ?

I do n't think it could have stayed as a ' monster of the week ' - I do n't think it would have been interesting to continue forever doing that . They could have , but to me personally I prefer the way we 've gone with it . \" We 've heard rumours that William Bell will be back - can you say anything about that ? \" I've heard the same rumours ! In fact , I think Leonard [ Nimoy ] announced it on his Twitter or something . All I can say is that there will be a return of Leonard 's character in a way . In a way . It 's not going to be , ' Hey , here 's Leonard again ' . It will be something different but really quite bizarre . Very bizarre , in fact . \" What are your hopes for Walter in the future ? \" Walter is a man who has gone through certain periods in his life and is now in his golden years and is trying to resolve himself with his creator , with the people around him . It 's quite biblical in a sense , the way he 's trying to come to grips with what he 's done and seek a rounding out and forgiveness . That continues on and it has to continue on , simply because he is an older man . He just continues to evolve almost in a religious sense until he finds some sort of peace and resolution . It would be ridiculous to do it otherwise . So I guess there will be a continuing unravelling and maybe a growing wisdom in the old man . I think that 's what will happen . \" Fringe has controversially been moved to Friday nights in the US - what are your thoughts ? \" I kind of like the move to Friday nights . I thought it was a really good move for us because it gave us a home base . Thursday night in America was never a good night for us ... It was n't a great spot for us up against Grey 's Anatomy and all those things . This is perfect for us . This is the spot that The X Files made their own . And it was sitting there waiting to be taken to be honest with you , because nothing was working in there . So far , so good . I 'd be quite happy to stay on Friday nights . \" Do you think Fringe will be renewed for another season ? The fans want it . \" The fans do want it , and the interesting thing about Fringe is that I know the executives at Fox and the executives at Warner Bros really love Fringe , they 're very proud of it . The challenge they have is , ' Well , OK , do enough people watch it to justify it ? ' That 's where they 're sitting at present . They obviously have to drop some shows this year to let other shows in . The chances of Fringe returning I 'd say are pretty good , but I ca n't really say any more than that . I would n't like to be making the decision they have to make and I think they 're probably making that decision almost as we speak . I know that sentimentally they want Fringe to remain - I know that for a fact . \" Fringe returns in the UK on Wednesday at 10 pm on Sky1 . Are you pleased that Fringe is back ? What do you think will happen in the new episodes ?

Soldiers and health technicians hopped in jeeps and secretly roped sheep and cattle grazing near Hanford . Then , they pressed Geiger counters to the animals ' thyroids to check for the presence of radioactive iodine 131 . The roundup was ordered by the late Herbert Parker - a formal and aloof English radiologist who was Hanford 's first chief of health and safety . Parker fretted about the huge clouds of iodine 131 gas spewing from the stacks of central Hanford 's B Plant and T Plant - where plutonium was chemically extracted from nuclear fuel rods . Parker knew iodine 131 affected thyroid glands . But he did n't know what amounts were unsafe for people . It was a problem he kept trying to calculate . He and other scientists had struggled for years to find out how iodine 131 - which loses half its radioactivity every eight days - enters human bodies . Early on , they believed iodine and other radionuclides settled on vegetation that birds and animals ate . And they noted hunters ate game animals . In the late 1940s , technicians stalked rabbits , coyotes and birds to find excessive amounts of iodine 131 in their thyroids , according to On The Home Front , a Hanford history book written by longtime site historian Michele Gerber . For decades , the government kept secret any speculation about the risks of radioactive iodine to folks downwind from the plutonium plants . The official word was Hanford 's neighbors had nothing to worry about . But in the government - owned town of Richland , home to most of Hanford 's workers , there were some curious rules that seem aimed at preventing iodine 131 from moving through the food chain , Gerber noted . Chickens and livestock were banned , and Richland pasture land was off limits for grazing . The government constantly was testing the milk and water . Richland 's milk supply came from the Yakima and Ellensburg areas - upwind of Hanford . Hanford officials often cautioned Richlanders against drinking \" poor quality \" milk from the rural areas near town , Gerber said . Milk from cows grazing on contaminated pastures is one of the most direct ways for radioactive iodine to reach humans . Although Gerber did n't find evidence directly linking the Richland rules to iodine hazards , the circumstantial evidence is there . \" You certainly have to raise the questions , \" Gerber said . Of course , for most of the past 50 years , no one outside a small cadre of experts was asking serious questions about Hanford emissions , despite the threat to human health . Releases of iodine 131 from Hanford smokestacks began soon after the first nuclear reactors fired up at Hanford . By far , the greatest releases of iodine 131 came from 1944 and 1951 , when emissions totaled an estimated 727,900 curies . After 1951 , special filters and other safety practices cut emissions dramatically . In fact , 98 percent of the overall curies of iodine released over the 28 years ending in 1972 went out the stacks in the first eight years of Hanford operations , according to the Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project . The iodine emissions accounted for nearly all the radiation doses from all types of airborne releases at Hanford . A key reason for the peak during those early years of the Cold War was that Hanford was experimenting with ways to increase plutonium production . One way to get plutonium quicker was to shorten the time that irradiated fuel rods cooled before going to the extraction plants . A side effect of shorter cooling times was that the radioactive iodine did n't have as long to decay before the fuel went into the plants . As a result , thousands of curies of radioactive iodine routinely were sent out Hanford 's smokestacks . By contrast , about 15 curies of radioactive iodine was released in the 1979 Three Mile Island reactor incident in Pennsylvania . The wall of secrecy surrounding Hanford began to crumble as the Cold War drew to a close in the late 1980s . Among the thousands of pages of declassified documents was an account of the so-called Green Run of 1949 . In terms of radiation dose , the Green Run 's 8,000 - curie release pales in comparison with the years of routine emissions . But the federal government 's decision to use the Northwest as an outdoor laboratory for radiation experiments still rankles many . Much about the Green Run still is classified , but numerous clues indicate America 's Cold War scientists wanted to learn how to monitor Soviet nuclear weapon production by tracking iodine releases . So an intentional release of iodine was set up at T Plant . It was dubbed the Green Run because so - called \" green \" fuel was used . That fuel had cooled only 16 days instead of the then - normal 90 or more days - giving iodine little time to decay . Scientists wanted a night experiment when cold layers of air near the ground would keep particles airborne until they were diluted . Plus , they wanted no rain , no low clouds and light winds . They figured 4,000 curies of iodine would be released . But the night of Dec. 2 - 3 , 1949 , was cloudier than expected , and the winds kept shifting . Calculations were off , and almost 8,000 curies of iodine 131 were released . And soon afterward , rain and snow came to force the iodine particles down all over the inland Northwest . One follow - up iodine 131 reading on vegetation in Kennewick was almost 1,000 times the limit set at that time . In 1950 , special filters were put on the processing plants ' smokestacks to capture iodine . Emissions dropped to a fraction of previous counts . But Hanford had an accidental release of 15,000 curies over several weeks in 1951 when the filters failed . Meanwhile , scientists kept researching iodine 131's health effects . They fed iodine 131 pellets to sheep kept at a facility near Hanford 's F Reactor in 1950 and 1951 and did autopsies on the carcasses . The then - classified study showed thyroid damage and changes in blood and hormone levels in the sheep . Also in 1951 , the Atomic Energy Commission - the forerunner of today 's Department of Energy - released a public report that declared releases of iodine 131 and other radionuclides were low and posed no hazards to plants and animals . Gerber noted all Hanford 's iodine and thyroid studies were kept classified until the 1980s . Scientists continued studying iodine and thyroid disease at Hanford and elsewhere . In 1954 , Hanford scientists were sent to Utah to check on sheep killed from iodine - laced fallout from atomic bomb tests , she said . Meanwhile , some research addressed strong suspicions that iodine 131 landing on vegetation came to humans through cows ' milk . \" They did n't get the connection with milk for a long time . They knew ( iodine ) landed on the vegetation , \" Gerber said . In 1963 , an AEC scientist publicly acknowledged that link with a report on the abrupt increase of iodine 131 in milk and subsequently in human thyroids after atomic bomb tests in Nevada , Gerber said . She believes the AEC was certain about the connection prior to that publication . However , it was not until the mid-1980s that public questions and concerns about Hanford radiation releases and people 's health gained major momentum . That was spearheaded by newspaper articles on \" downwinders \" and a massive 1986 release of 19,000 pages of previously classified documents that included information on iodine and thyroids . The federal Centers for Disease Control began pondering the need to find out how much radiation people living \" downwind \" of Hanford would have absorbed from 1944 to 1972 . And the agency thought a study was needed to see if a link existed between Hanford 's iodine emissions and the region 's thyroid problems . DOE agreed to a dose- reconstruction study , and it put Hanford contractor Battelle in charge . But public concerns surfaced whether DOE and one of its contractors could conduct an impartial and credible study on Hanford emissions . So an independent panel of scientists - dubbed the Technical Steering Panel - was put in charge . Much of the public did n't believe the panel had the clout to assert its independence . And Battelle - while sharing technical data - balked at sharing budget information on the research . The panel had to pressure Battelle to open up . And it requested overall responsibility for the study be shifted from DOE to improve credibility . In 1992 , the Department of Health and Human Services assumed responsibility for the study , and CDC began providing the money . In 1994 , the panel unveiled its final estimates on how much airborne radionuclides - dominated by iodine 131 - Northwest downwinders likely absorbed through the food chain . The numbers varied according to geography , ages and eating and drinking habits . Babies and children were among the higher risks . And these were just estimates within ranges of maximum and minimum possible doses . Many average doses were a few hundred times the levels people would receive from naturally occurring background radiation . The remainder varied widely , from a few dozen times that of background levels to a few thousand times background levels . The big problem was : What did these numbers really mean when looking at thyroid problems ?

Soldiers and health technicians hopped in jeeps and secretly roped sheep and cattle grazing near Hanford . Then , they pressed Geiger counters to the animals ' thyroids to check for the presence of radioactive iodine 131 . The roundup was ordered by the late Herbert Parker - a formal and aloof English radiologist who was Hanford 's first chief of health and safety . Parker fretted about the huge clouds of iodine 131 gas spewing from the stacks of central Hanford 's B Plant and T Plant - where plutonium was chemically extracted from nuclear fuel rods . Parker knew iodine 131 affected thyroid glands . But he did n't know what amounts were unsafe for people . It was a problem he kept trying to calculate . He and other scientists had struggled for years to find out how iodine 131 - which loses half its radioactivity every eight days - enters human bodies . Early on , they believed iodine and other radionuclides settled on vegetation that birds and animals ate . And they noted hunters ate game animals . In the late 1940s , technicians stalked rabbits , coyotes and birds to find excessive amounts of iodine 131 in their thyroids , according to On The Home Front , a Hanford history book written by longtime site historian Michele Gerber . For decades , the government kept secret any speculation about the risks of radioactive iodine to folks downwind from the plutonium plants . The official word was Hanford 's neighbors had nothing to worry about . But in the government - owned town of Richland , home to most of Hanford 's workers , there were some curious rules that seem aimed at preventing iodine 131 from moving through the food chain , Gerber noted . Chickens and livestock were banned , and Richland pasture land was off limits for grazing . The government constantly was testing the milk and water . Richland 's milk supply came from the Yakima and Ellensburg areas - upwind of Hanford . Hanford officials often cautioned Richlanders against drinking \" poor quality \" milk from the rural areas near town , Gerber said . Milk from cows grazing on contaminated pastures is one of the most direct ways for radioactive iodine to reach humans . Although Gerber did n't find evidence directly linking the Richland rules to iodine hazards , the circumstantial evidence is there . \" You certainly have to raise the questions , \" Gerber said . Of course , for most of the past 50 years , no one outside a small cadre of experts was asking serious questions about Hanford emissions , despite the threat to human health . Releases of iodine 131 from Hanford smokestacks began soon after the first nuclear reactors fired up at Hanford . By far , the greatest releases of iodine 131 came from 1944 and 1951 , when emissions totaled an estimated 727,900 curies . After 1951 , special filters and other safety practices cut emissions dramatically . In fact , 98 percent of the overall curies of iodine released over the 28 years ending in 1972 went out the stacks in the first eight years of Hanford operations , according to the Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project . The iodine emissions accounted for nearly all the radiation doses from all types of airborne releases at Hanford . A key reason for the peak during those early years of the Cold War was that Hanford was experimenting with ways to increase plutonium production . One way to get plutonium quicker was to shorten the time that irradiated fuel rods cooled before going to the extraction plants . A side effect of shorter cooling times was that the radioactive iodine did n't have as long to decay before the fuel went into the plants . As a result , thousands of curies of radioactive iodine routinely were sent out Hanford 's smokestacks . By contrast , about 15 curies of radioactive iodine was released in the 1979 Three Mile Island reactor incident in Pennsylvania . The wall of secrecy surrounding Hanford began to crumble as the Cold War drew to a close in the late 1980s . Among the thousands of pages of declassified documents was an account of the so-called Green Run of 1949 . In terms of radiation dose , the Green Run 's 8,000 - curie release pales in comparison with the years of routine emissions . But the federal government 's decision to use the Northwest as an outdoor laboratory for radiation experiments still rankles many . Much about the Green Run still is classified , but numerous clues indicate America 's Cold War scientists wanted to learn how to monitor Soviet nuclear weapon production by tracking iodine releases . So an intentional release of iodine was set up at T Plant . It was dubbed the Green Run because so - called \" green \" fuel was used . That fuel had cooled only 16 days instead of the then - normal 90 or more days - giving iodine little time to decay . Scientists wanted a night experiment when cold layers of air near the ground would keep particles airborne until they were diluted . Plus , they wanted no rain , no low clouds and light winds . They figured 4,000 curies of iodine would be released . But the night of Dec. 2 - 3 , 1949 , was cloudier than expected , and the winds kept shifting . Calculations were off , and almost 8,000 curies of iodine 131 were released . And soon afterward , rain and snow came to force the iodine particles down all over the inland Northwest . One follow - up iodine 131 reading on vegetation in Kennewick was almost 1,000 times the limit set at that time . In 1950 , special filters were put on the processing plants ' smokestacks to capture iodine . Emissions dropped to a fraction of previous counts . But Hanford had an accidental release of 15,000 curies over several weeks in 1951 when the filters failed . Meanwhile , scientists kept researching iodine 131's health effects . They fed iodine 131 pellets to sheep kept at a facility near Hanford 's F Reactor in 1950 and 1951 and did autopsies on the carcasses . The then - classified study showed thyroid damage and changes in blood and hormone levels in the sheep . Also in 1951 , the Atomic Energy Commission - the forerunner of today 's Department of Energy - released a public report that declared releases of iodine 131 and other radionuclides were low and posed no hazards to plants and animals .

The award for best online journalist was only offered in 2001 and 2002 . \" Some editors are saying there are too many categories , \" he told dotJournalism . \" It will be a root and branch review . \" More news from dotJournalism : Top prize- giver snubs online journalism ' Myopic ' press awards neglect UK web journalists British broadsheet site scoops more awards More coverage : Guardian Unlimited : http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,7495,1438881,00.html The Sun : http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2005122447,00.html Media Week : http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/articles/folder2005/Mar03/geldof-paperattack | Back to dotJournalism headlines Focus Daniell Morrisey : How to attract and recruit top talent Careers writer Daniell Morrisey on the steps employers can take to hire the best job candidates 15:14 21 December 2006 Who 's driving CAR ?

Doerfler and shotgunning her to death during a robbery that netted $ 3 , Tyrone X Gilliam was executed by lethal injection last night , proclaiming his innocence and asking God to forgive those who took his life . The execution ended a 10 - year legal fight for Gilliam , 32 , who claimed he did n't pull the trigger that ended the life of Doerfler , a 21 - year - old Baltimore accountant who dreamed of working with children and entertained her nieces and nephews by impersonating Donald Duck . Doerfler 's brother said family members were too distraught to talk last night . \" It 's a tough night for all of us , \" was all Robert Doerfler Jr. would say . Tyrone Gilliam Sr. told protesters outside the Maryland Penitentiary in Baltimore that his son had a message for them : \" I will live on through love , through God . \" None of Doerfler 's family members asked to be present for the execution . None of Gilliam 's were allowed to attend . At 10 p.m. , Gilliam was escorted into the 16-by - 15 - foot death chamber last night and strapped to a 300 - pound gurney . Four minutes later , execution commander William L. Sondervan gave the signal to start the flow of lethal drugs -- sodium pentothal to render him unconscious , pavulon to paralyze his muscles and potassium chloride to stop his heart . Wearing an orange jumpsuit , white socks that had \" Caresteps \" written on the bottom , and holding a blue Nation of Islam cap in his left hand , Gilliam lay on the gurney in the penitentiary hospital . He smiled when he saw his attorney , Jerome H. Nickerson Jr. , and his spiritual adviser , Ashidda Muhammad , who were among the 14 witnesses . \" Allah , forgive them , for they know not what they do , \" Gilliam said to the witnesses . Gilliam nodded at Nickerson and Muhammad , then said , \" I love you . \" He said one last thing : \" Allahu Akbar , \" Arabic for \" God is the greatest . \" Nickerson and Muhammad repeated the statement . Gilliam shifted back to the center of the table and closed his eyes . His chest heaved three or four times . His lips began to flutter . At 10 : 27 p.m. , Gilliam was pronounced dead , the 83rd man to be executed in Maryland history . For years , the Doerfler family declined to speak publicly about the slaying . Those who know the Doerflers say the family regarded the murder as a private matter . Both parents wrote to Gov. Parris N. Glendening to share their differing views on Gilliam 's fate , and they asked that the letters be kept confidential . Mrs. Doerfler wanted Gilliam 's life to be spared ; Mr. Doerfler did not . Gilliam became well - known in national anti-death penalty circles . Raised in the working - class Baltimore County neighborhood of Middle River , Gilliam had had only one conviction -- for robbery -- at the time of the murder . In the months before his death , Gilliam spoke from Baltimore 's Supermax prison by telephone to activists around the country . Gilliam and his attorney fought furiously to block the execution . They claimed in the last few days that one of Gilliam 's partners pulled the trigger that night 10 years ago , and that Gilliam did n't deserve to die . But the arguments were rebuffed every step of the way . At noon yesterday , Glendening denied a plea for mercy , calling the murder \" particularly brutal [ and ] heinous . \" Five hours later , the U.S. Supreme Court turned down a final appeal . Minister Louis Farrakhan and Baltimore Cardinal William H. Keeler , who opposes the death penalty , sent letters urging Glendening to grant clemency to Gilliam , who belonged to Farrakhan 's Nation of Islam . At 5 p.m. , Gilliam was told that his appeals had been denied . A prison spokesman said Gilliam took the news calmly . \" He 's fully prepared to die , \" said Leonard A. Sipes Jr. In the hours before his death , Gilliam stayed in a cell about 35 feet from the execution chamber , where he was visited by his father , his mother , his grandfather , a Roman Catholic priest and two Islamic ministers . Gilliam refused his last supper , a choice between roast beef and fried chicken . \" He felt pensive , \" Sipes said . \" He knew he was going to be executed , and he wanted to spend the time with his family and his spiritual advisers . \" Gilliam spent much of the day on the phone . \" He 's been speaking with attorneys , religious leaders and his family , \" Sipes said early in the evening . \" He fully recognizes that he will be executed . He seems to be very much at peace with what 's coming . \" Death penalty protest Outside the prison , more than 200 death penalty opponents lined East Madison Street , shouting , \" One , two , three , four , stop the killing of the poor . \" They carried signs that read \" Stop State Killing , \" \" Death Penalty Equals Murder \" and \" Stop Glendening Before He Kills Again . \" \" I have to do my little part to say no , \" said protester John Furst of Parkville . \" There 's a general level of ignorance in the population , and executions are going to continue to happen , unfortunately . But I 'm not going to just sit at home and do nothing . \" Lorig Charkordian , a coordinator of the Maryland Coalition Against State Executions , a Baltimore group , said she was troubled by Gilliam 's execution because of questions about who pulled the trigger . \" One of the problems with the death penalty is that it sometimes puts to death innocent people , \" Charkordian said . \" This is one of those cases that makes you wonder . \" Speaking to reporters outside the penitentiary less than a half - hour after the execution , Gilliam 's attorney called the governor \" a coward . \" \" The whole state saw what he did , \" Nickerson said . \" He makes the statement that he believes that my client is a cold - blooded killer . Well , my client never got his day in court as to whether or not he was eligible for the death penalty . But there 's one thing that we did establish tonight , and that is that Governor Glendening is the coldest , bloodiest killer that we have ever encountered . \" Thomas Forsythe of Highlandtown was the only demonstrator outside the penitentiary to visibly support the execution . \" Somebody has to stand up for this lady , \" said Forsythe , a house painter . \" I think this guy and his two accomplices ought to all get the death penalty . There was no need for what they did . They could have taken the $ 3 and left . They did n't have to kill her . For that , they should die . \" Forsy the held a sign . \" We Must Mourn All Victims of Murder , \" it read . \" Ms. Doerfler had a life , too . \" Drugs and crime A month before the 1988 murder , Gilliam -- a longtime drug user -- secured a $ 2,600 school loan to become a barber , according to court records . Gilliam used the money to buy drugs . He and his co-defendants , brothers Delano \" Tony \" Drummond and Kelvin Drummond , started using cocaine daily , mixing it with PCP . When the trio ran up a $ 700 debt with a drug dealer , Kelvin Drummond stole a gray Chevrolet Nova and three snowsuits . They added a sawed - off shotgun to their inventory , and on Dec. 1 , 1988 , they hatched a plan for a robbery spree while using drugs at a friend 's house . Gilliam said he wanted to kill a woman . Kelvin Drummond thought he was joking . Their first stop on Dec. 2 was a Burger King in Harford County . Kelvin Drummond grabbed the shotgun and walked to the car window of a woman waiting in the drive - through . She sped off , escaping . The Doerfler slaying They then went to a nearby townhouse complex , where they robbed a woman of her pocketbook before heading south to Perry Hall . As the men drove down Joppa Road , Doerfler was having dinner with her father and sister . The youngest of nine children , Doerfler belonged to the Shrine of the Little Flower church in Northeast Baltimore and sang folk songs for Sunday Mass . After graduating from Mercy High School , Doerfler worked as a hardware store accountant and planned to attend Loyola College , just like her brothers and sisters . That December night , Doerfler 's father decided to order submarine sandwiches . They sat on the living room floor , watched television and ate . At 7 p.m. , Doerfler said she was going to rent a movie and drive to her sister 's house , 25 minutes away . When she pulled up in her blue Nissan , Tony Drummond and Gilliam forced their way into her car . Drive , they told her . Give us your money . She said she had none , just $ 3 and an ATM card . They looked for a bank and then told her to turn down Gum Spring Road , a dead - end lovers ' lane in Rossville . They pulled her keys kept on a Donald Duck ring from the ignition . Kelvin Drummond testified that he saw Gilliam standing at the side of Doerfler 's car . She was in the driver 's seat and Gilliam was talking to her , one hand on the shotgun , the other resting on the car . Kelvin Drummond said he suddenly heard a loud boom and saw the flash of the shotgun . \" She was , like , face - first into the steering wheel , \" he testified . Gilliam told his partners he killed Doerfler because he did n't want any witnesses . After the murder , the trio went to Golden Ring Mall , where they had dinner with their girlfriends at the Italian Delight restaurant . Two days later , Gilliam was arrested after robbing a convenience store . He confessed to the murder and told police that it was an accident . It was the first of several confessions . His attorney said in court that he shot Doerfler during a drug-induced daze -- an argument that Baltimore Circuit Judge John F. Fader II rejected . \" I do n't think that that is a proposition that society can abide by , \" he said during Gilliam 's sentencing hearing on Oct. 31 , 1989 . An apology Before he was sentenced , Gilliam apologized to the Doerfler family . \" I 'm sorry , and I could n't imagine how you feel toward me , and I do n't know if you forgive me or not . But I am truly sorry . \" He then turned to the judge . \" Your Honor , I know that I have to be punished for this and I am ready to pay for it , \" Gilliam said , \" but I just ask you not to give me the death penalty . \" Pub Date : 11/17/98","annotations":[{"text":"kidnapping Christine J.

That 's why there would be a need for new groups to have albums . Even you would probably not appreciate Jane 's Addiction if we showed up in your town and we only played 70 minutes of new material . If we did n't play any oldies , you 'd probably be bummed out . People want something that they 're familiar with . Something that they love . They fell in love . That 's what they want . So you 're not interested in the old album cycle ? I am not , but I tell you what , do n't count it out , because the business might dictate that something like that occurs someday in the future . Just out of , I guess , contractual obligations , you might say . I ca n't really speak too much more about that . ( laughs ) ( laughs ) Okay , but did the original goal of the recording process work of getting your creativity flowing together in a studio ? Yes , exactly . But not for the purposes of writing a record . It was just for the purpose of : We 're going out , there are all these great new tools for us to distribute our music , and let 's come up with something new so we can perform one new song in the set . I think that would be really fun . I 'm just looking at it purely as an artist , not as any kind of signed artist , or from the recording industry perspective , I 'm looking at it purely as a troubadour . At the same time , you just released this massive physical box set for collectors . Do you feel you have to maintain that relationship with this vast amount of new media and the people who want everyone on vinyl , on plastic , etc .? That is true , but let me tell you , that box set was supposed to be released two years ago . It just took so long . We cut that deal on the box set when we were still together on the last record , and it took that long to get it coordinated and gathered and all those other things and it was just kind of a happenstance that we were together at this time . When Rhino saw that we were together they thought , ' Let 's just really work day and night and get the thing out . ' Jane 's Addiction perform at PNC Bank Arts Center on June 6 .

Some concern is definitely understandable , especially since certain infections are widespread and potentially dangerous , such as COVID - 19 and the flu . Fortunately , you may already be immune to a number of other contagious diseases . And thanks to a successful vaccination program , some illnesses , like rubella ( German measles ) , are now rare in the United States . You can also take comfort in the fact that most babies are n't harmed if their mother develops an infection during pregnancy . But some infections can be transmitted to babies through the placenta or during birth . When that happens , it may have serious consequences . What 's more , some infections can make you sicker if you get them when you 're pregnant , or they may lead to complications like preterm labor . Infections and pregnancy : Why you 're more at risk during pregnancy When you 're pregnant , your immune system works a bit differently than it normally does . Your hormone levels change considerably , as well . These factors make you more susceptible to some infections . You 're more likely to be infected with listeria , a foodborne illness , for example . Physical changes brought on by pregnancy can also raise your risk for certain infections . For instance , your odds of a kidney infection are higher , partly because of the pressure your growing baby places on your urinary tract . But your chance of getting sick in the first place is n't the only thing influenced by pregnancy . It can also affect how sick you may become . Pregnant women are more likely to get seriously ill with certain infections , including herpes simplex virus and the flu . In 2009 for example , pregnant women represented 5 percent of deaths from the flu , even though they only made up 1 percent of the population . Some infections present a greater risk to your baby , while others put you in more danger \u2013 and certain infections can be equally hazardous for both of you . Because of this , it 's important that you understand a few basics about common contagious diseases . What infections are common during pregnancy ? Here 's a list of some of the infections that can affect a pregnancy : Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) is an infection of the vagina that can cause itching and discharge . Though it 's not transmitted by having sex , you 're more likely to develop BV if you 're sexually active . During pregnancy , the infection can raise your baby 's chances of premature birth and low birthweight . Fortunately , BV is easily treated with antibiotics . Chickenpox is caused by the varicella- zoster virus ( VZV ) and was a common childhood illness in the United States until 1995 , when a vaccine became widely available . Its hallmark is an itchy , blistery rash , though fever and fatigue are also typical symptoms . Coming down with chickenpox when you 're pregnant can cause serious complications for both you and your baby , including pneumonia , birth defects , and low birthweight . The best way to prevent the disease is through vaccination prior to pregnancy , because you cannot receive the shot while you 're pregnant . So , be sure to avoid anyone you know that has chickenpox and let your healthcare provider know right away if you 're exposed . Chikungunya is a virus transmitted via an infected mosquito . Though there are occasional U.S. outbreaks , it is exceedingly rare here , with just 29 cases reported to the CDC in 2020 . Fever and joint pain are common symptoms , and recovery usually takes within seven days . Contracting chikungunya can lead to preterm labor , a lack of amniotic fluid in your placenta , and the death of the fetus . There is no vaccine or cure , though you can treat symptoms and lower your risk by guarding against mosquito bites in affected areas of the globe . Chlamydia during pregnancy is associated with leaking amniotic fluid , preterm labor , and low birthweight . Your baby can be infected during delivery , which may result in conjunctivitis ( pinkeye ) or pneumonia . There were about 1.8 million cases of the sexually transmitted disease reported to the CDC in 2019 , though the actual count is likely much higher . That 's probably because most people do n't have symptoms , which can include discharge , pain , bleeding , and burning . Chlamydia is treated with antibiotics and may be prevented by using a condom every time you have sex . COVID - 19 infection carries serious risks for pregnant and recently pregnant women , especially if you have other health conditions . Premature birth is one potential complication , and you 're at higher risk for having a stillbirth . You 're also more likely than non-pregnant women to become seriously ill and to need hospitalization , intensive care , or a ventilator . Your chances of dying are increased , as well . Being vaccinated is by far the best way of preventing COVID - 19 . The shot can be taken while you 're pregnant \u2013 it will not give you or your baby the coronavirus . Speak with your provider if you have n't received your vaccine already , if you 've come in contact with an infected person , or if you have COVID - 19 symptoms . Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) passes from one person to another via bodily fluids such as blood , saliva , or urine . It affects more than half of U.S. adults by age 40 and sticks around for life , though most people will never develop symptoms or even know they have the disease . Infected pregnant women can pass CMV to their babies , who are usually do n't have symptoms , but may develop problems with their brain , lungs , liver , or spleen . Hearing loss can occur up to 2 years later . The risk of growth problems and stillbirth is increased as well . If your provider suspects CMV , a blood test can detect the virus in adults , while a urine or saliva test is preferred for infants . Treatment is not yet recommended during pregnancy , but your baby may require treatment after birth . Dengue fever is , like chikungunya , transmitted by infected mosquitos and rare in the U.S. When Americans do develop the illness , it 's almost always because they 've traveled to high - risk areas . Symptoms include fever , rash , and pain . Dengue is potentially life - threatening if you become severely ill . If a pregnant person contracts the disease , it may cause low birthweight , premature delivery , or even death of the fetus . If you 're concerned about the possibility of dengue , speak with your healthcare provider before heading abroad . Fifth disease ( parvovirus B19 ) is a common , mild childhood illness that causes fever and rash and usually clears up between one and three weeks . It typically is n't an issue during pregnancy , though in rare cases , the mother may miscarry or her baby may develop anemia . While there is no treatment for fifth disease , avoiding sick people and washing your hands thoroughly and often can help keep you from getting sick . Your provider may want you to be tested if you 're exposed ; many pregnant women are already immune to parvovirus B19 . Flu can be extraordinarily harmful for both you and your baby if you 're infected while pregnant . You may end up with pneumonia , or deliver prematurely . If you have persistently high fevers early in the pregnancy , your baby may develop birth defects , as well , including some that affect the brain and spinal cord . So , contact your provider right away if you have fever , chills , a cough , a sore throat , or any other common signs . And keep in mind \u2014 year in and year out , the best way of preventing the illness is receiving your annual flu shot , which is recommended during pregnancy . Gonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics once the sexually transmitted disease is identified by a provider ; common symptoms include vaginal discharge and burning during urination . When left untreated , however , gonorrhea can lead to miscarriage , preterm delivery , and low birthweight . It may cause your water to break early , or for the fluid to become infected . Your newborn can also be infected at birth , and there 's a small chance they 'll develop pinkeye . Group B strep ( GBS ) is a kind of bacteria that lives in your digestive and reproductive systems . It affects about one - quarter of pregnant women , and you will be tested for it around week 37 of your pregnancy . If you 're positive and your GBS is not treated with antibiotics during labor , there is a small chance you could pass it to your baby at that point . Babies with a GBS infection may develop pneumonia , sepsis , or meningitis , which can cause additional health issues down the line . In a worst - case scenario , an infected baby can die . Pregnant people may develop complications , too , including a uterine infection . Testing and antibiotics are the best prevention methods for GBS . Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) affects more than 850,000 people in the U.S. , according to the CDC . A serious liver infection transmitted via blood , semen , and other bodily fluids , HBV can be short - or long - term , and may lead to life - threatening conditions such as cirrhosis or liver cancer . If you 're pregnant and have HBV , there is a 10 % to 20 % chance you will pass it to your baby during labor and birth . With no treatment , your baby can develop a chronic infection and severe liver problems . The best method of preventing HBV is through vaccination , which can be done during pregnancy , and immunization is recommended for all infants Herpes , or genital herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) infection , is a sexually transmitted infection that 's dangerous if it 's passed to your baby in the womb or during delivery . Sores , blindness , organ damage , and a serious brain disorder called herpes encephalitis can result . Lower your chance of contracting herpes by having safe sex . If you have a history of genital HSV , your provider will prescribe you medication in the last month of pregnancy to reduce outbreaks . You should be especially aware of skin-to - skin contact when you have mouth sores . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) can be passed to your baby if you 're infected . Transmission may happen through the placenta during pregnancy , via vaginal fluids during birth , or by means of breastmilk after birth . That said , treatment has come a long way since AIDS deaths peaked in the mid-1990s . Now , with the right medications and precautions , people with HIV live nearly as long as people without HIV . What 's more , fetal infection can almost always be prevented with medications . If you know you have HIV and are pregnant or trying to conceive , it 's critical that you speak with your provider about treatment . Listeriosis can be contracted by eating food contaminated by the bacteria L. monocytogenes \u2013 usually ready - to - eat poultry , meats , seafood , or dairy . Sometimes , it comes from eating produce grown in contaminated soil . The disease kills about 260 Americans each year , and pregnant people \u2013\u2013 are much more susceptible than others . Miscarriage , preterm labor , and stillbirth can result . If you pass listeriosis to your baby , it can cause infections , serious lifelong medical issues , and death . Reach out to your provider immediately if you suspect you have the illness , but know that symptoms , including fever , muscle aches , and fatigue , may not show for up to two months . To prevent listeriosis , refrigerate all perishable foods and leftovers , and throw away anything that 's been left on the counter for more than two hours . Rubella ( German measles ) is a viral infection . It may cause flu-like symptoms in adults , and life - threatening health issues for your baby if you become sick during pregnancy . Miscarriage , stillbirth , developmental delays , heart defects , and cataracts are just a few possible complications . Cases of rubella are extremely rare in the U.S. , with only 15 babies reported born with it from 2005 - 2018 , according to the CDC . That 's because the vast majority of Americans have had the measles , mumps , and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine \u2013 a safe , effective two - dose shot commonly given during infancy and young childhood . Still , your provider will make sure you 're up - to-date . Sexually transmitted infections ( STIs or STDs ) are diseases you can contract by having vaginal , oral , or anal sex with someone who is infected . They lead to a range of mild - to - severe medical problems for both pregnant people and their fetuses . Testing and treatment is key for averting these issues , though limiting your number of partners or using condoms can reduce your risk overall . Common STIs include : - Chlamydia - Genital herpes - Gonorrhea - Hepatitis B - Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) - Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) - Syphilis While some other illnesses can be transmitted by having sex , they 're more commonly spread in other ways . These include cytomegalovirus and Zika . Syphilis can lead to miscarriage , premature birth , umbilical cord problems , and stillbirth . If your baby is born with syphilis , they may die within a few days or develop severe health problems that will be with them for life . Awareness is especially important for pregnant women because cases of the sexually transmitted disease have skyrocketed in recent years , both in parents and newborns . A reported 1,870 babies were born with syphilis in 2019 , up from just 358 in 2011 . Though pregnant people are routinely screened for the infection , you should report symptoms to your provider right away . The first signs often include genital , anal , or oral sores , while later signs may include body rash and flu-like symptoms . Syphilis is treated with penicillin . Toxoplasmosis comes from contaminated cat litter or feces , though it can also be present in tainted soil or meat . Caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii , the disease is typically mild for adults . However , if it 's passed to the fetus , toxoplasmosis can lead to poor growth , premature delivery , miscarriage , and stillbirth . Infants may have eye issues or brain damage present at birth , though more often , problems do n't show up until years later . If you 're trying to conceive or are already pregnant and have a cat , ask someone else to change the litter each day . If the chore is left up to you , make sure you wear gloves , and wash your hands when you 're finished . Trichomoniasis also called tric , is a very common , very curable sexually transmitted infection . It causes symptoms in about one - third of infected people \u2013 typically itchy genitals , discharge , and burning when you pee . If you 're pregnant , the risk of early delivery and low birth weight increase . Let your provider know if you see signs of tric ; you 'll be given medication if you 're diagnosed . Urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) are typically caused by bacteria that travel up through your urethra . Most UTIs occur in your bladder ( cystitis ) , though some happen in your kidneys ( pyelonephritis ) , and you 're particularly prone to them during pregnancy . Bladder infections often lead to pain and burning when you pee , as well as a constant urge to use the bathroom . Kidney infections can cause fever , chills , vomiting , and pain in your lower back or sides . Tell your provider if you have any symptoms , but especially if you suspect your kidneys are affected , since it can have life- threatening consequences for both you and your baby . Providers treat UTIs with oral antibiotics over the course of a few days . Lower your risk of getting one by hydrating , not holding it when you have to pee , wiping from front to back after using the toilet , and keeping your genital area clean . Yeast infection during pregnancy is very common , thanks to changes in your hormones . The good news is , beyond an annoying itch and thick , white vaginal discharge , it wo n't pose much danger to you or your baby . Report symptoms anyway , so you can get treatment and just in case you may have a more serious problem . If you 're diagnosed , know that yeast infection pregnancy treatment differs slightly from the usual treatment in one big way : You wo n't be given an oral antifungal like fluconazole . Instead , you 'll receive a vaginal medicine , such as a tablet , suppository , or cream . Clotrimazole , miconazole , and terconazole are popular options . Zika virus is another illness mostly spread by mosquitos , though it can also be transmitted sexually . There is no vaccine , treatment , or cure . It 's very dangerous for pregnant people , linked to miscarriage , stillbirth , and birth defects like microcephaly , a condition in which a baby 's head is much smaller than it should be . Though there have been just a handful of U.S. Zika infections in recent years , 2016 saw a large outbreak . More than 5,000 cases were reported in the states and over 36,000 cases were found in U.S. territories \u2013 the vast majority in Puerto Rico . Pregnant people and those trying to conceive should avoid travel to places with Zika outbreaks . If you must travel , take precautions to prevent mosquito bites . How can I protect myself from infections during pregnancy ? You ca n't completely avoid all sources of infection while you 're pregnant . But you can take certain steps to make it less likely that you 'll get sick , and to reduce the risk of serious problems for you or your baby if you do get an infection . Most importantly , getting prenatal care is crucial . For example , simple blood tests can tell you whether you 're immune to certain infections , such as chickenpox and rubella . You 'll also be tested for infections you may not know you have , including UTIs , group B strep , hepatitis B , and HIV . If you think you 've been exposed to a serious infection or you become ill , getting care in a timely manner can often help prevent complications . You can do a number of things on your own , too . Basic measures will reduce your risk of getting sick : - Wash your hands . Do it thoroughly and often . If soap and water are not available , use an alcohol - based hand sanitizer and rub your hands together until they 're dry . - Avoid sharing personal items and toiletries .

Some concern is definitely understandable , especially since certain infections are widespread and potentially dangerous , such as COVID - 19 and the flu . Fortunately , you may already be immune to a number of other contagious diseases . And thanks to a successful vaccination program , some illnesses , like rubella ( German measles ) , are now rare in the United States . You can also take comfort in the fact that most babies are n't harmed if their mother develops an infection during pregnancy . But some infections can be transmitted to babies through the placenta or during birth . When that happens , it may have serious consequences . What 's more , some infections can make you sicker if you get them when you 're pregnant , or they may lead to complications like preterm labor . Infections and pregnancy : Why you 're more at risk during pregnancy When you 're pregnant , your immune system works a bit differently than it normally does . Your hormone levels change considerably , as well . These factors make you more susceptible to some infections . You 're more likely to be infected with listeria , a foodborne illness , for example . Physical changes brought on by pregnancy can also raise your risk for certain infections . For instance , your odds of a kidney infection are higher , partly because of the pressure your growing baby places on your urinary tract . But your chance of getting sick in the first place is n't the only thing influenced by pregnancy . It can also affect how sick you may become . Pregnant women are more likely to get seriously ill with certain infections , including herpes simplex virus and the flu . In 2009 for example , pregnant women represented 5 percent of deaths from the flu , even though they only made up 1 percent of the population . Some infections present a greater risk to your baby , while others put you in more danger \u2013 and certain infections can be equally hazardous for both of you . Because of this , it 's important that you understand a few basics about common contagious diseases . What infections are common during pregnancy ? Here 's a list of some of the infections that can affect a pregnancy : Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) is an infection of the vagina that can cause itching and discharge . Though it 's not transmitted by having sex , you 're more likely to develop BV if you 're sexually active . During pregnancy , the infection can raise your baby 's chances of premature birth and low birthweight . Fortunately , BV is easily treated with antibiotics . Chickenpox is caused by the varicella- zoster virus ( VZV ) and was a common childhood illness in the United States until 1995 , when a vaccine became widely available . Its hallmark is an itchy , blistery rash , though fever and fatigue are also typical symptoms . Coming down with chickenpox when you 're pregnant can cause serious complications for both you and your baby , including pneumonia , birth defects , and low birthweight . The best way to prevent the disease is through vaccination prior to pregnancy , because you cannot receive the shot while you 're pregnant . So , be sure to avoid anyone you know that has chickenpox and let your healthcare provider know right away if you 're exposed . Chikungunya is a virus transmitted via an infected mosquito . Though there are occasional U.S. outbreaks , it is exceedingly rare here , with just 29 cases reported to the CDC in 2020 . Fever and joint pain are common symptoms , and recovery usually takes within seven days . Contracting chikungunya can lead to preterm labor , a lack of amniotic fluid in your placenta , and the death of the fetus . There is no vaccine or cure , though you can treat symptoms and lower your risk by guarding against mosquito bites in affected areas of the globe . Chlamydia during pregnancy is associated with leaking amniotic fluid , preterm labor , and low birthweight . Your baby can be infected during delivery , which may result in conjunctivitis ( pinkeye ) or pneumonia . There were about 1.8 million cases of the sexually transmitted disease reported to the CDC in 2019 , though the actual count is likely much higher . That 's probably because most people do n't have symptoms , which can include discharge , pain , bleeding , and burning . Chlamydia is treated with antibiotics and may be prevented by using a condom every time you have sex . COVID - 19 infection carries serious risks for pregnant and recently pregnant women , especially if you have other health conditions . Premature birth is one potential complication , and you 're at higher risk for having a stillbirth . You 're also more likely than non-pregnant women to become seriously ill and to need hospitalization , intensive care , or a ventilator . Your chances of dying are increased , as well . Being vaccinated is by far the best way of preventing COVID - 19 . The shot can be taken while you 're pregnant \u2013 it will not give you or your baby the coronavirus . Speak with your provider if you have n't received your vaccine already , if you 've come in contact with an infected person , or if you have COVID - 19 symptoms . Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) passes from one person to another via bodily fluids such as blood , saliva , or urine . It affects more than half of U.S. adults by age 40 and sticks around for life , though most people will never develop symptoms or even know they have the disease . Infected pregnant women can pass CMV to their babies , who are usually do n't have symptoms , but may develop problems with their brain , lungs , liver , or spleen . Hearing loss can occur up to 2 years later . The risk of growth problems and stillbirth is increased as well . If your provider suspects CMV , a blood test can detect the virus in adults , while a urine or saliva test is preferred for infants . Treatment is not yet recommended during pregnancy , but your baby may require treatment after birth . Dengue fever is , like chikungunya , transmitted by infected mosquitos and rare in the U.S. When Americans do develop the illness , it 's almost always because they 've traveled to high - risk areas . Symptoms include fever , rash , and pain . Dengue is potentially life - threatening if you become severely ill . If a pregnant person contracts the disease , it may cause low birthweight , premature delivery , or even death of the fetus . If you 're concerned about the possibility of dengue , speak with your healthcare provider before heading abroad . Fifth disease ( parvovirus B19 ) is a common , mild childhood illness that causes fever and rash and usually clears up between one and three weeks . It typically is n't an issue during pregnancy , though in rare cases , the mother may miscarry or her baby may develop anemia . While there is no treatment for fifth disease , avoiding sick people and washing your hands thoroughly and often can help keep you from getting sick . Your provider may want you to be tested if you 're exposed ; many pregnant women are already immune to parvovirus B19 . Flu can be extraordinarily harmful for both you and your baby if you 're infected while pregnant . You may end up with pneumonia , or deliver prematurely . If you have persistently high fevers early in the pregnancy , your baby may develop birth defects , as well , including some that affect the brain and spinal cord . So , contact your provider right away if you have fever , chills , a cough , a sore throat , or any other common signs . And keep in mind \u2014 year in and year out , the best way of preventing the illness is receiving your annual flu shot , which is recommended during pregnancy . Gonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics once the sexually transmitted disease is identified by a provider ; common symptoms include vaginal discharge and burning during urination . When left untreated , however , gonorrhea can lead to miscarriage , preterm delivery , and low birthweight . It may cause your water to break early , or for the fluid to become infected . Your newborn can also be infected at birth , and there 's a small chance they 'll develop pinkeye . Group B strep ( GBS ) is a kind of bacteria that lives in your digestive and reproductive systems . It affects about one - quarter of pregnant women , and you will be tested for it around week 37 of your pregnancy . If you 're positive and your GBS is not treated with antibiotics during labor , there is a small chance you could pass it to your baby at that point . Babies with a GBS infection may develop pneumonia , sepsis , or meningitis , which can cause additional health issues down the line . In a worst - case scenario , an infected baby can die . Pregnant people may develop complications , too , including a uterine infection . Testing and antibiotics are the best prevention methods for GBS . Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) affects more than 850,000 people in the U.S. , according to the CDC . A serious liver infection transmitted via blood , semen , and other bodily fluids , HBV can be short - or long - term , and may lead to life - threatening conditions such as cirrhosis or liver cancer . If you 're pregnant and have HBV , there is a 10 % to 20 % chance you will pass it to your baby during labor and birth . With no treatment , your baby can develop a chronic infection and severe liver problems . The best method of preventing HBV is through vaccination , which can be done during pregnancy , and immunization is recommended for all infants Herpes , or genital herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) infection , is a sexually transmitted infection that 's dangerous if it 's passed to your baby in the womb or during delivery . Sores , blindness , organ damage , and a serious brain disorder called herpes encephalitis can result . Lower your chance of contracting herpes by having safe sex . If you have a history of genital HSV , your provider will prescribe you medication in the last month of pregnancy to reduce outbreaks . You should be especially aware of skin-to - skin contact when you have mouth sores . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) can be passed to your baby if you 're infected . Transmission may happen through the placenta during pregnancy , via vaginal fluids during birth , or by means of breastmilk after birth . That said , treatment has come a long way since AIDS deaths peaked in the mid-1990s . Now , with the right medications and precautions , people with HIV live nearly as long as people without HIV . What 's more , fetal infection can almost always be prevented with medications . If you know you have HIV and are pregnant or trying to conceive , it 's critical that you speak with your provider about treatment . Listeriosis can be contracted by eating food contaminated by the bacteria L. monocytogenes \u2013 usually ready - to - eat poultry , meats , seafood , or dairy . Sometimes , it comes from eating produce grown in contaminated soil . The disease kills about 260 Americans each year , and pregnant people \u2013\u2013 are much more susceptible than others . Miscarriage , preterm labor , and stillbirth can result . If you pass listeriosis to your baby , it can cause infections , serious lifelong medical issues , and death . Reach out to your provider immediately if you suspect you have the illness , but know that symptoms , including fever , muscle aches , and fatigue , may not show for up to two months . To prevent listeriosis , refrigerate all perishable foods and leftovers , and throw away anything that 's been left on the counter for more than two hours . Rubella ( German measles ) is a viral infection . It may cause flu-like symptoms in adults , and life - threatening health issues for your baby if you become sick during pregnancy . Miscarriage , stillbirth , developmental delays , heart defects , and cataracts are just a few possible complications . Cases of rubella are extremely rare in the U.S. , with only 15 babies reported born with it from 2005 - 2018 , according to the CDC . That 's because the vast majority of Americans have had the measles , mumps , and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine \u2013 a safe , effective two - dose shot commonly given during infancy and young childhood . Still , your provider will make sure you 're up - to-date . Sexually transmitted infections ( STIs or STDs ) are diseases you can contract by having vaginal , oral , or anal sex with someone who is infected . They lead to a range of mild - to - severe medical problems for both pregnant people and their fetuses . Testing and treatment is key for averting these issues , though limiting your number of partners or using condoms can reduce your risk overall . Common STIs include : - Chlamydia - Genital herpes - Gonorrhea - Hepatitis B - Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) - Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) - Syphilis While some other illnesses can be transmitted by having sex , they 're more commonly spread in other ways . These include cytomegalovirus and Zika . Syphilis can lead to miscarriage , premature birth , umbilical cord problems , and stillbirth . If your baby is born with syphilis , they may die within a few days or develop severe health problems that will be with them for life . Awareness is especially important for pregnant women because cases of the sexually transmitted disease have skyrocketed in recent years , both in parents and newborns . A reported 1,870 babies were born with syphilis in 2019 , up from just 358 in 2011 . Though pregnant people are routinely screened for the infection , you should report symptoms to your provider right away . The first signs often include genital , anal , or oral sores , while later signs may include body rash and flu-like symptoms . Syphilis is treated with penicillin . Toxoplasmosis comes from contaminated cat litter or feces , though it can also be present in tainted soil or meat . Caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii , the disease is typically mild for adults . However , if it 's passed to the fetus , toxoplasmosis can lead to poor growth , premature delivery , miscarriage , and stillbirth . Infants may have eye issues or brain damage present at birth , though more often , problems do n't show up until years later . If you 're trying to conceive or are already pregnant and have a cat , ask someone else to change the litter each day . If the chore is left up to you , make sure you wear gloves , and wash your hands when you 're finished . Trichomoniasis also called tric , is a very common , very curable sexually transmitted infection . It causes symptoms in about one - third of infected people \u2013 typically itchy genitals , discharge , and burning when you pee . If you 're pregnant , the risk of early delivery and low birth weight increase . Let your provider know if you see signs of tric ; you 'll be given medication if you 're diagnosed . Urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) are typically caused by bacteria that travel up through your urethra . Most UTIs occur in your bladder ( cystitis ) , though some happen in your kidneys ( pyelonephritis ) , and you 're particularly prone to them during pregnancy . Bladder infections often lead to pain and burning when you pee , as well as a constant urge to use the bathroom . Kidney infections can cause fever , chills , vomiting , and pain in your lower back or sides . Tell your provider if you have any symptoms , but especially if you suspect your kidneys are affected , since it can have life- threatening consequences for both you and your baby . Providers treat UTIs with oral antibiotics over the course of a few days . Lower your risk of getting one by hydrating , not holding it when you have to pee , wiping from front to back after using the toilet , and keeping your genital area clean . Yeast infection during pregnancy is very common , thanks to changes in your hormones . The good news is , beyond an annoying itch and thick , white vaginal discharge , it wo n't pose much danger to you or your baby . Report symptoms anyway , so you can get treatment and just in case you may have a more serious problem . If you 're diagnosed , know that yeast infection pregnancy treatment differs slightly from the usual treatment in one big way : You wo n't be given an oral antifungal like fluconazole . Instead , you 'll receive a vaginal medicine , such as a tablet , suppository , or cream . Clotrimazole , miconazole , and terconazole are popular options . Zika virus is another illness mostly spread by mosquitos , though it can also be transmitted sexually . There is no vaccine , treatment , or cure . It 's very dangerous for pregnant people , linked to miscarriage , stillbirth , and birth defects like microcephaly , a condition in which a baby 's head is much smaller than it should be . Though there have been just a handful of U.S. Zika infections in recent years , 2016 saw a large outbreak . More than 5,000 cases were reported in the states and over 36,000 cases were found in U.S. territories \u2013 the vast majority in Puerto Rico . Pregnant people and those trying to conceive should avoid travel to places with Zika outbreaks . If you must travel , take precautions to prevent mosquito bites . How can I protect myself from infections during pregnancy ? You ca n't completely avoid all sources of infection while you 're pregnant . But you can take certain steps to make it less likely that you 'll get sick , and to reduce the risk of serious problems for you or your baby if you do get an infection . Most importantly , getting prenatal care is crucial . For example , simple blood tests can tell you whether you 're immune to certain infections , such as chickenpox and rubella . You 'll also be tested for infections you may not know you have , including UTIs , group B strep , hepatitis B , and HIV . If you think you 've been exposed to a serious infection or you become ill , getting care in a timely manner can often help prevent complications . You can do a number of things on your own , too . Basic measures will reduce your risk of getting sick : - Wash your hands . Do it thoroughly and often . If soap and water are not available , use an alcohol - based hand sanitizer and rub your hands together until they 're dry . - Avoid sharing personal items and toiletries . These include drinking glasses , utensils , and toothbrushes . - Be aware of how you handle animals . Wash up after touching pet food or poop . Ask someone else to change your cat litter . Stay away from rodents , lizards , and turtles in general . If you keep them as pets , have someone look after them while you 're pregnant . - Practice safe sex . Limit your number of partners and make sure to use condoms . - Safeguard your food . Wash fruits and vegetables . Make sure that your meat , fish , and eggs are well cooked , and your work surfaces are kept clean . Do n't eat certain foods that may make you ill , including raw cheeses and rare meat . - Stay away from anyone with a contagious disease . Of course , it 's easier said than done if you work together or share a living space , but do the best you can . Always follow your local COVID - 19 guidelines , too . - Travel smart . Speak with a healthcare provider before you head overseas . Skip places where infections could endanger you or your baby . If you must go , take the appropriate precautions . Protect yourself from mosquitos , wherever you 're . - Get vaccinated . If you 're pregnant or trying to get pregnant , check to see that you 're current on your immunizations . You can receive certain shots during pregnancy , but not all of them . Finally , if you 're sick or think you 've been exposed to a contagious disease , let your caregiver know right away .

Nine bodies wrapped in red-and - black Albanian national flags were lying in front of a makeshift stage . Only fifty yards away , there were nine freshly dug graves . The funeral was originally scheduled for one o'clock in the afternoon , but commenced in the early evening hours because police had erected barricades on all roads to Drenica . They tried to prevent people coming from all over Kosovo to attend the funeral . Rows of cars and buses at the Komorani checkpoint near Glogovac stretched for miles . Ten members of the Ahmeti family from Likosani and their neighbors had a good reason to be at the funeral : they had been dead for three days already . Their bodies were taken that morning from the Pristina morgue but the truck carrying them reached the village only late that afternoon , as the driver was forced to take almost impassable side - roads the police could n't barricade . When the bodies finally arrived , it turned out that the death toll was bigger than expected so three more graves had to be dug . A total of 24 persons , mainly peasants from Likosani and the nearby village Chirez , were buried that day . The four policemen and an ethnic Albanian buried the day before bring the total death toll of the bloody weekend in Drenica to 29 . The obviously exaggerated reports by both the Serb and the Albanian side , as well as controversial testimonies of eyewitnesses still in a state of shock , made it no easier to establish what exactly happened between Friday , when the clashes broke out , and Sunday , when police finally left Drenica . It is certain , however , that Kosovo has not seen so much bloodshed since 28 March 1989 , when 70 people were killed in riots following a government decision that effectively took away Kosovo 's autonomy . A protest rally by ethnic Albanians in Pristina following the Drenica bloodshed ended with a brutal police intervention in which 30 protesters were wounded and one was killed , allegedly with a shot in the mouth . The situation in the province is tense , there is no telling what could happen next . Ethnic Albanian political leaders , including the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo leader Ibrahim Rugova and head of the Parliamentary party Adem Demaci , have girded together and convened for days in an effort to take a common stand on the massacre . At the time this edition of Vreme was being put in circulation , it was still too early to predict how they might react to the aggravated situation in the province . Meanwhile , the Serbian media and the vast majority of both government and opposition leaders took turns in congratulating the police with some exaltation for \u201c dealing a decisive blow to the terrorists \u201d . Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic went out of his way to express his personal condolence to the families of the killed policemen , and duly praised the police for their \u201c courage , patriotism and commitment \u201d . The Commander of the special police troops , Miroslav Mijanovic , called the four killed policemen \u201c the knights of Kosovo slued by ethnic Albanian bandits \u201d , while the ethnic Albanians said the friends and relatives they buried in Likosane were \u201c martyrs and heroes , the innocent victims of Serbian terror \u201d . It appears that neither side is prepared to treat one another as human beings . The police version : The Serbian interior ministry released a statement to the effect that it all started on Saturday around half past noon , when a police unit allegedly on a routine patrolling assignment was ambushed near Likosane . The car ran into a ditch , and the officers in trouble requested back up . Another police vehicle with four officers in it was sent to rescue them , but they too were ambushed several miles down the road . That is when two officers were killed from automatic weapons , while another two were seriously wounded and taken to hospital . Around two o'clock in the afternoon , another back up unit was sent and \u201c engaged in battle against the terrorists , in full accord with the powers vested in the police \u201d . Clashes between the police and the self - styled Kosovo Liberation Army ( UCK ) , which claimed responsibility for the death of four Serbian policemen , went on all night and spilled into the nearby villages . By Sunday , when the fighting stopped , two more police officers were killed and another two were wounded , while the death toll on the other side rose to 15 . The Serbian interior ministry did n't bother to disclose the names of the killed \u201c terrorists \u201d nor the nine allegedly arrested , leaving that to the ethnic Albanian side . There are lots of facts indicating that the Interior Ministry statement is only partially true . There had been no routine patrol assignments in the central Kosovo region of Drenica and its border municipalities Glogovac , Mitrovica and Klina since last November , when the UCK effectively took control of the region . Several minor skirmishes occurred , and they all ended with police withdrawal . Since then , police going on business to Drenica have been backed up by helicopter and armored vehicles . It is therefore hard to imagine that the police unit ambushed on Saturday was on a routine mission . Most of the killed Albanians ( the death toll does not match police reports ) , were no terrorists . According to eyewitness reports from Drenica , clashes between police and the UCK broke out on Friday evening , a whole day prior to what the police said . According to eyewitnesses , the fighting broke out in Srbica , the largest village in the Drenica region , and not in Likosane . The fighting broke out when unidentified individuals drove by a primary school accommodating Serb refugees and fired at the building with automatic weapons . Police reacted instantly and started pursuing the assailants , who stopped their vehicle in a chicane near Likosani and opened fire at their pursuants . The police vehicle slid off the road into the ditch , and it seems that two police officers were killed in this shootout . The back up unit that consequently arrived could not make any progress at night . During the night and the following morning , both sides deployed reinforcements and prepared for battle . Full - scale clashes broke out when the police arrived with some 30 armored vehicles and two Gama assault choppers . The UCK fighters tried to repel the vastly superior enemy but had to withdraw and leave the inhabitants of Likosani and Chirez at the mercy of the police , who stormed into the villages and started searching the houses . It appears that someone fired at the police during the search , and that is when the massacre began . Brains in the grass : Those who somehow managed to reach Likosane and Chirez on Monday came across a sickening sight : in the bullet riddled houses lay the dead , surrounded by their family members in a deep state of shock . Four brothers of the Djelji family \u2013 Bechir , Nazmi , Bedri and Bekim were killed in their Chirez home . Muhamet Dzleja , 79 , his brother Naser and cousin Kadrid were apparently shot from close range , the photographs clearly showing gunpowder marks around the wounds . Dzemsir Nabihu and his pregnant wife Rukija had their heads blown off . Virtually all the victims were killed in their homes or just outside them . Some houses were hit by artillery , but reports that they had been torched and demolished fortunately turned out to be devoid of all truth . The worst fate befell the Ahmeti family of Likosani , the wealthiest in the village , as almost all its members were executed . Mirsije Ahmeti , 24 , who lost her father and three brothers , told Vreme that police stormed into their estate breaking through the gate with an armored vehicle at around four o'clock in the afternoon . \u201c My father shouted out that the door was open , but they shattered the windows and pointed their rifles at us . They told us to lie down on our fronts , put our hands behind our heads and locked us up in a small room . They took all the men out while we stayed locked until they left , \u201d Mirsije told Vreme 's reporter . When she and the other women got out , their men were nowhere to be seen . Traces of blood on the rocks near a bush led them to outside their estate , where the neighbors found bullet shells , dry blood on the ground , pieces of clothes , human bones and an entire human brain on a patch of grass . They sealed the area with a rope and let Vreme 's reporter take a look for himself . Ten dead members of the Ahmeti family between the age of 16 and 60 were delivered on Tuesday in the truck mentioned earlier . An individual who saw the bodies in the Pristina morgue said they looked \u201c pretty chewed up \u201d . \u201c They were alive when they left \u201d , Mirsije said in tears . Her cousin Dzevdet Ahmeti , 30 , who happened to be in Pristina over the weekend and fortunately avoided the fate of his relatives , said the police robbed their home of about 5,000 German marks ' worth of gold and foreign currency , ten kilos of meat and 200 eggs . They also took a satellite dish receiver and a car radio . \u201c I do n't understand these people \u201d , Dzevdet said with a strange calm in his voice . After they were done with the Ahmeti family , they moved into a neighboring house thinking it was abandoned . They were wrong , for 17 year old Nait N. ( the name has been changed for obvious reasons ) was hiding in the attic . \u201c I did n't see anything but I heard it all . I heard blows and screams outside the Ahmeti estate . Then I heard gun shots and the screams stopped \u201d , Nait said . He spent 27 hours in the attic , too afraid to move . The house he was hiding in was used by the police as a canteen in which they prepared food they took from the Ahmeti home . They ate , drank and sang all night . One climbed into the attic and peeped in , but he did n't see me . I was paralyzed with fear \u201d , Nait said . The Likosani villagers say that not a single member of the Ahmeti family was a terrorist . \u201c They were the only wealthy family in the village . They worked hard for their money , minded their own business and had good relations with everyone \u201d , one of the villagers said . Why were they killed then ?

Our boys went wild . No one in the village would have survived if it were n't for orders from Belgrade to stop . \u201d Say hello to Gelbard : The ethnic Albanians of Likosani and Chirez believe there would have been far more casualties if it were n't for the UCK , whose reputation seems to have remained unstained after the latest events . \u201c They would have killed us all had there been no one to defend us \u201d , a villager said , and then answered our \u201c naive \u201d request for information on the whereabouts of the UCK and whether they would be willing to talk . \u201c Who do you think the UCK are and where do you think they came from ? Look around you , everything you see is the UCK \u201d , he said . The efforts by the Serbian regime to label the Likosani and Chirez victims as terrorists who got what they asked for will probably fail . \u201c Anti-terrorism , the way its done in the ' civilized world ' , does n't mean that suspects have no rights and that they should be shot on sight . We also have a problem with terrorism , but we apprehend our terrorists and give them a fair trial \u201d , a western diplomat said . \u201c Milosevic will have to bear the consequences of this action , but the immediate problem is that the western allies ca n't back their words by decisive action at the moment .

The Drenica incident occurred only days after US diplomat Robert Gelbard sharply condemned the UCK as a terrorist organization .

Nine bodies wrapped in red-and - black Albanian national flags were lying in front of a makeshift stage . Only fifty yards away , there were nine freshly dug graves . The funeral was originally scheduled for one o'clock in the afternoon , but commenced in the early evening hours because police had erected barricades on all roads to Drenica . They tried to prevent people coming from all over Kosovo to attend the funeral . Rows of cars and buses at the Komorani checkpoint near Glogovac stretched for miles . Ten members of the Ahmeti family from Likosani and their neighbors had a good reason to be at the funeral : they had been dead for three days already . Their bodies were taken that morning from the Pristina morgue but the truck carrying them reached the village only late that afternoon , as the driver was forced to take almost impassable side - roads the police could n't barricade . When the bodies finally arrived , it turned out that the death toll was bigger than expected so three more graves had to be dug . A total of 24 persons , mainly peasants from Likosani and the nearby village Chirez , were buried that day . The four policemen and an ethnic Albanian buried the day before bring the total death toll of the bloody weekend in Drenica to 29 . The obviously exaggerated reports by both the Serb and the Albanian side , as well as controversial testimonies of eyewitnesses still in a state of shock , made it no easier to establish what exactly happened between Friday , when the clashes broke out , and Sunday , when police finally left Drenica . It is certain , however , that Kosovo has not seen so much bloodshed since 28 March 1989 , when 70 people were killed in riots following a government decision that effectively took away Kosovo 's autonomy . A protest rally by ethnic Albanians in Pristina following the Drenica bloodshed ended with a brutal police intervention in which 30 protesters were wounded and one was killed , allegedly with a shot in the mouth . The situation in the province is tense , there is no telling what could happen next . Ethnic Albanian political leaders , including the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo leader Ibrahim Rugova and head of the Parliamentary party Adem Demaci , have girded together and convened for days in an effort to take a common stand on the massacre . At the time this edition of Vreme was being put in circulation , it was still too early to predict how they might react to the aggravated situation in the province . Meanwhile , the Serbian media and the vast majority of both government and opposition leaders took turns in congratulating the police with some exaltation for \u201c dealing a decisive blow to the terrorists \u201d . Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic went out of his way to express his personal condolence to the families of the killed policemen , and duly praised the police for their \u201c courage , patriotism and commitment \u201d . The Commander of the special police troops , Miroslav Mijanovic , called the four killed policemen \u201c the knights of Kosovo slued by ethnic Albanian bandits \u201d , while the ethnic Albanians said the friends and relatives they buried in Likosane were \u201c martyrs and heroes , the innocent victims of Serbian terror \u201d . It appears that neither side is prepared to treat one another as human beings . The police version : The Serbian interior ministry released a statement to the effect that it all started on Saturday around half past noon , when a police unit allegedly on a routine patrolling assignment was ambushed near Likosane . The car ran into a ditch , and the officers in trouble requested back up . Another police vehicle with four officers in it was sent to rescue them , but they too were ambushed several miles down the road . That is when two officers were killed from automatic weapons , while another two were seriously wounded and taken to hospital . Around two o'clock in the afternoon , another back up unit was sent and \u201c engaged in battle against the terrorists , in full accord with the powers vested in the police \u201d . Clashes between the police and the self - styled Kosovo Liberation Army ( UCK ) , which claimed responsibility for the death of four Serbian policemen , went on all night and spilled into the nearby villages . By Sunday , when the fighting stopped , two more police officers were killed and another two were wounded , while the death toll on the other side rose to 15 . The Serbian interior ministry did n't bother to disclose the names of the killed \u201c terrorists \u201d nor the nine allegedly arrested , leaving that to the ethnic Albanian side . There are lots of facts indicating that the Interior Ministry statement is only partially true . There had been no routine patrol assignments in the central Kosovo region of Drenica and its border municipalities Glogovac , Mitrovica and Klina since last November , when the UCK effectively took control of the region . Several minor skirmishes occurred , and they all ended with police withdrawal . Since then , police going on business to Drenica have been backed up by helicopter and armored vehicles . It is therefore hard to imagine that the police unit ambushed on Saturday was on a routine mission . Most of the killed Albanians ( the death toll does not match police reports ) , were no terrorists . According to eyewitness reports from Drenica , clashes between police and the UCK broke out on Friday evening , a whole day prior to what the police said . According to eyewitnesses , the fighting broke out in Srbica , the largest village in the Drenica region , and not in Likosane . The fighting broke out when unidentified individuals drove by a primary school accommodating Serb refugees and fired at the building with automatic weapons . Police reacted instantly and started pursuing the assailants , who stopped their vehicle in a chicane near Likosani and opened fire at their pursuants . The police vehicle slid off the road into the ditch , and it seems that two police officers were killed in this shootout . The back up unit that consequently arrived could not make any progress at night . During the night and the following morning , both sides deployed reinforcements and prepared for battle . Full - scale clashes broke out when the police arrived with some 30 armored vehicles and two Gama assault choppers . The UCK fighters tried to repel the vastly superior enemy but had to withdraw and leave the inhabitants of Likosani and Chirez at the mercy of the police , who stormed into the villages and started searching the houses . It appears that someone fired at the police during the search , and that is when the massacre began . Brains in the grass : Those who somehow managed to reach Likosane and Chirez on Monday came across a sickening sight : in the bullet riddled houses lay the dead , surrounded by their family members in a deep state of shock . Four brothers of the Djelji family \u2013 Bechir , Nazmi , Bedri and Bekim were killed in their Chirez home . Muhamet Dzleja , 79 , his brother Naser and cousin Kadrid were apparently shot from close range , the photographs clearly showing gunpowder marks around the wounds . Dzemsir Nabihu and his pregnant wife Rukija had their heads blown off . Virtually all the victims were killed in their homes or just outside them . Some houses were hit by artillery , but reports that they had been torched and demolished fortunately turned out to be devoid of all truth . The worst fate befell the Ahmeti family of Likosani , the wealthiest in the village , as almost all its members were executed . Mirsije Ahmeti , 24 , who lost her father and three brothers , told Vreme that police stormed into their estate breaking through the gate with an armored vehicle at around four o'clock in the afternoon . \u201c My father shouted out that the door was open , but they shattered the windows and pointed their rifles at us . They told us to lie down on our fronts , put our hands behind our heads and locked us up in a small room . They took all the men out while we stayed locked until they left , \u201d Mirsije told Vreme 's reporter . When she and the other women got out , their men were nowhere to be seen . Traces of blood on the rocks near a bush led them to outside their estate , where the neighbors found bullet shells , dry blood on the ground , pieces of clothes , human bones and an entire human brain on a patch of grass . They sealed the area with a rope and let Vreme 's reporter take a look for himself . Ten dead members of the Ahmeti family between the age of 16 and 60 were delivered on Tuesday in the truck mentioned earlier . An individual who saw the bodies in the Pristina morgue said they looked \u201c pretty chewed up \u201d . \u201c They were alive when they left \u201d , Mirsije said in tears . Her cousin Dzevdet Ahmeti , 30 , who happened to be in Pristina over the weekend and fortunately avoided the fate of his relatives , said the police robbed their home of about 5,000 German marks ' worth of gold and foreign currency , ten kilos of meat and 200 eggs . They also took a satellite dish receiver and a car radio . \u201c I do n't understand these people \u201d , Dzevdet said with a strange calm in his voice . After they were done with the Ahmeti family , they moved into a neighboring house thinking it was abandoned . They were wrong , for 17 year old Nait N. ( the name has been changed for obvious reasons ) was hiding in the attic . \u201c I did n't see anything but I heard it all . I heard blows and screams outside the Ahmeti estate . Then I heard gun shots and the screams stopped \u201d , Nait said . He spent 27 hours in the attic , too afraid to move . The house he was hiding in was used by the police as a canteen in which they prepared food they took from the Ahmeti home . They ate , drank and sang all night . One climbed into the attic and peeped in , but he did n't see me . I was paralyzed with fear \u201d , Nait said . The Likosani villagers say that not a single member of the Ahmeti family was a terrorist . \u201c They were the only wealthy family in the village . They worked hard for their money , minded their own business and had good relations with everyone \u201d , one of the villagers said . Why were they killed then ? The villagers said the police saw someone run into the Ahmeti backyard , while a police source said the following : \u201c They shot at us from each and every house in the village . Our boys went wild . No one in the village would have survived if it were n't for orders from Belgrade to stop . \u201d Say hello to Gelbard : The ethnic Albanians of Likosani and Chirez believe there would have been far more casualties if it were n't for the UCK , whose reputation seems to have remained unstained after the latest events . \u201c They would have killed us all had there been no one to defend us \u201d , a villager said , and then answered our \u201c naive \u201d request for information on the whereabouts of the UCK and whether they would be willing to talk . \u201c Who do you think the UCK are and where do you think they came from ?

The Client Woolworths Limited is a major publicly listed trans - Tasman retail group , with more than 3,000 stores and 180,000 employees in New Zealand and Australia . Through its New Zealand business , Progressive Enterprises Limited , it is a significant player in the New Zealand grocery market . The Challenge A key business improvement focus for Woolworths over the past few years has been enhancing the integration of its own core IT systems with those of its Trade Partners , through Electronic Data Interchange ( EDI ) . It has also been deploying a web-based e-business portal called webforms . Webforms is a free online solution allowing Woolworths ' Trade Partners to receive Purchase Orders and then respond with purchase - order acknowledgments and electronic Invoices . The application has been introduced as an alternative to fax and email , allowing the company 's Trade Partners who may not be in a position to implement a full EDI process , to still access the benefits of electronic trading . In a bid to speed up Trade Partner uptake of these electronic trading options in New Zealand , Woolworths engaged B2BE , one of its Value - Added Network ( VAN ) providers with a New Zealand base , to undertake a 13 - week education project . This involved liaising with 943 of Woolworths ' New Zealand Trade Partners , to educate , encourage and assist as many of them as possible to make an early transition to webforms or EDI . Prior to the webforms / EDI engagement project , B2BE had a strong existing relationship with Woolworths and its New Zealand operation , Progressive , facilitating the connections for many of those Trade Partners already engaging in e-business with Progressive . This put B2BE in a good position to help Woolworths in its goals around uptake of e-business by its New Zealand Trade Partners . The Solution B2BE ran a campaign for Woolworths that involved contacting each Trade Partner several times . Initially B2BE tested the community 's preparedness for the changes using an online survey . Then , depending on responses , B2BE followed up via phone and email to all Trade Partners , directing them to a purpose - built B2BE web site . The site provided all the documentation Trade Partners needed along with a registration process . The registrations from the site were also integrated with the Woolworths TRM ( Trade Relationship Management ) system . Jason Steiner , Woolworths ' Senior Project Manager for e-business , says the key reason for engaging B2BE was the realisation that to get the most out of the project it would be best to use an organisation with strong e-business supplier engagement skills , with \u201c on - the - ground \u201d presence in New Zealand and expertise in Woolworths ' e-business solutions , as well as in VAN services in general . \u201c B2BE already had contact with the majority of our Trading Partners who were already connected with Progressive electronically . In addition , they had experience in previous e-business initiatives undertaken by Woolworths in the past , \u201d says Steiner . \u201c One of the challenges we faced was contacting the right person to liaise with on e-business issues within each Trade Partner organisation . This was an issue from a resourcing point of view if we were to do it in - house . We could have got on the phone and started contacting each organisations , but we realised it was more efficient and cost-effective to engage B2BE who could not only establish contact in the context of e-business but also provide expertise and guidance as a VAN should it be necessary \u201d says Steiner . \u201c We looked to employ expertise in a geography that 's in a different time - zone to our Australian headquarters , and where we do n't have our own significant in - house e-business expertise or resources to undertake such a task . \u201d He says Woolworths ' New Zealand Trade Partners vary significantly in the size of their businesses , and the IT and technical skills they have within their organisations . \u201c B2BE were in the ideal position to assist us , given they have a presence on the ground in New Zealand and could also add value , technically , to discussions with our Trade Partners about whether to go down the webforms or EDI route . \u201d The Result By the end of B2BE 's 13 - week campaign contacting and liaising with Woolworths ' 943 New Zealand Trade Partners , 361 had signed up to use the webforms platform and 67 others had opted to engage through EDI . More than 100 others had indicated their interest and intention to move to either webforms or EDI in the near future . This meant the result of the campaign was that of Woolworths ' potential e-business base , 48 per cent had signed up to the initiative within the campaign 's agreed time - frame , and 12 per cent were expected to do so in the very near future . \u201c When you look at the number of trading relationships transitioned to e-business from start to finish , I think it was an impressive outcome , \u201d says Steiner . \u201c We 're very happy with the results achieved . I do not think we would have been able to achieve the same result utilising our own resources alone . We definitely achieved what we set out to do . \u201d Further insights gained by B2BE into the e-business capabilities and preferences of the Woolworths ' Trade Partner base , during the course of the project , will enable Woolworths to progress most efficiently and effectively those yet to make an e-business transition , Steiner adds . \u201c We 've gathered key information to assist with this and future eBusiness initiatives , such as who the right contact is for e-business within the various Trade Partner organisations . Thus , we 're now well positioned for any follow - ups with those yet to sign - on . In addition , we are now able to conduct a discussion with the Trade Partner already aware of our e-business aspirations . \u201d One New Zealand - based Woolworths Trade Partner to sign up for webforms , as a result of the B2BE project , is organics products ' distributor Ceres Enterprises . Ceres distributes its range of dry goods through Progressive Enterprises ' supermarkets , typically supplying each store with between 200 and 300 lines of product . Ceres ' General Manager , David Josephson , says his company had previously been interacting with Progressive via email . \u201c Facilitating the changeover to e-business trading with Progressive was probably going to be out of our league without somebody like B2BE having the expertise to handle things as the go-between , \u201d Josephson says . \u201c Even though we had dabbled in the EDI side of things , to try and get e-business up and running , and to , eventually , consider moving towards a full EDI connection with Progressive , we needed somebody like B2BE to come in and assist us , \u201d he says . \u201d We have n't actually gone live with webforms yet , so have n't seen the benefits from that side . But we have definitely seen the benefits of working with B2BE . It 's certainly a lot easier dealing with somebody locally than it is trying to deal directly with a company based in Australia . \u201d And Josephson is also anticipating that significant benefits will flow through to Ceres ' operation when the company does go live with webforms in the near future . \u201c We get hundreds , if not thousands , of order lines through on a weekly basis which we currently have to manually key - in , so moving to an e-business platform will assist our operation greatly . \u201d For more information regarding Progressive , please visit www.progressive.co.nz or to find out more about B2BE and how they can help your organisation to reduce manual document processing and distribution visit www.b2be.com or contact B2BE","annotations":[{"text":"New Zealand","span":[478,488],"token_span":[94,95],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"Where the event takes place."},{"text":"Progressive Enterprises Limited","span":[501,531],"token_span":[98,100],"role":"Buyer","label":"Buyer","role_definition":"The Buyer wants the Goods and offers Money to a Seller in exchange for them."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"In 2008 Progressive Enterprises approached its 943 New Zealand suppliers ( which Woolworths calls \" Trade Partners \" ) to use electronic commerce or EDI to integrate supply chain orders ( such as Purchase Orders and Invoices ) in the same way that Woolworths does in Australia .","annotations":[{"text":"Progressive Enterprises","span":[8,30],"token_span":[2,3],"role":"Buyer","label":"Buyer","role_definition":"The Buyer wants the Goods and offers Money to a Seller in exchange for them."},{"text":"2008","span":[3,6],"token_span":[1,1],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the event occurs."},{"text":"New Zealand","span":[51,61],"token_span":[7,8],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"Where the event takes place."}],"trigger":{"text":"Purchase","start_char":196,"end_char":203,"start_token":33,"end_token":33,"frame":"Commerce_buy"}},"source":{"text":"B2BE converts 50 % of Progressive / Woolworths ' NZ Partners to e-business The major grocery group engaged B2BE ( then called \u201c ECN \u201d in New Zealand ) to ' educate ' its 943 NZ Trade Partners of the benefits of switching to EDI and webforms \u2013 48 % did so in just 3 months , with more to follow \u2026 . The Client Woolworths Limited is a major publicly listed trans - Tasman retail group , with more than 3,000 stores and 180,000 employees in New Zealand and Australia . Through its New Zealand business , Progressive Enterprises Limited , it is a significant player in the New Zealand grocery market . The Challenge A key business improvement focus for Woolworths over the past few years has been enhancing the integration of its own core IT systems with those of its Trade Partners , through Electronic Data Interchange ( EDI ) . It has also been deploying a web-based e-business portal called webforms . Webforms is a free online solution allowing Woolworths ' Trade Partners to receive Purchase Orders and then respond with purchase - order acknowledgments and electronic Invoices . The application has been introduced as an alternative to fax and email , allowing the company 's Trade Partners who may not be in a position to implement a full EDI process , to still access the benefits of electronic trading . In a bid to speed up Trade Partner uptake of these electronic trading options in New Zealand , Woolworths engaged B2BE , one of its Value - Added Network ( VAN ) providers with a New Zealand base , to undertake a 13 - week education project . This involved liaising with 943 of Woolworths ' New Zealand Trade Partners , to educate , encourage and assist as many of them as possible to make an early transition to webforms or EDI . Prior to the webforms / EDI engagement project , B2BE had a strong existing relationship with Woolworths and its New Zealand operation , Progressive , facilitating the connections for many of those Trade Partners already engaging in e-business with Progressive . This put B2BE in a good position to help Woolworths in its goals around uptake of e-business by its New Zealand Trade Partners . The Solution B2BE ran a campaign for Woolworths that involved contacting each Trade Partner several times . Initially B2BE tested the community 's preparedness for the changes using an online survey . Then , depending on responses , B2BE followed up via phone and email to all Trade Partners , directing them to a purpose - built B2BE web site . The site provided all the documentation Trade Partners needed along with a registration process . The registrations from the site were also integrated with the Woolworths TRM ( Trade Relationship Management ) system . Jason Steiner , Woolworths ' Senior Project Manager for e-business , says the key reason for engaging B2BE was the realisation that to get the most out of the project it would be best to use an organisation with strong e-business supplier engagement skills , with \u201c on - the - ground \u201d presence in New Zealand and expertise in Woolworths ' e-business solutions , as well as in VAN services in general . \u201c B2BE already had contact with the majority of our Trading Partners who were already connected with Progressive electronically . In addition , they had experience in previous e-business initiatives undertaken by Woolworths in the past , \u201d says Steiner . \u201c One of the challenges we faced was contacting the right person to liaise with on e-business issues within each Trade Partner organisation . This was an issue from a resourcing point of view if we were to do it in - house . We could have got on the phone and started contacting each organisations , but we realised it was more efficient and cost-effective to engage B2BE who could not only establish contact in the context of e-business but also provide expertise and guidance as a VAN should it be necessary \u201d says Steiner . \u201c We looked to employ expertise in a geography that 's in a different time - zone to our Australian headquarters , and where we do n't have our own significant in - house e-business expertise or resources to undertake such a task . \u201d He says Woolworths ' New Zealand Trade Partners vary significantly in the size of their businesses , and the IT and technical skills they have within their organisations . \u201c B2BE were in the ideal position to assist us , given they have a presence on the ground in New Zealand and could also add value , technically , to discussions with our Trade Partners about whether to go down the webforms or EDI route . \u201d The Result By the end of B2BE 's 13 - week campaign contacting and liaising with Woolworths ' 943 New Zealand Trade Partners , 361 had signed up to use the webforms platform and 67 others had opted to engage through EDI . More than 100 others had indicated their interest and intention to move to either webforms or EDI in the near future . This meant the result of the campaign was that of Woolworths ' potential e-business base , 48 per cent had signed up to the initiative within the campaign 's agreed time - frame , and 12 per cent were expected to do so in the very near future . \u201c When you look at the number of trading relationships transitioned to e-business from start to finish , I think it was an impressive outcome , \u201d says Steiner . \u201c We 're very happy with the results achieved . I do not think we would have been able to achieve the same result utilising our own resources alone . We definitely achieved what we set out to do . \u201d Further insights gained by B2BE into the e-business capabilities and preferences of the Woolworths ' Trade Partner base , during the course of the project , will enable Woolworths to progress most efficiently and effectively those yet to make an e-business transition , Steiner adds . \u201c We 've gathered key information to assist with this and future eBusiness initiatives , such as who the right contact is for e-business within the various Trade Partner organisations . Thus , we 're now well positioned for any follow - ups with those yet to sign - on . In addition , we are now able to conduct a discussion with the Trade Partner already aware of our e-business aspirations . \u201d One New Zealand - based Woolworths Trade Partner to sign up for webforms , as a result of the B2BE project , is organics products ' distributor Ceres Enterprises .

( F ) , founded in 1919 by Henry Ford , is a leader in the global automotive industry . Ford designs , manufactures , sells , and services a full line of cars , trucks , and utility vehicles . The company also offers a broad range of financial services to support car dealers and vehicle sales . The company currently is focused on boosting electric car production , mobility services , and self-driving technology . Ford has operations worldwide and employs about 186,000 people globally . Ford 's competitors include established automobile companies such as General Motors Co. ( GM ) and Japan - based Toyota Motor Corp . ( TM ) as well as newer entrants such as electric vehicle makers Tesla Inc. ( TSLA ) and China - based NIO Inc. ( NIO ) . Key Takeaways - Ford is an automotive company that sells cars , trucks , and sports utility vehicles . It also provides vehicle service and financing . - The vast majority of the company 's revenue comes from automotive sales . - Mobility is the smallest operating segment by revenue , but also the fastest-growing . - Ford Credit was the only operating segment to report positive earnings for the most recent quarter , as measured by earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) . - Ford announced in September 2021 a total of $ 11.4 - billion in investments in two U.S. sites that will focus on electric vehicle ( EV ) production and batteries . Ford 's Financials Ford 's most recent earnings report was for Q2 2021 , ended June 30 , 2021 . The company posted net income of $ 553 million , down substantially from net income of $ 1.1 billion for the prior- year quarter . Despite that , Ford reported company - wide adjusted earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) of $ 1.1 billion in Q2 2021 compared to adjusted EBIT of - $ 1.9 billion in the same quarter a year earlier . The company 's total revenue for Q2 2021 was $ 26.8 billion , up 38.1 % year - over - year ( YOY ) as sales began to recover from the major disruptions to the economy caused by the COVID - 19 pandemic beginning in early 2020 . Throughout the pandemic , Ford 's business has been negatively affected by production suspensions and the global semiconductor supply shortage . After suspending production at facilities around the world in March 2020 , Ford returned to normal production schedules in June of that year . Ford 's Business Segments Ford operates through three business segments : Automotive , Mobility , and Ford Credit . The company breaks out revenue and adjusted EBIT for each segment . EBIT is a measure of profitability calculated as revenue minus expenses excluding tax and interest . Additionally , Ford reports corporate governance expenses , interest income , and gains and losses from investments under a fourth category , Corporate Other , although this is not considered an operating segment . Automotive Ford earns the vast majority of its revenue by selling vehicles , service parts , and accessories around the world under the Ford and Lincoln brands . The automotive segment includes revenues and costs related to development , manufacture , distribution , service , and electrification vehicle programs . It also sells vehicles wholesale to dealers and distributors in five major geographical segments : North America , South America , Europe , China ( including Taiwan ) , and International Markets Group . With Q2 2021 revenues of $ 24.1 billion , Ford 's Automotive segment accounted for 90.2 % of revenues for Q2 2021 . Automotive revenues grew by 45.1 % YOY in that quarter , the second - fastest rate among Ford 's three operating segments . However , the Automotive segment reported a loss for Q2 2021 , measured by adjusted EBIT , of - $ 95 million . That was a dramatic improvement from - $ 2.1 billion EBIT in the same quarter a year earlier . For Q2 2021 , Ford 's adjusted EBIT for its Automotive business in North America and International Markets Group were each positive , while its adjusted EBIT for the Automotive operations in South America , Europe , and China were all negative . Combined , Automotive adjusted EBIT for South America , Europe , and China totaled - $ 493 million for the quarter . Mobility Ford 's Mobility segment includes development costs for the development and production of autonomous vehicles . It also includes Ford 's equity ownership of Argo AI , a developer of autonomous driving systems , and investments in Spin , a micro-mobility service provider . Mobility is the smallest of Ford 's segments by revenue . It generated just $ 21 million of revenue for Q2 2021 , or about 0.1 % of total quarterly revenue . It was the fastest-growing segment by revenue , tripling YOY for that period , though that growth was off of an extremely small base . Mobility reported adjusted EBIT of - $ 182 million for Q2 2021 , an improvement from - $ 286 million in the same quarter a year earlier . Ford Credit The Ford Credit segment is comprised of the company 's vehicle - related financing and leasing operations . The company offers a variety of automotive financing products to and through dealers worldwide . Most of the Ford Credit business involves financing of vehicles , supporting dealer operations , and lease contracts . Ford Credit posted quarterly revenue of $ 2.6 billion for Q2 2021 , or roughly 9.7 % of total revenues . This figure was down by 5.0 % YOY , making Ford Credit the only one of the company 's operating segments to see declining revenues YOY for the quarter . Despite that , Ford Credit generated adjusted EBIT of $ 1.6 billion in Q2 2021 , nearly tripling YOY , as it benefited from the rebound in vehicle sales compared to a year earlier . It was the only operating segment to report positive adjusted EBIT in the quarter . During the quarter , Ford Credit benefited from an historically low loss-to -receivables ( LTR ) ratio , which reflects low losses and strong net recoveries . Ford Credit 's U.S. auction values also were 39 % higher than a year ago , reflecting robust demand for used cars . Ford 's Recent Developments Under the leadership of Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Jim Farley since fall of 2020 , Ford has heavily prioritized electric vehicles and related technologies . In May 2021 , the company announced that it aimed to be a leader in electric vehicles and connected services . Ford anticipates that 40 % of its global vehicle volume will be fully electric by 2030 and plans to spend more than $ 30 billion on electrification and battery development by 2025 . On Sept. 27 , 2021 , Ford announced a series of steps to increase its electric vehicle technology and production . Ford will create a 6 - square - mile campus in Tennessee to build the next generation of F-Series electric pickup trucks and advanced batteries . Ford also will build twin battery plants in Kentucky . The company plans to invest $ 11.4 billion in the two sites , creating about 11,000 new jobs . Also in September , the company announced a partnership with retail giant Walmart Inc. ( WMT ) and Argo AI to launch an autonomous vehicle delivery service in select markets in the U.S. The service aims to use Ford self - driving vehicles to deliver Walmart orders to customers .

The company currently is focused on boosting electric car production , mobility services , and self-driving technology . Ford has operations worldwide and employs about 186,000 people globally . Ford 's competitors include established automobile companies such as General Motors Co. ( GM ) and Japan - based Toyota Motor Corp . ( TM ) as well as newer entrants such as electric vehicle makers Tesla Inc. ( TSLA ) and China - based NIO Inc. ( NIO ) . Key Takeaways - Ford is an automotive company that sells cars , trucks , and sports utility vehicles . It also provides vehicle service and financing . - The vast majority of the company 's revenue comes from automotive sales . - Mobility is the smallest operating segment by revenue , but also the fastest-growing . - Ford Credit was the only operating segment to report positive earnings for the most recent quarter , as measured by earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) . - Ford announced in September 2021 a total of $ 11.4 - billion in investments in two U.S. sites that will focus on electric vehicle ( EV ) production and batteries . Ford 's Financials Ford 's most recent earnings report was for Q2 2021 , ended June 30 , 2021 . The company posted net income of $ 553 million , down substantially from net income of $ 1.1 billion for the prior- year quarter . Despite that , Ford reported company - wide adjusted earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) of $ 1.1 billion in Q2 2021 compared to adjusted EBIT of - $ 1.9 billion in the same quarter a year earlier . The company 's total revenue for Q2 2021 was $ 26.8 billion , up 38.1 % year - over - year ( YOY ) as sales began to recover from the major disruptions to the economy caused by the COVID - 19 pandemic beginning in early 2020 . Throughout the pandemic , Ford 's business has been negatively affected by production suspensions and the global semiconductor supply shortage . After suspending production at facilities around the world in March 2020 , Ford returned to normal production schedules in June of that year . Ford 's Business Segments Ford operates through three business segments : Automotive , Mobility , and Ford Credit . The company breaks out revenue and adjusted EBIT for each segment . EBIT is a measure of profitability calculated as revenue minus expenses excluding tax and interest . Additionally , Ford reports corporate governance expenses , interest income , and gains and losses from investments under a fourth category , Corporate Other , although this is not considered an operating segment . Automotive Ford earns the vast majority of its revenue by selling vehicles , service parts , and accessories around the world under the Ford and Lincoln brands . The automotive segment includes revenues and costs related to development , manufacture , distribution , service , and electrification vehicle programs . It also sells vehicles wholesale to dealers and distributors in five major geographical segments : North America , South America , Europe , China ( including Taiwan ) , and International Markets Group . With Q2 2021 revenues of $ 24.1 billion , Ford 's Automotive segment accounted for 90.2 % of revenues for Q2 2021 . Automotive revenues grew by 45.1 % YOY in that quarter , the second - fastest rate among Ford 's three operating segments . However , the Automotive segment reported a loss for Q2 2021 , measured by adjusted EBIT , of - $ 95 million . That was a dramatic improvement from - $ 2.1 billion EBIT in the same quarter a year earlier . For Q2 2021 , Ford 's adjusted EBIT for its Automotive business in North America and International Markets Group were each positive , while its adjusted EBIT for the Automotive operations in South America , Europe , and China were all negative . Combined , Automotive adjusted EBIT for South America , Europe , and China totaled - $ 493 million for the quarter . Mobility Ford 's Mobility segment includes development costs for the development and production of autonomous vehicles . It also includes Ford 's equity ownership of Argo AI , a developer of autonomous driving systems , and investments in Spin , a micro-mobility service provider . Mobility is the smallest of Ford 's segments by revenue . It generated just $ 21 million of revenue for Q2 2021 , or about 0.1 % of total quarterly revenue . It was the fastest-growing segment by revenue , tripling YOY for that period , though that growth was off of an extremely small base . Mobility reported adjusted EBIT of - $ 182 million for Q2 2021 , an improvement from - $ 286 million in the same quarter a year earlier . Ford Credit The Ford Credit segment is comprised of the company 's vehicle - related financing and leasing operations . The company offers a variety of automotive financing products to and through dealers worldwide . Most of the Ford Credit business involves financing of vehicles , supporting dealer operations , and lease contracts . Ford Credit posted quarterly revenue of $ 2.6 billion for Q2 2021 , or roughly 9.7 % of total revenues . This figure was down by 5.0 % YOY , making Ford Credit the only one of the company 's operating segments to see declining revenues YOY for the quarter . Despite that , Ford Credit generated adjusted EBIT of $ 1.6 billion in Q2 2021 , nearly tripling YOY , as it benefited from the rebound in vehicle sales compared to a year earlier . It was the only operating segment to report positive adjusted EBIT in the quarter .

Wong told his father someone was trying to kill him . \" They 're in front of me and trying to capture me , \" Wong told his father , pointing to the empty air before them . Voong quickly realized his son was not joking and decided to take him to the hospital . Wong went willingly to escape his supposed captors . The family of six had been in the United States for about five months and only Henry Voong spoke English , broken at best . Voong said he realizes now that communicating with the doctors was unclear . After two hours , the doctors told Voong there was nothing wrong with his son and they sent him home .

That incident 19 years ago is the only time they witnessed such erratic behavior or sought treatment for him . Wong 's paranoia did not surface publicly again until April 6 , when a letter written by Wong arrived at News 10 Now in Syracuse . The letter came three days after Wong opened fire at the American Civic Association in Binghamton , killing 13 people and then himself . Wong wrote how undercover police officers taunted him , tortured him and spread rumors about him wherever he went . Voong said he has never seen any officers calling or visiting his son . Why Wong did what he did remains a mystery , especially to the people who lived with him for nearly the last two years . His parents say he did not have any friends and rarely spoke to anyone . To them , he lived a quiet , nearly silent existence for the last 19 years . According to his father , that silence deepened two weeks before the shooting . Wong stopped eating dinner , stopped watching television and rarely emerged from behind his bedroom door . The letter Wong sent to News 10 Now was dated March 18 , a little more than two weeks before the shooting . \" He avoided being in the house at the same time with me , \" Voong said . \" At first , I thought maybe he was mad about something and was planning to ask him . This tragedy occurred before I even had a chance to ask him . \" Voong and Thong are trying to piece together the last few weeks -- even the last few years -- to find an answer to the question so many have : why ? \" All parents raise their children to be good human beings , \" Voong said . \" You never imagine in your wildest dreams that they would end up doing something so horrific . \" The couple contacted The Post-Standard on Thursday because they wanted to apologize to the Binghamton community and all those affected by their son 's actions . \" We are deeply sorry for our son 's actions , \" Voong said . \" Our family sincerely apologize to the victims ' families and ask for their forgiveness . \" The early days The Voong family moved to Binghamton from Vietnam in June 1990 . While ethnically Chinese , the Voongs said they left Saigon with the help of a program that assisted former South Vietnamese soldiers and political prisoners who were jailed after the Vietnam War ended . Voong served as a captain in the South Vietnamese Army . In the early 1990s , Voong said , his wife and their four children spent a lot of time together . Wong , the second oldest , would have been about 22 years old and spoke little to no English when the family moved to the Binghamton area . His parents say he often joked with his siblings during those early days . The family shared meals and often watched television together . \" We always stuck together because we were afraid we might get lost in our new surroundings , \" Voong said . Many members of the Vietnamese community in Binghamton fondly recall Voong during that time . Diep Nguyen says Voong helped many new immigrants by translating and taking them to school or a doctor appointment . \" The Voongs are a good family and always willing to help others , \" Nguyen said . \" Their son ( Wong ) kept to himself and rarely interacted with the Vietnamese community . \" About a year after settling in the states , Wong moved out of his parents ' home into a nearby apartment by himself . He worked at Felchar Manufacturer in Binghamton , a company that makes electric motors and power cords . Less than a year after that , Wong moved to California . In many ways Voong and Thong say , that was the last time they saw their son . A new name in California Binghamton police say Wong became an American citizen in November 1995 and left the country shortly after . Wong 's passport records , according to Binghamton police , say he returned to Los Angeles on Dec. 25 , 1999 , from Tokyo . Police say he was married and divorced in California but they have not disclosed the woman 's name has not been reported . Wong 's parents say they have no idea if any of that information is true . \" I do n't know anything about his life in California , \" Voong said . \" Something must of have happened there . \" During the nearly 15 years he spent in California , Wong rarely kept in touch with his family . He never visited or sent letters . His phone calls were few and short and he refused to share a mailing address . Mail addressed to their son occassionally arrived at the family 's Binghamton home . Voong recalls opening a piece addressed to Jiverly Wong , which was different from his son 's given name of Linh Phat Voong . \" He must have changed his name after he got his citizenship , \" Voong said . \" I was very angry because it 's our family name . He ca n't just change our family name . \" Back to the Southern Tier After years of nearly total silence , Jiverly Wong called his father in 2007 and told him he had lost his job as a truck driver in California . He asked his father if he could come home . Voong said he was upset about not hearing from his son for so long , but welcomed him home . Voong said the man who arrived at their house nearly two years ago , was not the same person who left 15 years earlier . He soon got a job working the 3 - to - midnight shift at the Shop-Vac plant in Endicott . Voong said he and his wife and their daughter Milline rarely saw or interacted with Wong , especially since everyone worked different shifts . Wong was more quiet . He did n't have any friends and he did n't make or receive any telephone calls . He never wore short sleeves , even in the summer . He spent most of his time in his bedroom , but did n't make much noise . He always emerged from the bathroom after a shower fully clothed in long sleeves and pants . Voong said his son kept to himself and spent most of his free time out of the house . About a year ago , Voong said Wong slapped his youngest sister Milline , 35 , who also lives with them , across the face during an argument . He said he did n't know what the argument was about but it was the only time he can recall his son being physically abusive . The only other time Voong can recall his son having a temper was a time when Wong raised his voice to his father several months ago . Voong asked Wong to move a portable heater away from their leather couch . In a raised voice , Voong said , \" Dad , you 're just being difficult . \" Life after the layoff In November 2008 , Wong told his parents he had been laid off from Shop - Vac . While out of work , Wong told his parents he was going to take classes to improve his English at the American Civic Association . Whenever he left the house , Wong said he was going to the library to use the computer . He checked out movies about animals . Posters and calendars of owls , cats , dogs and birds hung in his room . \" He liked animals , \" Voong said . \" He had a fish bowl with a fish in it . He liked watching ' Animal Planet ' and other channels showing animals ... I never saw him watch anything else . \" Voong and Thong say they know little else of the man who lived down the hall for more than a year . Voong said he never saw his son with a handgun , knew he owned one or heard him talk about going to a shooting range . Voong said he knew that his son owned an air rifle , which is similar to a BB gun . He also said he had never seen the room or setting in the photos of Wong holding guns that were sent to News 10 Now . The day of the shooting About noon on April 3 , Voong said , he was at work when co-workers began talking about \" an Asian guy shooting on Front Street by the American Civic Association . \" Voong was worried . His son took classes at the center . At their home on Taylor Street in Johnson City , Thong said she was sleeping that Friday when a police officer knocked on their door about 11 a.m . The officer told Thong something about a car being parked at the American Civic Association but she could not understand much because she speaks very little English . She asked the officer to wait until her husband got home from work since his English is stronger . The officer waited at the house until Voong arrived home between 3 and 4 p.m . Voong said he was surprised to see several Binghamton police cars at his house and immediately believed something had happened to Wong at the center . Police brought Voong , Thong and their daughter to the police station for questioning . Police spoke with the family for nearly four hours without a translator . Shortly before wrapping up the interview at about 8 p.m. , police told Wong 's parents that their son had died . Vong says they never explained his role in the shooting . Upset by the news of their son 's death , Voong and Thong returned home but did not watch any news , which by nearly that time included the name of the alleged shooter : Jiverly Wong . Voong and Thong said they learned of their son 's role in the shooting by reading Saturday 's newspaper . \" We were horrified and we could n't believe it , \" Voong said . \" I never suspected that my son would be dead . I especially never thought he would be a killer . \" Even family members in Vietnam heard about the shooting and called the family . Wong 's 91 - year- old paternal grandmother cried and could n't believe her grandson 's actions , according to Voong . Moving forward For more than a week , reporters from across the country have set up shop on the family 's street , in their front yard and on their answering machine . Voong and Thong say they are living in a constant state of fear and devastation . They are afraid to go out in public and have not yet returned to their jobs in assembly work . They say they cannot eat and have a hard time sleeping through the night . They fear retaliation from the victims ' families or anyone in the community . To their surprise , Voong and Thong say they have received more than 50 cards and dozens of many cards and floral arrangements supporting them and offering their sympathy and food at their doorstep . They say they are surprised and feel grateful . \" I thank members of the community who have been so kind and understanding , \" Voong said . \" Still , I am very worried about possible retaliation from some folks . We 're just two old parents who had no control over their 41 - year - old son 's actions . We ask everyone to forgive us for having such a son . \" After their interview at The Post -Standard , Voong and Thong went to the International Sangha Bhiksu Buddist Temple on Park Street in Syracuse to pray for the victims and their son . Because of the severity of his injuries , the family chose to cremate Wong 's body . They plan to spread his ashes in the ocean , which they hope will \" free his soul . \" Voong and Thong say they want to continue to live in Binghamton , the city where they sought a future for themselves and their family . \" My goal upon arrival in the U.S. , is to bring my children here so they can have a better future , \" Voong said . \" With this tragedy , I am very saddened and still in disbelief . \"","annotations":[{"text":"opened fire at the American Civic Association in Binghamton , killing 13 people and then himself .","span":[1848,1945],"token_span":[366,382],"role":"Crime","label":"Crime","role_definition":"An act, generally intentional, that has been formally forbidden by law."},{"text":"at the American Civic Association in Binghamton","span":[1860,1906],"token_span":[368,374],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the Crime occurs."},{"text":"Jiverly Wong","span":[6045,6056],"token_span":[1177,1178],"role":"Perpetrator","label":"Perpetrator","role_definition":"The individual that commits a Crime."},{"text":"About noon on April 3","span":[8986,9006],"token_span":[1797,1801],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the Crime was committed."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"Perpetrator Jiverly Antares Wong ( born Linh Phat Vuong , ; December 8 , 1967 \u2013 April 3 , 2009 ) , a resident of Johnson City , New York , was identified as the perpetrator .","annotations":[{"text":"Jiverly Antares Wong ( born Linh Phat Vuong","span":[12,54],"token_span":[1,8],"role":"Perpetrator","label":"Perpetrator","role_definition":"The individual that commits a Crime."}],"trigger":{"text":"perpetrator","start_char":161,"end_char":171,"start_token":35,"end_token":35,"frame":"Committing_crime"}},"source":{"text":"The first time he feared for his son 's sanity was in the fall of 1990 .

Voong said the man who arrived at their house nearly two years ago , was not the same person who left 15 years earlier . He soon got a job working the 3 - to - midnight shift at the Shop-Vac plant in Endicott . Voong said he and his wife and their daughter Milline rarely saw or interacted with Wong , especially since everyone worked different shifts . Wong was more quiet . He did n't have any friends and he did n't make or receive any telephone calls . He never wore short sleeves , even in the summer . He spent most of his time in his bedroom , but did n't make much noise . He always emerged from the bathroom after a shower fully clothed in long sleeves and pants . Voong said his son kept to himself and spent most of his free time out of the house . About a year ago , Voong said Wong slapped his youngest sister Milline , 35 , who also lives with them , across the face during an argument . He said he did n't know what the argument was about but it was the only time he can recall his son being physically abusive . The only other time Voong can recall his son having a temper was a time when Wong raised his voice to his father several months ago . Voong asked Wong to move a portable heater away from their leather couch . In a raised voice , Voong said , \" Dad , you 're just being difficult . \" Life after the layoff In November 2008 , Wong told his parents he had been laid off from Shop - Vac . While out of work , Wong told his parents he was going to take classes to improve his English at the American Civic Association . Whenever he left the house , Wong said he was going to the library to use the computer . He checked out movies about animals . Posters and calendars of owls , cats , dogs and birds hung in his room . \" He liked animals , \" Voong said . \" He had a fish bowl with a fish in it . He liked watching ' Animal Planet ' and other channels showing animals ... I never saw him watch anything else . \" Voong and Thong say they know little else of the man who lived down the hall for more than a year . Voong said he never saw his son with a handgun , knew he owned one or heard him talk about going to a shooting range . Voong said he knew that his son owned an air rifle , which is similar to a BB gun . He also said he had never seen the room or setting in the photos of Wong holding guns that were sent to News 10 Now . The day of the shooting About noon on April 3 , Voong said , he was at work when co-workers began talking about \" an Asian guy shooting on Front Street by the American Civic Association . \" Voong was worried . His son took classes at the center . At their home on Taylor Street in Johnson City , Thong said she was sleeping that Friday when a police officer knocked on their door about 11 a.m . The officer told Thong something about a car being parked at the American Civic Association but she could not understand much because she speaks very little English . She asked the officer to wait until her husband got home from work since his English is stronger . The officer waited at the house until Voong arrived home between 3 and 4 p.m . Voong said he was surprised to see several Binghamton police cars at his house and immediately believed something had happened to Wong at the center . Police brought Voong , Thong and their daughter to the police station for questioning . Police spoke with the family for nearly four hours without a translator . Shortly before wrapping up the interview at about 8 p.m. , police told Wong 's parents that their son had died . Vong says they never explained his role in the shooting . Upset by the news of their son 's death , Voong and Thong returned home but did not watch any news , which by nearly that time included the name of the alleged shooter : Jiverly Wong . Voong and Thong said they learned of their son 's role in the shooting by reading Saturday 's newspaper . \" We were horrified and we could n't believe it , \" Voong said . \" I never suspected that my son would be dead . I especially never thought he would be a killer . \" Even family members in Vietnam heard about the shooting and called the family . Wong 's 91 - year- old paternal grandmother cried and could n't believe her grandson 's actions , according to Voong . Moving forward For more than a week , reporters from across the country have set up shop on the family 's street , in their front yard and on their answering machine . Voong and Thong say they are living in a constant state of fear and devastation . They are afraid to go out in public and have not yet returned to their jobs in assembly work . They say they cannot eat and have a hard time sleeping through the night . They fear retaliation from the victims ' families or anyone in the community . To their surprise , Voong and Thong say they have received more than 50 cards and dozens of many cards and floral arrangements supporting them and offering their sympathy and food at their doorstep . They say they are surprised and feel grateful . \" I thank members of the community who have been so kind and understanding , \" Voong said . \" Still , I am very worried about possible retaliation from some folks . We 're just two old parents who had no control over their 41 - year - old son 's actions . We ask everyone to forgive us for having such a son . \" After their interview at The Post -Standard , Voong and Thong went to the International Sangha Bhiksu Buddist Temple on Park Street in Syracuse to pray for the victims and their son . Because of the severity of his injuries , the family chose to cremate Wong 's body . They plan to spread his ashes in the ocean , which they hope will \" free his soul . \" Voong and Thong say they want to continue to live in Binghamton , the city where they sought a future for themselves and their family . \" My goal upon arrival in the U.S. , is to bring my children here so they can have a better future , \" Voong said . \" With this tragedy , I am very saddened and still in disbelief . \"","annotations":[{"text":"Jiverly Wong","span":[6045,6056],"token_span":[1177,1178],"role":"Perpetrator","label":"Perpetrator","role_definition":"The individual that commits a Crime."},{"text":"opened fire at the American Civic Association in Binghamton , killing 13 people and then himself .","span":[1848,1945],"token_span":[366,382],"role":"Crime","label":"Crime","role_definition":"An act, generally intentional, that has been formally forbidden by law."},{"text":"About noon on April 3","span":[8986,9006],"token_span":[1797,1801],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the Crime was committed."},{"text":"the American Civic Association in Binghamton","span":[1863,1906],"token_span":[369,374],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the Crime occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"test"},{"instance_id":"EN-4342-201-frame-Communication","frame":"Communication","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Communicator conveys a Message to an Addressee; the Topic and Medium of the communication also may be expressed.","frame_ancestors":["Cause_to_perceive","Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":["Communication_manner","Communication_noise","Communication_response","Gesture","Reassuring","Summarizing"],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Social networks are also used to communicate scientists research results and as a public communication tool and to connect people who share the same professional interests , their benefits can vary according to the discipline .","annotations":[{"text":"Social networks","span":[0,14],"token_span":[0,1],"role":"Medium","label":"Medium","role_definition":"The physical or abstract setting in which the Message is conveyed."},{"text":"scientists","span":[45,54],"token_span":[7,7],"role":"Communicator","label":"Communicator","role_definition":"The sentient entity that uses language in the written or spoken modality to convey a Message to the Addressee."},{"text":"research results","span":[56,71],"token_span":[8,9],"role":"Message","label":"Message","role_definition":"Message is a proposition or set of propositions that the Communicator wants the Addressee to believe or take for granted."}],"trigger":{"text":"communicate","start_char":33,"end_char":43,"start_token":6,"end_token":6,"frame":"Communication"}},"source":{"text":"The use of social networks by researchers in their professional activities is a phenomenon on the rise .

This article is part of our dossier on Scientific Social Networks and was translated from the French by Abby Tabor . Social networks allow us to extend the reach of our influence and to exchange with others , well beyond the few people making up our private circle and the colleagues that we cross paths with each day . This sphere of close contact can be extended to included even acquaintances that we see only rarely , due to the distance that separates us , for example .

Similarly , scientists generally work individually or within a small research team . But it is rare that the isolated work of a scientist is not part of a national or even international collaboration . In academic studies and scientific research , the benefit of social networks for bringing together scientists and institutions seems obvious , given their ability to extend our sphere of contact and exchange .

Social Networks for Environmental Sciences The journal VertigO , a French -language electronic journal of environmental sciences , in open access , conducted a poll on scientific social networks from November 2009 to January 2010 . 159 French speakers and 23 English speakers responded to questions about what they expected from scientific social networks and their opinion of existing networks . The vast majority of respondents were in the field of environmental sciences , due simply to the mailing lists used for the diffusion of the poll . This preliminary study showed that the principal uses of a social network in the scientific world are collaborations and information searches . In addition , although the survey respondents seemed unconvinced by the networks currently available , they expressed interest in joining an open , multidisciplinary professional social network , involving many different participants . And , in spite of having little time to devote to it , respondents stated that they would be ready to contribute to the content of such a network and to share information . In exchange , they expected an active network , led by dynamic community managers , providing quality content . Social Media by Discipline and by Academic Field There are already several networks for social sciences ( SAGE , hypotheses.org ) offering a variety of tools : research logs , discussion forums , blogs , resources , event calendars , sharing of documents and the literature review \u2026 Information and communication sciences also bring together numerous social media players , as do the fields of scientific and technical culture ( Knowtex ) and science and art ( Bamboo , Artscience Factory , ArtScience Labs . ) In these disciplines , the interest of social media is acknowledged and these tools have been widely adopted . For the so- called hard sciences , similar networks have already become established in the English -speaking research world ( Research Gate , colwiz , Academia.edu ) , albeit with a limited reach . In France , while some initiatives have recently emerged , it seems that the hard sciences do not view social media with the same interest as social or communication sciences . Very specialized media , like the bibliographic tools Mendeley and Zotero , have seen the greatest success , their interest being , above all , individual and , only secondarily , collective . Aggregators of scientific blogs are also successful ( C@f\u00e9 des sciences in French , ScienceBlogging , ResearchBlogging , Science Blogs , and others in English ) , but it seems that the demand among readers for such blogs is greater than scientists ' need to maintain them .
