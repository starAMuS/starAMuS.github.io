The blaze began shortly after the southbound Blue Train \u2014 one of two that make up the downtown monorail system \u2014 left Seattle Center for the mile - long trip to Westlake Center . Fire crews approaching the scene were met by black smoke pouring down Fifth Avenue . Passengers said nearly 100 people were on the train when the fire started . Thick smoke quickly filled the train as passengers \u2014 some screaming , others calm \u2014 forced their way toward the front . The rescue of dozens of stranded passengers came on the final day of the Northwest Folklife Festival , which had attracted thousands to Seattle Center . As hundreds of fairgoers watched , some passengers made their way down a firefighter 's ladder that had been hoisted to a door in the front of the train . The system 's second train pulled up alongside the damaged train , allowing some passengers to board before returning to its base at Seattle Center . \" The outcome could have been very different , \" said Fire Department spokeswoman Helen Fitzpatrick . \" No one jumped , which is a good thing . \" Power was shut off to the monorail , and the service was shut down indefinitely . About 40 passengers were evaluated for smoke inhalation and eight were taken to Harborview Medical Center , Fitzpatrick said . One firefighter was sent to the hospital with an injured knee , she added . All were released last night , according to a Harborview nursing supervisor . \" It really did n't take the Fire Department that long to show up , \" said Marlene Schwartzmann , who along with her husband , son and daughter was in the rear car of the monorail when the fire started . \" But as the inside of the monorail turned pitch black , it began feeling like an eternity . \" The Schwartzmanns , of Tampa , Fla. , had begun their vacation in Seattle less than 24 hours earlier . They spent several hours at Seattle Center and took a ride up the Space Needle yesterday before hopping on the monorail back to Westlake Center . They were the last ones on the train and were jammed into the back car , standing . Holly Schwartzmann , 15 , said she heard a pop and saw a spark that appeared to be coming up from the floor near the window . The lights immediately went out , her mother added . \" Everyone began pushing forward , \" Marlene Schwartzmann said . \" It felt like 100 to 150 people in there . It was pitch black . \" As they hovered on the tracks in the burning train , \" People were looking up taking pictures , \" Holly Schwartzmann said . Her father added : \" You look down , and you see all those people looking up at you . You ca n't jump , it 's too high . You feel trapped . \" His wife added : \" I 'd say this is the highlight of our vacation . We 're lucky it 's a happy ending . \" The proposed Green Line monorail will be required to have emergency escape walkways along its 14 - mile length . The monorail was built in 1962 for the Seattle World 's Fair . The two trains have traveled more than 1.8 million miles on the one - mile stretch of tracks . The system carries more than 2 million passengers a year . The most serious accident in the monorail 's 42 - year history was in 1971 , when the braking system on the Red Train failed , sending it crashing into a steel girder at the Seattle Center station . Twenty six people were hurt . The monorail occasionally breaks down , and passengers usually transfer to another train that pulls alongside . But fire ladders are sometimes used , including twice in 2002 . Construction of the monorail cost $ 3.5 million , and it was built in 10 months . Its supporting structure required 15,000 tons of concrete . Each train rides on 16 tires and each has 24 more tires suspended sideways to hug the rail .

Bancroft , National Center for Environmental Prediction Typhoon Nida : Nida entered OPC 's oceanic area for ( Mercator ) radiofacsimile charts near 29N 136E at 1200 UTC May 20 with maximum sustained winds of 80 KT and gusts to 100 KT . The cyclone moved northeast and weakened to a tropical storm six hours later . By 0600 UTC on the 21st Nida was about 250 nmi northeast of Tokyo with maximum winds 45 KT with gusts to 55 KT , about to become extratropical . Figure 1 shows Typhoon Nida approaching a frontal zone and becoming an extratropical storm at 1200 UTC May 21 east of Japan . While Nida was still a typhoon , the Mokihanai ( WNRD ) encountered southwest winds of 50 KT and 10.5 m seas ( 35 ft ) near 22N 132E at 0000 UTC May 20 . The vessel CMA CGM Alabama ( DGGV ) ( 24N 137E ) reported south winds of 40 KT and 6.5 m seas ( 21 ft ) six hours later . The Sea- Land Reliance ( WFLH ) reported east winds of 45 KT near 39N 149E at 0000 UTC on the 21st , and east winds at 50 KT near 41N 153E twelve hours later . The extratropical storm attained a central pressure of 988 h Pa near 40N 148E at 1800 UTC May 21 , when the President Jackson ( WRYC ) encountered east winds of 50 KT 60 nmi to the north . After that , the system that was Nida continued to move northeast and weakened . Tropical Storm Omais : Omais followed Nida on a similar track south of Japan as a minimal tropical storm on May 21 , with maximum sustained winds of 35 KT with gusts to 45 KT . The cyclone then weakened to a tropical depression near 21N 136E at 0600 UTC May 22 , before becoming extratropical and merging with a frontal zone near 40N 150E two days later . By 0000 UTC May 27 the low- pressure area that was Omais redeveloped into a gale with a central pressure of 985 hPa just south of the western Aleutians . The system then tracked east-northeast , stalled and weakened in the central Gulf of Alaska late on May 29 . Super Typhoon Dianmu : Dianmu appeared on OPC 's Mercator oceanic analysis area near 16N 135E , or 1000 nmi south of Japan , at 1800 UTC June 16 with maximum sustained winds of 155 KT with gusts to 190 KT , the strongest typhoon of the period . The cyclone then tracked west-northwest , west of the area while gradually weakening , before recurving to the northeast on the 20th and weakening to a tropical storm near the southwest coast of Japan at 1800 UTC on June 20 . The President Trumani ( WNDP ) encountered southeast winds of 40 KT near 33N 136E six hours later . Dianmu then moved northeast into the Sea of Japan near 39N 138E at 1200 UTC on the 21st with maximum winds of 40 KT with gusts to 50 KT . The cyclone became an extratropical gale over northern Japan later on the 21st , followed by weakening in the Sea of Okhotsk on June 23 . The remains of Dianmu then dissipated over the northwest Bering Sea late on June 25 . Tropical Storm Mindulle : Tropical Depression 10W formed near 16N 144E at 0600 UTC June 23 and moved west-northwest , becoming Tropical Storm Mindulle six hours later with maximum sustained winds of 35 KT with gusts to 45 KT . The cyclone reached 17N 140E at 0000 UTC on the 24th before turning more southwest and passing west of 135E late on June 24 , with maximum sustained winds of 55 KT with gusts to 70 KT . Typhoon Tingting : Tingting entered OPC 's map area near 16N 146E as a minimal typhoon while moving northwest , and developed maximum sustained winds as high as 80 KT with gusts to 100 KT when the center was near 19N 144E at 1800 UTC June 28 . By month 's end an approaching cold front from the northwest turned Tingting more to the north . By 1200 UTC July 1 the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm near 30N 144E with maximum winds of 55 KT with gusts to 70 KT , and began a turn toward the northeast . Tingting weakened to an extratropical gale ( 990 h Pa ) near 38N 156E at 0000 UTC July 4 , and then re-intensified into a storm - force low with a central pressure as low as 980 hPa ( Figure 2 ) near 48N 164E , where it stalled . Some ship observations taken during the passage of Tingting are listed in Table 1 . The second part of Figure 2 shows only some ship reports of gale - force winds east of the front associated with extratropical Tingting , but the QuikSCAT image in Figure 3 has a 50 KT wind barb near 45N 167E , supporting the classification of the system as a storm . | OBSERVATION ||POSITION||DATA / TIME ( UTC ) ||WIND||SEAS ( M/FT ) | | Sea - Land Trader | ( KIRH ) | 35N 143E | |02/0000||NE 40 ||8.0/26 | | Brooklyn Bridge | ( 3EZJ9 ) | 36N 143E | |02/000||N 40 ||6.0/20 | | Aichi Maru | ( JEGI ) | 29N 149E||02/0900||S 35 | | Century Leader No. 3 | ( JADY ) | 33N 154E||03/0600 ||S 47||6.5/22 | | 33.5N 154E||03/1200||SW 50 | Table 1 . Some notable ship observations taken during Tropical Storm Tingting . The strong low that was Tingting then remained stationary and weakened to below gale strength early on July 6 , before becoming absorbed by a developing low passing to the south late on the same day . Typhoon Namtheun : Tropical Depression 13W formed near 23N 150E at 0600 UTC July 25 and moved northwest while rapidly intensifying , becoming Typhoon Namtheun only eighteen hours later near 25N 148E with maximum sustained winds of 65 KT with gusts to 80 KT . Namtheun attained a peak intensity of 115 KT sustained winds with gusts to 140 KT at 1800 UTC on the 26th when the center reached 27N 147E . Gradual weakening followed while the cyclone continued to move northwest , and Namtheun passed west of 135E , about 100 nmi south of Japan , as a strong tropical storm by month 's end , implying maximum sustained winds of 60 KT with gusts to 75 KT . The Bishu Marui ( JGAC ) encountered southeast winds of 40 KT near 30N 140E and 31N 140E at 1800 UTC July 29 and 0000 UTC July 30 , respectively . Namtheun later recurved northeast into the Sea of Japan and became extratropical west of northern Japan early on August 2 , before becoming absorbed by a larger low inland over Asia on the 3rd. Typhoon Meranti : Tropical Depression 14W formed near 19N 166E at 1800 UTC August 3 and intensified to a tropical storm six hours later while moving north . Tropical Storm 14W appears in the lower part of Figure 4 . The cyclone was named Meranti near 26N 166E at 0600 UTC August 5 and it continued to strengthen , becoming a typhoon six hours later near 27N 167E with maximum winds of 65 KT with gusts to 80 KT . The peak intensity came at 1800 UTC August 5 near 28N 167E , with maximum sustained winds of 90 KT and gusts to 110 KT . The cyclone then weakened to a tropical storm twenty - four hours later while turning more northeast into OPC 's high seas area ( Reference 2 ) , near 32N 170E . Meranti then continued to weaken and became extratropical near 38N 172E early on August 8 , where it stalled and later became absorbed by a larger Bering Sea low by the 13th . Tropical Depression 15W : This cyclone made a brief appearance , moving from west of the area into the Sea of Japan near 38N 135E at 0000 UTC August 5 ( Figure 4 ) with maximum winds of 30 KT with gusts to 40 KT . The cyclone moved northeast and became extratropical , and was absorbed by a frontal system over northern Japan on the 5th . Tropical Storm Malakas : A northeastward - moving weak low developed into Tropical Depression 17 W at 1800 UTC August 10 near 25N 156E , and Tropical Storm Malakas six hours later near 27N 158E . Following a track similar to that of Meranti , Malakas remained a minimal tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 35 KT and gusts to 45 KT , until becoming an extratropical gale near 33N 167E early on August 12 . The low that was Malakas then moved north into the Bering Sea and became absorbed by a larger Bering Sea system by the 15th . Tropical Depression 18W : This cyclone moved northwest to near 16N 143E at 0600 UTC August 14 with maximum winds 25 KT with gusts to 35 KT , and later passed west of 135E as a tropical depression early on the 15th . Tropical Storm Megi : Megi moved northeast into the Sea of Japan early on August 19 , to near 40N 136E at 1200 UTC on the 19th with maximum winds of 50 KT and gusts to 65 KT . Megi then became an extratropical storm six hours later in the northern Sea of Japan with a central pressure of 985 hPa. Figure 5 shows extratropical Megi as the 986 hPa compact storm crossing northern Japan . The Humber Bridgei ( JKRK ) reported a southwest wind of 50 KT near 40N 150E at 1200 UTC August 20 while the storm center passed 150 nmi to the northwest . The system then tracked east-northeast and weakened to a gale about 400 nmi south of the western Aleutians late on the 21st , and later ended up near the Queen Charlotte Islands on August 24 . Super Typhoon Chaba : Chaba moved northwest into OPC 's oceanic surface map area near 16N 141E early on August 23 as a super typhoon with maximum sustained winds of 155 KT and gusts to 190 KT , matching the intensity of Dianmu in June . Slow weakening followed , but the cyclone remained a super typhoon through 1200 UTC on the 25th , when the center was at 22N 137E . Typhoon Chaba then passed west of 135W , about 500 nmi south of Japan , at 1800 UTC August 26 with maximum winds of 110 KT and gusts to 135 KT . Chaba then passed over western Japan early on the 30th as a minimal typhoon before turning north into the Sea of Japan as a tropical storm . Figure 6 shows Tropical Storm Chaba losing tropical characteristics and becoming the extratropical storm ( 977 hPa ) in the second part of the figure , only twelve hours later . Table 2 has a listing of some notable reports , mostly from ships , taken during the passage of Chaba . | OBSERVATION || POSITION ||DATE / TIME ( UTC ) ||WIND ||SEAS ( m/ ft ) | | Northwest Shearwater | ( ZCAO7 ) | 28N 139E||28/1800 ||S 40 | | Cho Yang Atlas | ( DQVH ) | 33N 134E| |30/1200||S 50 ||12.0/39 | | OOCL Fedelity | ( VRWG5 ) | 34N 139E | |30/1800 ||S 45 | | Polar Eagle | ( ELPT3 ) | 34N 140E||31/0000 ||S 45 | | Martorell | ( HPNE ) | 36N 143E| |31/0000 ||S 40 ||5.0/16 | | Hanjin Pretoria | ( A8CP6 ) | 41N 147E||31/1200||SW 35||7.5/25 | | Buoy 21600||33.5N 136.8E||30/1500 ||8.0/26 | Table 2 . List of selected observations taken during passage of Tropical Cyclone Chaba . Typhoon Songda : Rapidly intensifying Typhoon Songda appeared near 16N 150E at 1800 UTC August 30 while moving northwest , with maximum sustained winds of 95 KT and gusts to 115 KT . By month 's end the cyclone was near 18N 147E with maximum winds up to 130 KT and gusts up to 160 KT . See Figure 6 . Also see the next issue of MWL ( April 2005 ) for more information on this typhoon which persisted into September . Other Significant Events Western North Pacific Storm , May 2 - 3 : A low- pressure area moved east from near northern Japan early on May 1 and intensified into a storm near 45N 165E with a 981 hPa central pressure at 1200 UTC May 2 , before looping to the southeast . The central pressure reached 979 hPa as the center crossed 43N 167E at 0600 UTC on the 3rd . The ship Sea - Land Racer ( MCDW2 ) ( 40N 162E ) encountered northwest winds xi of 45 KT at that time . The system then drifted east and weakened . Northwest Pacific Storm of August 4 - 5 : This system developed from a frontal wave of low pressure inland over northeast China late on August 3 and rapidly intensified into the 974 hPa storm shown in the Sea of Okhotsk ( Figure 4 ) . The cyclone was deepest six hours later when the center was analyzed with a 973 hPa central pressure , unusually intense for early August . The QuikSCAT image of the storm in Figure 7 was even more impressive , showing winds of 50 to as high as 80 KT north and northwest of the center at a time several hours before the valid time of the second part of Figure 4 . It is very unusual to get hurricane - force winds in a non-tropical system in summer . The Sioux ( WBN7617 ) reported west winds of 52 KT near 51N 144E at 2100 UTC August 4 . Another ship , UCEF , encountered south winds of 50 KT near 57N 156E fifteen hours later . This storm was short -lived , and moved quickly into eastern Russia and weakened rapidly by August 6 . Western North Pacific Storm of August 19 - 20 : Figure 5 depicts this development which was relatively far south for late summer , at the latitude of Japan . The 998 hPa low near 41N 158E deepened 23 hPa in 24 hours , resulting in the relatively compact 975 hPa storm in the second part of Figure 5 . Ship reports were sparse in the area . The cyclone then deepened slightly to 973 hPa in the following twenty - four hours while turning northeast , but winds decreased to gale force as the circulation of the low expanded in area . The system then stalled near the central Aleutians and weakened late on August 21 . References 1 .

For several decades of contemporary Amman 's existence , this center constituted the whole of Amman . Even when the city grew , the center retained its distinguishing feature as a public sphere in which all of the capital 's residents would gather , as well as all of the arrivals from different areas of the country . Here , there were relatively splendid hotels and Faisal square , in which celebrations and public shows were held . Here was Al - Husseini mosque , in which the king would lead Friday prayer amid a throng of people . Here was the Roman Theater and its various events such as wrestling and boxing matches , in which Fairuz sang , and where an ice-skating show was held ! Similarly , the national celebration of the victory of the Algerian revolution was also held there . And in this center , markets were established and were frequented by all classes of society . Until recently , for example , the gold market in Al - Shabsough area still attracted the brides of Amman . Likewise , the rest of the markets that later took the name \u201c popular markets \u201d were previously just considered central markets . It was also here that the first market following the emergence of the poverty phenomenon in Amman was established . It is called the \u201c Yamaniya Market , \u201d and it started as a marketplace for secondhand European clothes that piqued people 's curiosity and their imaginations , and continued to the present with a short interruption of two years . The interruption was due to the new market owner 's attempt to transform it into a modern marketplace like the rest of the nearby markets . He put a large sign up bearing a new name . Longtime workers remember however , that customers refused the market name change via a popular protest that was neither organized nor officially announced , and that manifested as a boycott of the shops in the new market . This hindered the attempt to replace the market 's content , which soon recovered its characteristics , and these remain essentially the same to this day . Slowly , but notably , Amman began to flee from its center , which took shape as the \u201c bottom of the city . \u201d This term , when referring to Amman , was a new terminology . The city was alienating itself from its center and exalting itself from it . It is true that , from an early period , a number of markets were established in parts of central Amman with marginal ( urban ) activity : the Halal market was established to buy and sell livestock near Ras Al - Ain , then the Al - Haddada and Al - Samkara markets were established . A market for street vendors was set up , and recently became known as \u201c Al - Jora , \u201d as well as a market commonly called \u201c Souq Al - Haramia , \u201d in which the business of selling used commodities spread . However , the center of the city remained a generally active and popular place for different residents in the 1970s and for most of the 1980s . In the \u201c public mind \u201d of Amman residents and Jordanians generally , the city was united to a great degree at that time . It should be noted that at the start of the 1980s , journalist Fakhri Kawar wrote an article titled \u201c East Amman and West Amman . \u201d The title alone was guaranteed to provoke a storm of protest and intense debate about the matter , due to the strangeness of that characterization at the time . According to the late novelist Abdelrahman Munif , who wrote in his book , \u201c Story of a City : Amman in the 1940s \u201d , the most beautiful and accurate description of Amman at that time , the marginalized people of Amman were a major and present part of the life of all social classes . The Adaptability of the Marginalized The preceding paragraphs are not a precise history of the center of Amman , but they are an attempt to pave the way for the subject of this article , namely the shifts in marginalization in Amman 's center during the last few years . The press archive clarifies that at the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s , a broad debate revolved around the problem of Amman 's center , and especially the issue of public transportation and public and private modes of transportation . As part of confronting the problem , the Raghadan Transportation Complex was established in 1974 and hosted many transportation routes , especially those that connect the center of the capital to the southern and eastern regions , including Zarqa and Al - Rasifa and their villages and camps . I still maintain the detailed written description that I wrote in 1997 about socio-economic life on the popular level in the Amman center area , specifically in the area extending between the ( old ) Raghadan Tourist Complex and the \u201c Saqif Al - Sail \u201d area . This was in the context of a scientific anthropological study that discussed the informal \u201c marginalized \u201d economy in that location . At the time , life proceeded in this place 24 hours a day , especially in the space stretching between the Raghadan Tourist Complex and the Hashemite Plaza , arriving at the Al- Husseini Mosque . Transportation service east to Zarqa was continuous and available non-stop , including medium size buses , and restaurants offered their services to customers perpetually as well . During this period , arrivals from Iraq after the Gulf War ( 1991 ) and the years of siege that followed distinguished the public scene of central Amman . Since a large number of Egyptian migrant workers were living there , the Iraqi and Egyptian elements blended together . Naturally , the Iraqis in this place were not generally from affluent sections of the population , so they joined working - class Amman residents in settling their families in nearby areas and overlooking hills . During field research that lasted nine months , I was able to survey the social components of this area . Since my research targeted the informal sector and especially street vendors in the area , I became acquainted with the degree of complexity of the internal organization of this popular market , which extends along the pavements and sidewalks of the streets . The marginalized people of the city were greatly present in this space on all weekdays , especially on Friday , which forms the peak of their activity . During that time , the whole area took shape and reshaped itself to assist the changes taking place . Every morning , the area witnessed the movement of hundreds of thousands of citizens , just as it saw their return in the evening . In response , the market sought to match their needs , and this effort included the formal and informal sectors . Thus , as required services and shops were set up , vegetable stands became numerous at the last spots before people climbed onto buses and taxis . That way , customers did n't have to carry their purchases for long distances . In the westernmost part of the area , at the end of \u201c Saqif Al - Sail , \u201d there is a relatively large plaza located next to the public street , which drops by two meters in some places . Called \u201c Al - Jora , \u201d it is the biggest market for street vendors . At the start of the 1980s , the vendors were ordered to leave the area due to the need to build a commercial building there . Another space was allocated for them , located exactly at the east of the Al - Mahatta bridge , and a building was erected there . It was divided into \u201c numbers , \u201d and the space of each was six square meters . These were distributed to the owners of the street vendor stands expelled from \u201c Al - Jora . \u201d And with this , one of the first sites of marginalization to the east was established , and would expand later . However , \u201c Al - Jora \u201d remained empty , and the construction of the commercial building did not begin until 2018 , 45 years since the evacuation of the original street vendors . During that time , other marginalized activities were undertaken in \u201c Al - Jora , \u201d especially the business of selling secondhand goods . It was also occasionally used as a taxi parking lot , and in some years , vendors were permitted to set up stands there in exchange for fees . The \u201c Solidere \u201d Project of Amman From the beginning of the 2000s , the scene changed gradually but continuously . In 2003 , the Greater Amman Municipality announced the launch of a project to rebuild the Raghadan Complex with a Japanese grant of eight million dinars . For this purpose , the place was sealed with metal fences , and the Municipality allocated three years to finish the project . During that time , necessary facilities were built in the public space located near Al - Mahatta bridge in eastern central Amman to gather traffic temporarily , in anticipation of the Raghadan Complex 's completion . Indeed , after three years , the completion of the project was announced . The metal fences were removed , and May 25 , 2006 ( Independence Day ) was set as the inauguration of the project . But days before the set date , Omar Al - Ma'ani , the mayor of Amman at the time , announced the cancellation of the inauguration , and then the repeal of the idea of the Complex itself . At the time , it was said that the large ultra-modern building would be rehabilitated for tourism purposes , and it was said literally that the center of the capital must not be just a corridor for road crossings and users of public transportation . During those three years , many people readied themselves to respond to the return of the Complex . They constructed new buildings , merchants updated their existing shops , and the owners of licensed kiosks signed new contracts with the Municipality , which allocated places for them in the new building . Thus , the relinquishment of the Raghadan Complex constituted a surprise to many , and entered everyone in a debate that resulted in instances of protest that included the formal and informal sectors . Thereafter , the Municipality implemented a series of measures . Among these was permitting people to use the complex as a parking lot , and an attempt to redirect some traffic routes to it . This measure failed immediately , despite the pressures and police intervention , and the Municipality issued more than one promise to resolve the plight of market vendors . Subsequently , the most prominent plan the Municipality announced had the objective of comprising Raghadan Complex in a massive project spread over 400 dunams . It was to be made up of the island located between Al - Mahatta street and Al - Jaish street , which begins at the historical Amman Municipality building ( the public library now ) and ends at Al - Mahatta bridge . At first , the project was called \u201c Solidere Amman , \u201d named after the Solidere company , which built a similar project in the old center of Beirut . The old Municipality building was even going to be transformed into a hotel . The project also consisted of markets , cafes , wide pools , and expensive residential buildings . On its website , the Municipality provided photo models of the project , and called it \u201c Wadi Amman \u201d ( Amman Valley ) , which was to be part of a larger project carrying the name \u201c Sahin Amman \u201d ( Plate of Amman ) . It included all of central Amman , which comprises most of the city 's roots . The Municipality did indeed undertake a wide appropriation of land , and demolished many facilities and terminated the licenses of many workshops and stores located within the area of the project . Work on the project stopped once again , and then the whole framework of ideas that took the name \u201c comprehensive Amman plan \u201d collapsed . The department that formed the factory for all of those ideas ( Urban Amman Institute ) was terminated , and the activities of its famous director Jerry Post , who came from the Canadian Bearing Point company , were halted . Modern Ruins On the periphery of this modernization drama in central Amman , people with a vested interest in this place were not on the mind of the city planner nor on that of the executor of the plans . People were , in reality , the last to know and the first to be injured . And these people include large swathes of the business sector and its various industries , since the area counts as a base for the food supplies business generally . Also within the area there is a concentration of the oldest central markets for vegetables , clothes , and secondhand clothes . The area is a core place for the informal commercial and service sector , via hundreds of street vendors ( thousands during the peak time ) , and a specialized market for the Asian migrant workforce , especially on Friday . This is because it contains much of the secondhand business in Amman , especially that of the furniture sector . On top of that , the shopping public , whether daily commuters or visitors of the town center , makes a habit of depending on this market . The closure of the Raghadan Complex in 2003 represented a point of clear transformation , and which immediately split \u201c Wast Al - Balad \u201d ( the city center ) into two primary sections : east of Al - Husseini mosque and west of Al - Husseini mosque . The impact is focused on the east of the mosque , since the traffic that ran to and from the Raghadan Complex and that used to attract activity and various jobs stopped . In 2009 , the Municipality executed a project to redesign and rebuild the Hashemite Plaza . For this purpose , it shuttered numerous restaurants and cafes that were open 24 hours in order to serve the needs of their visitors and especially those of migrants . This is at odds with the situation today , because today these businesses are popular with families . Gradually , but notably and hasteningly , silence prevailed in this lively area . Though an observer from afar could believe that the people had moved to the new complex in Al - Mahatta , this complex now sees quiet since the first hours of the evening , and the activity within it has no comparison with that of the previous Raghadan Complex . So where did the people disappear to ? This question was not asked by the city planner nor by the decision maker . However , the city planner began to bemoan the traffic in other locations . This traffic was a result of the transportation choices that people made in response to the malfunction that these changes brought about . The modes of transportation of residents became fragmented . For example , the decision makers did not notice that despite the gradual increase in the number of residents in the capital , the number of cars active on the \u201c Service \u201d routes towards East Amman shrank , since the drivers used their public car licenses to work in other locations . If someone walked to Al - Mahatta street , ( King Abdullah I Street ) in the area between Raghadan Tourist Complex and Al - Nasha bridge , and took a long look to their right , towards the area where the Municipality proposed to place its fanciful plans ( restaurants , hotels , swimming pools , markets , playgrounds and recreation ) , their eye would receive many scenes of what would appear to be ruins . The Municipality did not have the time to remove the majority of them after it had appropriated and demolished the establishments and old buildings . As usual , the adaptability of poor workers in the informal sector allowed them to spread and to respread continuously in empty urban spaces , and this is indeed what occurred in this area . Between the places that vacated , a space was formed . It is located between Al - Mahatta complex for transportation , \u201c the new complex , \u201d and between the secondhand clothes market of Al - Mahatta , which was established in 1984 after the evacuation of secondhand clothes sellers from \u201c Al - Jora \u201d area in Saqif Al - Sail , as I mentioned . Activity located on the margin of the margin quickly spread to it , represented by dozens of tool stands and semi-damaged goods that were usually gathered by dumpster divers , brought to the market , reclassified , and presented to poor customers of the surrounding area , and the poor last users of public transportation . Meeting Again The recently persecuted and marginalized and laid off from the center of Amman gradually met in a nearby location which soon united , and quickly formed the biggest market for simple secondhand goods . These products are usually abandoned where they lie by their owners if no one is found to buy them . One example is makeup tools and used red lipstick . Naturally , another activity emerged comprising of stands selling unassembled parts , which enable the expert customer to gather the complementing parts they need . When I undertook the first study of the informal sector in 1997/1998 , the number of \u201c dumpster divers \u201d was limited and they hardly knew one another . They were called \u201c night divers \u201d as opposed to \u201c day divers , \u201d who gathered furniture and used tools from houses . Night dumpster diving began after midnight and ended at sunrise in the known streets , and one or two people specialized in each street . That was before this activity grew to include the dumpsters of all neighborhoods of the capital and many shifts daily . Dumpster diving was no longer limited to nighttime . Persecution campaigns against the marginalized have not stopped in central Amman in twenty years . Despite the perseverance of the marginalized , they do n't have the power to negotiate , and therefore they never grow weary of responding in a pragmatic way . So they modify their ways of work , and some of them might move to the mountains , and many work in the licensed popular markets on some days of the week , and they might switch the type of goods or services that they work in . The decision maker of central Amman sees a decline in human presence there , and believes that the development plan succeeded , but he does not ask : where did the people go ? To be fair , some of the urban and administrative changes promoted other significant activity in the center of Amman . This is represented by the great number of popular cafes . Professor of architecture Rami Dahir describes this as \u201c Bab Al - Hara Decorations , \u201d the famous Syrian series , because in his opinion it does not reflect a particular popular dimension . Less than a year ago , I visited an old man who has worked as a shoemaker in central Amman for more than a half century . Thanks to his career , he knows the types of passersby and pedestrians in central Amman . He said to me : the people that we know disappeared , and they are not passing by anymore .","annotations":[{"text":"Amman","span":[43,47],"token_span":[8,8],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location that the change takes place."},{"text":"in the 1960s","span":[155,166],"token_span":[26,28],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the Entity undergoes the transformation."},{"text":"markets","span":[1177,1183],"token_span":[218,218],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The concrete or abstract entity that undergoes a change."},{"text":"by all classes of society","span":[1222,1246],"token_span":[224,228],"role":"Attribute","label":"Attribute","role_definition":"A characteristic of the Entity for which a quality can be assigned or determined by calculation, measurement, or observation."},{"text":"\u201c popular markets","span":[1418,1434],"token_span":[263,265],"role":"Final_category","label":"Final_category","role_definition":"The type of Entity that results from the change."},{"text":"central markets","span":[1470,1484],"token_span":[271,272],"role":"Initial_category","label":"Initial_category","role_definition":"The category that the Entity belongs to before it undergoes the change."},{"text":"a marketplace for secondhand European clothes","span":[1661,1705],"token_span":[307,312],"role":"Final_quality","label":"Final_quality","role_definition":"The quality of the Attribute that results from the change."}],"trigger":null},"split":"dev","frame_definition":"An Entity changes, either in its category membership, its situation, or in terms of the quality of an Attribute.","frame_ancestors":["Transition_to_state","Event"],"frame_descendants":["Improvement_or_decline","Nuclear_process","Undergo_transformation"]},{"instance_id":"EN-0213-433-frame-Undergo_transformation","frame":"Undergo_transformation","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"In mid-1996 , sales of Hanes / L'eggs hosiery had dropped another 9 percent in the past year , and they closed a distribution center in Illinois .

McGuire 's company last year loosened its dress code , permitting pants in the office . McGuire 's switch to a blazer , trousers and flats instead of a suit with a skirt , stockings and high heels for work is being repeated millions of times around the country with varying degrees of informality . The trend has , of course , changed the business of apparel retailing forever . But it also is hurting sales in the $ 2.2 billion sheer - hosiery market . Chicago - based Sara Lee Corp. , the country 's leading manufacturer and marketer of sheer hosiery , has been feeling the negative impact of the casual trend for several years . Sara Lee 's mass - marketed L'Eggs brand , its department store brand Hanes , and its up - market Donna Karan and DKNY hosiery lines together have about 47 percent of the market , according to a recent report from Prudential Securities . Sara Lee also is a leading hosiery company in Europe with brands including Dim in France , Pretty Polly in the United Kingdom and Vatter in Germany . In June 1994 , after watching hosiery sales drop 5 to 7 percent a year for the previous three years , Sara Lee restructured and eliminated 8,300 jobs , cutting U.S. hosiery capacity by 5 percent and making cuts in European manufacturing as well . Since then , casual dress in the workplace has become even more firmly entrenched , and an increasing number of women are taking advantage of communications technology to work at home . The downward trend has continued to be reflected in Sara Lee 's numbers . In fiscal 1996 ended June 30 , the company reported legwear volumes declined 9 percent . This month Sara Lee closed a distribution center , which employed 110 people , in Champaign . The company attributed the move to excess capacity . Sara Lee certainly is n't alone in feeling the pinch . Hosiery manufacturers at all levels of the market are having to find new ways to attract customers . Stores now must stock a wide variety of sheers , opaques and figure - enhancing styles to meet customers ' varied modes of dressing . And in department stores , each of these styles must be represented in a range of prices -- from $ 4 to as much as $ 50 . \" Being in the sheer - hosiery business now is a struggle , \" said Kathy Reynolds , president of Kenosha , Ill . - based Jockey International 's women 's division . Jockey , whose Jockey for Her line of underwear boosted the company 's fortunes , has been in the hosiery business since 1988 , just in time for the casual trend to take its toll . But women have n't gone cold turkey on hosiery . In many professions , including law and accounting where women have become prominent , informal attire still is unacceptable . These women are willing to spend on hosiery at the high end of the market . Marsha Kreucher , a communications director at a company in Hillsdale , Mich . , recently was in Chicago for a seminar and found time to carefully match Hanes Sheer Resilience colors -- at $ 7 a pair -- with a dress she had just purchased . \" I still wear a skirt and hose to work every day , \" Kreuscher said . Each of the competitors in the market is trying to find a quality in its product for which it can charge a slightly higher price , boosting profits even though volume may be shrinking . In the department store arena , the average price for a pair of pantyhose is $ 7 . At Jockey , a midprice department store brand with prices ranging from $ 5 to $ 7 , the company emphasizes fit and comfort , which builds customer loyalty , according to Reynolds . \" One of the biggest complaints women have is the ( short ) life of the product . And one of the things that contributes to damage is if they do n't fit properly , \" she said . Though Sara Lee 's hosiery volume is down , its operating income in the U.S. hosiery business increased at a double - digit rate . That 's because the company is putting emphasis on products that promise benefits such as body shaping for women of the Baby Boom generation who may not be as trim as they used to be . Another product benefit helped by new weaving technology is the combination of sheerness for fashion and strength for wearability . These extras , which are being incorporated into all three of its U.S. lines , can boost the price of any item by $ 1 or more . Singer Tina Turner will be showing up in television commercials for Hanes this fall as the personification of that quality . \" It 's all about strength and beauty , \" the ad campaign says . Hanes also is sponsoring Turner 's concert tour , which will hit the United States later this year . Sara Lee also hopes to keep the interest of the customer for its lower - priced L'Eggs line with actress Jamie Lee Curtis as spokeswoman . Though women are buying fewer packages of stockings , they are n't necessarily scrimping on what they do buy . \" There is a lot of activity in the high end , \" said Jockey 's Reynolds . \" Women will buy moderately priced hose for every day , but turn to a designer line for an evening out or special occasions . \" One of the newest department store competitors is Wolford , a line from Austria , with prices starting at $ 36 for a simple sheer . Wolford promises a luxurious feel , coupled with durability . \" With the emphasis on designer lines and value - added items , the market could grow in terms of dollars , \" despite the downtrend in volume , Reynolds said .","annotations":[{"text":"in the $ 2.2 billion sheer - hosiery market","span":[622,664],"token_span":[115,123],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The concrete or abstract entity that undergoes a change."},{"text":"for several years","span":[826,842],"token_span":[153,155],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the Entity undergoes the transformation."},{"text":"mass - marketed L'Eggs brand","span":[858,885],"token_span":[160,164],"role":"Initial_category","label":"Initial_category","role_definition":"The category that the Entity belongs to before it undergoes the change."},{"text":"U.S.","span":[1394,1397],"token_span":[259,259],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location that the change takes place."},{"text":"in the high end","span":[5072,5086],"token_span":[966,969],"role":"Final_category","label":"Final_category","role_definition":"The type of Entity that results from the change."}],"trigger":null},"split":"dev","frame_definition":"An Entity changes from one kind of thing (Initial_category) to another kind of thing (Final_category).","frame_ancestors":["Undergo_change","Transition_to_state","Event"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-1104-100-frame-Undergoing","frame":"Undergoing","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"Death Egal died on May 3 , 2002 in Pretoria , South Africa while undergoing surgery at a military hospital .

The self - declared republic of Somaliland broke away from the rest of Somalia in 1991 .

The governments of Ethiopia and Djibouti were represented , said businessman Abdullahi Aden Hirsi . The Ethiopian delegation was led by the deputy minister of foreign affairs . Our correspondent says that Ethiopia is trying to divide Somalia and supports Somaliland 's independence , while Djibouti is pushing for Somali unity . Mr Egal 's long time opponents , Suleman Gal and Ahmed Silanyo , were also there . The vice- president of Somaliland , Dahir Riyale Kahin , was inaugurated as the new leader on Friday . Although seven days of national mourning have been declared , our correspondent says that flags are not flying at half - mast because the emblem includes holy Islamic words . Power-struggle Mr Egal , who had been undergoing treatment for a number of ailments - ranging from rheumatism and hypertension to diabetes and cancer - died from what are described as complications following surgery . Mohamed Egal had just had his term of office extended for another year in a final bid to secure the international recognition he craved . Somaliland managed to avoid the descent into anarchy seen in the rest of Somalia but our correspondent says that Mr Egal 's death raises fears of a power - struggle and possible instability . Mr Kahin comes from the Gudabirsi clan , whereas Mr Egal was a member of Somaliland 's dominant Issak clan .

His parents were Russian Jewish immigrants who had arrived in Britain from Lithuania in 1909 . Joseph 's original surname was Naviprutsky . The surname was changed when they immigrated . He was one of thirteen brothers and sisters , who chose to stay and perished in the Holocaust . Two younger brothers escaped with the Polish army in 1939 , and eventually reached Israel , where their families still live . The Newmans were married at New Briggate Synagogue , Leeds on the 11th June 1912 , prior to which Joseph had been living at 8 Gledhow Terrace and Tilly at 22 Whitlock Street . Both were tailors and pressers . They lived at 11 Kepler Street ( or Grove ) , Leeds , at the time of Isidore 's birth . Isodore was the middle of three brothers . The older was Benny ( Bernard ) , born in 1914 , who although extremely clever developed acute mental illness as a young man . He had to leave school in the sixth form having shown great promise and was in and out of institutions much of his life . He died in Hull in the 1970s or 80s . The other brother Montague , seventeen months younger , was slightly physically disabled . He eventually became a medical technician at the Royal Victoria Infirmary at Newcastle -upon - Tyne , married a non - Jewish woman and appears to have lost touch with the family after Joseph and Tilly died . The family moved to Durham in 1922 when Isidore was six years old . An old friend , Dr Nat Cannon ( living in Vancouver aged 94 , in 2007 ) remembers [ that ] the family lived at 6 Cross Street and Isidore 's uncle Isaac Cohen ( Tilly 's brother ) resided at 9 Cross Street . The Durham City Directory for 1913 listed Joseph and Isaac as ' general dealers ' . Both Isidore and Nat attended St Margaret 's Elementary School ( on the honours board at the school , listing the pupils who went on to Grammar School , Isidore 's name was added in 1927 ) and later Johnston 's Grammar School . Isidore attended the Synagogue at 107 Laburnum Avenue of the small Durham community , where his father was a cantor . Isidore was a keen athlete , enjoying cricket , football , swimming and cycling , but was especially interested in learning French . He successfully completed his matriculation , aged sixteen and Higher School Certificate , at eighteen and went up to Armstrong College Newcastle -upon - Tyne , then part of Durham University in 1934 to read French , English and Latin . He and Nat Cannon , studying Medicine , with their slight Geordie accents , met on occasion , although Nat was four years older . As Isidore wrote in his SOE file on the 18th August 1941 : - The exciting life of a young student began for me ; I studied , I played games , I was interested in everything French language , literature and customs was my special study . In June 1936 , at the beginning of the holiday , I decided to go to Belgium with a friend ( I corresponded with a young Belgian student at the time ) . We left over for Ostend , then Brussels . As it was necessary for us to write a thesis for our BA degree , we installed ourselves at the University there - in the ' Cite estugiantine ' in order to use the books in the library . When the thesis was finished , we went to Bruges and to Blankenberghe , then to the French coast for a few days ; finally from Antwerp , we returned to England . In 1937 , I obtained my BA Degree ( 2nd class honours ) and in 1938 , after a year of study , I obtained the DThPT ( Diploma in the Theory and Practice of Teaching ) from Kings College Newcastle . I left the University and settled in Hull as a teacher in a Primary School . Meanwhile , Isidore 's father was bankrupt by 1938 ( though he later became a successful cloth merchant ) and moved with his family to Hull , where he was able to find a poorly paid job . This was as shomer ( literally , ' guard ' or ' keeper ' , who ensures that food sold in the community 's shops and prepared for weddings , bar mitzvahs and other events , is strictly kosher ) . They lived at 62 Etherington Drive then later at 137 Clumber Street , Princess Avenue . Joseph died 10th April 1966 and Tilly died 28th March 1956 . Isidore became engaged in Hull , and was teaching at Middleton Street Boy 's School from September 1938 . ( The school was demolished in 1994 . ) Isidore joined the army on he 29th August 1940 ( 2350538 ) and trained as a radio telegraphist with the Royal Corps of Signals at Catterick for six months . Posted to Scarborough , he then was posted to Kent for four months as a signalman . He was commissioned as a First Lieutenant ( 216306 ) and finished training on July 1941 , moved to Sheffield with the 12th Light Anti Aircraft Regiment . Stationed with a Royal Artillery battery in Hull . On 1st August 1941 , Isidore was sent for Wireless Officer Training with SOE . He broke his leg whilst training in Scotland . Isidore Newman was sent to Wanborough Manor near Guildford , taking on the pseudonym of ' Matthieu Elliot ' to disguise his identity from other recruits . The course instructors soon noticed his less than perfect French - he 'd studied the language at university , but had only spent a couple of weeks on the Continent , travelling across Belgium and northern France - and they also had some concerns over his moodiness during his commando training in Scotland , but there was no question about his technical abilities and he proved himself a determined and dedicated student . On the 9th March 1944 , Newman was arrested by the Gestapo , following the capture of Claude Malraux . As well as these two , a total of some 80 members of the SALESMAN circuit were taken by the Germans . In the same roundup eighteen tons of arms were also seized . At the beginning of September 1944 Newman 's group was transferred to Mauthausen concentration camp , along with three other ' F ' Section inmates , Sidney Jones , Marcus Bloom and Georges Clement . During 6th and 7th September Newman and his group were shot at or near the camp 's quarry , along with 40 agents from SOE 's Dutch section . His full story is told in Captain Isidore Newman SOE , Martin Sugarman , Jewish Historical Studies , 2007 . See also SOE Profiles by Nigel Perrin , for a more detailed history of his operations as an SOE agent . Isidore Newman was awarded a posthumous M.B.E. in 1946 , and is commemorated at the Brookwood Memorial in Surrey , the SOE memorial at Mauthausen and the ' F ' Section memorial at Valen\u00e7ay in France .

Possibly the best information I took away from the biotechnology documentary \u201c The Future of Food \u201d is the location of a great little Mexican restaurant right around the corner from the theater hosting the screening . And let me tell you , if you plan on seeing this film , you will appreciate knowing where to find good Mexican food when it 's over . Mouthwatering shots of tortillas and tacos serve to highlight one of writer / director Deborah Koons Garcia 's main concerns about biotech crops : Despite our best efforts , genetically modified ( GM ) plants can spread their genes where they are not welcome . In rural Mexico , considered to be the birthplace of corn , Koons Garcia worries that some protected varieties are being contaminated with transgenic corn from the U.S. , threatening biodiversity . Depending on your perspective , it might not help that her argument is based exclusively on research by a University of California , Berkeley , professor whose paper on the subject was retracted from Nature five months after it appeared in print . But then , how a viewer reacts to the messages in \u201c The Future of Food \u201d will be entirely based on perspective . When the house lights went up , fellow moviegoers either patted each other on the back for buying only organic foods or walked out grumbling accusations of propaganda . Phrases like \u201c preaching to the choir \u201d and \u201c fear-mongering \u201d also rippled through the crowd . In general , Koons Garcia glosses over the science of genetic engineering , instead focusing on the legal ramifications of \u201c patenting life \u201d and whether GM crops have enough federal oversight to protect public health . Simple animations of gel electrolysis and recombinant technology were significantly less memorable than the repeated images of crop dusting and the weepy faces of family farmers caught in a corporate power struggle . In one segment , Koons Garcia chronicles the story of a Canadian farmer whose livelihood was compromised when Monsanto found samples of its patented Roundup Ready canola on his field . Aside from perhaps justifiable allegations of corporate greed , both farmer and filmmaker seem horrified that scientists are tampering with the genes of a popular and economically vital crop like canola . Koons Garcia never mentions that canola \u2014 short for Canadian Oil \u2014 was created in the 1970s when a pair of plant breeders used a scalpel and gas chromatograph to engineer an oilseed rape plant with low levels of erucic acid , a potential culprit in heart disease . The technique was less sophisticated , but the results were the same : a genetically modified version of a common crop . Such oversights , combined with a proliferation of voices from only one side of the fence , ultimately undermine the film 's credibility . The lack of balance is especially frustrating because the film does present several valid concerns about the biotech revolution : Should businesses have the right to patent genes ? Will we be able to control crossbreeding between wild and transgenic plants ? How will people physically react to designer foods , and will we even know when we are eating them ? These concerns are not new , however , and the film adds little information about efforts to address them . Koons Garcia 's proposed solution is that we the people should ban GM crops completely and demand organic farming , which in the end makes \u201c The Future of Food \u201d seem less like a documentary and more like a 91 - minute advertisement .","annotations":[{"text":"Canadian","span":[2177,2184],"token_span":[387,387],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the place where the Agent uses the Instrument."},{"text":"in the 1970s","span":[2590,2601],"token_span":[453,455],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the Agent uses the Instrument."},{"text":"a pair of plant breeders","span":[2608,2631],"token_span":[457,461],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent uses the Instrument to achieve their Purpose."},{"text":"a scalpel and gas chromatograph","span":[2638,2668],"token_span":[463,467],"role":"Instrument","label":"Instrument","role_definition":"An entity directed by the Agent that serves to bring about the Purpose of the Agent."},{"text":"to engineer an oilseed rape plant with low levels of erucic acid","span":[2670,2733],"token_span":[468,479],"role":"Purpose","label":"Purpose","role_definition":"This role identifies the purpose for which an Agent uses the Instrument."}],"trigger":null},"split":"dev","frame_definition":"An Agent manipulates an Instrument in order to achieve a Purpose.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":["Attempt_means","Detonate_explosive","Expend_resource","Operating_a_system","Operate_vehicle","Use_firearm"]},{"instance_id":"EN-5069-604-frame-Vehicle_landing","frame":"Vehicle_landing","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"This is in contrast with the Surveyor 1 , which was able to be reactivated twice after lunar nights , but then never again .

Half a century later , where have those Surveyor 3 artifacts ended up today ? Apollo 12 crewmates Charles \" Pete \" Conrad and Alan Bean achieved the first precise lunar touchdown on Nov. 19 , 1969 , landing within walking distance of the Surveyor 3 spacecraft . On their second of two moonwalks , Conrad and Bean ventured over to the robotic probe , which by then had been on the moon for two and a half years . \" Hey , we got a nice brown Surveyor here ... well , raise the visor and it 's not so brown , but it 's tan , \" described Bean as he lifted his helmet 's gold - coated visor to get a clear look at the previously white lander . Related : Apollo 12 in Pictures : NASA 's Pinpoint Moon Landing Mission More : Apollo 12 Had the Funniest Crew . Here 's Why A short time later , as he and Conrad continued to inspect Surveyor , Bean found it was not tan , or brown , after all . \" We thought this thing had changed color , but I think it 's just dust , \" said Bean . \" We rubbed into that battery , and it 's good and shiny again . \" Following their training and checklists , the astronauts collected a scoop from the probe 's soil mechanics - surface sampler , a section of unpainted aluminum tube from a strut supporting the Surveyor 's radar altimeter and Doppler velocity sensor , another section of aluminum tube that was coated with inorganic white paint and a segment of television cable wrapped in aluminized plastic film . And there was the Surveyor 's camera . \" That 's ours ! \" exclaimed Conrad , as the camera came loose . \" We got her ! \" replied Bean . The Apollo 12 moonwalkers returned the camera and other parts to their lunar module , \" Intrepid . \" Later that same day , 31 hours after they arrived , Conrad and Bean lifted off of the moon to rendezvous with their third crewmate , Richard \" Dick \" Gordon , on the command module \" Yankee Clipper \" and begin their journey back to Earth . Accompanying them were 75 pounds ( 34 kilograms ) of moon rocks and 20 pounds ( 9 kilograms ) of probe hardware . Related : Truth of the Moon : The Brave Voyage of Apollo 12 | Video Show Surveying Surveyor Like the moon rocks , the Surveyor 3 parts were returned to Earth for study . For the first time , scientists and engineers had an opportunity to analyze equipment after it being subjected to long - term exposure on the lunar surface . \" The returned material and photographs have been studied and evaluated by 40 teams of engineering and scientific investigators over a period of more than one year , \" wrote Surveyor program manager Benjamin Milwitzky in the 1971 report on the studies ' findings . More than 80 researchers carefully examined the returned Surveyor parts for the effects of radiation and lunar dust exposure . As it turned out , Conrad and Bean had been correct \u2014 Surveyor 3 did change color and it was partly due to lunar dust adhesion . Sun exposure , over the course of 32 lunar days , had also caused paint to fade . Related : How a Passionate Scientist 's Eye Led to the 1st Pinpoint Moon Landing The engineering studies found that the TV camera and other hardware exhibited no signs of failure , which led Milwitzky to conclude , \" that the state of technology , even as it existed [ prior to the Surveyor 3 launch in 1966 ] , is capable of producing reliable hardware that makes feasible long - life lunar and planetary installations . \" Other studies looked at the probe 's equipment for the effects of the solar wind and micrometeorite impacts . About the latter , the research concluded that none of the visible surface features were of meteoritic origin . Bacteria that was found within the television camera was initially thought to have been deposited before Surveyor 3 was launched to the moon , meaning that it had survived for 31 months on the moon . Later studies found that it was more likely to have been the result of contamination from the team inspecting the camera after it was returned to Earth , as a result of poor clean room procedures . Surveyor souvenirs After the studies were complete , NASA placed some of the Surveyor 3 parts into storage , alongside the moon rock and soil samples being preserved by the Lunar Receiving Laboratory ( later , Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility ) at Johnson Space Center in Houston . Others made their way to museums \u2014 and elsewhere . \" NASA treats them as lunar samples , not as artifacts , \" said Michael Neufeld , a senior curator in the space history department at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington , DC . \" We have the Surveyor 3 camera on loan . \" The television camera is currently in storage , as the gallery where it has been exhibited is being renovated . It is expected to return to display with the opening of the new Exploring the Planets exhibition in 2022 . The Cosmosphere space museum in Hutchinson , Kansas exhibits the scoop from the soil sampler , which is also on loan from NASA . Another piece of the sampler is on display at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , California . NASA also loaned or gifted Surveyor 3 parts to some of its leaders . Before arriving at the Smithsonian , the Surveyor 3 camera was presented to William Pickering on his retirement as the director of JPL in 1976 . The sampler scoop 's motor gear box cover was placed with an American flag that was flown on Apollo 12 in a clear tube and mounted on a wooden base for presentation to NASA 's chief scientist John Naugle for his \" many contributions to the nation 's scientific efforts in space . \" After Naugle 's death in 2013 , his family returned the display to NASA 's headquarters in Washington , DC , where it is today . \" When John Naugle 's daughter returned the Surveyor 3 memento to us , it had a sticker on the bottom that said something like , ' To be returned to NASA , ' \" wrote Bill Barry , NASA 's chief historian , in an email to collectSPACE.com . Another piece , the color filter wheel from the television camera , remains in private hands . NASA presented the Surveyor 3 artifact to Edgar Cortright , director of Langley Research Center in Hampton , Virginia , from 1968 to 1975 . After he died in 2014 , Cortright 's son confirmed that NASA considers the filter wheel to be his family 's property , but has plans to eventually share it with the public . \" While I do intend to donate it at some point as I think it belongs at the museum , I decided to hold onto it for a while as a memory of my father , \" said Dave Cortright . That pieces were loaned or gifted as souvenirs is not unheard of , said Neufeld . \" There is some precedent from human [ spaceflight ] missions , people would take things out of the spacecraft and turn them into gifts or the astronauts would take things home , \" he said . \" So there has been this tradition of turning these things into awards for people at NASA . \" That said , both Barry and Neufeld agree that having the Surveyor 3 parts available today , 50 years after they were returned to Earth , has merit . \" There is much to be learned from Surveyor 3 , \" said Barry . \" Studying the Surveyor artifacts currently on Earth again with new techniques could , I presume , bear new information . \" \" [ They are ] something that were on the moon that you can look at , something that was recovered from the moon and is in the spectacular pictures from Apollo 12 of the astronauts at Surveyor , \" said Neufeld . \" You can say , ' That thing in this photo is this object that is sitting right in front of you . \u201d Click through to collect SPACE to see more photos of the Apollo 12 - retrieved parts of the Surveyor 3 probe . - Apollo 12 Was Struck By Lightning Right After Launch ...

Sept. 23 , 2009 -- Former child - star Mackenzie Phillips , whose life has been marred by drug abuse and arrests , confessed today that she engaged in a 10 - year consensual sexual relationship with her father , rock star John Phillips . Phillips , 49 , the former star of ' 70s - ' 80s sitcom \" One Day at a Time , \" told Oprah Winfrey that she was first raped by her father in a hotel room when she was 18 while passed out after a drug binge but continued to use drugs and have consensual sex with him for years . The relationship continued long after she married Jeff Sessler when she was 19 , and ended only when she became pregnant and feared her father was the baby 's father , Phillips said . John Phillips , she said , paid for an abortion . Reading an excerpt from her new book , \" High on Arrival , \" on Winfrey 's show today , Phillips said of her first sexual experience with her father : \" I woke up that night from a blackout to find myself having sex with my father . I do n't know how it started . \" She was raped by her father , lead singer of the Mamas and the Papas , in the hotel room in the late 1970s , Phillips said . \" For a moment , I was in my body for a horrible truth , \" she said of waking up and realizing she had had sex with her father . \" I boxed it away . I started very early on in my life compartmentalizing . ... This was the mother of all difficult experiences . ... I [ have spent ] the last 30 years trying not to look at it , \" she said . Michelle Phillips , Mackenzie Phillips ' stepmother and a member of the ' 60s group the Mamas and the Papas , told the Hollywood Reporter she believed the allegations were false . Phillips said Mackenzie had \" a lot of mental illness \" and that \" she 's had a needle stuck up her arm for 35 years . \" \" Mackenzie is jealous of her siblings , who have accomplished a lot and did not become drug addicts , \" Michelle said . Mackenzie Phillips told Winfrey she confronted her father about the rape , but he characterized their relationship as romantic , Mackenzie said . \" After the first experience , I went to my father and said we need to talk about how you raped me . My dad said : ' Raped you ? Do n't you mean made love ? ' In that moment , I thought I 'm really on my own here . \" In 1980 , soon after she 'd been fired from \" One Day at a Time \" because of her out - of - control drug use , Phillips began to travel with her father 's new band , the New Mamas and the Papas . It was during that time , she said , that she began regularly doing drugs and having sex with her father . \" It did n't happen every day , it did n't happen every week , but it certainly happened and happened many times , \" she said . Mackenzie Phillips Forgave Her Father \" It became a consensual relationship over time . I ca n't believe I 'm the only one this happened to , \" she said . \" No matter what kind of incest , it is an abuse of power ... a betrayal of trust . \" She forgave her father on his deathbed , but his death , in 2001 , relaunched her abuse of drugs , Phillips said . In excerpts from \" High on Arrival \" printed in People magazine , Phillips writes : \" On the eve of my wedding , my father showed up , determined to stop it . I had tons of pills and dad had tons of everything too . Eventually I passed out on Dad 's bed . \" I was a fragment of a person , and my secret isolated me , \" she writes , according to People . \" One night Dad said , ' We could just run away to a country where no one would look down on us . There are countries where this is an accepted practice . Maybe Fiji . ' \" Phillips was supposed to be reunited last year with her former television co-stars on the \" Rachael Ray Show \" but was arrested at Los Angeles International airport for possessing cocaine . Former co-star Valerie Bertinelli learned of Phillip 's incestuous relationship while backstage during the taping of the Winfrey show . \" You 're only as sick as your secrets , \" Bertinelli told her old friend and said she regretted not being there to help Phillips earlier .

U.S. forces have massed ships and helicopters near the disaster areas and devoted their efforts to cargo transportation , search , rescue and recovery work and carrying SDF members to their destinations . These coordinated relief activities at the disaster sites are expected to deepen the Japan - U.S. alliance . Especially noteworthy among the various relief activities are early efforts by the U.S. military to restore the damaged Sendai Airport , one of the most important transportation bases in the devastated region . The airport , directly hit by tsunami , could not be used due to the rubble and wrecked automobiles strewn across its runways . U.S. marines stationed in Okinawa Prefecture arrived there and started to remove the debris . Thanks to their efforts , the airport could resume part of its functions and serve as an emergency landing field for helicopters and other aircraft carrying relief materials . An expert said the action was based on the military principle that troops cannot conduct operations unless materials move first . The U.S. military also was transporting food , water , medicine , blankets , clothes and supplies by helicopters belonging to its fleet , including the USS Ronald Reagan , a nuclear - powered aircraft carrier , in seas off the Sanriku coast . A U.S. Marine Corps amphibious landing ship , the USS Tortuga , transported about 280 members and 94 vehicles of the Ground Self - Defense Force from Tomakomai , Hokkaido , to Ominato , Aomori Prefecture , on Wednesday and Thursday . On Saturday , U.S. forces supported helicopter transportation in seas off Hachinohe , Aomori Prefecture . U.S. marines based in Okinawa Prefecture have also participated in relief activities . Three U.S. naval vessels , including the amphibious assault ship USS Essex with 2,200 members of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard , are involved in relief activities in the Sea of Japan off Akita Prefecture . The troops use Yamagata Airport as a base for transporting fuel and materials to the disaster areas . This is the first time that the U.S. military has used a private airport in Japan for anything other than emergency landings , according to a senior member of the Defense Ministry . Sources close to the ministry commented that deployment of U.S. forces around Japan might be similar if a contingency were to occur on the Korean Peninsula . The U.S. military is also helping Japan deal with the reactor accidents at the Fukushima nuclear power plant . They have loaned 100 sets of nuclear protective gear to members of the SDF and other organizations involved . However , the U.S. Defense Department announced that it has prohibited U.S. soldiers from coming within 50 miles ( about 80 kilometers ) of the Fukushima nuclear power plant . The announcement reflects the apparent seriousness with which the U.S. government views the situation of the stricken reactors . Meanwhile , Adm . Robert Willard , commander of the U.S. Pacific Command , was planning to leave the United States for Japan on Saturday . In Japan , he will meet Gen. Ryoichi Oriki , chief of staff of the Self - Defense Force 's Joint Staff . Sources close to the Japanese government said Willard 's visit to Japan \" shows a strong sense of crisis on the side of the U.S. government . \" ( Mar. 20 , 2011 ) The Daily Yomiuri , The Yomiuri Shimbun Topics Media Data Info Link WASEDA ONLINE Chuo Online Mobile Phone | Web Site Policies | About Us| Privacy Policy | Copyright | Linking Policy | Contact Us| | \u00a9 The Yomiuri Shimbun .","annotations":[{"text":"the amphibious assault ship USS Essex with 2,200 members of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard","span":[2037,2137],"token_span":[340,355],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent puts effort into reaching Goal."},{"text":"relief","span":[2157,2162],"token_span":[360,360],"role":"Goal","label":"Goal","role_definition":"The Goal is what the Agent expends effort to achieve."},{"text":"in the Sea of Japan off Akita Prefecture","span":[2175,2214],"token_span":[362,369],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The place where the work is done."},{"text":"Mar. 20 , 2011","span":[3576,3589],"token_span":[614,617],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time when the effort occurs."}],"trigger":null},"split":"dev","frame_definition":"An Agent expends effort towards achieving a Goal.","frame_ancestors":["Attempt","Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":["Seeking_to_achieve","Seeking","Shopping"]},{"instance_id":"EN-7382-240-frame-Working_a_post","frame":"Working_a_post","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"The interiors of each tank are fully recreated with either a human or AI manning each station .

To anyone with no idea what Red Orchestra is , let me help out : It 's a multiplayer FPS , set on the Eastern front of World War 2 , which captures above all else the grayness and desperation of those nightmare battlefields . Red Orchestra is a game of wincing at suppressive fire , of bayonet attacks , and of struggling to figure out whether that figure is a German or a Russian because muddy gray and muddy brown often look the same in dim lighting . The sequel 's looking to expand on everything that made the original game great , including its horrific tank combat . Here , we present an exclusive interview with Tripwire President John Gibson , in which he talks freely on the as-of - yesterday unrevealed vehicle combat coming in the sequel . RPS : You mentioned that you plan to set the standard of tank combat in FPS games for years to come . How , exactly ? John Gibson : The big thing we 're doing with tanking for ROHOS is to really immerse the player in what it was like to be an actual soldier inside of one of these lumbering beasts in World War 2 . The typical FPS tanking experience generally has the player viewing the tank from third person , and the player essentially feels like they ARE the tank rather than feeling like they are a person in a tank . For ROHOS our goal is to move beyond that and provide the player with an immersive and robust first person experience . For starters we have fully modeled the entire interior of every tank in the game . At any position in the tank the player will see what a real person in the tank would see . Look down and you 'll see your hands operating all of the levers . Move between positions and it will be fully animated in first person . And your tank will have a full crew of either AI NPC 's or human players to fight alongside you . Look to your right and you will see the hull machine gunner blasting away at the enemy . Fire the main cannon , and you 'll see an NPC crewman reloading the cannon shell beside you . You have a living breathing crew all around you and you can see all of the elements of the tank operating . When a shell penetrates your armor , you 'll see your crewmates die around you , and hear their screams as the tank catches fire . Beyond this we have added a whole new level of functionality and interaction to the tanks . The first thing that we 've done is what we call a virtual interior . The player can actually look around in the interior and very easily interact with the interior . Want to look out of a view slit , just look at the slit and press a button . Want to stick your head out of the hatch , look up and press a button . It is all very streamlined and allows the player to do a lot of things but very simply . We 're actual giving players very near to a tank simulation 's level of functionality , but streamlined so it is easy to use and accessible . Speaking of view , one of the things we discovered after we shipped the original Red Orchestra was that while the view inside a tank is somewhat limited , there are a LOT of view ports , view slits , and periscopes that the tank crew had at their disposal to get a better view of what is happening outside of the tank . So for ROHOS we have added the ability to very easily interact with any of these and get a better view of the situation . Another area which we 've greatly expanded on is the damage system . The original RO had a generalized damage system with just a few key damageable components . For ROHOS we 've expanded this to include a very broad range of damageable components with accompanying gameplay effects . Things such as damaging optics , damaging the engine and transmission , damaging the turret rotation mechanism , hitting the fuel tank , drive sprocket , treads and more are now included . And now shots that penetrate the tank armor can hit the crewmembers inside . RPS : Can you repair tank damage ? And what amount of damage can be repaired ? JG : We are actually a bit torn on repairing damage on the tanks . Realistically there are n't a lot of repairs that you could do to a tank within the time frame of a match in ROHOS . But not allowing repairs leads to unrealistic gameplay where everyone always fights to the death , instead of retreating for repairs when they are too damaged to continue fighting . We 're looking at the idea of allowing tanks to be repaired at the resupply areas . This is something we 're still prototyping and trying different things , so we 'll have to wait and see what the final system ends up being . RPS : Will we see any playable vehicles other than tanks ? JG : For the initial release we 're going to ship with two medium tanks \u2013 the T34 76 and the Panzer IV . I know that might not seem like a lot , but for ROHOS our goal with the vehicles was to focus on quality over quantity . In tank simulations you typically only see a couple of drivable tank in the game . This is due to the sheer amount of work required to implement a vehicle at that level of detail . And for ROHOS , we 're actually implemented tanks at a level of detail and functionality far beyond tank sims or any existing game . Tripwire has a philosophy though when it comes to releasing games . We like to give gamers a lot of value for their money when they buy a game from us at launch , but they can also count on getting even more out of their game in the form of free content packs . We 've put out a LOT of free additional content for the original Red Orchestra as well as Killing Floor . So we do already have four additional vehicles in production and those will likely come out in our first free content pack not long after the launch . The four additional vehicles will be two more tanks and two troop transports . RPS : Awesome as they were , in the past I 've found tanks in RO can be a source of frustration - either getting slaughtered by them as a fleshy little infantryman , or finding yourself inside one with a crew that does n't know what they 're doing . Were you planning to address either of these situations ? JG : A lot of our work for ROHOS for both tanks and infantry has been to make a game that stays true to its realism roots while also being much more accessible than the original game . Infantry versus tanks is a tricky thing to balance in a game that aims to be both realistic and accessible , because tanks really should do very well against infantry . For us one of the things we learned during and after the release of RO : Ostfront was that making good combined arms gameplay is about putting tanks in situations where they are vulnerable to infantry . We found that in the right setting , tanks can be at a serious disadvantage to infantry . In the first game we put infantry in a lot of scenarios fighting tanks in their element \u2013 wide open landscapes fighting infantry . These scenarios end up with happy tankers and unhappy infantrymen . So we 've taken what we 've learned from the first game and applied that to the levels in ROHOS . Now when we do combined arms levels , we make sure that there is plenty of cover and concealment so that the infantry can more easily get the drop on the tanks . We 've also given the infantry some additional tools for their tank fighting arsenal in the form of semi-automatic anti tank rifles , and anti tank grenades . Regarding making tanks less frustrating , let me just say \u2013 we hear you . Tanking in RO : Ostfront at its best was an amazing experience you could n't get anywhere else , but at its worst could be an exercise in frustration . The biggest issue we found was that tanking with other random public players was extremely frustrating , especially if they did n't know what they were doing or were n't using their microphone . To address this we 've made a lot of changes for ROHOS . First off , players will never have to tank with some one that they do n't want to . When a player chooses a tank role they have the option of locking the tank , or allowing other people to join their crew . Another frustrating thing was standing around waiting for a tank to spawn . Tankers now always spawn inside their tank , and respawn with their tank . Additionally every level will feature enough tanks so that every tanker will have a tank . Since tanking with random public players was frustrating in the first game players usually ended up tanking by themselves . Because the tanks in the game were designed to be crewed by three people , tanking by yourself was cumbersome requiring the player to constantly switch between positions . This was neither realistic nor fun , as a tank would never leave base in a real battle with just one tank crewman . So to address this the big feature we 're adding that I 've touched on a little bit already is the AI crew . When you choose to tank by yourself you will now have a fully functional intelligent AI crew at your disposal . You can choose to play any of the main positions in the tank still , but now the AI will handle the rest for you . If you just want to drive around , the AI crew will man the MGs and take out infantry for you , or fire the main cannon at enemy tanks . If you want to operate the main cannon , you can use your movement keys to easily give orders to the driver to move the tank . If commanding is your thing , you can take the command position and designate targets for the AI crew to attack , give locational movement orders to the tank driver using a 3d command widget or the overhead map , give normal movement commands using the movement keys , spot artillery targets with your binoculars , and more . And with a full live AI crew the player can instantly switch between any of these positions assuming the role of that AI crewmember , and the AI will dynamically take over the functionality in the position you just left . Now there is a catch . If an AI crewmember is killed the player will need to move to the position of the dead crewmember to perform the function of that crewmember . And transitions to the position of a dead crewmember will be a real first person animated transition that will take time . The good news is , if you lose a crew member you can go to a vehicle resupply station and get your tank reinforced with fresh crewmembers . And the player can mix and match other human players with the AI crew members . There are a lot of other things we 've done to refine tanking and make it more accessible . In the first game people found the in tank view very limiting , either because they did n't understand that you could zoom in on the view slits or open the hatches , or because we did n't provide all of the views that the real tank actually had . So for the new game we will have a training mission that will familiarize the player with the tank functionality , including the use of the view system so they do n't get in the battlefield and think the only view they have is a tiny slit that is feet from their face . Additionally , as I mentioned before we 've added a lot of additional view ports that the real tanks actually had , and created a system to easily look out of them . This makes the view system a lot more robust and tanking in general easier in the new game . There are a lot of small things too like refining the controls . One example would be we now use a more intuitive mouse based aiming system which better mimics how players aim with their first person weapon as an infantry soldier . RPS : Hang on . If you can choose to lock your tank with an AI crew , do the AI count towards your team 's playercount ? Because if they do n't you 're giving your side a couple of bots , for free , no ? And if they do , you 're limiting how many people get to tank on your team . JG : The AI Crew does n't count toward the playercount . On combined arms maps , the infantry are good for fighting in the buildings and the tanks are good in the open areas . So for the players it will be a decision of where they want to allocate their human players . For example , let 's say you are playing with 64 players and there are ten tanks . You could have 1 human player in each tank with a full AI Crew and then have 54 infantry players . Or you could have 30 human players in tanks ( 3 human players filling the playable positions in each tank ) and then only have 24 infantry players . Or you could do something in between . It all sounds pretty complicated , but the way it is presented to the players in game is pretty simple and streamlined . The key thing here is that every tank rolls out with a full crew either human or AI NPC , and no one is ever left standing around at the base waiting for a tank to appear . RPS : I 'd guess that finding statistics to build a simulation of WW2 small arms is a lot easier than finding info on tanks . How 's researching this been ? JG : Basically , small arms were around in huge quantities and can even be bought in working order today . People still use them . Tanks were n't \u2013 and are n't . The tanks of the period were practically obsolete by the end of the war and there are very few left running today . Tech was moving so fast that there was also relatively limited research conducted on the \u201c old tech \u201d \u2013 everyone was too busy gearing up for the cold war . The research and documentation that WAS done had been done under war-time conditions , was sketchy , too much guess - work \u2013 and half of it got lost anyway . All this adds up to making research on tanks a complete nightmare \u2013 certainly at the level of detail we needed . Exteriors were n't too bad . The interiors were really difficult \u2013 mostly some old photos , a few bits of plans , plus recent photos of the interior of ( mostly ) trashed old tanks . The T-34 is easier \u2013 there are at least more modern examples still around , although that means interpreting what the 1942 version was like . Add to that the whole business of armor technology and penetration in the 1940s , of course , and we 'd have to say it has been very hard . We worked with museums and archives ( Bovington , Littlefield 's , Patton Museum for a start ) to dig out the info , as well as some individuals who have made WWII armor tech their life 's work ! And all of that is just to get the information \u2013 after that we 've done a lot of additional work interpreting it and turning it into meaningful , working , accurate models in game ! RPS : If you were a tank , what kind of tank would you be ? JG : If you are talking about the tanks that are in ROHOS , the tanks are pretty well matched . If you are talking about WWII tanks in general , I would say the Panther . It was a great balance of armor , mobility , and firepower . Funny you should ask this though , as there is a long standing debate on the Red Orchestra forums about what the greatest tank of WWII was that has almost taken on a life of its own . As a matter of fact , it has gotten so big , that if you google \u201c greatest tank of ww 2 \u201d the discussion on the Red Orchestra forums is the top link that pops up . This thread has been going on for 4 years and has reached over 30 pages . Most people there will say that the Russian IS - 2 heavy tank is the best tank of WWII . It has reached the point where it is almost an inside joke among RO fans . We even have an IS - 2 emoticon in our forums ( http://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/images/smilies/is2.gif).

The reforms are being shelved to push the Children , Schools and Families Bill through parliament before it is dissolved before the general election . One - to - one tuition , a home education register and school report cards are among the abandoned plans for England . Mr Balls expressed his \" deep regret \" , but the Tories defended their position . Under the redrafted Bill , home school agreements , which give head teachers stronger powers to enforce parents ' responsibilities in maintaining good behaviour , have been dropped . Reforms of the primary school curriculum , allowing schools greater flexibility to tailor teaching to their children , have also been shelved , as have catch - up lessons , one - to - one tuition and small group support for pupils needing extra support . Mr Balls has been forced to drop plans for a licence to practise for teachers , as well as well as a requirement that local authorities carry out parental satisfaction surveys on secondary schools . The Bill will no longer give local authorities powers to intervene in schools causing concern and it will not give powers to the secretary of state to intervene in failing youth - offending teams . ' Significant setback ' In a letter to his Conservative shadow Michael Gove , Mr Balls said : \" I do believe the interests of children would have been better served had you agreed to these provisions reaching the statute book . \" Your refusal means the loss of a number of key provisions that would have made a significant difference to the lives of children and their families . \" It is a great pity that you have put at risk improvements in our schools , support for pupils , and the wellbeing of our young people . \" Mr Balls said if Labour won the election he would make sure these measures made it on to the statute book in the first session of the new Parliament . ' Wave of bureaucracy ' But the Conservatives said they had successfully blocked more bureaucracy for teachers . A spokesman said : \" This Bill would have meant a great new wave of bureaucracy swamping schools and it is good news that it has collapsed - teachers will breathe a sigh of relief . \" Mr Gove said the Tories had opposed plans to remove a parent 's right to veto sex education from the age of 15 because \" children are children until they are 16 , and after that they are adults \" . A spokesman stressed that the Tories were in favour of making PSHE statutory , but wanted to support the right of parents of 15 year olds to withdraw their children from these lessons . \" The government refused to allow parents to withdraw children under the age of consent from any sex education they considered inappropriate , \" he said . Mr Gove said the Tories had opposed government plans for one - to - one tuition for children who fall behind because head teachers had been against it , and because it was unnecessarily bureaucratic , tying the hands of teachers . ' Betrayal ' The Terrence Higgins Trust criticised the Tories for their failure to support compulsory sex education for pupils at age 15 . \" It 's a disgraceful betrayal of the next generation , \" said policy director Lisa Power . Sexual health charity Brook said it was \" extremely disappointed that young people could be let down yet again \" over sex education . National director Simon Blake said : \" A broad consensus has now been established between children , young people , parents and professionals in support of statutory sex and relationships education . \" All politicians must listen to this majority . \" The home educators ' group , Education Otherwise , welcomed the shelving of the compulsory register for home-educated children . \" There is a huge sense of relief that this has been rejected , \" said spokeswoman Ann Newstead . \" We are thankful for the support of opposition MPs who took the trouble to listen and engage with home educators . \" We are looking forward to the general election and the opportunity to make our feelings known by the way we vote at the ballot box . \"","annotations":[{"text":"Schools Secretary Ed Balls","span":[61,86],"token_span":[13,16],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent is the person who acts to leave behind the Theme."},{"text":"key reforms , including compulsory sex education for 15 - year-olds","span":[100,166],"token_span":[19,29],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The Theme is the entity that is relinguished to no one from the Agent's possession."},{"text":"before the general election","span":[335,361],"token_span":[58,61],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the Agent gives up the Theme."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Agent leaves behind a Theme effectively rendering it no longer within their control or of the normal security as one's property.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-2488-151-frame-Abusing","frame":"Abusing","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"Subsequently , a number of women made allegations against Casey that they were sexually abused by him , two of which received compensation following a High Court trial .

Fresh allegations against the former Bishop of Galway , who died in 2017 at the age of 89 , were made by his niece , Patricia Donovan , who in an interview with the Irish Mail on Sunday claimed she had been abused by him for more than a decade from the age of five . The newspaper also reported that Casey paid settlements to two other women who accused him of abusing them as children in the 1950s and 1960s , while a third settlement was made following his death . Patricia Donovan ( 56 ) said the abuse occurred across the dioceses of Galway , Kerry and Limerick . She reported the offences to UK police in 2005 , but no charges were brought . Casey fathered a child with US woman Annie Murphy in the 1970s , before she published details of their affair in a book titled Forbidden Fruit in 1993 , prompting his resignation . Describing her treatment at the hands of her uncle as \" horrific \" , Ms Donovan , who lives in England , said : \" It was rape , everything you imagine . It was the worst kind of abuse . \" Ms Donovan , through her solicitor , discovered that one of Casey 's settlements was made through the Residential Institutions Redress Board , established to compensate victims of institutional and clerical abuse . The claim is the first time it has emerged that Casey is among those named to the Board , which to date has paid over \u20ac 970 million in compensation .

But industry analysts say a leveraged buyout in 2006 saddled the company with $ 5.3 billion in debt and interest payments of $ 400 million a year .

Following a comprehensive review of the rail project , which ought to have commenced passenger operation but had been hindered by unforeseen third party issues and other challenges , the state government said the Marina to Mile 2 section of the project known as the Blue Line Rail , would now be ready for passenger operation by 2022 . The state government had engaged consultants to carry out a technical review and due diligence on the implementation of the project , which substantially had focused on civil works , and reported back to government that operation of the first phase may only commence in 2022 . Alstom SA France , a foreign firm with over 100 years of railway experience covering 60 countries , was subsequently engaged to review the report of the consultants , while the firm in its report agreed that the first phase of the rail project could only become operational in 2022 based on proposed funding pattern . Speaking at the signing of the agreement with Alstom SA , Managing Director of Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority ( LAMATA ) , Abiodun Dabiri , who signed on behalf of the state government , said the partnership was the result of the commitment of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode towards the transformation of public transportation in the state . He said a consortium of experts engaged by the state government to undertake a technical due diligence on the LRMT Blue Line Project ( Mile 2 \u2013 Marina ) had developed a roadmap which was accepted by the state government to bring the railway project to passenger operations . The consortium , according to Mr Dabiri , in a final report , outlined their findings and proposed a roadmap to complete the civil infrastructure works and the Operation & Maintenance ( O&M ) infrastructure that will be needed for the commencement of passenger operation . According to him , \u201c Based on the final report submitted , the consortium of Alstom Transport SA France has been engaged for the procurement , engineering , construction , installation of Operation & Maintenance ( O&M ) moveable infrastructure and commissioning of railway systems towards the commencement of passenger operations for LRMT Blue Line project from Marina to Mile 2 . \u201d While highlighting the extent of works to be carried out by Alstom SA , Mr Dabiri said for ease of implementation , the work plan had been divided into two phases , with phase one aimed at demonstrating the non-public operation of the existing rolling stock before end of second quarter of 2019 . \u201c For this purpose , a track length of about 3.0 km from Iganmu Station to National Theatre will be electrified . This operation would be done with the rolling stocks already supplied for the Blue Line project . \u201c This phase would allow the completion of all the preliminary works that would lead to the financing of the main works in Phase two . Phase one will be fully financed by Lagos State Government through Internally Generated Revenue ( IGR ) . \u201c Phase two , which is expected to be completed in 39 months , would entail the provision and installation of railway operations ' systems for the project from Marina to Mile 2 and the delivery of a passenger - ready Lagos Blue Rail Line by 2022 , \u201d he said . Mr Dabiri further said that the current efforts of Governor Ambode 's administration on the rail project was to bring to fruition the State Government 's commitment to deliver a multi-modal transport system and transform the State 's public transportation landscape with the view to moving it closer to the achievement of the first integrated and multi-modal transport system in Nigeria . The LAMATA boss specifically appealed to businesses and Lagosians to trust the Akinwunmi Ambode 's administration to bring the Blue Rail Line to passenger operation by paying their taxes since the rail project is solely financed by the state government through its IGR . \u201c We had highlighted earlier that what we are doing currently to bring the rail project to passenger operation would be funded through IGR . This is your project ; it is designed to ease the movement of Lagosians , it is designed to improve and increase our competitiveness in the comity of smart cities , it is designed to improve our lifestyle and regenerate our environment . Let us support it , \u201d Mr Dabiri said . Responding , Guy Jean- Pierre , a Director of Alstom SA , thanked the state government for the confidence reposed in the firm and the opportunity given to partner with the state on the Blue Line Rail project . He assured that Alstom would work to ensure the delivery of the Blue Line to passenger operation by bringing on board required expertise and experience in rail system management .

Each time he asked his mother to please bring him home . Olin Kreutz wanted out of Seattle . He wanted to be back in Hawaii . If it had been up to him , this season at Washington , the 9 - 2 record , first team all - Pac - 10 , a football career careening toward the riches of the NFL , would never have happened . \" It just seemed like the time to go home , \" Kreutz said . \" I hated watching him go through what he had to go through . I did n't mean to hurt him . \" It tore at the team last spring , threatening to unravel Jim Lambright 's attempt to push the Huskies back on the national stage . They fought briefly on the field . Then , in the locker room , Kreutz punched Sekou Wiggs in the face , breaking his jaw in two places . Kreutz , who played as a true freshman on the offensive line , was suspended indefinitely from the team . Wiggs , who started on the defensive line , was unable to eat solid foods . Kreutz did n't know if Lambright would let him play again ; Wiggs did n't know if he 'd be able to play again . Kreutz thought constantly about going home . Wiggs thought about suing . The course of Husky football changed because neither did . Reinstated by Lambright , Kreutz was dominating this season . He was the hub of the offense , a Husky center in the mold of Ray Mansfield , Ray Pinney , Blair Bush , Ed Cunningham and Bern Brostek . He bowled people over , running point for Corey Dillon . He was named player of the game in the Apple Cup victory over Washington State . \" Playing between Benji Olson and Bob Sapp made me 10 times better , \" said Kreutz , who dreamed of being all - Pac - 10 as a sophomore , but never thought he would . But then he did n't think he 'd even be at Washington this year . To suggest the fight was as painful for Kreutz as it was for Wiggs is ridiculous . Wiggs lost 65 pounds with his jaw wired , he missed the first three games of the season , and he never regained his starting spot . But Kreutz was wounded . He was instructed by Lambright to take an anger- management course . He was suspended from the team throughout the summer . He was told he would n't play again if he were involved in another incident . When his mother would n't support his return home to Hawaii , he rallied instead around his \" Hawaiian brothers \" on the team : Ink Aleaga , Petro Kesi and Ikaika Malloe . \" They talked me through things , \" he said . \" They stuck with me . \" Kreutz is soft-spoken . He has that gentle demeanor of the carefree Hawaiian . But the volcano inside is dormant , not extinct . He said he 's had no problems this season containing his aggression to the football field . \" They taught me how to leave it there , on the field , \" he said . \" I know I made a mistake . I 'm very sorry for what I did to him . But I 've grown up , I 've matured . I think things are better . \" Kreutz is explosive on the field , playing with an emotion that borders on rage . But more than anything , he is a very good athlete . At St. Louis High School in Honolulu , a perennial power , he was captain his senior year as his team won the state championship with a 13 - 0 record . But he was also state heavyweight wrestling champion as a senior , and threw the shot put . \" He has such good feet and balance , \" Lambright said . \" We saw that from the beginning . \" Kreutz was the only member of his recruiting class at Washington to play as a just - out - of - high - school freshman . Ironically , he came to Washington because the Huskies told him he would n't play . \" Other schools told me I 'd play as a freshman , but the Washington coaches said I 'd probably redshirt , \" Kreutz said . \" That seemed more truthful to me . I was n't sure I was ready to play . \" Kreutz made recruiting visits to Colorado , Nebraska , Arizona , Washington and Hawaii . His parents , Lora , a teacher , and Henry , a stevedore , apparently wanted him on the mainland . Following a well documented and decorated Hawaiian connection - Brostek , Aleaga , Pat Kesi , Siupeli Malamala , Ricky Andrews - he picked Washington and played in all but one game as a freshman , rare at most positions , but almost unheard of on the offensive line at Washington . Kreutz is a warrior . He loves battle . He just has to take care choosing the field and the opposition . Fortunately for his teammates - in lots of ways - he is doing that .

Advertisement When it was announced that the beloved TV series would be ending with its fifth season , fans worried that they would miss out on the end of the story . Thankfully , we have all since learned that there will be a sequel film to the series titled Seven Kings Must Die . The film is intended to serve as a \" standalone \" epilogue inspired by the final novels in the series by Bernard Cornwell : War of the Wolf , Sword of Kings and War Lord . Thanks to The Last Kingdom season 5 ending we have some idea of what direction this film will take the story , but many will be wondering whether we will ever get a full sixth season and why this was not the initial plan .. Uhtred of Bebbanburg star Alexander Dreymon and the series ' executive producer Nigel Marchant have revealed to RadioTimes.com why their current plan came about . The decision to end The Last Kingdom with season 5 actually dates back to when the show first went into development and a longterm plan for the overarching narrative was mapped out . At the time of the series premiere , only nine The Last Kingdom books had been published , with author Bernard Cornwell busy writing the 10th during filming on the television adaptation . As a result , the creative team had always intended for the show to wrap up after its fifth season , with Dreymon explaining that it certainly was n't cancelled as some viewers had feared . \" That press release was slightly misconstrued , \" he said . \" We had always planned for it to be five seasons only so it came as a surprise to no one really . When we started off there were only 10 books and so that was the arc that we had planned out ... I 'm quite happy with the way that it went . \" Executive producer Marchant said that the endpoint was a \" joint decision \" between production company Carnival and distributor Netflix , which he feels came at the \" right time \" . \" You always want to keep on top and improving season upon season and 10 hours is ... it 's a lot of story you tell within that and you have to be careful not to repeat , \" he explained in July 2021 . \" It 's always a challenge : how do we do a battle differently ? How do we make sure the battles are told through emotion and not just loads of people fighting that you do n't care about ? And how long can you keep going with those two themes without ever getting to a climax ? \" Marchant added : \" What we really wanted to do was finish [ in a way ] that everyone thought was satisfactory \u2013 which I hope we 've done \u2013 and that we had nearly 50 episodes that felt that you had a beginning , middle and end . I think it 's always nicer if you curate that , rather than it just finishes and you do n't finish telling the story . \" \" When we started shooting the show there were 10 books that Bernard Cornwell had written , and we had structured the show in a way that season 5 was always going to be the last season , \" said Dreymon at The Last Kingdom 's MCM London Comic - Con panel , hosted by RadioTimes.com writer David Craig . \" However , for a good while now we 've been in talks about maybe a little extension ... because it felt like it could n't quite yet be the end . And then we 've seen such a big appetite from the fans for an encore that we have decided , along with Netflix , to do a special which is going to be a ' movie version ' of the show and which we are going to be shooting next year [ 2022 ] . \" At the time of writing , Seven Kings Must Die is midway through filming in Hungary , with a number of cast members from the television series reprising their roles for the project . However , fans are advised not to get their hopes up for a full 10 - episode The Last Kingdom season 6 , as Marchant has pitched this sequel special as more like an epilogue to the main story than the start of a whole new era . \" Season 5 does feel like the end of the TV series , and the movie will be much more standalone , \" he said . \" It 'll be an extra treat for the fans of the TV series , but you could also watch it even if you 've never seen the TV show . \"","annotations":[{"text":"The Last Kingdom series","span":[43,65],"token_span":[9,12],"role":"Activity","label":"Activity","role_definition":"This role identifies the Activity that the Agent stops."},{"text":"Netflix","span":[1927,1933],"token_span":[368,368],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"This role identifies Agent that stops the Activity."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Agent ceases an Activity without completing it.

The NCRB merely lists suicides in a particular employment category , but that does not mean farming or crop-failure is the cause of the suicide . Arvind Kejriwal accused Gujarat of having high farmer suicide rates - 5,874 over the last decade . The Gujarat government said only one farmer committed suicide due to crop failure . Statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau ( NCRB ) indicate that the overall Kejriwal numbers may be closer to the truth , but we need to offer three caveats to this assertion . 1 . The NCRB merely lists suicides in a particular employment category , but that does not mean farming or crop-failure is the cause of the suicide . There is thus an outside chance that both Gujarat and Kejriwal are right , and both are off the mark . It all depends on what was the real cause of the suicide - crop failure or some other reason . 2 . High or low suicide rates are a function of a state 's overall suicide levels . Thus the data to compare is the suicide rate among farmers against the overall suicide rate in a state . Here , Gujarat is not an outlier . Farmer suicides as a percentage of total suicides in the state ranged from 8 - 9 percent . Andhra , Karnataka , Uttar Pradesh , and Maharashtra fared worse . 3 . There is no mention of landless labourers , landed agricultural labourers , no indication if this includes small and marginal farmers ( It probably does ) . So even the current data may be an underestimate when talking about suicides relating to farming conditions gone bad . * The data is sourced from the National Crime Records Bureau 's annual reports on accidental deaths and suicides in India . The reports categorise suicides based on profession of the victim and include one sub- category of farmers / agriculturists in the self - employed category . * Overall , more than one lakh persons ( 1,35,445 ) in the country lost their lives by committing suicide during the year 2012 . This indicates a decrease of 0.1 % over the previous year 's figure ( 1,35, 585 ) .

But now anyone can serve up a buttered lobster freshly cooked in their own kitchen , safe in the knowledge that it has been humanely killed , thanks to a British entrepreneur . Simon Buckhaven has created a machine that takes less than a second to efficiently and painlessly zap a lobster , crab or other crustacea to death . The price \u2013 at \u00a3 2,500 \u2013 may deter some but many an animal lover or restaurant chef will think it a small price to pay for a cruelty - free death . Plus , according to the manufacturer , the CrustaStun also makes the meat taste better . Inside one of the little machines that are going on sale this week , a lobster takes just 0.3 seconds to die , whereas it can live for three minutes in boiling water . A crab takes even longer to die as it is boiled to death \u2013 up to four and a half minutes . After several trials here and in the US , Mr Buckhaven 's firm , Studham Technologies , in Bedfordshire , has developed a machine that takes five seconds to use , and meets health and safety and other regulations on both sides of the Atlantic . The entrepreneur is firmly in the \" yes \" camp in the old argument about whether lobsters feel pain . One side is that their nervous systems are not complex enough to experience what humans would recognise as pain , implying that , for a lobster , being placed in boiling water would be like being sent gently to sleep in a warm whirlpool bath . This conclusion was buttressed by research published in Norway in 2005 , but in November 2007 , Professor Robert Elwood , of Queen 's University , Belfast , published the results of an experiment which involved daubing acid on the antennae of prawns . The animals immediately reacted by touching the affected areas , a reaction consistent with experiencing pain , although other specialists in the same field argued that the prawns may simply have been cleaning their antennae , without suffering distress . Mr Buckhaven is in no doubt that research like Professor Elwood 's is conclusive , and means that the practice of subjecting crustaceans to a slow death will have to end . \" These are sentient animals , who feel pain and distress , and you should not boil them alive , or drown them in fresh water , or cut them in half while they 're alive , \" he said . \" A lot of people who love to eat lobster do not like preparing it at home because they have to cook it in boiling water . And restaurants are more frequently hearing questions from customers about how their lobster will be killed . \" He added that in one blind test , customers were given lobsters killed in boiling water and lobster that had died in a CrustaStun , and every participant said that they preferred the meat from the electrocuted animals . \" It was sweeter meat and better consistency , \" he said . \" If you eat an animal which had been under stress before it died , it affects the meat quality . \" However , a planned demonstration of the CrustaStun turned into an unmitigated disaster \u2013 not least for 1,800 lobsters . It was a charity event for 600 guests in Tucson , Arizona , whose organisers had consulted the animal welfare group Peta , to see if there would be any objection to having lobster on the menu . Peta said it would be acceptable , if the lobsters were killed in the CrustaStun machines rather than being boiled or drowned in fresh water . Peta bought two of the machines and paid for Mr Buckhaven to travel out to demonstrate them . The machines were shipped out separately . Sadly , the delivery company let them down , 1,800 lobsters died horribly , and the machines turned up in Tucson two days late . \" We were completely let down , and are suing to get the money back , \" Mr Buckhaven said . Despite that catastrophe , he is convinced that there will be a growing demand for his machines . His company is now offering two types of lobster zappers . The larger industrial models , which cost over \u00a3 60,000 each , are already in use in the UK , Ireland , Norway and Portugal . Some supermarkets are now stocking lobster only if it has been killed by electrocution .

Turner had summoned Whitman , a starting tight end for the Illini from 1997 - 2000 , to discuss some of the worst news the player would encounter during his career . \" You could tell he was nervous when I called him in , '' Turner recalled Wednesday over the phone . \" I said , ' Josh , you 're in trouble . \u2026 You got a B . ''' The memory made Turner chuckle . \" I'll never forget his reaction : He put his head down and said , ' I know , coach , ''' Turner said . \" He felt like he let me down . '' To Turner , that summed up the kind of person Illinois hired to be its next athletic director , a conscientious 37 - year - old governed by a deep sense of personal responsibility and guided by a work ethic exceeded only by his intelligence . Turner knows Whitman as well as anybody ; he recruited the class valedictorian out of Harrison High School in West Lafayette , Ind . He watched Whitman develop into an Academic All - American and serviceable Big Ten tight end good enough to spend time in the NFL with four teams . He nurtured a relationship strong enough that the former player and coach tailgated together at last month 's Rose Bowl . He saw this coming \u2014 more than a decade ago . \" I 'm not surprised at all , '' said Turner , now the Florida International coach who talked to Whitman throughout the process . \" Once Josh got into this field , I remember saying he will be the athletic director at Illinois at some point . He 's very mature . He 's ready . He has a pride and passion for Illinois that the place needs right now . '' Whitman 's lack of experience raised immediate questions about an administrator jumping from Division III Washington in St. Louis \u2014 where the athletic budget was $ 7 million , according to the Equity in Athletics Disclosure data \u2014 to a Big Ten institution such as Illinois , which spent $ 74.4 million in the last fiscal year . Those concerns are valid but , on the other hand , consider Illinois finally showed self - awareness often in short supply to make the best of a bad situation . Perhaps hiring a bright up - and - comer such as Whitman suggests the university understands what it is \u2014 and what it is n't \u2014 as its upcoming period of renewal begins . Perhaps the \" pride and passion \" Turner promised Whitman has for Illinois will carry him and appease alums until the quick learner gets a better sense of just how big the job is . The choice of Whitman is unorthodox but not necessarily unwise for an underachieving program that should aspire to compete for national championships . Remember , the school started its pursuit at the top , being rebuffed by Northwestern AD Jim Phillips , an Illinois alum . Other qualified candidates considered good fits stayed away from what one veteran AD called \" a dumpster fire . '' The search clumsily continued down an obscure trail with the committee whittling down a list of names that were , in the words of another AD , underwhelming . In that context , Illinois easily can justify putting its athletic future in the hands of a renaissance man like Whitman \u2014 an attorney educated at its own law school who practiced in Washington , D.C. , before diving into athletic administration at Wisconsin - La Crosse . There Whitman emerged from a pool of 70 candidates to get the job at 32 despite only having worked in a college athletic department as an assistant to former Illinois AD Ron Guenther from 2005 - 2008 . \" He had a great presence , '' Wisconsin - La Crosse Chancellor Joe Gow told the Tribune on the phone . \" Frankly we took a little bit of a chance but we picked up immediately on what incredible integrity Josh has . '' A Whitman sampler of the AD 's strength and sincerity : Gow noted the diplomacy Whitman demonstrated in handling two tricky coaching transitions , one involving the football coach he fired five months into the job . Gow and Whitman became confidants , sitting together at athletic events and sharing ambitions . It was no secret to Gow where Whitman wanted to work one day . \" He always has had a soft spot for Illinois but even that might have been too much to dream of at the time , '' Gow said . \" I knew this day would come \u2014 admittedly it 's sooner than I thought . But I can assure you he 'll deliver on his promises . '' Whitman should avoid promising anything but his best effort at Thursday 's introductory news conference . Whitman 's top priorities seem obvious : 1 ) Decide what to do about basketball coach John Groce , who 's likely to stay given three years remain on his contract ; 2 ) Determine the long - term direction of the football program , which figures to move on from coach Bill Cubit after next season ; 3 ) Develop a facility upgrade plan to close the gap in the Big Ten ; and 4 ) Restore the luster to a severely tarnished athletic program . History says that whatever Whitman does will affect those around him profoundly . On Norv Turner 's last day as Chargers coach after the 2012 season , according to the San Diego Union - Tribune , he referenced Whitman in his farewell speech . Whitman played in four games for the Chargers in 2001 yet touched Turner , Ron 's brother , with the note he wrote the coach days before his final game . \" On the bottom of it , he said , ' You changed my life , ''' Turner told Chargers players .

The revelations came as western diplomatic missions in Sana 'a went into lockdown following threats from al - Qaeda 's Yemeni affiliate , which has taken responsibility for a failed attempt to blow up an airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day . Both the British and American embassies , considered the most high - profile targets in the city , remained closed for a second day . France and the Czech Republic also shut their embassies , while Spain , Germany and Japan announced restrictions on public access to their missions . The identity of those who smuggled the weapons contingent into Sana 'a has not been disclosed , and it is unclear if its disappearance is linked to al - Qaeda 's increasingly powerful Yemeni branch , al - Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula ( AQAP ) Although AQAP released a statement on Sunday urging its followers to kill all Western diplomats on the Arab Peninsula , western officials have declined to divulge whether or not threats of a specific nature have been made . Diplomats dismissed speculation that the vanishing convoy could presage an imminent attack on Western interests in the city . \" These reports have nothing to do with the reason embassies were shut , \" one said . John Brennan , President Barack Obama 's counter-terrorism adviser , has spoken of \" indications \" that al - Qaeda was planning an attack on a Western target in Sana'a , possibly the US embassy , which was twice attacked in 2008 , killing 19 . It is not the first time that lorries carrying arms have disappeared in Yemen , and sources suggested that the weapons may well have been bound for tribal rebels in the North . The insurgents , who are Shia , are regarded as apostates by al - Qaeda , although some observers say there may be a limited alliance of convenience between the two . But the disappearance of so large a shipment of explosives will only enhance the febrile atmosphere in Sana 'a and raise fresh concerns about Yemen 's competence in dealing with the al - Qaeda threat . A combination of corruption , instability , poverty and lawlessness has helped turn Yemen into fertile breeding ground for al - Qaeda . Amid warnings that the country could soon emerge as a \" new Afghanistan \" , Gordon Brown this weekend gave warning that Yemen was becoming a \" failing state . \" Keen to demonstrate its commitment to fighting terror , the Yemeni government said its forces had killed two suspected al - Qaeda members in an operation in the mountainous Arhab region , 25 miles north of the capital . The raid happened close to the scene of government air strikes on Dec 17 that killed three members of an AQAP cell who were allegedly plotting to blow up the British embassy in Sana'a . The main target of Monday 's attack , identified as Mohammed Ahmed al - Hanaq , managed to escape . Observers in Sana 'a described Mr Hanaq as a tribal chief who has only loose connections to al - Qaeda .

Under the recently passed $ 1.9 trillion stimulus law , the federal government will pay the entire cost of unemployment benefits for the first week people are out of work . But Assembly Speaker Robin Vos suggested suspending the one - week waiting period for benefits might discourage people from getting back into the workforce . \" I think the problem is not the suspension of a one - week waiting period . It 's getting more people into the workforce to fill the huge number of jobs that are going unresponsive to employers who need folks , \" the Rochester Republican told reporters . Vos stressed that he had not talked to other Republicans who control the Legislature and said no final decisions have been made . Republicans a decade ago instituted the one - week waiting period to help shore up the state 's unemployment fund . They agreed to temporarily end it last year because the federal government began paying for benefits during the first week of unemployment during the coronavirus pandemic . The state 's one - week waiting period recently went back into effect because the federal aid for benefits was coming to an end . But the new stimulus law , known as the American Rescue Plan , will continue to have the federal government pay for the first week of benefits because the pandemic is ongoing . If the Wisconsin Legislature again suspends the waiting period , those who lose their jobs could receive hundreds of dollars during their first week of unemployment at no cost to the state or its employers . But Vos said suspending the one - week waiting period could have the \" unintended consequence \" of keeping people on the sidelines when businesses are looking for workers . Suspending the one - week waiting period would require the support of the Assembly and Senate , both of which are controlled by Republicans . Democratic Gov. Tony Evers backs the idea and has called for permanently ending the waiting period . Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu , a Republican from Oostburg , declined to say what he thought of suspending the waiting period as he stepped off the Senate floor after a session Tuesday . Democratic Rep. Daniel Riemer of Milwaukee said it was a bad idea to give up millions of dollars in federal aid that could help people as soon as they lose their jobs . \" The fact that you lose a job does n't mean you lose the requirement to pay rent , the requirement to pay your mortgage , the requirement to pay for day care , which is so expensive , or for groceries , \" he said . Wisconsin 's unemployment system has caused some of the state 's biggest problems throughout the pandemic . The state Department of Workforce Development was crushed by the high volume of claims at the beginning of the outbreak as unemployed Wisconsinites applied for benefits . The department tried to quickly hire employees but struggled to implement new federal benefit programs with its outdated computer system . Thousands of unemployed people waited months for their payments , with some struggling to feed families , pay rent and keep the lights on . At one point , more than 100,000 claims were caught in the backlog . The department was able to catch up on the claims in December , but some applicants are still waiting for an adjudicator or judge to determine whether they qualify for benefits . Nearly 16,000 people are still waiting on an appeal , according to department data . The most recent data from the department show more than 12,000 people filed for unemployment for the first time during the week of March 6 . Nearly 100,000 people filed a regular weekly claim . Those figures do not include claims filed under recent federal programs , such as the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program and the Pandemic Unemployment Emergency Assistance program .

While the days of the heavy - handed ' War on Drugs ' are ( mostly ) behind us , we are all still faced with navigating a society that stigmatises and punishes weed users in many ways . This is without mentioning that we live in a federation . Each state has its own set of laws , requiring their own unique strategies . This series will address the key legislation and policies you 'll need to be aware of as a resident stoner in Australia . We 'll be focusing on recreational use and growing for personal use \u2014 if you 're a dealer and you get busted , that 's on you . Last time , we covered the essential bud - law you need to know for getting stoned in WA . This week : South Australia . Minor Possession and Expiation There 's a common misconception when it comes to cannabis law in SA , so let me clarify : weed is still very much illegal . To possess , smoke , or distribute it constitutes an offence under the Controlled Substances Act 1984 . That said , the expiation system in place there makes it far less of a risk to possess small amounts than in other states . Under the Expiation of Offences Act 1996 , simple cannabis offences can be expiated by a police officer . An expiation is a small fine , given in lieu of prosecution , to be paid within 28 days . They can be given for possession for the following : - Cultivating one cannabis plant without artificial enhancement ( non-hydro , no artificial lighting , no commercial fertilizers ) - Possession of up to 100 grams of cannabis - Possession of up to 20 grams of cannabis resin - Smoking cannabis ( except in a public place ) - Possession of smoking implements Expiation notices are subject to the following conditions : - The recipient must be aged 18 or over - They may relate to up to three offences arising from the same incident - They wo n't be given for charges of possession / cultivation for commercial purpose or supply , even if the total amount is less than the ' simple cannabis offence ' threshold - If given an expiation notice you may choose to opt for prosecution instead ( Dunno why you would ever do this , but maybe $ 300 is worth more to you than a criminal record ) Expiation fines are currently as follows based on the Controlled Substances ( Controlled Drugs , Precursors and Plants ) Regulations 2014 . Fine amounts : Possession : - Less than 25 grams of cannabis : $ 150 - Between 25 and 100 grams of cannabis : $ 300 - Less than 5 grams of resin : $ 150 - Between 5 and 20 grams of resin : $ 300 - Equipment for preparing or consuming cannabis or resin : $ 150 ( + $ 30 when accompanied by another simple cannabis offence ) Cultivation : - One cannabis plant : $ 300 Smoking / consumption - Smoking or consuming cannabis or resin ( except in a public place ) : $ 150 Expiation notices must be given if found committing those offences in SA , so you are relatively safe from prosecution so long as you keep your quantities low and do n't smoke in public places . And pay your expiation fines on time ! Taking more than 28 days will incur a late notice and another fine , any longer than that and you 're risking prosecution . Cultivation Once you move beyond one plant , or you start using ' artificial enhancement ' in your growing , you become subject to much harsher penalties in SA courts . Artificial enhancement is defined in the Controlled Substances Act ( 1984 ) as : - cultivation in a solution comprised wholly or principally of water enriched with nutrients ; or - cultivation involving the application of an artificial source of light or heat ; Quantities and maximum penalties for cultivation offences are as follows : - 1 plant ( no artificial enhancement ) : expiation notice & fine of $ 300 - 2 to 4 plants : $ 1000 fine and / or 6 months imprisonment - 6 to 9 plants : $ 2000 fine and / or 2 years imprisonment - trafficable quantity ( 10 to 19 plants ) : $ 75,000 fine and / or 15 years imprisonment - commercial quantity ( 20 to 99 plants ) : $ 500,000 and / or life imprisonment - large commercial quantity ( 100 + plants ) : $ 500,000 and / or life imprisonment These maximums are rarely if ever reached . Actual penalties tend to be significantly lower , except in cases involving organised crime or seriously negligent legal advice . Further Charges - Supply and low-level cultivation offences ( growing hydro ) will be prosecuted in SA , and each carry a maximum $ 2000 fine and / or 2 years imprisonment . - Charges for trafficking or cultivating cannabis are tried summarily ( by a judge without a jury ) in the Magistrates Court . If the sentence is likely to exceed 5 years , cases will be transferred to the District Court . You 'll be indicted and tried before a jury . The maximum penalty for an offence in this case is up to $ 50,000 and 10 years imprisonment \u2014 $ 75,000 and 15 years for an aggravated offence . - Trafficking , sale , or cultivation or a commercial or ' large commercial ' quantity can carry sentences of up to $ 200,000 and 25 years imprisonment . Charges in this range are generally applied for entire grow houses , so recreational stoners have nothing to worry about here . - If an expiation notice is not paid , simple cannabis offence charges typically carry a $ 500 - $ 1000 maximum fine . The criminal record that comes with prosecution will likely be much worse than the damage to your bank account . Case Studies Due to the non-prosecutorial nature of South Australian cannabis legislation , small offences are hard to study . I 've included two examples of larger offences listed in the courts \u2014 useful examples of the sorts of sentences that are handed down for larger - scale possession and trafficking charges . R V SIMON MATTHEW BUCKINGHAM ( 2019 ) 41 - year - old man charged for trafficking a commercial quantity of cannabis . Found with 2.3 kgs of packaged cannabis , two hydroponic plants , and equipment for sale . Defendant had a distant history of prior drug possession offences . Sentenced to four years imprisonment with a non- parole period of two years . R V VASILIOS MANIATIS ( 2019 ) 45 - year - old man with no prior convictions , convicted for trafficking a large commercial quantity of cannabis , as well as cultivating a commercial quantity and possessing associated equipment . Found with 4.6 kg dried cannabis , plus 33 plants at various stages of development . Sentenced to five years imprisonment , reduced to three years for an early guilty plea including 18 months without parole .

As I tried to replace the lid I trapped my little finger in the jar where I can only assume the specimen mistook my finger for a cricket . I am a 39 year old male of average build and reasonable health . I have no allergies , that I know of , but have had an allergic reaction to a previous spider bite ( Steatoda grossa ) . I had drunk around three pints of Guinness earlier that evening . I have been diagnosed as Asthmatic , but have only ever had to use my inhaler 5 - 6 times in the 12 + years since my asthma was first diagnosed . 10th September 1:55 am . Tingling sensation in finger , feels hot ( due to the squeezing ? ) , tip swollen , numb and with slight reddening , only a shade or two darker than the finger next to it , not noticeably different . The spider was captured and returned to her container and books containing information on spider bites were gathered , ( there would be a good chance I would have more information than the people attending to me at the Hospital , as spider bites are a rare occurrence ) . I then woke Lesley up to tell her the good news . 2:35 am . We set off to Hospital , just in case . 2:50 am . Slight pain in left elbow , finger almost stiff - feels as if I have wrenched my finger back and has the same painful pins and needles feeling one gets when the hands have been in the cold too long . 3:00 am . Arrive at hospital . Slight pain under arm and triceps . Under Hospital recommendation I take two aspirin , these were taken at 3:30 am . While at hospital the nurse and I looked in Toxbase where no mention of any spider bites was to be found . We then rang Guys Hospital where another nurse found some reference to spider bites , but not Poecilotheria . All we had as a guide was the comments in Schultz & Schultz and Verdez , where one person bitten by P. regalis had a sore finger and the other was in hospital for five weeks - nothing really sound for the nursing staff to work from . Since I had been bitten almost two hours ago and was still standing , the nursing staff decided to administer two aspirin to relieve the pain ( uncomfortable , but not agonising ) . 3:45 am . Left hospital . At this point in time there was no visible tracking from the bite ; no sense of euphoria , nausea ; no hallucinations ; no bowel movements and no sign of any necropsy around the bite ( I remained calm at all times ) . When I returned home I had a cup of coffee . No dressing or cream / ointment was ever put on the wound . 4:30 am . Went to bed . The sub-adult , female P. pederseni was feeding and showed no signs of stress . 4:00 pm . Finger and knuckle was still stiff and had that wrenched , pins and needles feeling . I did some gardening and found it painful to grip with my left hand , but this did not prevent me using my hand . 11:30 pm . I had a warm bath and took my watch off ( I always keep my watch on , except for swimming and bathing . I like to wear my watch tight on my wrist ) . 12:55 am . The knuckle of my wedding finger was stiff ( exercise from gardening or venom ? ) . I then went to bed . 11th September , 8:30 am . The finger was still stiff as I set off to work . 11:00 am . Felt flu like . My breathing was a bit heavy and my left armpit glands were swollen and painful . 2:00 pm . Requested to be taken back to hospital as my breathing was now much heavier . 2:20 pm . Back in hospital we tried to get in touch with Jean Lou Dorne at Southampton University ( the other people who I would have sought help from were in India ) . 4:30 pm . Discovered Jean Lou was on holiday , the person I spoke to suggested I might be having an allergic reaction to the venom . I explained this to Andy , the nurse attending me , he agreed with this and prescribed Cetirizine ( 10mg tablets ) , and Prednisolone ( 5mg tablets ) a steroid and an anti-histamine respectively . I had to take 10mg of each tablet each day , for five days . 12th September , 10:30 am . Woke up to find that my finger was still stiff . Most of the pain had gone , but I felt very rough and still flu like . I walked up to the Post Office to pick up a parcel ( the walk was around 600 m , but up-hill ) . When I got to the Post Office I could only pick up one package and had to go home for proof of identity for the other one . As I returned to the Post Office I had a mild asthma attack and had to sit down for 20 minutes , and use my inhaler , before I could pick up the parcel . I was given a lift home where , after a drink of water and my pills , I sat down and fell asleep . 4:30 pm . Woke up , still feeling pretty groggy . For the next day I refrained from any strenuous activity . I felt worn out and my stool was of a softer consistency than normal . This could have been due to the steroids and anti-histamines ( there was also no sign of blood or mucus ) . My urine was normal too - no blood or marked discoloration . My breathing was still noticeable , but not as heavy as before . I did not feel like eating and went off even mildly spicy food . I regularly used my inhaler , both the blue and the brown ones . 15th September . Woke up early with pain in my lower sides - could be due either to a mixture of German beer and Tequila , or more allergic reactions to the venom . ~ 1:30 pm . I felt as if I had really bad heartburn . I then had a drink and took the last of my pills . ~ 1:45 pm . Felt slightly better . 5:30 pm . The little finger on my left hand was flicking under the wedding finger at the knuckle . I found this painful , but bearable and had to push the knuckle back out again . In the following minutes this happened three more times , only staying out in its normal position on the third push out . I then massaged my finger . 17th September 9:05 am . Woke up with severe cramp in my lower , left leg and to a lesser degree , in my right foot behind the toes . 10:45 am . Attended a Doctors appointment . The cramp in my left leg was still there . A urine sample was also given . By now I was starting to feel less flu like . As I had no steroids or anti-histamine to take I asked the Doctor for a re-prescription , which was declined . Every time I stretched or yawned , I could feel some of my muscles tighten up almost cramp like . 18th September . Back to work . My finger was still a little stiff and I felt better , but my leg muscles were still not fully relaxed causing me to walk with a slight limp ( right foot still hurt too ) . 19th September , ~ 6:00 pm . I managed to speak to Jean Lou , who agreed that I had had an allergic reaction to the spiders venom . It was suggested that I take Ibuprofen , as an anti inflammatory . He also informed me that the allergic reaction could last a couple of weeks . I started taking the Ibuprofen that night and continued for the next couple of days . By the evening of the 21st I was no longer walking with a limp as my calf muscle was now back to normal . Although I still had the pain in my right foot , I could feel it was residing . Conclusions Very little is known about the effects of theraphosid venom , and the Medical facilities have little or no knowledge on the subject . With this in mind I would request that any useful information should be supplied to me , so that I can pass it onto my local health authority who will ensure that the relevant information is made available for future reference . I would also request that a copy of this journal and any other BTS journals containing bite information be sent to myself , so that I can also supply this information to my local health authority . If you do get bitten , stay calm , get someone to take you to hospital immediately . If you use an inhaler take it with you , bring some other information such as the books referenced below , especially Verdez and Schultz . Make accurate notes , with times if possible - you might be the first person to be bitten by that species , so all the information you gather will be invaluable for medical knowledge , and for treating the bite . I would like to thank the following people for their advice , interest , time and concern : Jean Lou Dorne , Jan - Ove Rein , S\u00f8ren Rafn , Henrik Wessel Frank , Ray Hale , Steve Copley , the attendant Nursing Staff at Princess Margarets Hospital Swindon , and last but not least Lesley for her taxi driving , humour ( at my expense ) and all round care and concern .

All eight ferry employees - including a husband - and - wife team in Chester - Hadlyme - received notices Thursday that their positions will be eliminated as of Aug. 25 , Chester - Hadlyme ferry employees said Thursday . But do n't expect the ferries to run until then ; they 'll be shut down a few days before that in order to get the boats off the water and store them , likely for good , said John Marshall , master captain of the Chester - Hadlyme ferry . \" If you 're going to take it out of service , it needs to go somewhere . It ca n't just sit , \" Marshall said . Department of Transportation spokesman Kevin Nursick would not confirm news of the layoffs and referred all questions to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy 's office . The layoffs are part of Malloy 's plan to reduce the state work force by about 13 percent to fill a $ 1.6 billion hole in the state budget . The state today will unveil what the 6,560 job eliminations - including 884 in the DOT alone - will mean to state services . The DOT 's maritime manager , Chuck Beck , handed to the Chester - Hadlyme ferry 's five full - time employees letters detailing the job cuts during a meeting at noon Thursday , said Tom Darcy , one of three ferry captains who has a combined 22 years on both state ferries . Rocky Hill - Glastonbury 's three ferry employees received elimination notices earlier in the day , said Darcy 's wife Diane Darcy , a first mate in Chester - Hadlyme with 17 years on the job . The Darcys had been worried about losing their jobs since last year , when they first got word that the ferries were on a list of possible budget cuts . Diane Darcy 's first thoughts upon receiving the layoff notice Thursday were : How would they pay for their daughter 's last year of college ? Would they be able to afford their mortgage and keep their house on Ferry Road in Hadlyme ? But ultimately , she said , the disappointment Thursday was n't about the job losses . \" The saddest part of it is , they 're going to close this thing , and it 's never going to come back , \" she said . \" It 's not going to be there for our kids , it 's not going to be there for their kids , as it has been for 242 years . \" An illustrious past When Jonathan Warner started running the Chester - Hadlyme ferry in 1769 , it was pushed across the river with long poles . The ferry was given its current name in 1882 when the town of Chester took over its operation , according to the state , which began running it in 1917 . The Rocky Hill - Glastonbury ferry has been around even longer - since 1655 - and is the country 's \" oldest continuously operating ferry service , \" according to the state . The Chester - Hadlyme ferry , which runs April 1 through Nov. 30 , is the busier of the two , with 18,890 river crossings in the 2009 - 10 fiscal year . It cost the state $ 338,706 to run the ferry that year , but the ferry generated $ 106,302 in revenue that year , according to the DOT . The ferry is an established part of the lower Connecticut River area , for both practical and sentimental reasons . Ambulances use the ferry to shuttle patients on the east side of the river to Shoreline Medical Center in Essex , and it 's popular with locals who ride the ferry to commute to work , preferring it over both the Interstate 95 Baldwin Bridge and the swing bridge in East Haddam . Visitors drawn to landmarks such as Gillette Castle and Goodspeed Opera House take it to get from one tourist attraction to the other . \" This thing brings in a lot of money , \" Marshall said . \" It 's hard to quantify that , but I can tell you this . On the afternoons and mornings and weekends , and at all times , I 'm sending people to Middletown , I 'm sending them to Chester , I 'm sending them to Deep River , Essex , Old Saybrook - all throughout the Connecticut River Valley . ... We 're giving them directions to the casinos , to New London , to Salem Four Corners . \" Around Halloween , ferry employees decorate the gates at the ferry landings with masks of ghosts and goblins . Every November , they string Christmas lights on the ferry , send out a holiday greeting card and have an end - of - the - season party on the boat . A ' bitter disappointment ' Lyme First Selectman Ralph Eno said Thursday he was n't surprised to hear that ferry employees were part of the thousands receiving pink slips from the state . \" They 've got to let a lot of people go if the budget is going to balance , \" Eno said . But the imminent loss of the Chester - Hadlyme ferry is \" a very bitter disappointment \" to residents , especially given how the layoffs came about , he said . \" It 's a big piece of history , \" Eno said . \" You hate to see that kind of thing go because of a lack of foresight on the part of the people who were voting on the concessions . \" Residents and passengers last fall learned that the ferries - frequent targets of budget cuts - were again on a list of possible cuts . Many rallied to save the Chester - Hadlyme ferry , in particular , with a 2,000 - signature petition and meetings with state employees and legislators . The Hadlyme Public Hall Association organized a \" Save the Ferry \" effort , dedicating $ 1,000 of its own funds to the effort . Ferry supporters rejoiced when it appeared the ferries would continue to be funded under the new state budget . But the relief was short - lived , and word quickly spread that the ferries ' future was once again uncertain after the Malloy administration failed to negotiate concessions with unions that would have prevented mass layoffs . The Hadlyme association held a meeting June 28 to re-energize public support for the ferries and plans to hold another meeting at 7 p.m . Sunday at the public hall to \" review the situation , \" association President Curt Michael said . Tom Darcy said news of the layoffs was rough , but that employees working the ferry that day had to put on a good face for customers . \" I 'm not going to curl up in the fetal position here , \" Darcy said . \" It is what it is . You have to carry on . \" He said he remained somewhat hopeful that union leaders would be able to work out a last- minute deal with the governor 's office . \" It 's a real gut shot to read that letter , \" Darcy said . \" But I do n't think it 's actually over . ... Before I actually have to walk off this boat , I 'm hoping that things change and we 're able to do our jobs here . \" j.cho@theday.com If you go Who : Hadlyme Public Hall Assocation What : Emergency meeting on the elimination of the ferries When : Sunday at 7 p.m. Where : Public Hall , 1 Day Hill Road , Hadlyme READER COMMENTS Stories that may interest you Police : Wallingford man abused puppy ; snout was taped shut A Wallingford man has been arrested on an animal cruelty charge after police said he was seen on video manhandling a Siberian Husky puppy with its snout taped shut Teacher under fire for cotton , cuffs in class on slavery Rochester school officials are investigating allegations that a white teacher told his class of mostly Black students to pick seeds out of cotton and put on handcuffs during lessons on slavery in a seventh - grade social studies class Law enforcement rally planned to support trooper accused of manslaughter The state police union is urging law enforcement officers to rally in support of the trooper accused of manslaughter in the shooting death of a man after a high - speed chase into West Haven two years ago .

It was published in The Ecologist Volume 29 Number 4 , July 1999 . Coming from Colombia , I can say that I come from the head - waters of the Amazon . When I leave the country , I fly over its many arms and branches stretching out from this great body of water . In saying this I have used the vocabulary of anatomy . In speaking of the river I have mentioned its head , its body , and its arms . Many languages use anatomical terms when describing landscape features , but most people , when being reminded of this fact , would find themselves at a loss when asked to explain the reasons for this choice of words . To people belonging to a scientific , technological , rationalistic age , it does not make much sense to use such animistic terminology , to speak of a river mouth , of the body of a lake , or the foothills of a mountain . If we come to think of it , there is something archaic , something romantic about this kind of language . Every part of the Indians ' dress is imbued with significance . \" Herbert Grade / Still pictures . But the Indians can tell us what is meant by all this , and we should heed the Indian words because they convey to us the true meaning of these terms , a meaning we have lost in the course of our frantic advance towards what we call progress . To most Colombian Indians , and especially to those of the north - west Amazon , the river is a human body , a living organism . The river is life itself , stretched out in a linear sequence of vital events , between two power spots : the headwaters and the river mouth . There has always been something strangely enticing about headwaters the world over . They are thought to be the sources of great energies , the sources of wisdom , the spots where essential transformations may occur under the guardianship of benevolent nature spirits . According to the Indians , people who live at the headwaters of a river are more tradition - oriented ; they have more esoteric knowledge than others . Besides , there is more wildlife at the headwaters and so they are good hunting grounds . But hunting , of course , is not devoid of danger because all game animals stand under the protection of powerful spirits that might cause harm to the hunter who kills too many of their species . So the headwaters are very sacred ; they are a very special part of a river drainage . The other extreme of the river 's lifeline is its mouth . The true power of a river is said to reside at its mouth . It is thought that both the headwaters and the mouth of a river are enclosed by invisible boundaries forming a hexagonal space , modelled on a rock crystal . The hexagon of a river mouth is larger and more powerful than that of the headwaters . When leaving the hexagonal space of the river mouth , shamans say that one has become a transformed person , that one is better and wiser , that from now on one will avoid noisy places and bad company . The Indians say that the river is life : this idea is expressed in many images . In the first place , in many Creation Myths , embryo - genesis is said to have taken place in a lake , in a riverbed , in a deep pool of the river . The slow evolution of embryonic and foetal development took place in a strictly sequential line of womb-like pools in which the incipient being acquired the faculties that made it human . In another image , the river is a model of ethnogenesis , of cultural origins . The Tukano Indians call themselves Anaconda people and believe that mankind was born at the river mouth and then travelled upstream in a huge canoe shaped like an anaconda . At certain spots , people went ashore and , one by one , acquired the fundamental institutions of their society and culture . There is a spot where they danced for the first time ; another spot where they learned the first songs ; a spot where they cleared the first fields ; a spot where they built the first maloca ; another spot where they had their first hallucinatory experience ; a spot where the rules of exogamy were established . In this manner the entire river landscape comes alive , because every spot along the river has its name , its place in myths and visions , its place in genealogies and its particular significance to the passer - by . Every bend in the river is a reminder of the great serpent 's coils and , at the same time , the anaconda of mankind 's and nature 's origin is a projection of the Milky Way . In another image , the river is a model for individual adult life , a metaphor which is explained in the following terms : a river always adapts its course to the relief of the landscape by flowing along its deepest parts : by sheer gravity it hollows out its bed , by moulding itself around mountains and hills , and across plains and swamps . This is how a person 's life should be : a slow process of adaptation to whatever circumstances that might arise . When the river meets an obstacle , a range of hills or a huge rock , it gently flows around it : but when it arrives at an abrupt drop , a steep decline of the surface , then it shoots straight ahead and throws itself in thundering falls and rapids over the boulders , only to expand again peaceably after it has reached flat ground . This is the way life ought to be . It should adapt itself , it must avoid head - on collisions , but it should also be prepared to run risks and push straight ahead until the landscape opens up again and the current flows undisturbed . The river is life because water is life . In some languages of the north - west Amazon , the word for river or water is the same as the word for health , for medicine . When the Indians see stagnant , polluted waters they say the river is ill : but when the current is swift and clear the river is healthy . When a man works hard and perspires profusely he is in good health because then \" the water circulates \" , as the Indians say . On a higher level of abstraction , the river becomes a model of man 's process of spiritual development . It is what the Indians call \" the path \" , what other religions or philosophies would call tao , the Way to Perfection , to fulfilment , to oblivion . In fact , in the shamanic idiom , the Vaup\u00e9s river is called \" river of transformation \" . We all have been marked by a cheap stereotype of Amazonian Indians : a man or a family peacefully paddling a canoe . But to the Indians , the meaning of this picture is immensely more complex . River travel is life but it is much more than life . On the river , man finds food ; it is there he meets his kinsmen and where he meets women ; it is on the river that he listens to the sounds of the waters and the forests and , often , it is on the river that he meets his death . River travel , the image of man penetrating upriver , over rapids and falls , over whirlpools and from one bend of the river to another , constitutes a recurrent visionary theme in dreams , hallucinations and myths . And then there is the forest . The forest has different dimensions ; it offers other resources and all of these have their spirit-owners and therefore require different behavioural norms . Above all , there are the game animals . Between the hunter and the animals he kills , there exists a relationship of reciprocity . The spirits of dead or frightened animals take their revenge by causing illness to the hunter and his family . In fact , the animals are \" hunters \" in their own right , in that they \" hunt \" people with diseases , accidents and nightmares . In order to establish and maintain a viable relationship between the hunter and the hunted , people must observe many dietary and sexual restrictions . The former have two complementary functions : on the one hand they act as controls , as deterrents to over-hunting ; on the other hand , they serve to mask human body odours . The consumption of peppers , for example , or the smoke of burning pitch will make the game animals disregard any human scent while the consumption of fatty or oily substances \" makes the hunter visible \" ( as the Indians say ) by his strong body odour . To the Indians of the north - west Amazon , the river and the forest are living organisms , kept alive and fertile by the cosmic energy of the Sun Father . This father figure is in continuous exchange with our Earth , which is a female principle . Between the two - solar energy and the Earth 's fertility potential - exists a circuit ; whatever man subtracts from it for his sustenance , be it fishing , hunting or harvesting , he must return by saving energy through personal sacrifice . This principle of \" saving \" is reflected in the conscious and planned conservation of natural resources . Must adult people are quite aware of this principle , but the true power of planning and decision - making in these ecological matters lies in the hands of shamans and elders . I have seen shamans carefully measuring out the adequate amount of fish poison to be put in a creek ; I have heard them interpret dreams in terms of game conservation , explaining that the frightening appearance in a dream , of a certain animal , was a warning that the species was being over-hunted . Shamans will control the felling of trees , the firing of clearings ; they will control house construction , canoe making , the brewing of beer , the processes of daily food preparation , and a great multitude of other activities . In the evening , the men will sit around their fires and talk , and in these nightly conversations they will refer to the change of seasons , the appearing in the sky , the water level and the current of the rivers and creeks , the animals they have seen and heard , the fruits that are ripening in the fields or in the forest . Every few weeks there will be a slight change in the subject matter of these nightly talks , and the seasonal cycle or rainy or dry months will mark major changes in emphasis . There will he talk of bird migrations and of fish runs ; fields must he fired and planted . And night after night people talk while the shamans and elders listen and occasionally ask some questions . In the shamans ' minds , all this information will be organised into structured knowledge which henceforward , for the next few weeks , determines their activities , be they expressed in ritual , in recommending hunting strategies or in arranging social gatherings . For each season of the year , for each distinct shorter time - span , and for each ecosystem , all behavioural norms have to be re-adapted and co-ordinated anew . And this is why the Indians ' knowledge is so vital . The great \" energy \" potential of soils , plants , game animals and fish has to he redistributed to the cosmic energy circuit by rituals , recitals , myths and admonitions which , in their totality , prescribe a way of life . If observed in their full context , these norms constitute an integrated system . For thousands of years , the Amazon Basin has been inhabited by Indians who knew how to conserve their habitat ; we have archaeological evidence for their demographic density and the cultural inventiveness of these peoples . Of course , I am quite aware of the fact that , occasionally , the Indians have contributed to the destruction and degradation of their lands , especially when acting under the pressure of encroaching mestizo peasants , but as a general rule they have managed their natural environment with ecologically - sound land use planning . But the pressure of outside forces upon the Amazon environment is increasing day by day . In the course of my travels , and of long years of field experience in Colombia , I have seen many irreparable changes in the natural environment brought about by human agency ; I have seen the ancient deserts of central Asia and I have seen the rapid expansion of modern deserts on the plains and mountains of Colombia . But no single case has impressed me more than what is happening , and what might be happening , in the Amazon Basin . In speaking of Colombian Indians , I have mentioned some isolated customs ; some animistic beliefs and shamanistic images such as might be described for many aboriginal societies of the tropical rainforest or the Andes . But what I want to emphasise is this : these beliefs and attitudes toward life , these visions of the universe , these hundreds of little things a person does or thinks or avoids , form a highly - structured order . In myth and ritual , in conversation and daily activities , the Indians express deeply - felt beliefs . During an Indian 's entire life , there is a constant , more or less conscious , interplay between the individual and the way in which he perceives the environment . There are shapes and colours , movements and gestures , sounds and smells ; there are different temperatures , different flavours to taste , things to touch , air to breathe . There is the power of the spoken word , the rhythm of music , the bond of kinship . All these manifold sensations , perceptions and feelings are consistently coded and carry specific meanings , the total message of which is life - a well - adapted life . Every single musical instrument , every single feather in a headdress , every dance - step or body gesture is imbued with a specific meaning . And to these are added dietary restrictions , the rules of food processing , hunting and fishing , the clearing of a field , the firing of a clay vessel or the manufacture of a basket . And then there are dreams and visions , visions induced by the controlled use of hallucinogenic drugs , or by deep meditation ; and from these visions , a person awakes with the certainty that what he has seen or heard and felt in that other dimension was true . The sounds of the river and the forest , at different times of day or night , may he warnings or encouragements ; the screech of a parrot , the eyespot pattern on a fish tail , the smell of rotten wood or of an aromatic herb may determine a man 's activities and thought for a day or a week . In this manner the person is continuously exposed to messages which , in all essence , are of a biological nature because they mainly refer to the following rules : to find the right person to marry , to find the right food to eat , and to obtain both in the right way , without upsetting the balance - \" the energy - circuit \" - that links man to his society and his environment . How to read the signals the environment is sending out , a person has to learn through myth and ritual , through the long recitals of genealogies , the casting of spells , and above all , through the nightlong conversations of shamans and elders who are the true suppliers and transmitters of knowledge made wisdom . We should never underestimate this learning process , because it is an exacting mental discipline which eventually enables people to live in nature and with nature , and in society . Our cosmovision is based upon our science ; the Indians ' is based upon their knowledge . Of course , we want to continue in our world which , for better or for worse , is our creation . But in order to live in it , here , today , tomorrow and in the future , we need the Indian 's knowledge . And here I am referring not only to the practical knowledge of the Indians , to the sort of things a peasant knows . What I am trying to say is that the Indians ' way of life reveals to us the possibility of a separate strategy of cultural development ; in other words , it presents us with alternatives on an intellectual level and on a philosophical level . We should keep in mind these alternative cognitive models . The conservation of the Amazonian is not a visionary scheme of ecologists and romanticising anthropologists ; it is a vital necessity for mankind on a global scale : for the study of biological evolution , the study of soil - plant co-evolution , the study of species diversity ; to understand the linguistic , ethnographic , and biological diversity of human societies . We need the Amazon for its enormous human potential , quite apart from its economic or technological promises . Up to this point , I have been writing this article as a humanist , as an intellectual , as an anthropologist who is profoundly concerned about the future of the Indians and their natural environment . But now I shall begin to write as a rationalist too : as a person who is acutely aware of the realities of our present times , and who knows that the future lies in the hands of the intelligentsia , of the technologists and bureaucrats . It is they who have the power , and according to them the Indians are primitives who have to be integrated ; according to them , nature is something that has to he exploited for the benefit of man . We may know that we need the Indians ; we may know that the ruthless exploitation of natural resources has limits ; but the leading intelligentsia and their development agencies recognise no limits to their all - embracing technology . We have to be realistic , and accept the fact that the Indian world is on the wane . The Amazon basin and many , many other , formerly remote , regions of the Third World are being opened to outside influences and to technological development . In some regions this process will be slower and less turbulent than in others ; some aboriginal societies will he able to re-adapt , but others will become profoundly modified , and some will perish altogether , biologically , culturally , linguistically . As anthropologists and biologists , we know only too well that these changes are part of the historical scheme of things . These are disturbing thoughts , to say the least , and I wish I could be more positive when thinking of the future of rainforest Indians and aboriginal peoples in general . But in fitly y ears , I have seen too many traditions being lost ; I have seen entire tribes disappear ; I have seen too much misery among gentle , helpless people . Although I know that the Indians ' world is on the wane , I believe that this knowledge does not exempt us from certain obligations . So , here , I shall attempt to suggest a few approaches to these problems ; I shall try to make an effort to envisage a better future for the Indians , by suggesting a few personal ideas . In the first place , I think we should make a combined effort to study the Indians ' knowledge of their biotype , taking into account not only our , but above all their , concepts of ecosystems . Every square kilometre of forest contains a library of important biological , cultural and psychological information , and if we study it in the company of the Indians our insights in all these fields will be enormously enriched . The death of an old Indian who never had the chance to share with us his knowledge of the forest and the river is the equivalent of a whole library disappearing . If we undertake this study alone , we will get a mere inventory but if we work together with the Indians our insights will be greatly enriched by a kind of knowledge which , at present , still lies beyond our experience . For 500 years we have witnessed and played along with , the destruction of the Indians ; now we are witnessing the destruction of the natural habitat . What are we waiting for ? There can also be no doubt that as anthropologists , biologists and ecologists we possess an enormous amount of information , or practical field experience , and of the many forms of human vulnerability and of the destruction of the natural environment . By transforming this information into practical knowledge , in a manner that would make it understandable and convincing to national leaders and planning agencies , we can influence the process of decision - making ; we can convince those in power of the biological and social necessity to Conserve these lands ; and we can convince them of the dignity and value of our Indian societies . It is not sufficient to say that what we owe to the Indians is potatoes , maize and quinine . It is not sufficient to retell their myths and tales in florid Portuguese or Spanish or to stage their dances in a pseudo-Indian setting on television . What we must show is the Indian 's philosophy of life , their cosmogonic and cosmological schemes , their ethical and aesthetical attitudes . What we must show is their courage of choice , their option of other ways of life , different from ours ; the courage and genius of having built their societies , their cultures based upon an astonishing combination of realism and imagery .","annotations":[{"text":"A View from the Headwaters","span":[4,29],"token_span":[2,6],"role":"Medium","label":"Medium","role_definition":"The written or spoken material that contains a message that potentially influences the Addressee towards the Content."},{"text":"Gerardo Reichel - Dolmatoff","span":[90,116],"token_span":[15,18],"role":"Speaker","label":"Speaker","role_definition":"The person who intends through the use of language to get another person to act."},{"text":"the validity of our modern views of landscape and nature","span":[234,289],"token_span":[42,51],"role":"Topic","label":"Topic","role_definition":"What the communication is about."},{"text":"The Ecologist Volume 29 Number 4","span":[502,533],"token_span":[91,96],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the Speaker attemtps susaion on an Addressee."},{"text":"July 1999","span":[537,545],"token_span":[98,99],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the lobbying occurs."},{"text":"heed the Indian words","span":[1596,1616],"token_span":[312,315],"role":"Content","label":"Content","role_definition":"The wish for action on the Addressee's part that the Speaker expresses."},{"text":"Colombian Indians","span":[1778,1794],"token_span":[348,349],"role":"Salient_entity","label":"Salient_entity","role_definition":"An entity which the Speaker believes should participate in the action."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"The Speaker expresses through language his wish to get the Addressee to act in some way that will help to bring about events or states described in the Content.","frame_ancestors":["Attempt","Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-4923-53-frame-Attending","frame":"Attending","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"In April 2014 , Grimes attended a Chicago meeting of the Democracy Alliance , a group of liberal donors who pool their resources in support of progressive causes , where she was a featured speaker at the event .","annotations":[{"text":"In April 2014","span":[0,12],"token_span":[0,2],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the Agent attends the Event."},{"text":"Grimes","span":[16,21],"token_span":[4,4],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent is the person who chooses to make himself present at the Event."},{"text":"a Chicago meeting of the Democracy Alliance , a group of liberal donors who pool their resources in support of progressive causes","span":[32,160],"token_span":[6,27],"role":"Event","label":"Event","role_definition":"The Event is the deliberate set of happenings given at a particular time and place."},{"text":"Chicago","span":[34,40],"token_span":[7,7],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the Agent attends the Event."}],"trigger":{"text":"attended","start_char":23,"end_char":30,"start_token":5,"end_token":5,"frame":"Attending"}},"source":{"text":"Kentucky Republicans want Alison Lundergan Grimes to choose between the liberal donors she met with in Chicago this week and the state 's coal industry that she has campaigned on supporting . The Democratic challenger to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell attended a meeting of the country 's biggest Democratic donors at the Democracy Alliance meeting this week , but never spoke to the man who has pledged to spend millions for Democrats in the midterm elections -- environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer . The Kentucky Coal Association had already cautioned the pro-coal Grimes that accepting money from Steyer would position her against the industry . Grimes walks a thin line between her environmentalist supporters ( which does not currently include Steyer ) and the energy industry in her state , which she has supported throughout her campaign . After declining to take a position for much of her campaign , she belatedly came out in favor of the Keystone XL pipeline last week . Republicans insist she ca n't have it both ways , and they think the coal industry 's timely warning has given them the fuel they need to take it to the voters . \" If Alison Lundergan Grimes accepts aid and financial support from Tom Steyer , or any anti-coal group , Republicans will absolutely use any and all means to educate our fellow citizens about her hypocrisy , \" said Kentucky Republican spokeswoman Kelsey Cooper . Some Republicans in the state say they plan to hold her accountable not only for any money she might accept from him , but any indirect involvement in the state by his PAC , and money from the DSCC , which Steyer helped raise . And they 'll take to the air to do it . Asked whether Grimes would be accepting money from Steyer , her spokeswoman Charly Norton demurred , saying \" we will continue to rely on the 45,000 grassroots contributors that make up the heart of our campaign . \" Grimes 's campaign also points out that McConnell has received more than $ 100,000 from Next Era Energy , a coal - competing renewable energy company . It 's certainly not Republicans ' first attempt to tie Grimes to her donors \u2014 they 've hit her on Hollywood donations , and donations from state lawmakers who were accused of sexual harassment \u2014 but in Steyer they think she 's guilty of blatant guilt by association . Republicans across the country are eager to compare the liberal billionaire to the Koch brothers , and tie Democrats who receive his money to being anti-coal or oil . In Colorado , the conservative group American Commitment has run ads accusing Sen. Mark Udall ( D ) of being bought off by Steyer and his climate change agenda . Kentucky 's Republican Party is threatening a similar fate for Grimes if she accepts his money . Grimes has n't had any trouble fundraising . She brought in a $ 2.7 million haul this quarter and outraised McConnell in two of the last three fundraising quarters .

Subs : Mitchley , Stonehouse , Cain , Collett . DARLINGTON manager Mark Cooper opted for a 4 - 3 - 3 formation with striker Campbell recalled to play alongside Moore and Wright . But before they could get into their stride , they had keeper Russell to thank for being alert enough to race out of his area to clear from former Boro striker Connor , who had recovered froma calf injury to play , after Murray 's pass sent him clear of the Darlington defence . Mansfield looked the livelier side early on , but Campbell won the game 's first corner for Darlington on 11 minutes . Brown swung it in and Marriott did well to punch clear as Hatch closed in . Back came Darlington and Moore 's cross from the right struck the outside of the post , though Marriott was standing right on the post and appeared to have the ball covered . There was a cracking atmosphere with both sets of fans making plenty of noise , though Mansfield had more of them . Quakers were now starting to dictate play , but Mansfiueld won an 18th minute corner off Hatch . Former Quakers skipper Foster rose well to meet it but headed over the bar Hatch then halted Connor with a timely tackle as Mansfield tried to turn the screw . Brown then conceded another corner , though Darlington broke swiftly , Smith setting up Wright who fired over from 20 yards . Both sides werev trying to get the ball forward quickly , though play was halted when Smith took a heavy knock and needed treatment . The sides were happy for a breather on a warm humid day . Smith recovered and broke into the Mansfield penalty area on 32 minutes . He appeared to be brought down by Briscoe , but referee Stuart Attwell , who was well placed , felt otherwise . Marriott saved Moore 's header from a cross by Brown , then after good work from Chandler Bridge - Wilkinson was given space to cross , but sent the ball too close to Marriott . Darlington sufferede a blow on 38 minutes when Smith , who had been lively in midfield , limped off to be replaced by Verma . Hatch , playing as a stand - in central defender for Darlington , then presented te ball to Connor but was baled out by skipper Miller who got back swiftly to concede a corner . Then Russell had to go down smartly to save Adam Smith 's long range shot in first half stoppage time . Darlington needed more mobility from strikers Wright and Campbell but Mansfield threatened first in the second period , iod iod od d Smith firing a low shot wide of the near post after good work from Connor . Then Briscoe outmuscled Brown and saw his drive deflected narrowly over the bar , the closest either side had come so far . At the other end Brown 's free kick on 56 minutes was comfortably held by Marriott . But twice within a minute Quakers missed gilt edged chances . Campbell broke clear down the left and cossed low for Wright who took too long and Mansfield cleared for a corner . From it Bridge - Wilkinson found Miller breaking into space but the skipper misdirected his header which drifted harmlessly wide . The game had opened up now with both sides shedding their inhibitions . On 62 minutes Russell was down smartly to keep out Connor 's low shot from 12 yards , as Mansfield linked well in attack . Quakers broke through Brown , whose cross was met by Wright , but Marriott climbed well to pluck the ball out of the air before Campbell could latch onto it . It was looking increasingly likely that one goal would settle it . But Darlington in particular needed better delivery into the penalty area as they had wasted some good positions , though Verma was not far off target with a rising drive from 20 yards . With 16 minutes remaining Darlington brought on Senior for Campbell to try and pep up theior attack , and Marriott had to scramble to prevent his low coss from reaching Wright in front of goal . Darlington looked the more likely scorers now , but they had to be wary at the back as Mansfiled were linking up well in midfield at times . Going into the last 10 minutes the game was stretched , and itv was down to stamina and desire as to who would come out on top . Wright who was having more influnce now failed to get on the end of an Arnison free - kick into the heart of the penalty area . Then on 89 minutes when Verma was brought down 25 yards from goal , Bridge - Wilkinson struck the post from the free-kick . And there was still time for Bridge - Wilkinson to cross into the box where Wright headed wide with a diving attempt . Darlington tried to pick up the tempo again in extra time , and won a corner which was cleared . Senior won another corner as Darlington dictated . Mansfield cleared but Brown played the ball back in for Wright , who headed wide . Than Mansfield brought on Cain for Smith . Arnison conceded a free-kick for a high boot 30 yards from goal to give Mansfield a chance to play the ball into the penalty area . Cain took it and Darlington cleared only after a scramble . Drlington then played their final card , Terry coming on for Bridge -Wilkinson . The substitute played a good ball into the penalty area from which Wright headed narrowly wide , though he claimed that Marriott had got a touch . Early in the second half of extra time Terry released Senior whose shot was deflected into the grateful arms of Marriott . Darlington were dictating much of the play and Mansfield brought on Mitchley for Murray to try and gain some control . Wright went down injured and players from both sides went straight for the drinks bottles , while he recived treatment . Connor threatened when Cain ' s cross reached the far post where Connor headed narrowly over the bar . Then eight minutes from time Moore forced a Darlington corner . Brown too it and Wright headed against the post as Quakers agony continued . Hatch headed clar a corner from Cain in a rare Mansfield attack , as a penalty shoot out loomed .

In order to protect the rights of workers and ensure that standard working practices are followed throughout the industry , a Code of Practice has been introduced which will become law in 2006 . | | || | | | | || Who is the code for ? | | || The Code is for everyone who provides labour to the fresh produce industry regardless of whether they consider themselves to be a ' gangmaster ' . It also has relevance for Labour Users who contract the services of Labour Providers and on whose premises workers are employed . As is made clear in the foreword to the code , others involved in the supply chain have important responsibilities . For more information read the leaflet ' What does the Code mean for me ? ' or visit the download page for other relevant documents . | | || | | | | || Why should I comply with the Code ? | | || The Association of Labour Providers is making compliance with the Code a condition of membership . The Fresh Produce Consortium and the National Farmers Union have urged their members to use only labour providers that comply with the code . To reinforce these commitments the supermarkets are actively encouraging all suppliers to use only labour providers who are working to comply with the code of practice . | | || | | | | || What happens when I register ? | | || Following registration , Labour providers must arrange to be audited against the Code by a firm of trained auditors and then agree a programme for rectifying any shortcomings that are identified . The audit will include a review of documentation , a physical inspection and worker interviews . | | || | | | | || Do I have to pay to become registered ? | | || Initial registration is free . However , the auditor 's fees must be borne by the Labour Provider . The audit is a thorough process and will take up to two days . | | || | | | | || How do I register ? | | || Initial registration can be completed online through this web site , or by downloading a registration form which should be completed and returned by fax or post to the registration secretary . Registration forms will also be available at the upcoming regional events which are being held to explain the Code and assist in your preparation for it , details of which will be published on this site . | | || | | | | || What will happen if I do n't register ? | | || As the Association of Labour Providers is making compliance with the Code a condition of membership and the Fresh Produce Consortium , the National Farmers Union and the supermarkets are all urging their members to use only labour providers that comply with the code , it is in your best interests to register . | | || | | | | || I trade under more than one name . Do I need just one audit ? | | || If you trade under more than one name then only the named company that is audited will qualify as registered and audited . Any other names or businesses run with only a partial link to the registered business will not qualify and will need to be audited separately . | | || | | | | || How do I find an auditor ? | | || We will be publishing a list of auditors trained in auditing against the Code of Practice on this web site in due course . You should use an auditor from this list . | | || | | | | || What happens after the audit ? | | || Any issues will be recorded in a Corrective Action Plan . If there are no critical non-compliances , your business will be listed and labour users will be able to identify that you have been audited and therefore reach a certain standard . If there are critical non- compliances then these will need to be addressed before the business can be listed on the site . | | || | | | | || Will the GLA recognise an audit ? | | || As a general rule the GLA will recognise successful audits against the TLWG code as counting towards a licence . ie. Labour Providers that have been audited successfully against the Code will not normally require to be audited again on application . However , the GLA reserves the right to require a further audit depending on : | - The age of the previous audit - The completeness of the original audit against the TLWG Code - The nature and degree of any unresolved non-compliances from the original audit | || | | |","annotations":[{"text":"some labour providers","span":[69,89],"token_span":[17,19],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent avoids an Undesirable_situation."},{"text":"tax","span":[158,160],"token_span":[31,31],"role":"Undesirable_situation","label":"Undesirable_situation","role_definition":"This role identifies the situation that the Agent avoids."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Agent avoids an Undesirable_situation under certain Circumstances.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":["Dodging","Evading"]},{"instance_id":"EN-2419-333-frame-Bail_decision","frame":"Bail_decision","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"In March 2009 , three months after her abduction , Mukoko was released on bail . update Pambazuka News , \" Jestina Mukoko released \" , 6 March 2009 , accessed 19 January 2011 Her bail conditions required her to report to her local police station in Norton on a weekly basis and surrender her passport . \" Zimbabwe Supreme Court orders end to prosecution of activist Jestina Mukoko \" , Amnesty International News , 27 September 2009 , accessed 19 January 2011","annotations":[{"text":"March 2009","span":[3,12],"token_span":[1,2],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time when the bail setting occurs."},{"text":"Jestina Mukoko","span":[107,120],"token_span":[21,22],"role":"Accused","label":"Accused","role_definition":"At the time of bail setting, the Accused is held without bail/bond, released on his/her own recognizance, or required to give the Court a specific amount of money for bail."},{"text":"Her bail conditions required her to report to her local police station in Norton on a weekly basis and surrender her passport","span":[175,299],"token_span":[34,55],"role":"Status","label":"Status","role_definition":"Status idenitifies the decision made with regard to bail.

AFRICA ACTION WELCOMES JESTINA MUKOKO'S RELEASE Yesterday , human rights activist Jestina Mukoko was released on bail following three months of incarceration in Zimbabwe prisons . Africa Action welcomes this development and wishes to extend appreciation to hundreds of activists who responded to our calls over the last 3 months to take action demanding Jestina 's release . Jestina is ' free ' today due to the collective efforts of people of good conscience all over the world who stood in solidarity with her during months of unlawful incarceration . It is this outcry that made the government of Zimbabwe realize that the world is not just watching but is in fact , utterly outraged by cases of gross human rights violations . As we welcome Jestina 's release , we note with dismay that fabricated charges against her are still in place . We believe that these charges should be dropped immediately and Jestina must be allowed to go back to her life of civic activism without any intimidation or hindrance . Of great concern too is the fact that the government of Zimbabwe continues to hold other political prisoners . If the new inclusive government of Zimbabwe is serious , and wants to be taken seriously by the world its human rights , governance and democratic record must improve and that includes immediate release of all political prisoners . A notable case is that of Roy Bennett , the designate Deputy Minister for Agriculture in the inclusive government who has been in prison for almost a month now . Despite the fact that Roy Bennett was granted bail by the courts , he remains incarcerated because the government of Zimbabwe continues to manipulate the judicial system . All political detainees in Zimbabwe have told stories of torture and other forms of abuse at the hands of state agents . Jestina Mukoko had to be released to a hospital because of serious health problems from torture and horrible prison conditions . In the interest of justice , we believe that those responsible for torture and abuse must be brought to book . The culture of impunity by Zimbabwe 's police and other security agents must stop immediately if the inclusive government is to be taken seriously .","annotations":[{"text":"2009-03-06","span":[4109,4118],"token_span":[668,668],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time when the bail setting occurs."},{"text":"human rights activist Jestina Mukoko","span":[4759,4794],"token_span":[766,770],"role":"Accused","label":"Accused","role_definition":"At the time of bail setting, the Accused is held without bail/bond, released on his/her own recognizance, or required to give the Court a specific amount of money for bail."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"This frame covers a step in a criminal process in which a Judge decides whether the Accused should be released on bail, and, if so, what the amount of the bail should be.

JACK WHITE : I think all of four of us probably met around the same six-month period , back in 1998 . How does it feel to be playing in a four - piece band , Jack ? JW : Great . I have n't been onstage with more than one other person in years . Last time I was in that situation was when I was in The Go in Detroit for about six months , and we never played to more than a hundred people . What prompted you to get together in the first place ? JW : Brendan said , ' I 've got this song that needs some lyrics ' . I took a listen to it and it was the music for \u201c Steady , As She Goes \u201d . So I wrote the lyrics for it and we recorded it , though it was kind of more reggae-sounding at that point . We really loved it and just kept playing it , so we said , ' Maybe it 's time to do this band we keep talking about ' . That song really was the trigger . The subject had nothing to do with your marriage , Jack ? JW : No , it was long before that . A year before , I would say . But it 's asking a question , which is , ' Is doing that \u2013 getting married and settling down \u2013 starting a new life or is it giving up ? ' Are you raconteurs ? JW : I thought yeah , it 's something I 've always tried to do songwriting - wise . And it 's hard to do , because it 's hard to sneak it into songs , to get away with something like \u201c Frankie And Johnny \u201d . BRENDAN BENSON : I would love to think of myself as a raconteur . It sounds very sophisticated . Is it liberating playing with a proper rhythm section , Jack ? JW : When we started working , I knew I did n't want it to sound anything like The White Stripes . The easy way was to say it 's not going to have any of the constrictions that The White Stripes have . We were gonna take all that boxing - in away . So that helped 90 per cent of that . Is there something of The Stooges here that you can never achieve with Meg ? JW : There were tons of things like that , like synthesizers and guitar solos . It 's hard with The White Stripes when I put a guitar solo on something like \u201c Black Math \u201d , I 've got to stop playing the riff and try to play them both at once . You think , ' It sounds cool now but I hope it sounds cool live when we finally do it ' . With these songs I knew I 'd be able to do it , whatever we did . In some ways it seems like an unlikely alliance \u2013 powerpop meets gothic punk blues . BB : Stylistically I guess we 're different , but we both love the same music . I love The Stooges , though I do n't write songs like The Stooges . What inspired the organ sound for \u201c Store Bought Bones \u201d ? JW : I 'm a big Jon Lord fan , and you do n't hear organs with that grunt and that crunchy sound anymore . Jack , you 've said that \u201c Brendan is a lot more song craftsman \u201d , whereas you 're \u201c more emotional and from the hip \u201d . Do you agree with that , Brendan ? BB : Yeah , he 's more commercial , I 'm more indie . [ Laughs ] Yeah , I might agree with that . JW : But we 're also learning that people think something sounds like Brendan or sounds like me , and in fact it turns out it was the other way round . On \u201c Store Bought Bones \u201d Brendan played slide , which is always the first thing I would normally go to . BB : It 's like a guessing game with this record , which is why we did n't say who did what on the artwork . For me it 's been especially exciting to try new things and get away with them . I could do impressions \u2013 do Jack , or write a riff that I would never normally write . Is it a holiday ? JW : It is , yeah . When we worked on Loretta Lynn 's album it was enjoyable but it was n't necessarily fun time . I mean , we had to go to work , there was a job to be done . Whereas when we started this band , there was no , ' This is gonna be a soul band or this is gonna be a big rock band ' . Nobody said anything about anything we were gonna be . There are songs here that could have been on a Brendan Benson album and maybe songs that could even have been on a White Stripes album . Then there are tracks that really feel like you guys meeting halfway . JW : I had not one note of any song that I brought to the table , although the main organ riff on \u201c Store Bought Bones \u201d had sort of started life as something for Satan . Brendan had a couple of things that did n't have middle eights or did n't have lyrics . I think \u201c Together \u201d was a song that he had one line for , and maybe \u201c Hands \u201d also . \u201d The harmonies on \u201c Hands \u201d are straight off Revolver . JW : When we started the band , I knew that one thing I definitely wanted to do was two - or three - part harmonies , which I 'd never been able to do . Meg had done a little bit here and there , with \u201c Little Ghost \u201d and stuff like that , but we almost kind of kept it just for our country songs . \u201c Broken Boy Soldier \u201d is a great title and a great phrase . Is it a song about masculinity in general ? Or about bands , perhaps ? JW : I guess it was about breaking out , like it 's time for everybody to grow up , kind of thing . There 's a feeling when all your friends are musicians and nobody has a real job , you wonder how long this is going to last and how long it 's going to be before people start \u2026 not getting a real job necessarily , but treating people with respect and acting more responsibly . That was the second song we wrote , and that 's when I knew things were going to get interesting .

Fairfax 's to me as follows \u201c If on the British Establishment Officer 's are allowd more Pay , the Regimentals they are oblig 'd annually to furnish , their necessary Table and other Incidents being considerd , little or no savings will be their Portion \u201d 7 \u2014 I believe it is well known we have been at the expence of Regimentals ( and it is still better known , that Regimentals , and every other necessary that we were under an indispensable necessity of purchasing for this Expedition , were not to be bought for less Virga curr [enc ]y , than British Officer 's cd get for sterling money ; 8 which they ought to have been , to put us upon a parity in this respect , then Colo . Fairfax observes that their Table and other Incident charges prevents them frm saving much : if they dont save much , they have the enjoyment of their Pay which we neither have in one sense nor the other : We are debarr 'd the pleasure of good Living , which Sir ( I dare say with me you will concur ) to one who has always been used to it ; must go somewhat hard to be confin'd to a little salt provision and Water : and do duty , hard , laborious duty that is almost inconsistent with that of a Soldier , and yet have the same Reductions as if we were allowd luxuriously : My Pay accordg to the British Establisht & common exchange is near 22 / pr Day , in the R[ oo ] m of that the Committee ( for I ca n't in the least imagine yr Hr had any h[ an ] d in it ) has provided 12/6 so long as the Service requires me , whereas , one half of the other is ascertain'd to the British Officer 's forever : now if we shd be fortunate enough to drive the French from Ohio \u2014 as far as your Honour wd please have them sent to \u2014 in any short time , our Pay will not be sufficient to discharge our first expences . I would not have your Honour imagine from this , that I have said all these things to have the Pay encreas 'd \u2014 but to justify myself , and shew your Honour that our complaints are not frivolous , but are founded upon strict Reason : for my own part , it is a matter almost indefferent whether I serve for full pay , or as a generous Volunteer ; indeed , did my circumstances corrispond with my Inclination , I shd not hesitate a moment to prefer the Latter : for the motives that lead me here were pure and Noble I had no view of acquisition but that of Honour , by serving faithfully my King and Country . As your Honour has recommended Mr Willis you may depend I shall with pleasure do all that I can for him . But above all Sir , you may depend I shall take all possible means of procureing intelligence , and guarding against surprises , and be assur 'd nothing but very unequal number 's shall engage me to submit or Retreat . Now Sir , as I have answer 'd your Honour 's Letter I shall beg leave to acqt you with what has happen'd since I wrote by Mr Gist ;9 I then acquainted you that I had detach 'd a party of 75 Men to meet with 50 of the French who we had Intelligence were upon their March towards us to Reconnoitre &ca [ . ] Abt 9 Oclock the same Night , I receivd an express from the Half King who was Incampd with several of His People abt 6 Miles of , that he had seen the Tract of two French Men xing the Road and believ'd the whole body were lying not far off , as he had an acct of that number passing Mr Gist \u2014 I set out with 40 Men before 10 , and was from that time till near Sun rise before we reach 'd the Indian 's Camp , havg Marched in small path , & heavy Rain , and a Night as Dark as it is possible to concieve \u2014 we were frequently tumbling one over another , and often so lost that 15 or 20 Minutes search would not find the path again . When we came to the Half King I council 'd with him , and got his assent to go hand in hand and strike the French . accordingly , himself , Monacatoocha , and a few other Indians set out with us , and when we came to the place where the Tracts were , the Half King sent Two Indians to follow their Tract and discover their lodgment which they did abt half a mile from the Road in a very obscure place surrounded with Rocks . 10 I thereupon in conjuction with the Half King & Monacatoocha , formd a disposion to attack them on all sides , which we accordingly did and after an Engagement of abt 15 Minutes we killd 10 , wounded one and took 21 Prisoner 's , 11 amongst those that were killd was Monsieur De Jumonville the Commander , Principl Officers taken is Monsieur Druillong and Monsr Laforc , who your Honour has often heard me speak of as a bold Enterprising Man , and a person of gt subtilty and cunning with these are two Cadets \u2014 These Officers pretend they were coming on an Embassy , but the absurdity of this pretext is too glaring as your Honour will see by the Instructions and summons inclos 'd : 12 There Instructions were to reconnoitre the Country , Roads , Creeks &ca to Potomack ; which they were abt to do , These Enterpriseing Men were purposely choose out to get intelligence , which they were to send Back by some brisk dispatches with mention of the Day that they were to serve the Summon's ; which could be through no other view , than to get sufficient Reinforcements to fall upon us imediately after . This with several other Reasons induc 'd all the Officers to beleive firmly that they were sent as spys rather than any thing else , and has occasiond my sending them as prisoners , tho they expected ( or at least had some faint hope of being continued as ambassadors ) They finding where we were Incamp 'd , instead of coming up in a Publick manner sought out one of the most secret Retirements ; fitter for a Deserter than an Ambassador to incamp in \u2014 s [ t ] ayd there two or 3 days sent Spies to Reconnoitre our Camp as we are told , tho they deny it \u2014 Their whole Body movd back near 2 Miles , sent off two runnors to acquaint Contracoeur with our Strength , and where we were Incamp 'd &ca now 36 Men wd almost have been a Retinue for a Princely Ambassador , instead of Petit , why did they , if there design 's were open stay so long within 5 Miles of us witht delivering his Ambassy , or acquainting me with it ; his waiting cd be with no other design than to get Detachts to enforce the Summons as soon as it was given , they had no occasion to send out Spy's ; for the Name of Ambassador is Sacred among all Nations ; but it was by the Tract of these Spy 's they were discoverd , and we got Intilligence of them \u2014 They wd not have retird two Miles back witht delivering the Summons and sought a sculking place ( which to do them justice was done with gt Judgment ) but for some especial Reason : Besides The Summon 's is so insolent , & savour 's so much of Gascoigny that if two Men only had come openly to deliver it . 13 It was too great Indulgence to have sent them back . The Sense of the Half King on this Subject is , that they have bad Hearts , and that this is a mere pretence , they never designd to have come to us but in a hostile manner , and if we were so foolish as to let them go again , he never would assist us in taking another of them [ . ] 14 Besides , looseing La Force I really think wd tend more to our disservice than 50 other Men , as he is a person whose active Spirit , leads him into all parlys , and brought him acquainted with all parts , add to this a perfect use of the Indian Tongue , and gt influence with the Indian He Ingenuously enough confessd that as soon as he saw the commission & Instructions that he believd and then said he expected some such tendency tho he pretends to say he does not believe the Commander had any other but a good design . In this Engagement we had only one Man killd , and two or three wounded , among which was Lieutt Waggener slightly \u2014 a most miraculous escape , as Our Right Wing was much exposd to their Fire and receivd it all . The Half King receiv'd your Honour 's speech very kind : but desird me to inform you that he could not leave his People at this time , thinking them in great Danger15 \u2014 He is now gone to the xing for their Familys to bring to our Camp & desird I wd send some Men and Horses to assist them up ; which I have accordingly done \u2014 sent 30 Men & upwards of 20 Horses . He say 's if your Honr has any thing to say you may communicate by me &ca ; and that if you have a present for them it may be kept to another occasion , after sending up some things for their imediate use , He has declar'd to send these Frenchmens Scalps with a Hatchet to all the Nations of Indian 's in union with them , and did that very day give a Hatchet and a large Belt of Wampum to a Delaware Man to carry to Shingiss : 16 he promis 'd me to send down the River for all the Mingo 's & Shawnesse to our camp , where I expect him to Morrow with 30 or 40 Men with their wives & Children , to confirm what he has said here , he has sent your Honour a String of Wampum . As these Runnors went of to the Fort on Sunday last , I shall expect every hour to be attackd and by unequal number 's , which I must withstand if there is 5 to 1 or else I fear the Consequence will be we shall loose the Indians if we suffer ourselves to be drove Back , I dispatchd an express imediately to Colo . Fry with this Intelligence desiring him to send me Reinforcements with all imaginable dispatch . 17 Your Honour may depend I will not be surprizd , let them come what hour they will \u2014 and this is as much as I can promise \u2014 but my best endeavour 's shall not be wanting to deserve more , I doubt not but if you hear I am beaten , but you will at the same hear that we have done our duty in fighting as long there was a possibility of hope . I have sent Lieutt West18 accompanied with Mr Sprilldorph19 & a Guard of 20 Men to conduct the Prisoners in , and I believe the Officer 's have acquainted him what answer to return yr Honour . Monsiur La-Force , and Monsieur Druillong beg to be recommend to your Honour 's Notice , and I have promis'd they will meet with all the favour that 's due to Impriso n'd Officer 's : I have shew 'd all the respect I cou'd to them here , and have given some necessary cloathing by which I have disfurnish 'd myself , for having brought no more than two or three Shirts from Wills Ck that we might be light I was ill provided to furnish them I am Yr Honour 's most Obt Hble Servt Go : Washington NB I have neither seen nor heard any particular acct of the Twigtwees since I came on these Water 's , we have already began a Palisadod Fort and hope to have it up tomorrow I must beg leave to acqt yr honr tht Captn Vanbraam & Monsr Peyrouney has behav 'd extreamely well since they came out \u2014 & I hope will meet wth yr Honrs favr . 20 ALS , ViHi. 1 .

Joseph Coulon de Villiers , sieur de Jumonville ( 1718 \u2013 1754 ) , a 16 \u2013 year veteran of the French army in America , held the rank of ensign and in 1754 was assigned to Fort Duquesne . Ordered by the sieur de Contrecoeur to carry a \u201c summons \u201d to the English to vacate the Ohio country , he left the fort on 23 May in command of approximately 35 men . Among his officers was Pierre Jacques Drouillon ( Druillon ) , sieur de Mac\u00e9 ( b. 1725 ) , also an ensign , who returned to Canada after he was freed and became a lieutenant in the French army in 1759 . For La Force , see William Trent to GW , 19 Feb. 1754 , n.5 . The two cadets were named de Boucherville and Dusabl\u00e9 . The controversy concerning GW 's engagement with Jumonville has persisted until recent times . The French claimed that Jumonville 's role was that of ambassador and that while on a peaceful mission , similar to GW 's own mission to the French commandant a few months before , he and his party were ambushed by the Virginia troops . Contrecoeur recounted what was to become the French version of the affair in a letter to Duquesne , 2 June 1754 : \u201c I expected Mr. de Jumonville , within four Days ; the Indians have just now informed me , that that Party is taken and defeated ; they were Eight in Number , one whereof was Mr. de Jumonville . One of that Party , Monceau by Name , a Canadian , made his Escape , and tells us that they had built themselves Cabbins , in a low Bottom , where they sheltered themselves , as it rained hard . About seven o' Clock the next Morning , they saw themselves surrounded by the English on one Side and the Indians on the Other . The English gave them two Volleys , but the Indians did not fire . Mr. de Jumonville , by his Interpreter , told them to desist , that he had something to tell them . Upon which they ceased firing . Then Mr. de Jumonville ordered the Summons which I had sent them to retire , to be read . . . . The aforesaid Monceau , saw all our Frenchmen coming up close to Mr. de Jumonville , whilst they were reading the Summons , so that they were all in Platoons , between the English and the Indians , during which Time , said Monceau made the best of his Way to us , partly by Land through the Woods , and partly along the River Monaungahela , in a small Canoe . This is all , Sir , I could learn from said Monceau . The Misfortune is , that our People were surprized ; the English had incircled them , and came upon them unseen . . . . The Indians who were present when the Thing was done , say , that Mr. de Jumonville was killed by a Musket - Shot in the Head , whilst they were reading the Summons ; and that the English would afterwards have killed all our Men , had not the Indians who were present , by rushing in between them and the English , prevented their Design \u201d ( Memorial Containing a Summary View of Facts description begins [ Jacob Nicolas Moreau ] .

A copy of the summons , 23 May 1754 , signed by Contrecoeur and addressed to the commander of any English troops that Jumonville might find in the lands claimed by the French is in P.R.O. , C.O. 5/1328 , f. 119 . A copy of Contrecoeur 's instructions to Jumonville , 23 May 1754 , is in P.R.O. , C.O. 5/1328 , f. 118 . 14 . The role of the Indians in the engagement remains obscure . An eyewitness on the French side claimed the Indians did not fire and the French casualties were the result of British volleys ( see note 12 ) . Similarly in his diary GW stated that \u201c we killed Mr. de Jumonville . . . as also nine others . . . . The Indians scalped the Dead \u201d ( Diaries description begins Donald Jackson and Dorothy Twohig , eds . The Diaries of George Washington . 6 vols . Charlottesville , Va. , 1976\u201379 . description ends , 1 :195 ) . In a letter to the Board of Trade of 18 June 1754 , however , Dinwiddie wrote that \u201c this little Skirmish was by the Half - King & their Indians , we were as auxiliaries to them , as my Orders to the Commander of our Forces [ were ] to be on the Defensive \u201d ( P.R.O. , C.O. 5/1328 , ff. 117 , 120 ) . John Shaw , a veteran of the surrender at Fort Necessity , claimed that Jumonville was killed with a tomahawk by the Half - King who then scalped the French commander ( McDowell , S.C.

In Colonial Records of South Carolina , 2d ser. , vols. 2 \u20133 . description ends , 4 ) . That the Indians may have been responsible for at least some of the French deaths is suggested by the fact that the French force which marched out of Fort Duquesne on 28 June in pursuit of the English found when they reached the site of the skirmish that a number of bodies had been left unburied , a custom often adopted by Indians hoping to discourage their enemies ( \u201c Journal of M. de Villiers , \u201d Memorial Containing a Summary View of Facts description begins [ Jacob Nicolas Moreau ] .

In the early 1750s he supported the British , but after going over to the French probably in late 1754 , he became the scourge of English settlements along the Pennsylvania frontier . In 1754 he was living in the vicinity of McKee 's Rocks in Allegheny County , Pa. 18 . John West , Jr. ( d. 1777 ) , was a surveyor for Fairfax County . The date of his commission as the fourth lieutenant in the Virginia Regiment was 27 Feb. 1754 . He resigned his commission in late summer following this campaign . He was the son of Hugh West ( 1705 \u2013 1754 ) . 19 .

He was killed with Braddock 's forces at the Battle of the Monongahela , 9 July 1755 . 20 . William La P\u00e9ronie , a Frenchman with military experience , came to Virginia about 1750 . His name is variously spelled , even , apparently , by La P\u00e9ronie himself . See for example , his letter to GW , 5 Sept. 1754 . After he was wounded in the engagement at Fort Necessity , Dinwiddie made him adjutant of the regiment on GW 's recommendation ( GW to Dinwiddie , 10 June 1754 ) .

The General Manager ( GM ) , Emeka Ugoanyanwu , stated , at the weekend , that the residents dump refuse , defecate , bury corpses and construct soak - away pit around the river . Also , the World Bank would start a project to provide safe water for Imo citizens by January . Ugoanyanwu disclosed this in Owerri , during a roundtable dialogue organised by Open Arms Initiative for Sustainable Development , with three monarchs from five autonomous communities in Owerri municipality in attendance . He regretted that the Urban Renewal programme of then Governor Rochas Okorocha 's administration witnessed destruction of pipelines laid in the city , making it difficult for tap water to run into the homes of different parts of the city .

His origins lay in ancient Egypt , like those of Hawkman and Fantomah . He was a crime - fighting magician like continued below | Mandrake and Zanzibar ; and also like them , did n't maintain a secret identity or wear a flashy costume while doing so . He did depart from the Mandrake mold by sporting a turban , but then , so did Mr. Mystic and Sargon the Sorcerer . Least unique of all , he was a comic book superhero who flourished in the early 1940s , and there were hundreds of others like that . | But he was among the more successful of the magician superheroes . In fact , having been in regular publication for more than 13 years , he was the most successful of all , other than Mandrake himself . Ibis was first seen in Whiz Comics # 2 , published by Fawcett Publications with a cover date of February , 1940 . His origin story was written by editor Bill Parker and drawn by C.C. Beck , just like those of Captain Marvel and Spy Smasher , which also appeared in Whiz # 2 , tho Parker and Beck both left the character early on . Ibis 's later writers and artists included , among others , Otto Binder ( Supergirl , Legion of Super Heroes ) and Pete Costanza ( who for years was Beck 's main assistant ) . Ibis 's original name , 4000 years ago when he was a prince of Egypt , was Amentep . He was in love with the beautiful Princess Taia of Thebes , but an evil magician calling himself The Black Pharoah kidnaped Taia and seized the throne , imprisoning Amentep as he did . Amentep 's uncle snuck a magic wand called the Ibistick to him , whereupon the prince became Ibis the Invincible . In the ensuing melee , Taia was struck by an arrow . Before she could die , Ibis used the wand to put her into suspended animation long enough for the wound to heal , then did the same to himself so he could be with her when she woke up . Both came to in 1940 , in separate museums , where they were being exhibited as mummies . They had little trouble getting together , and even less adapting to life in the 20th century , in which Ibis , his former occupation as an Egyptian prince no longer available to him , embarked on a new career of using the Ibistick to bash evil . Like a majority of the features starting in Whiz # 2 , Ibis proved popular enough to get his own comic . But it came out only sporadically , a total of six issues appearing between 1942 and ' 48 . He did , however , remain in the back pages of Whiz Comics as long as that title lasted , i.e. , until # 155 ( June , 1953 ) . After that , Fawcett got out of the comic book business . It continued to put out a variety of regular magazines , but its only foray back into comics publishing came several years later , when it licensed Hank Ketcham 's Dennis the Menace . Charlton Comics , which picked up several of Fawcett 's properties ( such as the horror title This Magazine Is Haunted and the western Lash Larue ) , apparently included Ibis among its acquisitions , as the magician starred in a cover- featured story in Charlton 's Danger & Adventure # 22 ( February 1955 ) , which also reprinted a Fawcett - published story about Nyoka the Jungle Girl . Later issues of Danger & Adventure featured other Fawcett characters , such as Lance O'Casey and Colonel Corn . Ibis may have made one or two other Charlton appearances , but bibliographic material is sketchy . Nonetheless , when , decades later , DC Comics acquired Fawcett 's old superhero characters , Ibis was included again \u2014 not a unique situation , as Fawcett was also apparently careless enough to have sold Hoppy the Marvel Bunny to both Charlton and DC . DC 's first use of Ibis was in a very crowded 1976 crossover involving The Justice League and Justice Society of America .

His image , along with the ' saltire ' ( or diagonal cross ) associated with him , has been used for political as well as religious purposes from early medieval times until the present . According to the Gospels , Andrew was a fisherman from Galilee and the first disciple of Christ . He is believed to have been martyred by crucifixion in Patras ( now part of Greece ) on 30 November in the year AD 60 . It is thought that his remains were removed to Constantinople about AD 357 , but after Constantinople was sacked during the Fourth Crusade in 1204 , the relics at Constantinople were taken to the cathedral of St Andrew at Amalfi in Italy . | By this time the monastery of Kilrymont ( later St Andrews ) in Fife claimed to possess three fingers of the saint 's right hand , a part of one of his arms , one kneecap , and one of his teeth . It is possible that these were brought to Fife ( which was at that time part of the kingdom of the Picts ) from the neighbouring kingdom of Northumberland . Although veneration of St Andrew was particularly strong there , having been brought to England by St Augustine , it was St Andrews that became a popular pilgrimage destination after miracles were attributed to the saint . | | Cast of the seal of the Guardians of Scotland ( NAS reference RH17/1/17 ) Another explanation for the relics became current by the 12th century . In this version the bishop of Patras ( Saint Regulus ) removed the relics about AD345 , sailed beyond the Mediterranean and was shipwrecked at Kilrymont , where he founded a church . Early Scottish historians , such as Walter Bower and George Buchanan , relate that Saint Andrew appeared in a vision to the Pictish king ( Hungus or Angus ) , who was about to fight a major battle against the Saxon king ( Athelstan ) , and promised victory to the the Picts . The grateful king welcomed Regulus and the relics and endowed the fledgling church with the lands around the bay where the saint had landed . The main problem with this story is that the kings mentioned reigned in the 8th or 9th centuries , not the 4th . The Regulus legend was promoted by Scottish kings , nobles and churchmen from the 12th century onwards for political reasons . Scottish independence had come under threat from England since the late 11th century , and the Scottish Church was contesting a claim to primacy by the archbishop of York . Precedence and hierarchy were very important in the middle ages . By promoting the story of Saint Andrew 's choice of Scotland in the 4th century , the Scots acquired a top-rank patron saint , a separate identity from England , and a date for the supposed foundation of the Scottish Church , pre-dating the conversion of England and Ireland to Christianity by several centuries . | In the Wars of Independence , fought by Scotland in the 13th and 14th centuries , the Scots used the story as part of the diplomatic battle to persuade the papacy to recognise Scotland as an independent kingdom . Pope Boniface , in a papal bull of 1299 , demanded that Edward I of England end the war against Scotland , and reminded Edward how Scotland \" was converted , and won to the unity of the Christian faith , by the venerable relics of the blessed Apostle Andrew , with a great outpouring of the divine power . \" | It should come as no surprise therefore that reference is made to St Andrew in the most famous claim to Scottish self - determination and what is probably our greatest documentary treasure : the letter of the Barons of Scotland to Pope John XXII , sent in April or May 1320 , popularly known as the Declaration of Arbroath . The Declaration of Arbroath is written in Latin , but the English translation of the paragraph in question reads : \" The high qualities and deserts of these people , were they not otherwise manifest , gain glory enough from this : that the King of kings and Lord of lords , our Lord Jesus Christ , after his Passion and Resurrection , called them , even though settled in the uttermost parts of the earth , almost the first to His most holy faith . Nor would He have them confirmed in that faith by merely anyone but by the first of His Apostles - by calling , though second or third rank - the most gentle Saint Andrew , the Blessed Peter 's brother , and desired him to keep them under his protection as their patron for ever . \" The image of Saint Andrew thereafter came to symbolise Scotland and another 12th century legend - that the saint was crucified on a ' crux decussata ' ( an X -shaped cross ) - provided a simpler symbol . The Scottish heraldic term for such a cross is a ' saltire ' , from the old French word ' saultoir ' , meaning a type of stirrup . | || | Declaration of Arbroath ( NAS reference SP13 / 7 ) . Read more about the Declaration of Arbroath . It was used on seals in Scotland from about 1180 onwards , sometimes along with the lion rampant , which was the heraldic symbol of the Scottish crown . In 1286 , when Scotland was ruled by the Guardians of Scotland in the absence of a king , the saint was depicted on the Guardians ' seal , used to authenticate their legal documents and communications to the rest of Europe . The seal included the inscription : \" Andrea Scotis dux esto compatriotis \" ( Andrew be leader of the compatriot Scots ) . The images below show examples of two documents with the St Andrew and lion rampant seals . Order by Edward I for payment of 2s. a day to Master Alan de Dunfres , Chancellor of Scotland , and his clerk , 4 Jul 1292 ( NAS reference RH5/55 ) and warrant from the Guardians to the Chamberlain of Scotland to pay Master Thomas de Carnoto , late Chancellor , a quarter 's salary , 18 Aug 1291 ( NAS reference RH5/101 ) .

Carson came to graphic design relatively late in life . He was a competitive surfer \u2014 ranked eighth in the world \u2014 and a California high - school teacher when , at age 26 , he enrolled in a two - week commercial design class . Discovering a new calling , he briefly enrolled at a commercial art school before working as a designer at a small surfer magazine , Self and Musician . He then spent four years as a part-time designer for the magazine Transworld Skateboarding , which enabled him to experiment . His characteristic chaotic spreads with overlapped photos and mixed and altered type fonts drew both admirers and detractors . Photographer Albert Watson , for example , declared , \u201c He uses type the way a painter uses paint , to create emotion , to express ideas . \u201d Others felt that the fractured presentation obscured the message it carried . In 1989 Carson became art director at the magazine Beach Culture . Although he produced only six issues before the journal folded , his work there earned him more than 150 design awards . By that time , Carson 's work had caught the eye of Marvin Scott Jarrett , publisher of the alternative - music magazine Ray Gun , and he hired Carson as art director in 1992 . Over the next three years , with the help of Carson 's radical design vision , Ray Gun 's circulation tripled . Because Carson 's work clearly appealed to a youthful readership , corporations such as Nike and Levi Strauss & Co. commissioned him to design print ads , and he also began directing television commercials . After leaving Ray Gun in 1995 , Carson established David Carson Design . The firm was instantly successful and attracted well - known , wealthy corporate clients . In 1995 Carson produced The End of Print : The Graphic Design of David Carson ( revised edition issued in 2000 as The End of Print : The Grafik Design of David Carson ) , the first comprehensive collection of his distinctive graphic imagery . This was followed by the boldly experimental books 2nd Sight ( 1997 ) , Fotografiks ( 1999 ) , and Trek ( 2003 ) . In 2014 Carson was awarded an AIGA Medal .

Musa Qala saw some of the fiercest clashes between Western forces and the Taliban following the American - led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 . Three US air strikes on Saturday around Musa Qala reportedly killed up to 40 Taliban fighters but the militants regrouped to push Afghan ground forces back .

The battalion was part of the 20th Brigade of the newly formed 7th Division . It completed basic training at Ingleburn before marching to Bathurst army camp to undergo subunit field training . In October the 20th Brigade , comprising the 2/13th , 2/15th , and 2/17th Battalions , sailed from Sydney Harbour for the Middle East . The brigade transferred to the newly formed 9th Division en route to Egypt . Arriving in November the battalion travelled by train to Palestine and went into camp at Kilo 89 . Early in March 1941 the 9th Division moved into Cyrenaica replacing the 6th Division going to Greece . The Axis were also reorganising their forces . German forces landed at Tripoli , bolstering the Italians , and advanced east . The British were forced to evacuate Benghazi and fall back to Tobruk , referred to as the \" Benghazi handicap \" . The 2/13th covered the division 's withdrawal . The 2/13th was first complete Australian unit to fight German troops during the Second World War . The battle took place at Er Regima on 4 April 1941 . The battalion was thinly spread along an 11 kilometre front against a German force of about 3,000 men . The battle began mid-afternoon and continued into the night . Outnumbered and vulnerable the battalion fought on until 10 pm before withdrawing . They initially moved of on foot but were soon picked up by trucks and driven 16 km east of Barce to rest . By 9 April the 2/13th joined the rest of the division at Tobruk . It helped defend the \" fortress \" for eight months , being the only Australian battalion to see out the siege . It planned to evacuate in October but was delayed when their convey was forced to turn back from enemy air attack . The battalion remained in Tobruk until the siege was lifted in December . The 9th Division returned to Palestine before going to Syria to perform garrison duties . The 2/13th rejoined the division at Lattakia . By July 1942 the war in North Africa was critical for the British Eighth Army . German and Italian forces had reached El Alamein , about seventy miles from Alexandria . The 9th Division rushed to Alamein and held the northern sector for almost four months while the Eighth Army reinforced under new a commander . The 2/13th reached the forward British defences in mid-July and moved to Tel El Eisa in early - August . It fought in the Alamein battle from 23 October to 5 November 1942 . The 9th Division was recalled to Australia to face a new enemy - the Japanese . The 2/13th left Egypt in January 1943 and disembarked at Sydney in February . After leave and jungle training on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland in August the battalion embarked for Milne Bay in Papua . On 4 September the battalion departed Milne Bay on landing craft and landed on Red Beach , north - west of Lae , without casualties . It carried out subsequent jungle operations until Lae fell 12 days later . The battalion also landed at Scarlet Beach near Finschhafen on 22 September , helping defend the area against Japanese counter-attack . The 2/13th returned to Australia in March 1944 , disembarking in Brisbane . After leave , it reformed at Ravenshoe and did not return to action until the final months of the war . Towards the end of April the 9th Division was transported to Morotai to prepare for amphibious landings on Borneo as part of the OBOE operations . The 2/13th landed at Brunei on 10 June before making another landing in the Miri-Lutong area ten days later . The battalion captured the Lutong airfield and oil tanks and moved inland along the Pujut Road to the Pujut oilfields . It then moved along Canada Hill to Lobang , where it remained until the end of the war . Following Japan 's surrender , the 2/13th 's ranks thinned , as men were discharged or transferred . The battalion moved to Luban in November and in December sailed to Australia to \" wind up \" in preparation for disbandment .","annotations":[{"text":"Early in March 1941","span":[1039,1057],"token_span":[211,214],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the Assailant attacks the Victim."},{"text":"German forces","span":[1189,1201],"token_span":[237,238],"role":"Assailant","label":"Assailant","role_definition":"The Assailant is a group of armed forces (or, metonymically, their commander or the organization they represent) that encircles, surrounds, or otherwise cuts off the Beseiged in an attempt to force surrender."},{"text":"Tobruk","span":[1331,1336],"token_span":[262,262],"role":"Victim","label":"Victim","role_definition":"The Victim is the fortification or geopolitical entity that is being attacked."},{"text":"Tobruk","span":[1331,1336],"token_span":[262,262],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the place where the Assailant makes an assault on the Victim."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Assailant, a group of armed forces, surrounds the Victim, a military location and the people within it, in an attempt to cut the Victim off from the outside, with the goal of either forcing their surrender or weakening them so that an invasion would be successful.","frame_ancestors":["Attack","Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-1571-51-frame-Borrowing","frame":"Borrowing","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"Personal life Hsu faded into obscurity in the aftermath of a legal quagmire involving contract breaches and negative press covers .

Comeback Hsu 's manager Zhou Yan Tong was irate when asked to comment on Hsu 's statements at the press conference . \" While I was being pursued by the clients because we could not fulfil our part in the contract , where were you ( Hsu ) ? \" Did you give me a way out ? \" said Zhou . Whatever the outcome of her court appeal , Hsu has at least made some headway in her bid to improve her financial situation . She announced that she is making a comeback and performed on a Taiwan television show on Wednesday . \" I 'm back . I hope everyone can continue to support me , \" Hsu told Taiwan media after the show . Hsu was paid NT$ 18,888 ( S$ 788 ) for her performance . The production team hoped the auspicious number would give her luck as she makes her way back into showbiz . - CNA / gl","annotations":[{"text":"My mother","span":[963,971],"token_span":[193,194],"role":"Borrower","label":"Borrower","role_definition":"The person who receives the Theme from the Lender for a Duration."},{"text":"money","span":[994,998],"token_span":[198,198],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The object that the Borrower receives from the Lender for a Duration."},{"text":"from people around us","span":[1000,1020],"token_span":[199,202],"role":"Lender","label":"Lender","role_definition":"The person or institution who gives the Theme to the Borrower for a Duration."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"The Borrower takes possession of a Theme with the knowledge that the Borrower will have to give the Theme back to the Lender after a Duration of time.","frame_ancestors":["Receiving","Getting","Event"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-0705-1012-frame-Breaking_out_captive","frame":"Breaking_out_captive","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"While on tour in South Africa with the Lions in 1938 , Mayne 's rambunctious nature came to the fore , smashing up colleagues ' hotel rooms , temporarily freeing a convict he had befriended and who was working on the construction of the Ellis Park Stadium and also sneaking off from a formal dinner to go antelope hunting .","annotations":[{"text":"in 1938","span":[45,51],"token_span":[9,10],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time identifies when the Agent release the Theme ."},{"text":"Mayne","span":[55,59],"token_span":[12,12],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent is the individual who ends the confinement or captivity of the Theme."},{"text":"a convict he had befriended","span":[162,188],"token_span":[30,34],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The Theme is the person or object in motion released by the Agent."}],"trigger":{"text":"freeing","start_char":154,"end_char":160,"start_token":29,"end_token":29,"frame":"Breaking_out_captive"}},"source":{"text":"Willie John McBride stood in his underpants and surveyed the scene in front of him . The wreckage of his hotel lobby lay all around , with , as Willie John recalled it , pieces of tables , bits of chair and other furniture strewn about and , in the thick of it , \" a dozen drunken Lions , all out of their tree \" . He clenched his pipe between his teeth till its tip bobbed up towards his nose , then turned towards the hotel manager , who was , at that precise moment in the early hours of the morning , dripping wet and hopping up and down on one foot . \" What , \" Willie John said to the manager , \" seems to be the problem ? \" The Lions might have got away with it if it had n't been for Bobby Windsor . It would have had to have been Bobby . The Welsh hooker was one of those players who just could not help but take things a little too far . It was Bobby who took the blame when Tommy David 's bed was shoved out of a window on to the hotel awning down below . He had the misfortune to be standing in the shot when a local photographer took a snap of the scene . \" I was known as ' the fireman ' , \" Bobby said , \" because I was the one who put the fires out . \" Literally . That night , after the Lions ' 28 - 9 victory over South Africa in the second Test of 1974 , \" someone \" , Bobby remembered , \" had set light to a load of empty cardboard beer boxes . So I got the fire extinguisher off the wall , but I could n't get it to work . So I grabbed a hose pump and used that instead . \" Flushed with pride at having fulfilled his civic duty , Windsor was somewhat surprised to find himself being berated by the hotel manager across the pile of soggy , steaming cardboard . \" He was being a right prat , \" Bobby said . \" So I gave him a right good drenching as well . \" Roger Uttley , the English forward , was sober enough to know that he had better run and get the captain , Willie John . \" Roger was banging on my door at 3 am , shouting that there was a bit of trouble and I was needed downstairs . \" McBride strolled out , in his pants , pausing only to pick up his pipe because \" I never go anywhere without it , especially in times of crisis \" . \" In the midst of all this carnage there was an extremely irate hotel manager , shouting and screaming . \" For some reason , when Willie John , naked but for his pants and pipe , asked him what the matter was , the manager snapped and said he was going to call the police . \" Now , \" Willie John thought to himself , \" I 'd seen the riot police in operation in South Africa and did n't like the images my mind was conjuring up . I could see hordes of them rushing through the door and I did n't think they 'd be asking for autographs from these drunken idiots . \" Willie John paused and saw the next morning 's headlines in his mind . \" Drunken Lions darken rugby 's name \" . He considered the situation . Sucked on his pipe . \" Excuse me , but if you are going to get the police , \" he said to the manager with a smile , \" do you think there will be many of them ? \" That was that . The Lions left the next morning , but not before they had completed one last little ritual , every bit as entrenched in Lions tradition as the selection of an uncapped player : the tour manager handed over a cheque to compensate the hotel owner for all the damage done . Both those rituals are long gone now . This is the fifth Lions tour of the professional era , and the last uncapped player to be picked for the squad was Will Greenwood in 1997 . Back then , as Keith Wood has said , \" the game had just turned professional , but there was still a lot of the amateur ethos \" . It was just wild enough to make the current trip to Australia seem pretty tame . The prop Adam Jones has described his average day in the camp before this tour as \" Wake up . Cryotherapy . Breakfast . Train . Cryotherapy . Lunch . Train. Cryotherapy . Dinner . Sleep . \" The dullest boys on tour , Jones says , are the teetotallers , who include the captain , Sam Warburton . Brian O'Driscoll says the only chance the drinkers do have to \" unwind and have a few beers together \" is on the evening after an afternoon kick -off . After the 22 - 12 win against Queensland Reds , he said , \" the non- playing 23 went home early . By the time the others got in , it was midnight . Some of the boys were already in bed . It is not as conducive to hanging out after games . \" Quite right too . Modern media coverage does not allow players to get away with much , and professionalism means that even if they could , many of them would n't want to . Under Gatland and Warburton , the Welsh turned all - but teetotal at the 2011 World Cup , allowing those who \" feel they need it \" a \" bottle or two \" of beer after a match to relax . You could n't wring too many war stories out of all that on the after-dinner speaking circuit . But everyone remembers England 's dwarf - tossing , ferry -diving escapades . Most people wo n't need reminding , either , which team was two points away from making the final and which was dumped out in disgrace in the quarters . The Lions , though , have seen it all before . When they toured New Zealand in 1908 the English forward Percy Down took a dive off the side of a ferry in the very same spot as Manu Tuilagi did , in Auckland harbour 103 years later . Down did a somersault over the railing . The main difference was that six of his team - mates followed him overboard , one of them giving himself such a bad case of concussion as he hit the water that he missed the next match . By then the Lions already had a reputation for making trouble . On their very first tour , in 1888 , the local papers in Australia carried reports complaining about their \" Rowdyism on the Railway \" between Newcastle and Armidale , when \" three galoots invaded a private first class carriage , guzzled tea without paying , smashed the cups and saucers , and left the solitary passenger to stand the racket \" . So began 109 years of raising Cain . The 1968 Lions were accused of being the \" worst - behaved team ever to tour South Africa \" by the Johannesburg Sunday Times . The sage rugby writer JBG Thomas refuted this on the grounds that , unlike at least one lot of their predecessors , \" they have never set fire to a railway carriage \" . That may have been true . But a couple of them did incinerate a pile of blazers belonging to their team - mates in a bonfire on the tarmac at Kimberley airport after what was described as an \" airborne cheese and wine party \" . \" They have left a trail of havoc and stunned incredulity after three days in East London , \" thundered the Sunday Times . \" Marked by severe drinking bouts , riotous behaviour at hotels and nightclubs . They left broken hotel doors , broken glasses by the dozen , unpaid liquor debts and girls in tears because of outright rudeness . \" In New Zealand in 1977 the local girls were crying again , out of boredom rather than rudeness . That was the tour when the infamous \" Wanda from Wanganui \" told the press that she had slept with four of the tourists and found them to be \" lousy lovers , boring , self - centred , ruthless , always on the make and anything but exciting bedmates . Give me the down to earth Kiwi male any day \" . The squad were called a \" pack of animals \" on that trip , which was the tour which featured the Irish pair of Moss Keane , nicknamed \" rent -a-storm \" , and Willie Duggan , perhaps the last of the real hell - raisers . Duggan had what he called \" a pathological dislike of training \" , his one concession to fitness being a breakfast of half a dozen raw eggs on the morning of the match . Ollie Campbell remembers how he used to be able to tell which dressing room toilet Duggan was in before a match by the clouds of smoke billowing over the cubicle door . \" I always had the philosophy , \" Duggan said , \" that if you took 30 players out for a night and made sure they were well pissed before they went to bed at 3 am , then got them up at 8 am , trained the bejaysus out of them , then you would know who was up to lasting 80 minutes in an international . \" Duggan 's great mate Keane would have passed easily enough . Keane cultivated a fear of flying just so , his team - mates reckoned , it was taken for granted that he had to have five or six pints before he got on a plane or he would n't be able to travel . In 1977 he was in such a state when he got a last - minute call - up that he had a crash on the way to the airport , then left a message for his mother saying \" the car is at the airport , it 's written off , see you in four months \" . The king of them all , though , was Blair \" Paddy \" Mayne , a man who has every claim to being the hardest-drinking , free-est-swinging firebrand in the long history of the Lions . Mayne was an Irish lock , and one- time university heavyweight boxing champion . He toured in 1938 , when his great running gag , the centre Harry McKibbin said , was to burst into his team - mates ' rooms in the middle of the night , knocking the doors off the hinges , and then systematically smash up all furniture , Keith Moon-style . \" Until , \" McKibbin said , \" all the chairs and tables and things were just so much bits of kindling around us in the room while we were still in bed . \" The management despaired of Mayne , who used to run around with the Welsh hooker ( what is it about Welsh hookers ? ) Bunner Travers . The two of them dressed up as sailors and snuck off to the Durban docks just so they could pick fights with the local longshoremen . When they got to Ellis Park , they found that the stands were being erected by a team of convicts from the local prison who were sleeping in a compound underneath the scaffolding . Blair and Bunner befriended one of them , and asked him what he had done to merit a prison sentence . \" Stealing chickens , \" he said . \" And I 've been given a seven - year stretch . \" Full of sympathy for their new companion , who they nicknamed \" Rooster \" , Blair and Bunner returned that night with a pair of bolt cutters and some spare clothes . They sprung Rooster , and set him free . When he was caught the next day , it turned out the jacket he was wearing still had Mayne 's name stitched inside the collar . In desperation , the management decided to make Mayne share a room with the fly-half George Cromey , who also happened to be a Presbyterian minister . Even Cromey could n't stop Mayne sneaking off from an official dinner to go on a late - night hunting trip with a group of men he 'd met who were carrying rifles and lamplights . Cromey waited up for his room - mate till 3 am , and then , just as he was nodding off , Mayne broke down the door and announced \" I 've just shot a springbok \" . Cromey said his blood ran cold . And then he turned on the light , and saw Mayne , still wearing his cummerbund , with a dead antelope draped over his shoulders . \" Jimmy Unwin has been complaining that the meat here is n't as fresh as it is back home , \" Mayne announced . So he took himself off to his team - mate Unwin 's room , broke down that door too , and tossed the beast into his bed . The trouble was that , in all the confusion , Unwin cut his leg on the antelope 's horn . That would n't do . So Mayne decided to deposit it outside the room of the South Africa manager , with a note saying : \" A gift of fresh meat from the British Isles touring team . \" Well , that did it . Even though the captain , Sammy Walker , was a great friend of his , Mayne knew that the management were going to tan his hide for that . So he scarpered . The team did n't see him for three days , till he turned up , still in his suit , to meet them on board the ship they were sailing home on . And if those stories sound a little far-fetched , as though , like all the best tales , they have gained a little in the telling , well , they 've nothing on what he did next . Mayne became one of the founding members of the SAS in the second world war . He was recruited out of a prison cell , where he had been sent after striking a senior officer \" because he bored me \" . His bravery won him the Distinguished Service Order with three bars , the L\u00e9gion d'honneur , and the Croix de Guerre . Rugby has gained a lot from professionalism but it has a lost a little something too . On the pitch the 2013 Lions may play better rugby than most of their predecessors managed \u2013 harder , faster , and tougher , but off it , they 're not a patch on the ones who came before them .","annotations":[{"text":"Blair \" Paddy \" Mayne","span":[8632,8652],"token_span":[1804,1808],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent is the individual who ends the confinement or captivity of the Theme."},{"text":"Bunner Travers","span":[9389,9402],"token_span":[1956,1957],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent is the individual who ends the confinement or captivity of the Theme."},{"text":"Ellis Park","span":[9556,9565],"token_span":[1989,1990],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location where the Theme ceases to be confined."},{"text":"in a compound underneath the scaffolding","span":[9677,9716],"token_span":[2012,2017],"role":"Location_of_confinement","label":"Location_of_confinement","role_definition":"The location to which the Theme's motion was formerly inhibited."},{"text":"Rooster","span":[9970,9976],"token_span":[2073,2073],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The Theme is the person or object in motion released by the Agent."},{"text":"that night","span":[10008,10017],"token_span":[2080,2081],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time identifies when the Agent release the Theme ."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Agent brings about the end of a Theme's captivity at a Location_of_confinement in contravention of the plans or desires of a captor.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-2726-43-frame-Building","frame":"Building","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"The disaster was memorialized in songs such as \" Mississippi Fire Blues \" and \" Natchez Mississippi Blues \" , by the Lewis Bronzeville Five ; \" The Natchez Fire \" , by Gene Gilmore ; \" The Death of Walter Barnes \" , by Leonard Caston ; \" The Natchez Burnin \" , by Howlin ' Wolf ; and \" Natchez Fire \" , by John Lee Hooker .

Alderman James \u201c Ricky \u201d Gray brought up the issue at last week 's Natchez Board of Aldermen meeting . Gray said the memorial to the 1940 tragedy that killed 209 people should be moved to the club 's original site on St. Catherine Street . The Natchez Civic and Social Club of Chicago privately funded the memorial , which has sat between the gazebo and Silver Street on the bluff since 1940 , said Darrell White , director of the Natchez cultural heritage tourism and the Natchez Association for the Preservation of Afro-American Museum . Major Jake Middleton said at Tuesday 's meeting that he has met with Monroe Sago , the owner of the recently erected Rhythm Night Club Museum about the memorial 's location . Middleton said Sago asked if it was possible to move the marker to the original site , where the museum sits . Sago told the mayor the Mississippi Department of Historic Archives and History indicated the city had jurisdiction over deciding if the monument could be moved , Middleton said . The Natchez Monument Company assessed the monument at the mayor 's request and determined the 70- year - old structure could probably not sustain a move , Middleton said . Middleton said Monday that the issue has become a moot point as far as relocating the monument , but that it 's possible the city could consider placing some other placard with the victims ' names or a smaller monument at the original site . Natchez National Historical Park Superintendent Kathleen Jenkins said the group in Chicago likely had relatives or knew some of the victims in the fire . She said the great migration , which ended a decade before the fire , likely brought many black Natchezians to the cities in the Midwest , such as Chicago and Detroit . \u201c We need to respect the intent of the original donors , \u201d Jenkins said . Jenkins said it is natural that the donors chose the bluff as the location for the monument because it would get more exposure than the original site . White said Monday the bluff area can serve as an introduction into the city for tourists , which makes the location of the original marker appropriate . White said the bluff area contains a historical significance for African American , as well . White said black males used to congregate on the bluff in the early years of the depression to look for work . \u201c They used to assemble in that area hoping to get a job for that day , \u201d White said . White said the bluff was also the location of the Freedman 's Picnic after the end of the Civil War . The picnic was a parade of freed slaves that started at the bluff in 1867 and paraded to the grounds of Longwood , which was the largest assembly of people in Natchez until 2005 when the Red Cross handed out money to Katrina victims , White said . White said former slaves who had fled Natchez came back for the picnic . Jenkins said moving the monument would also present potential public relations and logistic issues because the original site is private property . \u201c By sitting in the city park on the bluff , the monument anchors the tragedy as a very important component in the span of Natchez history that affected hundreds of families throughout the entire community , \u201d Jenkins said .","annotations":[{"text":"the Rhythm Night Club memorial","span":[106,135],"token_span":[19,23],"role":"Created_entity","label":"Created_entity","role_definition":"Created_entity identifies the entity that is created in the act of building."},{"text":"The Natchez Civic and Social Club of Chicago","span":[478,521],"token_span":[89,96],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent builds a Created_entity."},{"text":"between the gazebo and Silver Street on the bluff","span":[569,617],"token_span":[105,113],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the building occurs."},{"text":"1940","span":[625,628],"token_span":[115,115],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time when the building occurs."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"This frame describes assembly or construction actions, where an Agent joins Components together to form a Created_entity, which is profiled, and hence the object of the verb.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_create","Creating","Transitive_action","Objective_influence","Event","Intentionally_act"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-1317-792-frame-Burying","frame":"Burying","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"On the other side , IGN rated the game with 7.4/10 ( Decent ) , calling it a \" pretty entertaining game and some great ( but strange ) concepts buried within this very unconventional WiiWare offering . \"","annotations":[{"text":"some great ( but strange ) concepts","span":[108,142],"token_span":[23,29],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The Theme is the object that is buried."},{"text":"within this very unconventional WiiWare offering","span":[151,198],"token_span":[31,36],"role":"Goal","label":"Goal","role_definition":"The role Goal is the location where the Theme ends up."}],"trigger":{"text":"buried","start_char":144,"end_char":149,"start_token":30,"end_token":30,"frame":"Burying"}},"source":{"text":"|Blogs||Boards ||Guide||FAQs||Cheats ||Reviews || Previews ||News || Features | December 19 , 2008 - Usually you can look at a screenshot for a puzzle game , or just hear the name alone even , and know exactly what you should expect . This is n't really the case with Plattchen : Twist 'n ' Paint . True , the game lives up to its sub-title , as you will be twisting with the Wii-mote or nunchuk , and you do inevitably \" paint \" in a sense , but the game is far from regular in about every single way . Everything from it 's insane ( and yes , at times very unintuitive ) interface , its story \u2013 focused around Earth , seven billion years from now , when life has evolved into gears \u2026 yeah , like car gears \u2013 and lack of any real direction or helpful tutorial is simply odd . Chisel away at its rougher , stranger aspects though , and you 'll find a pretty entertaining , brain - bending puzzler for WiiWare . It 's not the best on the download service by any means , but if you 're looking to take a chance on a game you simply wo n't find on any other platform , Plattchen is an interesting 1,000 point investment . For starters though , I need to make mention of the interface . Laid out in a grid system ( much like a chess board , really ) , all of the modes and options are placed as colored tiles with no real explanation as to what you 're selecting , or why . After a few point- and - clicks through the confusing setup though , you 'll find that there 's a grid based on what mode , skill level , and unlocked level you 're selecting , with other random modes and options across the bottom to fill in the gaps . All screen-to - screen movement is done with clicking initially , but scrolling through pages ( such as a tutorial , or high score boards ) is done by moving the cursor off-screen in that direction . If you want to arrow right , for example , you wo n't click on the on-screen arrow ; you 'll actually drag your cursor and exit the screen off to the right . It 's odd , and that 's just one of dozens of strange choices made by the team , and some of them , such as the cursor dragging , actually feel kind of rewarding after a few repetitions . Everything from cursor avatars ( little space men or butterflies that act as save files , and also follow your cursor around the screen as you play ) to the random modes and control styles make Plattchen a curious little package . At times it can be fun , at others you wonder what the hell the team was smoking when they came up with the design . Closing Comments Plattchen is an odd game , pure and simple . The core mechanic is essentially a mash - up of gravity - based puzzle games , Bejeweled or Othello , IR pointer control , and rotation - based color selection , but with so many strange rules , modes , and options the game is both amazingly robust and also completely random at the same time . Some modes require players to saw back and forth with the Wii-mote to flip tiles \u2013 it does n't feel very good \u2013 the main twist - based mechanic is a great concept , but some gamers will be instantly turned off at how odd and somewhat uncomfortable hand positions need to be to play it right . Random aspects like shooter elements and a very unique , but also challenging , scoring system make this one a game that only adventurous players will drop 1,000 points for and try to get into , but like me , you may find yourself finding a pretty entertaining game and some great ( but strange ) concepts buried within this very unconventional WiiWare offering . Download at your own risk , but if you 're looking for something truly original , and do n't mind taking a gamble , Plattchen is certainly a one - of - a- kind offering . | Rating ||Description | | out of 10 | | click here for ratings guide | | 6.5 | | Presentation | A total grab - bad of poor font , interesting style , thrown in lighting effects and a bizarre overall design .

Abramovich is also present at the training ground that day and , while the manager subsequently admits some of his squad are not buying into his ideas , he reiterates that he enjoys the owner 's support . 21 February 2012 \u2013 Napoli 3 - 1 Chelsea Chelsea are undone at the Stadio San Paolo despite taking a first - half lead , with the decision to leave Lampard , Michael Essien and Cole on the bench at the start , prompting the technical director , Michael Emenalo , to seek an explanation of the team selection on behalf of the owner . \" [ Abramovich ] just wanted to know the thought process , \" explains Villas - Boas . At the time , the bold selection has the feel of a suicide note . 27 February 2012 \u2013 Interview with Portuguese radio A lengthy interview , conducted the previous Thursday , is broadcast on the Portuguese radio station TSF in which Villas - Boas admits for the first time that he fears he may suffer the same fate as Luiz Felipe Scolari and Carlo Ancelotti . There is an unhelpful comparison of Fernando Torres 's impact with that of Mateja Kezman and Andriy Shevchenko , with the comments unappreciated by the club 's hierarchy . 2 March 2012 \u2013 Brutally honest press conference Again , Villas - Boas is a victim of his own honesty . A public admission that Chelsea 's squad bears no comparison with that of Manchester City , despite Abramovich 's \u00a3 1 bn investment in the club , is politically perilous and hardly a fillip for the players he is preparing to send out against West Bromwich Albion .

Now while for certain practical purposes we are accustomed to distinguish these forms of media of exchange from money proper as being mere substitutes for money , it is clear that , other things equal , any increase or decrease of these money substitutes will have exactly the same effects as an increase or decrease of the quantity of money proper , and should therefore , for the purposes of theoretical analysis , be counted as money . In particular , it is necessary to take account of certain forms of credit not connected with banks which help , as is commonly said , to economize money , or to do the work for which , if they did not exist , money in the narrower sense of the word would be required . The criterion by which we may distinguish these circulating credits from other forms of credit which do not act as substitutes for money is that they give to somebody the means of purchasing goods without at the same time diminishing the money-spending power of somebody else . This is most obviously the case when the creditor receives a bill of exchange which he may pass on in payment for other goods . It applies also to a number of other forms of commercial credit , as , for example , when book credit is simultaneously introduced in a number of successive stages of production in the place of cash payments , and so on . The characteristic peculiarity of these forms of credit is that they spring up without being subject to any central control , but once they have come into existence their convertibility into other forms of money must be possible if a collapse of credit is to be avoided . \" Great 500 + page read for a Sunday afternoon . As for some more generic , brief ( and modern ) thoughts , I provide a few personal observations . First , a run through the orthodox framework . A basic account of money supply starts with the monetary aggregates that matter most for CPI inflation : in the case of the US this includes cash balances in aggregates such as the M2 ( total deposits ) or MZM ( zero maturity money / cash plus bank claims and money market funds ) . The traditional recent definition of \" available stock \" of money consists of the cash notional of money printed by the central bank ( outside money ) and how much the banking system has created by making loans ( inside money ) . Of course , due to the deposit multiplier effect , the inside money is much bigger than outside money . For the purposes of this narrative , the impact of securitization and derivatives ( tier 3 and 4 ) will not be discussed currently as the complexity involved would take a big turn for the uglier . It will , however , be a topic pursued in the future . The chart below shows the relative composition of inside money ( mostly deposits ) was almost ten times the outside money ( monetary base ) prior to the recent crisis . Furthermore , as the historical chart demonstrates below , while rare , it has occurred , most notably during the Great Depression , that the broader money stock and monetary base moved in opposite directions . A looking at the other side of the equation : demand , is the desired cash balances held by the public . Money demand rises via transactions demand with a growing economy , and falls when interest rates rise as zero-yielding cash becomes less attractive . Some math : money demand is the inverse of the velocity of money . If MV=PY ( where M is money stock , V is velocity and PY is nominal GDP ) , then ( 1/V ) = ( M/ PY ) , which is the level of money stock relative to nominal GDP . For households , 1/ V can be represented as the desired money holdings as a share of nominal income . If a household decided to increase their money holding to 9 months of income from 6 months ( a process occuring pervasively in the current environmen tof job and otherwise insecurity and lack of trust ) , V would fall to 1.33 from 2x . This is , in simple terms , the standard approach . As the bolded section of Hayek 's quote demonstrates , however , it does not go far enough . What he is trying to convey , is that the economy , like any other constantly shifting \" ecosystem \" can create its own media of exchange in order to \" economize \" on the use of inside and outside money for use in the purchasing of assets . Once assets themselves can serve as collateral , allowing for leverage purchases , they also take on money-like properties . And , herein lies the rub , when financial assets serve as collateral for borrowing to purchase yet more assets ( margin purchasing ) , this kind of shadow money becomes especially potent in driving asset price overshoots and bubbles . The chart below demonstrates the various parts of the credit cycle from the perspective of shadow money . A good form summary of a credit bubble is presented below , compliments of Credit Suisse : It starts with some genuine investment opportunity almost always related to a real improvement in technology or fundamentals . As strong price performance turns into a boom , optimistic investors desire to buy more on margin . They leverage up , usually using the buoyant asset itself as collateral . Lenders are all too willing to benefit by funding these purchases \u2013 after all , in the worst case , they will be holding valuable collateral . Borrowing terms such as haircuts , loan - to - value ratios , or margin requirements get easier . New money flows in , and associated financial assets begin to take on money -like attributes . As buying on leverage accelerates , prices and credit conditions blow past what is warranted by fundamentals . There is a monetary expansion in the broad sense of shadow money , but when the bust comes this is quickly reversed . Lending conditions tighten , collateral prices plummet , and highly leveraged optimists are wiped out . Now cash is king ; investors do not want houses , stocks , tulips or asset-backed commercial paper . To accommodate this demand for cash the government / central bank must quickly and forcefully expand the monetary base or else the increase in money demand can lead to a painful general deflation . Meanwhile , the sudden disappearance of good collateral in the financial system has created a dangerous de-leveraging that could feed on itself . The government may respond by increasing its own debt , since public collateral in the forms of treasury bills and such do still have funding liquidity , and by flooding the market with government paper the leverage collapse can be better managed . In this example effective money ( meaning shadow money plus the conventional money stock ) falls sharply , but it would have fallen much more without aggressive policy actions . As shadow money is a pro-cyclical , boom - time phenomenon , serving as a medium of exchange to finance a bubble , it affects asset prices directly , but only indirectly affects goods and services prices . An approach to estimate shadow money is calculating the immediate cash embodied in various debt securities : this can be done using asset haircuts in repo markets as well as current market values at FMVs in four points in time : early ' 07 , 2008 Pre Lehman , 2008 Post Lehman , and currently . If the market had outstanding securities worth $ 100 billion and repo haircuts of 5 % , then effective money would be $ 95 billion . If prices fell 50 % and repo haircuts rose to 20 % , effective money would be ( $ 100 * 0.5 ) * ( 1 - 20 % ) = $ 40 billion . Some asset haircuts are presented below in the attempt to determine effective money . The exhibit below estimates the size of effective US money stock as a sum of inside and outside money as well as shadow money , broken by private and public . A simplified breakdown of public and private effective money stock is presented on the next chart . Lastly , in order to demonstrate the dramatic outflow in private shadow money in the immediately pre / post Lehman economy , and just how effectively subdued the public shadow money response has been in dealing with the pull back of the private sector . Credit Suisse estimates that since 2007 the shadow money in private debt securities ( IG , HY bonds , non- agency RMBS , CMBS and ABS ) has fallen by 38 % or $ 3.6 trillion to $ 5.9 trillion , mostly due to a drop in market values , a scarcity of new issuance and , most importantly , a huge increase in repo haircuts . To compensate for this , public shadow money represented by treasuries , agency bonds and agency RMBS , has risen by $ 2.8 trillion , driven by an unprecedented ramp up in treasury and MBS issuance , and an increase in relevant asset prices . It is immediately obvious that the expansion of public shadow money is no match for the massive contraction seen in the private side . In this light , the question of the efficacy of the QE rollout and other public shadow money expansion has a tinge of futility to it , and not just in terms of money supply inflection points . The continued risk aversion by banks means inside money contraction , and not outside money expansion , is the threat . Not just the wilful allowance of rising inflation by policy makers , but , much more relevantly , a recovery in loan creation is needed . As Keynes noted , in assessing money demand , in addition to interest rates and growth , the subject of \" liquidity preference \" is critical - the desire by the public to hold ( often abnormally large ) cash balances as buffers in times when bad economic outcomes are feared , such as currently . As liquidity preference is a mass psychology phenomenon , it is impossible to quantify and predict . A huge increase in cash demand at a time of weak growth is a rare , dangerous and deflationary occurrence , and tends to occur exactly at financial crises such as this one . The administration 's , and the media 's , massaging of mass psychology through the constant and repeated message that all is well , in order to rekindle the liquidity preference by the general public , makes all the sense in the world , as absent its intangible \" benefit \" the road to recovery is doomed from the onset . But is even this propaganda machine doomed , in a more subversive way ? As households whose HELOCs have been cut or whose home equity has diminished , firms whose commercial property has collapsed in value , and banks whole ability to borrow in collateral markets to raise cash has fallen , all face the same problem : as the ability to raise cash has fallen , actual cash holdings must rise . And , unfortunately for the Obama administration , this is not a temporary hoarding , this is a permanent rebalancing in the trillions of dollars order of magnitude . As money demand skyrockets , the velocity of money plummets . In the pro-cyclical boom of 2002 - 2007 many components of everyday lives became a derivative of the shadow money system : repo lending became critical to credit creation ; home equity extraction became a key means to smooth consumer spending during period of low or no income ; off - balance sheet funding of various assets became a major earnings generator for commercial banks . Yet the process appears not to have affected money demand and supply : regular bank loan growth was limited , keeping money stock from soaring , and money demand was held back by beliefs in easy availability of borrowing against collateral . Most dangerously , economic policy , first through Greenspan then Bernanke , was complicit in allowing the boom by emphasizing price level inflation and not effective money . With regular M2 and MZM money supply and demand effected only indirectly by the credit boom and a massive output gap following the 2001 recession , it was never an issue that inflation would soar . A similar credit boom occurred with no inflation in the 1920s also , another period where a major collateralized credit pyramid was built virtually on top of a reasonably stable money stock . The reason , then , as now , key decision - makers did not notice a massive credit pyramid was being built , is because traditional money indicators , which this post argues are essentially useless in the context of today 's much more sophisticated from a money and liquidity perspective economy , were fairly stable . If there is one \" crime \" for which the most two recent chairmen of the Fed should be held in ridicule in hsitory books , it is precisely this . And yet while Greenspan may be somewhat forgiven due to his less academic nature , Bernanke , who was a depression \" specialist \" , should have seen our current predicament coming from miles . That he failed to do so is why future historians and market pundits will not spare him the criticism of being among the primary culprits for the current , multi-generational crisis . In the meantime , the propaganda issuing from every media source is to be expected ( and in some ways welcomed ) - it merely demonstrates that the administration finally grasps the severity of the problem , and the need for confidence to rematerialize , even if it is through the current meme of Green Shoots ( whose very existence is flawed flawed upon more than a cursory examination , whether it is due to seasonal factors , subsequent economic data adjustments , or outright misrepresentations ) . Yet now that any hope of a preventative approach has failed and we are stuck with the consequnces , what happens ? In order for there to even be hope of recovery , money stock has to rebound . Not only Bernanke , or Geithner , but Obama himself has now demontrated that he is on the same page with regard to explanding the shadow money stock ( while presumably providing better oversight and supervision ) . For now , the immediate focus should be on whether confidence can return : in collateral , in lending , in risk taking , in entrepreneurship . In the meantime , any talk of inflation is premature . The deflationary shock has to wear off first , and in many asset classes it has not even accelerated yet . It is ironic that shadow money and credit are not just the dynamo that drives the free market , but also its Achilles heel . While most of the time they serve a useful purpose , currently their purpose is a destructive one as long as they continue to trendline away from recent asymptotes . If history is any indication , the overshoot to the downside will likely be just as severe as the upside overshoot was protracted . In that case , nothing the Fed does can accelerate inflation . Also , while possible that Bernanke has something up his sleeve , it is improbable . Thus while the market continues trading on a sepculative basis and conjecture rooted in the casino psychology that has gripped equity markets ( and recently credit markets as well ) , the long term picture is much less sanguine as the excesses of the credit cycle from the past 60 years wear off and not only asset prices but also repo haircuts find a new equilibrium . What is certain is that the near- term economy will be driven in spurts and starts as mass psychology shifts from one extreme to another . The next catalyst in my view will be the interplay of the impact of stimulus spending coupled with the failure of the green shoots materializing into anything worthwhile . And while this will make the life of daytraders interesting , the traditional buy and hold approach to asset accumulation must be delayed indefinitely , until the critical equilibrium discussed above is achieved . Until that happens , anyone who claims the economy is headed in the right direction ( either much higher or much lower ) , is merely spreading their own agenda or has an opinion that is fundamentally not rooted in actual facts .

Maintenance treatment may include chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , or targeted therapy . Maintenance therapy is used for the following reasons : To prevent or delay the cancer 's return if the cancer is in complete remission after the initial treatment . \u201c Complete remission \u201d means that the doctors cannot find cancer and you have no symptoms . To slow the growth of advanced cancer after the initial treatment . This can help shrink the cancer , which is called a partial remission . In this situation , maintenance therapy is not used to cure the cancer , but it can lengthen a person 's life . You can have maintenance therapy for a long time in either of these situations . Is maintenance therapy new ? No , but doctors use it more today than in the past . Maintenance therapy is more common now for many types of cancer because : The number of effective drugs for most types of cancer has increased . Some of these drugs are not used for initial treatment , but they are effective as a part of maintenance therapy . New cancer drugs often have fewer side effects than older ones . This means that people may be able to take them longer . Maintenance therapy can help lengthen the lives of people with certain types of cancer . But some studies have shown that maintenance therapy does not work for all types of cancer . Some drugs are also more effective than others . Maintenance therapy often uses traditional chemotherapy drugs . However , it typically involves a single drug rather than a combination , so there are usually fewer side effects . But doctors give lower doses than when you first have treatment . You might also get targeted therapy , hormonal therapy , or other drugs . For example , doctors give hormones as maintenance therapy for some types of breast cancer . Maintenance therapy may include a drug from the first treatment plan . Or it may include another drug or drug combination . During cancer remission Maintenance therapy may be used to lower the chance of the cancer coming back . For example , it may be considered after treatment for some types of leukemia and lymphoma . Talk with your doctor about if or how maintenance therapy is used for the type of cancer you have . For advanced cancer Maintenance therapy may help control advanced cancer that has improved but is not gone after initial treatments . In these situations , it can help people live longer . Maintenance therapy is now commonly used after initial treatment for several cancers , such as advanced lung cancer , colorectal cancer , and some types of lymphoma . How long does maintenance therapy last ? It may last weeks , months , or years , depending on : The type of cancer The drugs used How well it works How long you can tolerate any side effects Benefits and drawbacks Maintenance therapy may keep cancer from coming back or slow down its growth . But it can also come with disadvantages , including : More side effects Higher treatment cost More doctor visits If maintenance therapy is an option for you , talk with your doctor about benefits and drawbacks . Maintenance therapy as a cancer survivor Some people feel safer taking maintenance therapy . But others feel they are not a cancer survivor if they are still getting treatment . Either way , maintenance therapy is an important part of many people 's treatment and recovery plans . Learn more about survivorship . Questions to ask your health care team Consider asking the following questions : Is maintenance therapy an option for me ? What type of maintenance therapy do you recommend ? What are the potential benefits and risks of this treatment ? How often would I get it ? For how long ? Will my insurance pay for it ? When is watchful waiting a better option ? ( Doctors call watchful waiting \u201c active surveillance . \u201d It means watching for signs that cancer is coming back .

Except that the recently returned Lindsey ( Christian Kane ) and Eve ( Sarah Thompson ) , who is the liaison to Wolfram and Hart 's senior partners - - will be a big part of it . \" But what side Lindsey ultimately comes down on is never clear , \" Whedon said . \" That 's kind of what makes Lindsey interesting . \" And we will start to get more specific about why it is ( Angel and Co. are at Wolfram and Hart ) and the inevitable effect that the big , evil corporation will have on them , which is to start getting between them and getting inside them . . . .

So why does Philip Ridley regard himself as a Young British Artist ? There are many Philip Ridleys . There is the children 's author , winner of a Smarties Book Prize and creator of well - loved characters such as Poppy Picklesticks . There is the playwright of the apocalypse , feted and reviled in equal measure , who so terrified the bourgeoisie with Mercury Fur ( 2005 ) that Faber and Faber refused to publish it and theatre - goers walked out nightly . There is the film - maker : author of the screenplay of The Krays , the mesmerising 1990 biopic starring the brothers Kemp , and director / writer of the cult classic The Reflecting Skin , with Viggo Mortensen in the lead . Then there is the St Martins - trained performance artist , photographer and painter . Philip Ridley is akin to a hologram : different every way you look at him . And the first thing this intimidating polymath says , when I meet him in his rehearsal space at the Pineapple Dance Studios ? \" Hello . I 'm Phil . Does n't it smell like the school gym in here ? Terrifying . \" We toddle off to a nearby caf\u00e9 . He is instantly likeable , warm yet vulnerable , with a big baseball cap rammed on as if for protection . He is \" thrilled \" about the project in hand : a revival of his 2000 play , Vincent River , at Trafalgar Studios , starring Lynda Bellingham and Mark Field . It 's a timely revival , he says , because , as a play that centres around a homophobic murder , it is more relevant now than when it first opened . \" You walk around the East End now and you see homophobic graffiti . You see some extremely enlightened graffiti , but you also see swastikas . Lots of them . There 's anti-gay fundamentalism coming from both Islam and the Catholic right . You hear rap lyrics openly calling for ' death to batty boys ' . Then you go along to the National Theatre to see Chatroom / Citizenship , a double bill for young people , and when two men kiss one another on stage , there 's a chorus of disgust from the audience . The teenagers make retching sounds . Honestly . It 's scary stuff . \" So is Vincent River a play about gay issues ? \" No more than Suddenly Last Summer is about gay issues . \" The first time it was performed , theatre critic Benedict Nightingale called it Ridley 's \" best play to date \" , but its social realism was largely written off . \" People were quick to say , ' This kind of homophobia does n't exist any more , we 're all liberals now . ' Well , that 's not my experience . Since the play premiered we 've had a killing on Clapham Common , we 've had a nail - bomb in Soho . We 've seen photographs of beautiful young men being hanged from a crane in Iran , surrounded by cheering crowds . What was their crime ? They were having a relationship . We 're beginning to realise that liberal culture is a thin veneer . \" Ah yes . Civilisation , to Ridley , is paper-thin . His canon of plays , from The Pitchfork Disney ( which opened starring Rupert Graves in 1992 ) to Leaves of Glass ( Ben Whishaw and Maxine Peake took the leads at the Soho Theatre in 2006 ) , are all set in a distinctive half - world where society is deteriorating and apocalypse is just around the corner . Before meeting Ridley , I had always thought they were composites of the barbaric past and a dystopian future . Now I see that , to him , they are set in the present . \" My plays are about now . Or tomorrow morning . Artists I really admire , such as JG Ballard and David Cronenberg , their take on society is always a beat ahead of where it 's going . Not that I would compare myself with them , of course \" ( one of Ridley 's vices is modesty ) \" but my plays to a certain extent have that . \" The Fastest Clock in the Universe , his 1992 surreal study of male vanity and homoeroticism , was originally derided as fantasy , but directly after , along came Marky Mark Wahlberg in his pants , the cult of Calvin Klein , and the rise of the metrosexual . It is to be hoped that the nightmare vision of Mercury Fur is not equally prophetic . This seems unlikely \u2013 its premise being a uniquely and precisely horrifying combination of elements including torture tourism , a boy wearing a golden suit , and \u2013 the scariest word in the English language \u2013 meathooks . But Ridley is quick to point out that a parallel scenario occurred soon after in Iraq . \" It was Mercury Fur re-enacted . All - American farm boys from Idaho , going to church on Sundays and eating apple pie , and all it took was 10 weeks without moral responsibility for them to be raping small girls and filming it on their mobiles , by all accounts . \" If there is a whiff of defensiveness about his retort , it is because he is still scarred from the furore surrounding its first showing . Mercury Fur was Ridley 's fifth play for adults , commissioned by Paines Plough and performed at the Menier Chocolate Factory in 2005 . A now-legendary production , it was directed by John Tiffany and starred Whishaw , both of whom have since gone on to greatness . The play is gut -wrenching yet never graphic : as in a Greek tragedy , its violence is largely reported . Its characters grapple with questions of love and decency . It has a moral core ; a sense of redemption , even . Yet the outraged response to the play overlooked all this . It was as if Ridley was being arraigned for his own vivid gift . \" People said , ' It 's sick \u2013 you see a child being tortured on stage . ' You did n't , but people seemed to think you did . \" Most punishingly , drama critic Charles Spencer said Ridley was \" turned on by his own sick fantasies \" . \" That personal attack just floored me , \" says Ridley . \" It 's horrible when all you 're trying to do is work , and you hope you have something to say about the world and the times in which we live , and then people just call you ' sick ' and ' pervert ' . As if we 're living in some Utopia and I 'm trying to spoil it for everyone . What I did in Mercury Fur , I did for a reason . I like putting people on a ghost train , but I guide them safely through the other end ; I do n't want to keep them there , I want to take them on a ritual of exorcism . \" ' Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30 - day free trial Sign up Did the public censure make him feel he had gone too far ? \" In the act of writing it never occurs to me that anything is shocking or not shocking . It would have been moral cowardice not to take it to the conclusion that the play was setting up . \" Worst of all , Ridley 's publisher , Faber and Faber , refused the play . \" I could n't believe I 'd been caught up in that controversy in this day and age . The first comment that the editor at Faber said to me was , \" I 've got to tell you that several people here are seriously offended by this . \" I have a thing about dialogue , so I remember . Those were her words . It was as if they 'd all suddenly turned into a bunch of Cardinal Wolseys , deciding what was right and wrong . It 's not their job to be moral arbiters ; it 's their job to publish . I think Faber realised they could n't say this , so after a few weeks they decided to rephrase it as , ' It 's a piece of writing that I do not admire . ' \" Ridley moved to Methuen , taking his back - catalogue with him . Mercury Fur has since been in constant demand , with productions both amateur and professional taking place across the world . It is now touring Australia . A gift for savage prophecy is often unwelcome in society , and Ridley has it in abundance . It seems to bubble up out of him . \" I constantly think a lot of my DNA is alien . I look at people and I hear them talking and I think , ' I do n't get what you 're saying , I do n't see the world like you see it . ' And then I come out with one word and they look at me as though I 've just said the most shocking disgraceful thing . But I 've grown up with that . My nickname at school was ' alien ' . \" Sitting there in the cosy caf\u00e9 in Covent Garden , Ridley launches into a speech that brings a real chill , casting runes for the future of East London . \" I firmly believe that we will see something terrible happen , \" he says . \" Fundamentalism is on the rise , whether it 's from Islam or the Catholic right . It 's ' We are right , you are wrong . ' It 's ' Women should not show their faces . ' It 's ' Men should not go out with men . ' It 's a pressure cooker and the lid is screwed on so tight that anger will just erupt in a terrible way . I firmly believe that there will be killings on our streets . \" Ridley is something of a recluse . He has lived in the same Bethnal Green tower block since he was born , and his flat is \" minuscule \" , a Peabody dwelling crammed with paperbacks , model dinosaurs , skulls and skins . \" You have to take this Bond -esque route to get past the door \u2013 there 's literally no room to move . I constantly moan to my mates about my lack of space . About three times a year I have these ' avalanches ' where about 20 shelves will fall down . \" To him , it is heaven to close the door and unplug the phone . \" You could lock me in there forever with pens and paper and I 'd be happy . As a child I remember watching films where people got life sentences in solitary confinement and I 'd think , ' How lovely . ' \" His mother worked on a supermarket checkout ; his father was a lorry driver . \" My world was between five streets . You could n't make a bowl of gravy without someone reaching out to dip a bit of bread in it . \" It would all come in useful , starting with his screenplay for The Krays . As a child , he was very sick with asthma . \" I did n't talk much , so I grew up listening a lot while at home off school . I was in an oxygen tent for a lot of the time and people tended to think it was soundproofed and talked very openly in front of me . \" He used to hide a tape recorder under his parents ' sofa in the living - room , tape them all night , then write up transcripts . Now he eavesdrops professionally , recording conversations on the bus in Bethnal Green ( he mimes holding a Dictaphone surreptitiously over his shoulder ) . He is a real poet of place ; all his plays are set in the East End . \" A dilapidated room above an abandoned factory in the East End of London \" is the set direction for The Fastest Clock in the Universe ; Vincent River is full of references to \" Vicky Park \" and Mare Street . Ridley transcribes local graffiti and photographs passers - by . \" Some of the biggest influences on Mercury Fur were the snaps I 'd taken of people out and about in fur coats looking very bling , and suddenly this gang started to form in my mind . \" Everything feeds into his work . \" I never know where the life stops and the work starts or vice versa . \" When mates come round and we have a cup of tea , I 'm always asking them to read little bits of speeches or taking photographs \u2013 my ' studio ' is literally four squares of black paper pinned on the wall next to the fridge \u2013 or asking them to try on outfits . Most of my mates are actors . \" Might these actors include Mortensen or Whishaw ? Or Jude Law , who starred in The Fastest Clock in the Universe ? \" I have n't seen Jude for a bit \" he laughs . \" But the other two are both mates . How blessed am I ? They 'll be round here and it 's on with the sunglasses or the silly hat . We might take 1,000 digital photos in an afternoon , and one of them will just have something special that I can use in a play . \" The visual and verbal clearly synthesise in Ridley 's head ; as an art-school contemporary of Damien Hirst and the Chapman brothers , he sees himself as a Sensation artist , working in a linguistic medium . It 's only because theatre critics ca n't think outside the amphitheatre that they have n't noticed . \" It 's the most obvious thing to me . \" And indeed , the insects that recur through his work , variously tortured and vomited up by his characters , the butterfly motif , the shock and scandal : the parallels are all there . \" A lot of the stuff they are dealing with I am dealing with . Birds , insects , crocodiles , dinosaurs , dolphins \u2013 there 's a menagerie that keeps coming back in my work . I do n't plan it that way . Work is a lot like dreaming ; it 's whatever the unconscious throws up . I love it when you write furiously at night and then the next morning you go back and read it and it 's like , ' Oh my God , that 's bloody good , I did n't realise I 'd done that . ' \" Ridley 's existence is geared towards work . \" I've never earned much ; I do n't have a mortgage and I do n't want one . Everything is set up so I can do the work I want to do , and I do n't have to write six episodes of EastEnders to pay the bills . \" He writes , he says , to understand the world . \" My work is not cerebral at all . Telling stories and making images is how I make sense of the world , which is a very confusing place for me . Relationships are very confusing , sex is incredibly confusing . Perhaps I 'm not meeting the right people . I open the window and demons fly in . I think what I do in my work is try to make the demons feel welcome . \" I 'm at my happiest when I 'm alone at the desk in my back room , where I 've stuck black paper up at all the windows and I write by one lamp at this desk . I 'm at my least lonely when I 'm in that cocoon of writing . \" And there we shall leave Philip Ridley , to conjure his dark and comforting visions . * ' Vincent River ' : Trafalgar Studios , London SW1 ( 0870 060 6632 , www.theambassadors. com ) , from Tues to 17 November .

Christy Quail , 33 , of Enfield , was in Superior Court in Enfield on Tuesday , accused of buying stolen beer from Thornton . As she left her court appearance on Tuesday , her husband , Sean Quail , 33 , sprayed the journalists with a can of some chemical , police said . CT Now reports that reporter George Colli and photographer Alan Chaniewski were sprayed with a chemical , possibly bug spray . The can appears to be Spectracide wasp and hornet spray . The warning in the material safety data sheet states that you should avoid breathing vapors of the product and avoid contact with the liquid . A photographer for NBC Connecticut was also outside court but was not sprayed . After spraying the journalists , Christy Quail , Sean Quail and another woman got into a car and left . Chaniewski was taken to a nearby firehouse for first aid . Police took Sean Quail into custody at his home . Christy Quail was arrested three days after Thornton went on a mass shooting spree at the Manchester beer distributor facility and killed eight coworkers before turning the gun on himself . She was charged with receiving stolen property from Thornton . According to the affadavit , Thornton made two deliveries to her . On July 16 , he gave her two beer barrels valued at $ 300 . Hartford Distributors officials told police they appeared to be empty because of the way Thornton was carrying them . On July 23 , Thornton gave her a 30 - pack case of Bud Light and four cases of Budweiser , court records state . They were valued at $ 112 . Christy Quail 's case was continued to Sept. 13 . Her husband , Sean Quail , 33 , was arrested on Monday afternoon , also accused of accepted stolen beer . When he was arrested on Tuesday , he was charged with three counts of first-degree reckless endangerment , three counts of third - degree assault , carrying a dangerous instrument and breach of peace . An affidavit , first obtained by The Journal Inquirer , said Quail is the wife of a former employee at Hartford Distributors who knew Thornton . According to an affadavit , Sean Quail was a friend of Thornton and used to work at Hartford Distributors .

The fax cover sheet has a brief note , \" Dan , a generic description of the process . \" The name of the sender , based at the CIA , has been obliterated . You can view the document here . The document provides a step-by-step manual for extraordinary renditions . The process starts with \" capture shock . \" The detainee is subject to a medical examination prior to his flight . During the flight , the detainee is securely shackled , and is deprived of sight and sound through the use of blindfolds , earmuffs and hoods . The detainee is \" in the complete control of Americans . \" The detainee is stripped naked and shaved . A \" series of photographs are taken of the HVD while nude . \" A medical officer and a psychologist play key roles in the process ( though their professional ethics rules would prohibit such conduct . ) All of these practices are carefully engineered to facilitate the interrogation process . Nudity , sleep deprivation and dietary manipulation are used as standard preparatory steps . It then details the standard \" corrective techniques : \" these are a series of physical assaults labeled with innocuous titles like insult slap , abdominal slap , facial hold and attention grasp . \" Coercive techniques \" used include : walling ( slamming a prisoner 's head against the wall , with some protective measures to avoid severe injuries ) , water dousing , the use of the stress position ( known to the inquisition as the strapado , to the Germans in World War II as Pfahlbinden ) , wall standing ( referred to by the NKVD and KGB as stoika ) and cramped confinement . Because of substantial redactions , it seems unlikely that this list is complete . None of this information is surprising . In fact it all tallies perfectly with the description of the renditions program that can be derived from the report prepared by the International Committee of the Red Cross , which used the appropriate legal designation for these techniques : \" torture . \" But this is an historical document , right ? President Barack Obama shut down the black sites and the extraordinary renditions program immediately after taking office , right ? Well , not entirely . Consider the recent rendition of a Lebanese businessman accused of petty contract fraud , Raymond Azar . The first stage of these guidelines was followed with precision . He was seized in Afghanistan by U.S. Justice Department operatives . They claim they had the approval of the Afghan government . The Afghan government disagrees , saying it has no record of ever having permitted the \" snatch \" of Azar . According to papers filed by his lawyers , Azar was presented with \" capture shock , \" stripped naked , subjected to a body cavity search for \" health reasons , \" was shackled , subjected to hypothermia and sleep deprivation , and then was transported in a Gulfstream with the requisite hood , blindfold and earmuffs . When pressed on this in court , the Justice Department claimed it was only following \" standard procedures . \" The CIA memo shows that this claim is accurate : it was following standard procedures for extraordinary renditions , which were approved in a series of now-rescinded memoranda prepared by the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel . The Justice Department also claimed , in papers filed with the court , that the extraordinary measures were taken out of concern for the safety and security of the prisoners and the government agents involved . But on this point , the Justice Department is now revealed as being guilty of what at a minimum would be called a \" failure of the duty of candor \" to the court . The 2004 CIA memo delivered to the Justice Department explaining these procedures makes very explicit that the techniques employed have little if anything to do with the safety and security of the personnel involved . They explain the real function these techniques : \" To persuade High - Value Detainees ( HVDs ) to provide threat information and terrorist intelligence in a timely manner , to allow the US Government to identify and disrupt terrorist plots . \" The preparatory measures , such as capture shock , nudity , body cavity search , sleep deprivation and manipulation of nutrition are designed to put the prisoner in a position in which he can be effectively interrogated . They are geared to breaking down psychological resistance and making the prisoner pliable . Not every technique designed to wear down resistance and make a prisoner more willing to talk is , of course , \" torture . \" But in fact these techniques are highly coercive and have been held to be torture . Moreover , in the Azar case , the Justice Department agents used these techniques in precisely this fashion , moving to aggressive interrogation immediately after applying the preparatory measures . Azar even claims that one agent brandished a photo of his family taken from his wallet and threatened that he would never see them again -- something Azar interpreted as a threat against the safety of his family . The credibility of this account is boosted by the release this week of a 2004 CIA inspector general 's report , which documented numerous cases in which similar threats were made . After Azar 's allegations of torture became public , Justice Department prosecutors rushed to snatch a plea bargain deal with Azar , clearly motivated by a desire to put an end to that issue . But whatever deal was struck with Azar should not let the government avoid the question of accountability for what was done in this case . That should start with an examination of the Justice Department 's failure to candidly disclose to the court that the rendition techniques they applied to Azar were part of an effort to coerce a confession were explicitly engineered for that purpose . In sentencing Azar , the court will have to start with the recognition that the Justice Department began , overstepping the lawful constraints on its authority , to mete out punishment to him from the moment they seized him in Kabul . But the broader question is for the new panel that the Obama White House has set up to oversee renditions and interrogations policy : Why are procedures designed to secure intelligence from violent terrorists being used on businessmen involved in petty contract fraud cases ?

With the score level at 1 - 1 entering extra time , the teams scored four minutes apart . Kei Kamara leapt to head home in the 98th minute , but Shalrie Joseph popped up to head home a free kick in the 102nd . Then in the fifth round of penalty kicks , Khano Smith stepped up with a chance to give the Revolution the crown . But Pat Onstad saved the effort . The next six shooters all converted until Ashe fired off the bar . Nate Jaqua opened the scoring after 18 minutes after Amaechi Igwe turned the ball over inside his own box . Steve Ralston tied the score four minutes before halftime with a volley from a Mauricio Castro cross . Eddie Robinson ( hamstring ) and Richard Mulrooney ( knee ) did not travel for the Dynamo . Geoff Cameron continued at center back beside Bobby Boswell in Robinson 's absence . Nate Jaqua and Brian Ching partnered up top once again after Jaqua set up Ching for a goal in Saturday 's 2 - 0 win against Columbus . Selection problems also hampered the home team , with Jay Heaps suspended and Michael Parkhurst away on Olympic duty . Amaechi Igwe partnered Jeff Larentowicz in the center of defense . Rookie Chris Tierney started at left back . The match started at breakneck pace with both teams seeking to attack the perceived weaknesses on defense . The Dynamo 's Wade Barrett had to come back quickly to hook a ball over his own end line from a cross through the box . Dwayne De Rosario hit the post after just four minutes after jinking through the Revolution defense and hooking his effort towards the near post . Joseph nearly responded on both ends . Joseph 's long - distance drive kept rising just over the bar , before he almost knocked the ball over the bar with his thigh . The cadence for a goal kept building as Mauricio Castro 's free kick just missed the upper left corner with Onstad stranded . But when the goal came , it came from the oddest of circumstances . Cameron lumped a free kick down the center of the field . No Dynamo player challenged and Reis looked likely to come out and collect it . Igwe decided to clear it with his back to the ball and shanked it right to Jaqua . The burly striker made no mistake to give the Dynamo the lead . It should have been two just a minute later from another Igwe giveaway let Jaqua slide a ball to Ching with space inside the area . Ching did n't make good contact with his strike , but managed to knock it off before the ball trickled away from danger . Steve Ralston tested Onstad at his near post with a free kick , but the Canadian international reacted smartly to push it around the post for a corner kick . Sainey Nyassi should have tested Onstad minutes latter after a quick buildup from left wing to right wing gave him space at the far post , but Nyassi managed to drive his effort off the side netting . The Revs were growing in confidence and generated a penalty shout in the 33rd minute . Nyassi jumped to meet a corner kick at the far post only to see Craig Waibel barge him in the back . Referee Howard Webb was n't impressed , much to the chagrin of the Revolution players . Houston responded quickly through De Rosario . A thumping shot forced Reis into an acrobatic save at the near post after the Revs could n't hack it clear . De Rosario then got in behind the defense moments later with another route one service . After rounding Reis , De Rosario slid a ball towards goal before Larentowicz recovered and cleared the goal - bound effort . Tierney 's turn to clear off the line came quickly afterwards after Reis came for a corner kick and could n't collect . Jaqua shot towards goal , but Tierney managed to keep it out and get it clear . Just when Houston looked to score the killer second , New England conjured up the equalizer . Castro 's right - footed cross found Ralston at the far post and the Revs captain smashed home his volley to equalize . Another defensive giveaway nearly put the Revs in front three minutes before the break . Bobby Boswell coughed it up on the edge of his penalty area . Kheli Dube surged into the penalty area and whacked his effort towards goal . Onstad charged out of his goal and diverted the ball out of harm 's way . The early stages of the second half did n't produce nearly the amount of chances as in the first half . The frantic pace settled down to merely a frenetic pace , one where both teams still tried to surge forward but did n't connect nearly as well . Half - chances ruled as Jaqua shanked wide after Ching played him in and substitute Khano Smith cut inside and drove towards Onstad . Extra time loomed , and Igwe ensured it would arrive after tackling Davis as he shaped to shoot in second - half stoppage time . Kamara headed the Dynamo in front in the 98th minute . Ching drove a curling ball into the box . Reis looked like he should have punched away , but did n't get to the ball in time . Kamara nodded into the vacated net to restore the Dynamo 's lead . That lead lasted just four minutes . Ralston lofted a free kick up towards the far post . Joseph wrestled away from Bobby Boswell and directed his header into the far side netting . That would be enough to drive the match into penalties , and the crossbar emerged as New England 's hero after Ashe 's shot caromed away to give the Revs the SuperLiga crown .

In 1933 , the original movie was designed to beguile and distract a suffering US . President Roosevelt 's programmes for rebooting the economy had yet to take effect , and the movie 's audience was desperate for the temporary relief of big - budget effects , big - name stars and the 200 \u201c gorgeous girls \u201d that the trailer promised . 42nd Street proved more popular than the Warner Brothers studio bosses had dared imagine but credit was given less to director Lloyd Bacon than to Busby Berkeley , the actor and self -trained choreographer in charge of its musical numbers . Warner Brothers were taking something of a punt on Berkeley , who had no formal dance training and whose first experience of choreography had been organising marching drills during the first world war . But Berkeley had displayed some talent for working with chorus lines on Broadway , and spent two years with the Samuel Goldwyn studio , choreographing a number of low-budget musicals . During that period he 'd begun playing with new ways to put dance on screen . 42nd Street gave him the budget and freedom to let those ideas fly . When we look at a number such as Young and Healthy today , its structural devices may seem tame but at the time they embodied a bold new attempt to liberate dance from the physical conventions of the stage , and place it in a purely cinematic dimension . By constructing the choreography around a trio of hydraulically operated platforms , Berkeley transformed the spatial possibilities of his choreography . He could move his dancers between different levels , without the need for complex lifts or partnerwork ( 0.24 ) ; he could create effective shifts in pattern and speed with only minimal physical activity ( 0.40 ) . Even more radical were the visual possibilities created by his agile camera , which ranged from this tracking closeup of the dancers ' legs ( 1.23 ) , abstracting them to a V-shaped tunnel of stockinged flesh , to the dizzying overhead shots that turned the chorus line into a kaleidoscope of art deco patterns . Berkeley 's overhead shot became his signature device ( it was significant perhaps that he 'd been an aerial observer with the US air corps ) ; and he made even more dramatic use of it during the second half of the movie 's title number , which dramatised the \u201c naughty , gawdy , bawdy , sporty \u201d life of 42nd Street . Berkeley starts out by choreographing vivid vignettes of individual characters : a juggling street vendor , a fighting couple , a drunk , a barber , a cocktail waiter . But as these individuals are re-absorbed into the ensemble , and as the crowd then morphs into a street of dancing buildings , the camera soars higher and higher , until the scene is abstracted into a dreaming cityscape . The box-office success of 42nd Street propelled Berkeley to the top of his profession . He choreographed six more musicals during the next two years and his ideas grew exponentially \u2013 and expensively \u2013 more flamboyant . The By a Waterfall number in Footlight Parade ( 1933 ) featured giant water tanks in which its chorus could float though a riot of pin-wheeling , molecular patterns . In Gold Diggers of 1933 and Dames , Berkeley elaborated his dance numbers with an ever more inventive panoply of costumes , props and multi-level platforms . Berkeley helped make the 1930s a golden age for the Hollywood musical and the above compilation of clips illustrates just how brilliantly his imagination was suited to the silver screen . During that decade , Berkeley had a major rival in Fred Astaire , who was working for RKO , and even a basic comparison of the two men 's choreography reveals the limits of Berkeley 's style . Step for step , his vocabulary rarely deviates from a series of rudimentary leg kicks , shuffles and taps and a few simple , decorative movements of the arms . Lacking the musical phrasing , the grace notes , the full - bodied impetus of Astaire 's dancing , Berkeley 's choreography is memorable principally for the spectacle he was able to create out of large numbers of bodies moving in unison . Berkeley also became increasingly dependent on the interventions of the camera , for tracking closeups , witty angles and bird 's- eye views that added texture and substance to his choreography . Astaire once quipped of his own film performances , \u201c either the camera dances or I do \u201d , and while most of his own on - screen dancing could work just as well on the stage , Berkeley 's numbers would have palled rapidly without their cinematic box of tricks . If Astaire focused on the pure dancing body , and Berkeley on special effects , the other crucial difference between the two lay in their handling of sex . Back in 1930 , a strict code of censorship had been laid out for Hollywood and Astaire 's musicals , although swooningly glamorous , were chastely compliant . Berkeley 's early productions for Warner Bros , however , came with a strong subtext of erotic titillation . In 42nd Street 's Young and Healthy , the lingering pace of the camera as it travels between the women 's legs has the intensity of a voyeur 's gaze . More blatant still is the way the camera hovers over the dancers ' torsos in the By a Waterfall routine from Footlight Parade , revelling in the illusion of naked flesh created by the women 's clinging costumes . Berkeley offered his female actors and dancers up to the camera with a mathematical exactness that could border on ruthlessness . One of his signature tricks was to zoom , in rapid succession , over the faces of the chorus line , but far from individualising the women it simply confirmed their conformity to type ( usually blond and china - doll cute ) . As a device it was no more humanising than Berkeley 's favoured shots of disembodied legs , busts , feet or arms . Of course we look at old movies now with politically correct hindsight , but some among his original audience would have been made a little queasy by the sexual innuendo of Pettin ' in the Park , a choreographed guide book to the rules of seduction that featured in Gold Diggers of 1933 . Berkeley introduces a small boy ( Billy Barty ) into his cast \u2013 dressed up as a rollerskating baby and leading a chorus of policeman a frantic dance ; then chasing a football up the skirt of a beautiful woman , who lies on the grass with her stockings and suspenders in full view ; and finally leering suggestively to camera as he lifts up a window blind to reveal a chorus of women in visible states of undress . Berkeley always claimed there was nothing to read into his dances beyond his own ambition to make each better than the last . He resisted attempts to interpret his mass ensembles as an embodiment of Roosevelt 's New Deal collective spirit ; he shrugged off comparisons between his precision - tooled chorus lines and the monumental street parades beloved of Mussolini , Hitler and Stalin . However , one of the most powerful numbers he ever directed \u2013 Remember My Forgotten Man \u2013 was also the most political , as Berkeley drew on his wartime experiences to choreograph the heroism and suffering of his fellow veterans . In movement terms it could hardly have been more basic \u2013 little more than a marching column of men that Berkeley filmed against a succession of ironic backdrops ; a cheering , patriotic crowd , a rain - soaked battlefield , a postwar soup kitchen and a dole queue . But towards the end of the sequence ( around 5.40 ) he deployed all his cinematic knowhow to orchestrate an image that potently evoked the despair and the exaltation of the soldiers ' sacrifice : as lines of men tramp wearily across the screen they simultaneously look like victims of a military war machine and figures enshrined in a stained glass window . Berkeley 's brand of high - gloss musical gradually fell out of fashion and by the end of the 1930s he moved into straight directing . In the early 1970s , a revival of interest in the music , art and fashions of the 1930s restored movies such as 42nd Street to popularity . Berkeley 's influence is still felt in a whole range of choreographic creations . In Disney 's cartoon version of Beauty and the Beast , the Be Our Guest sequence pays a joyously overt homage , with its lines of dancing crockery and ditzy kaleidoscopic formations . The epic ensemble numbers in Riverdance are no less indebted to the choreographer in their machine - drilled , percussive unison . And the pure camp spectacle of synchronised swimming would surely have become a far lesser thing without the inspiration of Berkeley 's aquatically high - kicking chorus girls .","annotations":[{"text":"1933","span":[175,178],"token_span":[32,32],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the motion of the Theme occurs."},{"text":"Busby Berkeley","span":[654,667],"token_span":[119,120],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent is the one whose action causes the motion of a Theme.

The art of core making has its roots in circa 1300 BC , when sand casting was first developed in the form of clay molding . Since , then the crux of the process has remained the same , but the technical intricacies have evolved to match the requisites of the current era . But Core making was and still remains an integral part of the sand casting process . The process has evolved from crafting cores one at a time with skilled hands to production of thousands of cores with automated core shooters while moderating tolerances to as low as \u00b1 0.020 inches . In modern foundries , its amusing to even think of crafting cores with hand which will further be used for casting anything from centrifugal pump impellers to V8 engines . What are cores ? Cores are apparatus used to generate hollow cavities or internal features which cannot be formed using pattern alone in moulding , cores are majorly made using sand , but some processes also use permanent cores made of metal . In this article we will focus on sand core making process . The process of core making 1 . Selection of Core Sand Properties of core sand are highly crucial and are required to have characteristics like permeability , green strength , refractoriness , flowability , collapsibility , adhesiveness , cohesiveness , and fry strength . 2 . Mixing of sand with additives After an initial thorough mix of sand to ensure proper distribution of sand granules , binder is added to the silica sand with moisture content and other additives like coal dust , dextrin , or silica flour and together they create a mixture . This mixture should be uniform to create standardized sand cores with high production efficiency . 3 . Core Blowing or Shooting After the mixture is ready , next step includes blowing this flowable mixture into the core box , and depending on the type of process used , either the core box is heated , or the already heated sand mixture is blown into the core box and left to settle for a few seconds . This process is also referred to as core shooting process and modern foundries use dedicated core blowing / shooting machines for optimal production efficiency . 4 . Core Venting In the casting process , the core will be surrounded by molten metal which will stimulate gases inside the mold , and it is essential to provide a venting passage for these gases as if remain entrapped inside the mold , these gases can result in casting defects . Therefore , to obtain good permeability additional venting holes are made in the cores . 5 . Reinforcement of Cores Some cores , heavy & large cores in particular , might need additional reinforcement material like cast iron grids or low- carbon steel wires to maintain coherence . 6 . Baking of Cores Depending on the type of process used , baking of sand cores is done in convention oven with temperature between 200\u00b0 C to 250\u00b0 C ( 392\u00b0 F and 482\u00b0 F ) , the heat causes the binder to polymerize . 7 . Core Cleaning & Finishing After baking , cores are ready for cleaning & finishing . Following methods are used as per requirement : - Trimming of cores involve removing loose pieces and other unwanted projections - Brushing is used to remove loose sand off the core with fine wire brush - Coating is crucial step for finishing and involves coating of cores with refractory material to improve heat resistance . 8 . Core Inspection This step includes either manual or machine inspection of the cores for dimensional accuracy . 9 . Core assembling This includes assembling of multiple cores together with core glue in case of small and medium size cores and bolts in case of large cores . Feedback section 1 .

Some background on Maestre and her art : 1 . Jennifer Maestre has loved \" the way pencils smell and how the graphite gleams \" \u00c2 since she was a young girl . She never wanted to throw one away , sharpening them until they were just tiny nubs . To Maestre , pencils represent \" creativity , inspiration , striving , work potential , and fun , \" \u00c2 in addition to being \" cute . \" \u00c2 2 . To create her pencil sculptures , Maestre takes hundreds of pencils\u00e2which she buys by the gross\u00e2and cuts them into 1 - inch sections that she turns into beads by drilling holes through them . Then , she sharpens the pieces and sews them all together , usually using the peyote stitch , a sculptural beading technique . 3 . Sea urchins were the original inspiration for Maestre 's pencil sculptures . As she describes it , \" The spines of the urchin , so dangerous yet so beautiful , serve as an explicit warning against contact . The alluring texture of the spines draws the touch in spite of the possible consequences . \" \u00c2 She also draws inspiration from animals , plants , other art , Ernst Haeckel , Odilon Redon , and mythology . 4 . Maestre also creates jewelry from pencils by gluing together blocks of pencils , slicing them at varying angles , and then laminating the pieces . The resulting jewelry looks so unlike pencils that people often ca n't figure out what it 's made from . Maestre has said , \" Sometimes people ask me if I melt the pencils\u00e2which is a funny question , pencils are made of wood ! \" \u00c2 5 . Some of Maestre 's sculptures are comprised of 4,000 pencil stubs , sometimes even more . Though it 's hard for her to estimate just how many pencils she 's used in the 10 years or so she 's been creating pencil sculptures , Maestre guesses she 's used \" at least 5,000 pencils \" \u00c2\u00e2a number that includes only the pencils required for sculptures , and not for jewelry .

Today this essential grain can also be found in a variety of processed foods , some with histories centuries old . Rice 's role in Japanese cuisine is not limited to its appearance on the table , a steaming bowlful around which the meal is planned . It is also the main ingredient in a number of well - known foods , beverages and seasonings . The final product depends on how the rice is processed and on what type of rice is used , whether uruchimai , the ordinary rice that is served with meals , or mochigome , a glutinous rice , most often prepared for special occasions and used to make snacks and sweets . Sake , Mirin and Vinegar The most popular processed rice product is sake , a brewed , highly alcoholic beverage with a mild aroma and delicate blend of flavors . Fourth - century records reveal its essential role as a sacred offering to soothe the gods . Three ingredients go into sake brewing - rice , water and the fermenting agent koji ( steamed rice inoculated with the yeast Aspergillus oryzae ) . The fermented liquor is put into cloth sacks and pressed to separate the sake from the lees ( the remains of the rice and koji ) , then heated to kill bacteria - a technique invented in Japan some 450 years ago , long before the discovery of pasteurization . While wine fermented from grapes is regarded as an accompaniment to a meal - to accent or bring out the flavors of foods - in Japan , sake is accompanied by small portions of food , or sakana , to enhance the flavors of this celebrated beverage . In other words , it can be said that Japanese cuisine developed as an accompaniment to sake . Mirin is a sweet , alcoholic flavoring , also made of rice ; namely , distilled rice spirits mixed with steamed glutinous rice and koji , which is fermented . Originally drunk as a liqueur with a rather tart taste , mirin has been refined over the years , becoming one of the mainstays of Japanese cooking . Combined with soy sauce , for example , it forms the basis of teriyaki sauce , a popular basting sauce for grilled foods . Before sake is heated to kill bacteria , it quickly sours , because bacteria converts the alcohol to acetic acid when it comes in contact with air . The result is vinegar , another essential in the Japanese larder , which can also be made from sake lees . Miso , Pickles and Mochi Another important flavor in Japanese cooking is provided by miso , a fermented paste of beans , rice or barley . Rice miso , made only of rice and koji , comes in two types , salty and sweet . The rather sweet , white miso is characteristically used in Kyoto cuisine . Rice also plays a major role in pickling and sushi production , the origins of which can be found in the Nara period , when fish , wild boar or deer were salted and pressed , then placed between layers of cooked , salted rice and pressed under stones to ferment . The rice soured because of the bacteria that produces lactic acid during fermentation , increasing its capacity to preserve the layered foods . The type of sushi that developed from this process is called narezushi - the early incarnation of the more familiar nigirizushi , a strip of seafood atop a small fistful of vinegared rice . Pickles , or tsukemono , a traditional sidedish to a Japanese meal , are said to stimulate the appetite and enhance the flavor of cooked rice . One method of pickling utilizes sake lees , while yet another uses rice bran ( nuka ) , a by-product of the rice - polishing process . Nukazuke , or pickling in bran , has been around for about 800 years . One of the most versatile rice products , mochi , is made with glutinous rice , which is steamed rather than boiled , and placed in a large wooden mortar while still hot , then beaten with a large pestle . Flipped and sprinkled with water between plunges until it becomes a coherent mass with a smooth , elastic texture , the ball of rice is then flattened and cut into pieces or shaped into rounds . Kagamimochi , for example , is a traditional New Year 's decoration that serves both as the dwelling place of the god of the harvest and the offering to that god . Small mochi balls , endowed with similar significance , go into zoni , a soup made from the symbolic offerings of seafood , fowl and vegetables that decorate the kagamimochi . In the past , most families pounded mochi whenever there was a special event , but today it is available in supermarkets , prepackaged . Households who prefer to make their own often use automatic mochi-pounding machines instead of the traditional wooden mortar and pestle . Sweets , Snacks and Instant Foods Glutinous rice flour is used to make another kind of rice - ball confection with a mochi-like consistency : the sweets served in the tea ceremony , or wagashi . Stuffed with sweet bean paste , or anko , and shaped and colored to suggest seasonal flowers or fruits , these delicacies have become a minor art form . The felicitous combination of anko ( made from red beans boiled with sugar ) wrapped in mochi was discovered about 500 years ago . Mochi may be cut into small pieces of varying shapes and designs and dried , then grilled or deep - fried as snack foods , often with soy sauce as the basic flavoring . Today , the crispness of these mochi snacks make them increasingly more popular among young people than grilled senbei , or rice crackers . For travelers in the Nara and Heian periods ( 710 - 1185 ) , another glutinous rice product , hoshii , was a lifesaver . The rice was steamed and dried , rather than pounded into mochi . The resulting product kept well and served as trail food in an era without inns , much less drive - in restaurants . The traveler would simply add an equal amount of boiling water to the hoshii , wait ten minutes , and the rice was ready to eat - instant food from a millennium ago . From the classic bowl of gleaming white rice to ancient emergency rations , the Japanese have centuries of experience in making full use of their rice crop . Even the bran left when rice is polished is used down to the last husk - in pickling beds , for bleaching root vegetables and as a source of oil . In the wide range of foods based on rice , and in the sacred character of rice itself , this fundamental grain has become the cornerstone of the culinary culture of Japan .

Ferguson , Jr. To the University of Connecticut School of Business Graduate Learning Center and the SS&C Technologies Financial Accelerator , Hartford , Connecticut October 29 , 2004 Equilibrium Real Interest Rate : Theory and Application I want to thank the University of Connecticut for providing me this opportunity to comment on the important and challenging concept of the equilibrium real interest rate and its relevance to monetary policy . I will use this occasion to discuss the role that estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate can play in thinking about the desired degree of policy accommodation . Those views , I should add , are my own and are not necessarily shared by anyone else in the Federal Reserve System . I hope that at the end of this talk you will conclude , as I do , that while the concept of the equilibrium real rate is a useful aid in thinking about setting monetary policy , it is not measured and observed with such precision as to provide a practical guide to the appropriate stance of policy . Current Situation As the most recent statement of the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) made clear , the U.S. economy appears to have moved out of the soft patch that characterized the second quarter . Supported by ongoing advances in productivity and the attendant increases in real incomes , household spending has picked up . Businesses , for their part , seem to have shaken off at least some of their hesitancy to spend , although the subdued pace of hiring may signal that they still retain a wary attitude toward making important commitments . But the strengthened balance sheets of the business sector , along with buoyant cash flow , should provide firms with the wherewithal to fund a healthy expansion of the capital stock in coming quarters . No doubt the recent run - up in energy prices poses some challenges , but the evidence indicates that , without some further material shock , aggregate demand is on a track consistent with sustained economic growth . That should gradually return the economy to full utilization of its resources , while inflation remains subdued . The FOMC was confident enough about its assessment of the vigor of spending to indicate in its most recent statement that it continues to believe that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured . That begs the question , of course , of how the Committee can be sure that policy is currently accommodative . I find it instructive to first consider how not to measure policy accommodation . In particular , the fact that the nominal federal funds rate remains quite low does not , by itself and without context , signal that policy is loose . After all , spending decisions should depend on real , not nominal , determinants , including the real federal funds rate , which is the nominal federal funds rate less prevailing inflation expectations . Although backward - looking measures of inflation -- such as the four- quarter growth in core personal consumption expenditure ( PCE ) prices - - imply that the FOMC 's cumulative 75 basis points of tightening so far this year has moved the real federal funds rate into positive territory for the first time in almost three years , that observation is not sufficient to calibrate the stance of policy . For example , the U.S. economy expanded at about the same average pace from 1981 to 1990 and from 1991 to 2000 . In the earlier period , however , the real short - term rate averaged 4 - 3/4 percent whereas in the more recent one the real rate was 2 percentage points lower . Clearly , prevailing conditions matter in determining the degree of policy accommodation . It is only against a backdrop of an economy that seems poised to maintain sustained and solid economic growth , even as the funds rate rises , that the FOMC can determine that current policy is accommodative . The Equilibrium Rate in Theory What is needed is a benchmark summarizing the economic circumstances -- including , among other variables , the underlying strength of aggregate demand , the level of aggregate wealth , and economic developments in our trading partners -- combining to shape the expansion of activity and the extent of pressures on inflation . One way of providing that benchmark is to consider what level of the real federal funds rate , if allowed to prevail for several years , would place economic activity at its potential and keep inflation low and stable . If the actual real rate is below that benchmark level , policy can be viewed as accommodative , in that if that stance were maintained , ultimately pressures on resources would build . If the actual real rate is kept above that benchmark level , policy would seem to be contractionary . This definition makes clear that the most relevant aid in policymaking is an intermediate - run measure , in that there may be forces at work in the shorter run that push spending away from potential output even if the real rate were pegged at this benchmark rate . It also makes clear that the concept involves a good amount of judgment -- indeed , the same judgment that goes into making any economic forecast -- about the determinants of spending , the trend of productivity , and the forces affecting inflation in the intermediate term . Economists famously cannot agree on much . In this case , we cannot even agree on the name of the benchmark concept that I have just described . The real interest rate consistent with the eventual full utilization of resources has been called the equilibrium real federal funds rate , the natural rate of interest , and the neutral real rate . I prefer the first name , the equilibrium real federal funds rate , because , by using the word \" equilibrium , \" it reminds us that it is a concept related to the clearing of markets . Even if economists settled on a name , however , we are not likely to agree on a single model to describe a system as richly complicated as the U.S. economy . Thus , there are as many ways of estimating the equilibrium real federal funds rate as there are different economic models . There is , however , one way of estimating the equilibrium real rate that I do not find especially convincing . Some economists derive point estimates of the equilibrium real rate by taking averages of the actual real rate over long periods of time . True , over a long - enough sample period , resource slack probably averages near zero , which suggests that the sample average of the real interest equals the equilibrium real rate . But decisions about the sample period -- whether to include low-real - rate stretches , such as the 1950s , or high - rate periods , such as the early 1980s -- have material bearing on the estimate . This indicates to me that there can be significant and persistent deviations in the equilibrium real rate from the observed long - run average measured over decades . The average interest rate that seems to have brought aggregate demand and aggregate supply into rough balance in the past may not be the same rate required in every conjunctural setting . Our inability to equate the long - run average interest rate to the equilibrium real interest rate that is relevant for setting policy is not surprising given the manner in which economic behavior , technology , and government policy can change over time . Put another way , an estimate derived from long - run observations may not be relevant for policy for two reasons . First , economic conditions during the policy - relevant period might differ from the average conditions during the observation period . Second , the economy changes in ways that tend to limit the relevance of historical observations for policymaking . That said , policymakers do strive to understand what the equilibrium real interest rate will be over the long run , but that is a forward - looking notion that depends on our sense of how the forces of productivity and thrift will evolve over time as measured in decades . An understanding of a likely long - run level of the equilibrium real rate is useful , even though the level is not directly observable , because it provides a general sense of the level that would , over that longer period , allow aggregate supply and demand to move into balance , given the evaluation of secular forces such as productivity and population growth . Such an understanding of the longer - term prospects for the real interest rate aids in identifying variations in the concept over the intermediate run that is relevant for setting monetary policy --a period of several years , when cyclical forces dominate . Critically , such deviations in the intermediate run can be especially important for policy choice . For example , an unusual hesitancy on the part of businesses to hire and spend emerged in 2001 after the collapse of equity prices and was subsequently reinforced by corporate - governance concerns ; this hesitancy could be thought of as pulling the equilibrium real federal funds rate down temporarily below its longer-run value . In addition , other forces may also have weighed on growth , making it appropriate to move the real funds rate below the intermediate - run equilibrium for a time . From that perspective , the FOMC 's reduction in the actual nominal federal funds rate over this period from the level of 6 - 1/2 percent that prevailed at the beginning of 2001 to the forty - five - year low of 1 percent by mid-2003 had three components : ( 1 ) A reduction to match the decline in inflation expectations so as to prevent the real funds rate from rising inappropriately , ( 2 ) an effort to chase a downwardly moving equilibrium real rate given the pressures on aggregate demand , and ( 3 ) an effort to bring the actual real rate below its apparently lowered equilibrium to provide sufficient stimulus to cope with transitory adverse factors and to speed the recovery in production and employment . So while the real federal funds rate ultimately was pushed below zero , the extent of policy accommodation was less exceptional , in that many estimates of the equilibrium real rate had also fallen significantly . This is a tangible recent example of the need both to judge how the equilibrium real interest rate that is relevant for policy might have changed from a perceived long - run level and to set policy against the background of such an understanding . Indeed , in my judgment , the lingering hesitancy of businesses to make commitments , the restraint imposed on domestic consumers from an increase in the cost of energy , and the drag on domestic production from the excess of imports over exports all represent forces pulling the equilibrium real federal funds rate below its perceived longer-term level . And , in the context of well - contained inflation , the evidence of remaining underused resources gives us a good reason to hold the real rate below even the intermediate - run notion of its equilibrium to allow the economy to be firmly set on a path that will shrink the pool of these underused resources over a reasonable period . But as the expansion regains its footing and resource slack is worked down , we should expect both that the equilibrium real rate will move toward its longer- run level and that policymakers will no longer find it appropriate to keep the actual rate below its equilibrium . That is , the FOMC will likely be removing its policy accommodation over time . The Pace of Return to Equilibrium I have thus far argued that the equilibrium rate that is relevant for actual policy determination can only be judged in the context of forces influencing economic developments . Several aspects of the current outlook lead me to suspect that the return of the equilibrium real rate from its currently somewhat depressed level to its long - run value might plausibly be expected to be gradual and attenuated compared with historical experience . Let me highlight just three of these aspects . I have already mentioned the role of business hesitancy in determining the past trajectory of monetary policy . Clearly , if evidence of that hesitancy remains -- for example , if the labor market were to remain sluggish -- that might be one indication that the return of the equilibrium rate to its longer - run level is likely to be relatively gradual . Secondly , the household saving rate has fallen to less than 1 percent , quite low in its range of historical variation . If households , on net , take steps to return the saving rate closer to the middle of that range ( which , I might add , would provide welcome support to capital accumulation ) , then a sustained period in which consumption grows more slowly than income would result . Third , given government budgetary trends , some fiscal restraint is in order , and one might expect that those responsible for fiscal policy will move that policy to a more - balanced position ( another development I would welcome ) , thereby removing some fiscal impetus . I believe that the combined force of these three factors restraining aggregate demand , plus others that I have not mentioned , would require a lower real rate than otherwise to avoid economic slack . Let me add , however , that there is a powerful force tending to make the equilibrium real rate higher than it would otherwise be . The rapid expansion of labor productivity has raised the growth of economic potential , increased permanent income and wealth , and created an important inducement to add to the capital stock . All else equal , a higher growth rate of productivity will be associated with a more elevated equilibrium real rate . As long as productivity grows steadily at its recent pace , however , there is no reason to suspect that it will produce a change in the equilibrium real rate . In addition , the factors that I mentioned above might not unfold as hypothesized . Business hesitancy might lift abruptly and would be evidenced by large increases in business demand for capital and labor resources ; households might maintain a very low savings rate ; and government policy might not return quickly to a more-balanced posture . Any of these factors might imply that the equilibrium rate relevant for policy returns more quickly to , or even moves above , its long - run level as fewer forces weigh on aggregate demand . Recognizing the uncertainty regarding these various forces and the interplay among them , I believe it important that the FOMC calibrate the return of policy to the equilibrium real rate so that the process is neither hasty nor overly attenuated . Clearly , incoming data and the implications for the outlook should play a particularly important role in policy determination at this juncture . However , theory and practice both indicate that policy works with long and variable lags . Therefore , the actual stance of policy will have to approximate more closely the equilibrium real rate before the pool of underutilized resources is fully exhausted . Otherwise , we risk a buildup of inflationary pressures . Clearly the execution of policy will require careful evaluation as the FOMC attempts to judge both the equilibrium rate that is relevant and the pace of removal of accommodation that is appropriate . Estimating the Equilibrium Rate in Practice So much for the generality of theory . Economists have taken a variety of tacks to arrive at measures of the equilibrium real federal funds rate . I will touch on two techniques in particular . The first can be thought of as a mechanical attempt to implement my definition -- the level of the real federal funds rate that , if allowed to prevail for a couple of years , would place economic activity at its potential -- in models of the U.S. economy . For instance , we can use the many equations of a large - scale macroeconomic representation of the U.S. economy , such as the Federal Reserve Board 's staff model , FRB / US , to calculate at any point in time the level of the real rate that would eliminate economic slack in a reasonable period of time . Or we can rely on a reduced - form description of the economy that measures the output gap in terms of the actual real short rate . The value of the real rate that will move that gap to zero can be thought of as the equilibrium real rate . Besides the assumptions undergirding the construction of either model , such a calculation will require judgment in determining what is a \" reasonable \" period of time and how to cope with the run of prediction errors that are inevitable when trying to explain economic data . An attempt to employ a large model to calculate the equilibrium nominal federal funds rate can be found in an article by Antulio Bomfim . 1 Using the MPS model , the predecessor to the Board staff 's current model , Bomfim found that the equilibrium nominal funds rate varied in a range from 2 percent to 14 percent over the period from 1965 to 1994 , implying that his estimate of the equilibrium real rate turned negative at times . Laubach and Williams opted for the single - equation approach and estimated that the equilibrium real funds rate was around 3 percent in mid-2002 but that it varied from as low as 1 percent in the early 1990s to as high as 5 percent in the late 1960s . 2 In addition to exhibiting large swings , the Laubach - Williams point estimate of the equilibrium rate is a very uncertain statistic . The confidence interval around the estimate is such that there was a 70 percent probability that the actual value of the equilibrium real rate was between 0.5 percent and 5.5 percent . Clearly , this estimate is not measured sufficiently precisely to be a useful guide to policy . An alternative approach turns to financial markets to infer the market 's assessment of the longer - term prospects for real interest rates . Since 1997 , the U.S. Treasury has been issuing price- index - linked securities providing an assured real return . With about $ 250 billion of these inflation - protected securities now outstanding , we can get readings along the entire maturity structure of real interest rates . Currently , for instance , real short yields are close to zero , and longer - term rates are at about 1 - 5/8 percent . One could presume that the forward real rate of interest implied by yields on longer- term indexed debt -- or the real return provided , say , over the period five to ten years from now -- conveys a sense of market participants ' view of the long - run equilibrium real interest rate . 3 Unfortunately for such an inference , however , longer - term yields embody expectations of future interest rates , a term premium , and potentially a premium for the relative illiquidity of these instruments , so this technique will provide an overestimate of the equilibrium real rate . Conclusion This brief discussion highlights the uncertainties attending any attempt to measure the equilibrium real rate . I find these measures useful teaching tools to describe the complicated and iterative process of forecasting the path of the economy so as to arrive at the appropriate stance of policy . However , I believe it to be very important that the FOMC not go on a forced march to some point estimate of the equilibrium real federal funds rate . In my judgment , we should remove the current degree of accommodation at a pace that is importantly determined by incoming data and a changed outlook . Our knowledge of the workings of the economy is sufficiently imprecise that we could not attach much confidence to any single calculation that one might make of the equilibrium rate . Moreover , history provides a daunting record of challenges to economic forecasting associated with changes in economic behavior , the evolution of technology , and swings in governmental policy that would suggest that the equilibrium can vary over time . In such circumstances , the performance of the economy will provide feedback to assess the level of the equilibrium real federal funds rate over time . Footnotes 1 .

The new guidance permits meeting and business events to be held at an indoor capacity of 30 percent of the usable space or 200 guests , whichever is less ( excluding venue staff ) . Alcohol , receptions and networking events are still prohibited . \u201c We 're pleased to have the opportunity to welcome back small groups to the building in Phase 2 , \u201d said Jeff Blosser , Washington State Convention Center President & CEO . \u201c The convention center has bolstered its already stringent cleaning protocol to provide an even safer , but still comfortable , environment for event-goers . We look forward to collaborating with clients to mitigate known risk factors for in - person events so they and their attendees can focus on program content . \u201d In its effort to ensure the safety of event attendees and staff , WSCC anticipates deploying an extensive collection of protocols . Examples include : Personal Protective Equipment - Requiring all staff and event attendees to wear face coverings while in and around the facility . - Providing hand sanitizer stations throughout the building . Cleaning - Frequent cleaning and disinfection of high - touch surfaces using products that are EPA - approved for use against the virus that causes COVID - 19 . - Cleaning and disinfection of restrooms , meeting rooms and spaces between uses . - Utilizing electrostatic sprayers to aid in disinfection , and ATP meters to measure the success in cleaning and disinfecting surfaces . - Providing indication of when spaces have been disinfected and how effectively . Catering and Banquet Services - Offering a Safety First Menu with solutions to ensure the highest levels of food safety . - Modifying staffing , operations , and culinary practices , plus changes to the meal and food service . Examples include : the use of plexiglass shields at staffed food stations ; compostable single - use service ware , pre-packaged food options ; touchless hot urns and cold beverage containers ; and consideration given to physical distancing in all break and meal placements . Building Access - Monitoring and limiting access to registered event attendees only to allow contract tracing . Physical Distancing - Directional hallways and passageways have been established for foot traffic , and separate routes will be designated for entry and exit into the building , meeting rooms and other shared spaces where possible . - Room sets will be arranged to achieve recommended physical distance between attendees . Along with safety guidelines , the convention center has also developed a virtual event studio which will allow meeting planners to broadcast virtual or hybrid ( both in - person and virtual ) meetings to attendees . The studio , which features first - class projection , lighting and a pre-installed audio / video control system , is an essential addition for the interim reality of in - person meetings . On July 7 , WSCC announced its commitment to achieve the GBAC STAR \u2122 accreditation on outbreak prevention , response and recovery . WSCC also released a Safety First Overview , which outlines the guidelines , precautionary measures , and requirements to be followed by everyone who enters the building . The modification of restrictions was due to the advocacy of the Washington Meeting and Convention Coalition , a group of statewide partners assembled to advocate for group meeting and convention business in response to the impacts of COVID - 19 . \u201c I would like to thank Governor Inslee , his staff , the Washington State Department of Labor & Industries , and the Washington State Department of Health for their understanding of the value of meetings and conventions to our region , \u201d said Frank Finneran , WSCC Chairman of the Board of Directors . \u201c This is a reassuring step toward a new normal in our industry and helping to reopen important commerce in downtown Seattle . I really appreciate the coordination work by Becky Bogard , of Bogard & Johnson , and the collaboration of the members of the Coalition . All are committed to safely hosting small meetings now and look forward to the day when we can welcome larger groups . \u201d Questions about booking event space can be directed to the WSCC sales team through wscc.com or sales@wscc.com .

When Nike , Adidas , Puma and the rest grudgingly came round , it was hailed as a turning - point in the relationship of these companies to their sub-contractors in the developing world . Five years ago this newspaper spoke of \" the ethical revolution sweeping through the world 's sweatshops \" . It seems we spoke too soon : what was really under way was a revolution in these companies ' public relations departments . As our investigation published today reveals , conditions in hundreds of the factories in which the West 's favourite sportswear brands are manufactured remain highly unsatisfactory or appalling . None of the companies has committed to paying overseas workers a living wage , the paltry sum required for a worker to keep himself and his family in conditions of the most rudimentary decency . Many workers do not even make the derisory local minimum wage , which in China amounts to only two -thirds of a living wage . Some factories continue to use bonded , indentured , prison or child labour . Women working in others are subjected to compulsory pregnancy tests ; if they prove positive , they are summarily sacked . Supervisors terrorise workers into submission . These are the shocking facts revealed by a detailed examination of the reports submitted by the companies themselves \u2013 but as Puma breezily admits , the truth is certainly far worse than that , because some of the sub-contractors lie systematically about their employees ' conditions of labour , and in particular about the amount of overtime they work . Special software has been developed to falsify the records of working hours . The contrast these findings make with the codes of conduct the firms have embraced is startling . \" Our vision is for everyone in our supply chain to share a common set of values \" , declares Adidas . Nike 's code of conduct proposes that \" high ethics means success \" . It exhorts its workers \" to lead balanced personal and professional lives \" , and insists that \" Nike will strive to pay fair compensation \" . In the context of the gruesome shopfloor reality , these fine words are contemptible . Instead of trying to dazzle Western consumers with meaningless rhetoric , these firms must divert some of their vast financial muscle into bringing real improvements to the misery of the sweatshops . The industry 's pledge to reform remains dramatically unfulfilled .

They ransacked the main chamber of the Legislative Council - known in Hong Kong as LegCo - in what Chief Executive Carrie Lam called an \" extreme use of violence \" . The group were a small branch of a largely leaderless protest movement sparked by a controversial , now suspended , extradition bill . The protesters were evicted after a few hours , but the graffiti they left behind tells us a lot about the evolving nature of these protests . The defacing of the emblem Hong Kong is a semi-autonomous part of China , and LegCo is where its government sits and bills are debated and passed . Central on the main wall of the chamber is the territory 's emblem . In English , it says Hong Kong , but in Chinese it reads : \" The Regional Emblem of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People 's Republic of China \" . The protesters defaced a portion of the emblem bearing the word \" China \" , leaving the Hong Kong part of the emblem untouched . Under the Basic Law , in place since Hong Kong was handed back to China by the UK in 1997 , Hong Kong is guaranteed a level of autonomy and has freedoms not available in mainland China . It keeps its own judicial independence , its own legislature and economic system . But critics say this is under threat from an increasingly assertive China . The extradition bill , that would have enabled suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to China , was cited as proof of this , sparking massive protests . The bill has been suspended - and is unlikely ever to pass . But the defacing of the bill is indicative of the anger many in Hong Kong have towards China . The colonial flag The protesters also draped a colonial - era Hong Kong flag on the podium inside LegCo . It 's a sign of Hong Kong 's history as a British colony and is being seen as a message to the former colonisers , calling on the UK to hold China to account . One Hong Kong journalist said the flag was not a sign , as some have suggested , that the protesters want a return to British rule . \" Whatever the British Hong Kong flag means today , Beijing would n't be pleased to see it . And that might have been the point of putting it in front of the world 's cameras , \" said Inkstone editor Alan Wong on Twitter . Tyranny banner This black banner which was installed over the podium reads : \" There are no rioters , only a tyranny . \" The Hong Kong government described violent clashes on 12 June between protesters and police as a riot - something else that has angered the demonstrators . The term rioting is a serious one , it 's an offence punishable by up to 10 years in jail . Protesters want the government to drop this term . The sunflower movement The phrase \" Hong Kong 's sunflower \" can also be seen on the walls . It 's a reference to the Sunflower Movement protests that took place in Taiwan in 2014 when a controversial trade agreement led students and activists to occupy Taiwan 's parliament . They were protesting against what they said was a sign of Beijing 's growing influence over Taiwan - the same thing they say is happening in Hong Kong right now . ' Dog officers ' References to the police being \" dogs \" were sprayed repeatedly on these glass doors and elsewhere . Protesters have frequently described the city 's police force as \" lapdogs \" of the government , occasionally of Beijing too . It was 12 June that proved to be a turning point in the relationship between the police and the people . It first started out as another protest , but protesters and police officers soon clashed on the streets . Protesters were seen throwing items at police , who responded by spraying tear gas and firing rubber bullets . Footage has been circulating showing some officers dragging protesters and beating them with batons . Human Rights Watch called it a \" well - documented use of excessive force against peaceful protesters \" . Protesters have been demanding an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality . But there have also been large demonstrations in support of the Hong Kong police . The police commissioner has rejected allegations of excessive force , saying many police officers have been injured in the unrest . ' It was you who taught me ' A slogan sprayed on one of the columns in the Legislative Council reads : \" It was you who taught me peaceful marches did not work . \" It appears to be directed at Hong Kong 's leader Carrie Lam , who despite protests of up to a million people prior to 12 June , had remained adamant that the extradition bill would not be suspended . The government later backed down and suspended the bill , and Ms Lam indicated that it would likely not pass . However the bill has been perceived as being part of a wider agenda that aims to move Hong Kong further down a path of becoming a fully \" Chinese city \" , without its unique freedoms . ' Freedom ' The Chinese characters for \" freedom \" - sprayed on this screen in LegCo - sum up why people in Hong Kong say they are protesting . Under a deal struck with Britain that saw Hong Kong return to China in 1997 , the city was guaranteed to enjoy \" a high degree of autonomy , except in foreign and defence affairs \" for 50 years . The Basic Law ends in 2047 , and what happens to Hong Kong 's autonomy after that is unclear , which is fuelling the protesters ' sense of urgency .","annotations":[{"text":"On Monday night","span":[50,64],"token_span":[9,11],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the Agent breaks up the Whole_patient."},{"text":"protesters in Hong Kong","span":[68,90],"token_span":[13,16],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The conscious entity, generally a person, that performs the intentional action that results in the Whole_patient being broken into Pieces."},{"text":"the parliamentary building","span":[103,128],"token_span":[19,21],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the place where the Agent breaks the Whole_patient into pieces."},{"text":"metal shutters","span":[141,154],"token_span":[24,25],"role":"Whole_patient","label":"Whole_patient","role_definition":"The entity which is destroyed by the Agent and that ends up broken into Pieces."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Agent suddenly and often violently separates the Whole_patient into two or more smaller Pieces, resulting in the Whole_patient no longer existing as such.","frame_ancestors":["Transitive_action","Objective_influence","Event"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-0609-728-frame-Cause_to_make_noise","frame":"Cause_to_make_noise","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"He belonged to Mangrasi tribe , the Manganhars are believed to bring happiness and are welcomed by people on festive occasions for their gift of melody .

Born on 1932 Allan Fakir ( 1932\u20132000 ) , a Pakistani folk singer is a one of the foremost exponents of sufi music in Pakistan . He is particularly known for his ecstatic style of performance marked with extreme devotional rhetoric and sufi dance singing . His peculiarly funny body language and distinctively pleasing facial expressions marked with a broad smile , were always amusing for his audience at live performances . Allan Fakir was born in 1932 in the ancient village of Aamari in Jamshoro District , taluka Manjhand , Sindh . His mother died soon after his birth . He spent his childhood in Manjhand , a town between Sehwan and Hyderabad . He belongs to the Mangrasi tribe the Mangarhars are believed to bring happiness and welcomed on festive occasions for their gift of melody . According to the traditions of this caste , Allan Fakir 's father used to beat the drum and sing traditional songs at weddings and Faqir 's brothers still do the same job . Fakir is an Arabic word , and implies a Sufi or a mystic . Thus in the real sense of the word , a Fakir is a person , who leads an independent life marked by piety , abstinence from material needs , and contentment in the available resources . It must not be confused with the rather loose usage of the same word implying a begger , in the local languages Urdu , and Sindhi . When he was only a teenager , Allan Fakir developed a habit of singing melancholy songs which his father did not like . Deprived of a mother 's love , he went off in search of someone who could replace that love . He arrived at the tomb of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai in Bhit Shah and started living there . Faqir 's memory was sharp even though he could not read and write . Hearing the traditional Latifi Raag sung every night touched his heart . Encouraged by Faqir Zawar Qurban Ali Lanjwani and Moolchand Maharaj , he began singing Bhitai 's poetry at the shrine and ultimately spent twenty years there until meeting Mumtaz Mirza , who introduced him to Radio Pakistan and ptv in Hyderabad and helped him to learn the correct pronunciation of Bhitai 's poetry . Eventually , he became a performing legend . His songs , mostly in Sindhi language except a few in Urdu , usually revolve around sufism and the devotional philosophy . But the characteristic which distinguishes him from many other folk singers is the depth of his feelings , which is very expressive in all his songs . One of his famous songs is a duet with Muhammad Ali Shehki , \" Allah Allah kar bhaiya \" which was a big hit and increased his popularity tremendously . A patriotic song \" Itne bare jeewan saagar main \" also got very popular . In appreciation of his services to folk culture , he was given a job and a small house at the Institute of Sindhology . He was originally appointed as an officer to help promote Sindhi culture , but due to his illiteracy , he was eventually demoted to the post of peon . Allan Fakir received the President 's Pride of Performance award in 1980 , the Shahbaz Award in 1987 , the Shah Latif Award in 1992 and Kandhkot Award in 1993 .

He was educated in Kabul and in France . He was proclaimed king in 1933 , a few hours after his father had been assassinated . He had previously helped his father and brothers reassert government control during a period of lawlessness and had served as a Minister . The young king took the title , ' Confident in God , Follower of the Firm Religion of Islam ' . Afghanistan 's monarchy had been established in 1919 . During the early years of his reign , power was actually exercised by his uncles , who ruled the country through the powerful office of Prime Minister . Throughout the Second World War and afterwards , the king helped steer the country on a path of neutrality . In 1953 his cousin Mohamed Daud became premier but Zahir Shah forced his resignation in 1963 , after which he began to assert his own power to the full . In 1964 he promulgated reforms which provided for a parliament , elections and a free press . Members of the royal family were also banned from holding public office . Parties were not strictly legal but tolerated . Social reforms included attempts to improve the status of women . Foreign aid flowed from both east and west but , apart from roads and irrigation projects , this help made little impact outside the Kabul area . Throughout his reign many potential advances and reforms were stymied through factionalism and constant political infighting . Zahir Shah himself was frequently accused of indecisiveness . However , his reign did see a long period of peace to which many Afghans now look back with nostalgia . During the early 1970s , however , Afghanistan was beset by drought and famine and the demands of Pashtun tribes along the border with Pakistan for autonomy .

However , civil and criminal trials have since determined that Juventus and Moggi did not enjoy such an advantage and that the punishments handed out in 2006 were based on incomplete evidence , and Moggi 's prison sentence was also written off last week following his appeal at the Court of Cassation .

You may have followed all the rules : no caffeine before bed , an early bedtime , and all the rest . But your best efforts are oftentimes for naught , foiled by the mysterious ways of sleep cycles . There may be an answer : WakeMate , a Y Combinator - funded startup that 's launching today , is looking to help you catch that ever-elusive good night 's sleep ( and maybe even the perfect nap , too ) . Wake Mate is one of the few startups we 've see that actually involves its own physical product ( another that comes to mind is FitBit ) . To use the service , you first order the WakeMate wristband from the website , which costs $ 50 . Then , you download an application for your Bluetooth - enabled smartphone ( WakeMate is launching with support for i Phone , BlackBerry , Android , Windows Mobile , and a standard Java app for non-smart phones ; support for Palm 's WebOS is on the way ) . Once you 've installed the app and paired your wristband with your phone , you set your alarm ( more on that later ) and hit they hay . The wristband tracks the movement of your wrist through the night , which it can use to analyze your sleep patterns . If you 're raising your eyebrows you 're not alone \u2013 this sounded strange to me at first , but co-founder Greg Nemeth explains it 's a well established sleep-study technique called actigraphy . The WakeMate wristband collects data throughout the night and stores it on internal Flash storage . When it 's time to wake you up WakeMate does n't necessarily sound an alarm at exactly the time you set . Instead , it monitors your sleep patterns for the 20 minute window prior to that and sounds your alarm when you 're in the lightest sleep mode , which can help eliminate that groggy feeling you sometimes wake up with . The alarm does n't come from the wristband though \u2013 instead , the wristband uses Bluetooth to trigger your cell phone 's alarm . It then transmits your sleep data to your phone , which in turn uses its cellular data connection to upload it to the WakeMate servers . You can then browse through your sleep history from the WakeMate website . Wake Mate will be facing off with a number of other sleep devices , including the Zeo Personal Sleep Coach , which was released over the summer . The Zeo consists of a standalone alarm clock that pairs with a headband that measures your brainwaves as opposed to your wrist movements . It 's also quite a bit more expensive than WakeMate , running around $ 250 . Nemeth says he says the Zeo as a powerful tool for people who need to diagnose their sleep problems . But he says that WakeMate has a much broader appeal , in part because of its lower price , but also because it 's more portable . For example , WakeMate can be used to help you take the ideal nap , even when you 're on the go . The device has modes for both ' power naps ' ( which last around 30 minutes ) and ' full naps ' , which range from 60 - 90 minutes . Wake Mate shows promise , but I do n't love the fact that it requires a Bluetooth handset to trigger its alarm . It seems like it would be easier just to integrate an alarm directly into the wristband , along with a cheap LED display so you can set the time ( you could still use Bluetooth to transfer your sleep data via a handset ) . Co-founder Arun Gupta says they 've considered this , but that integrating an alarm would make it bulkier , less comfortable , and more expensive . He also points out that some people might sleep with their arm under their pillow , which could muffle the alarm ( perhaps they could include a ' vibrate ' mode ) . All of that said , the sleep industry has a broad appeal \u2013 who has n't wished they could kiss those groggy mornings goodbye ? And the $ 50 pricepoint is low enough to make the product attractive even for people who do n't have serious sleep issues . You 'll have to wait a while to try one though : the site is now accepting preorders ( you get $ 5 off ) but the wristbands wo n't start shipping until January .","annotations":[{"text":"you","span":[1508,1510],"token_span":[295,295],"role":"Sleeper","label":"Sleeper","role_definition":"The person or being that is sleeping."},{"text":"WakeMate","span":[1515,1522],"token_span":[297,297],"role":"Cause","label":"Cause","role_definition":"An animate or inanimate entity, a force, or event that produces an effect.

If Union sea power did not win the war , it enabled the war to be won . When hostilities opened , the U.S. Navy numbered 90 warships , of which only 42 were in commission , and many of these were on foreign station . Fortunately for the Federals , Lincoln had , in the person of Gideon Welles , a wise secretary of the navy who was one of his most competent cabinet members . Welles was ably seconded by his assistant , Gustavus Vasa Fox . By the time of Lee 's surrender , Lincoln 's navy numbered 626 warships , of which 65 were ironclads . From a tiny force of nearly 9,000 seamen in 1861 , the Union navy increased by war 's end to about 59,000 sailors , whereas naval appropriations per year leaped from approximately $ 12 million to perhaps $ 123 million . The blockade of about 3,500 miles ( 5,600 km ) of Confederate coastline was a factor of incalculable value in the final defeat of the Davis government , although the blockade did not become truly effective before the end of 1863 . The Confederates , on the other hand , had to start from almost nothing in building a navy . That they did so well was largely because of untiring efforts by the capable secretary of the navy , Stephen Mallory . He dispatched agents to Europe to purchase warships , sought to refurbish captured or scuttled Federal vessels , and made every effort to arm and employ Southern - owned ships then in Confederate ports . Mallory 's only major omission was his delay in seeing the advantage of Confederate government control of blockade runners bringing in strategic supplies ; not until later in the war did the government begin closer supervision of blockade - running vessels . Eventually , the government commandeered space on all privately owned blockade runners and even built and operated some of its own late in the war . The naval side of the Civil War was a revolutionary one . In addition to their increasing use of steam power , the screw propeller , shell guns , and rifled ordnance , both sides built and employed ironclad warships . The notable clash on March 9 , 1862 , between the North 's Monitor and the South 's Virginia ( formerly the Merrimack ) was the first battle ever waged between ironclads . Also , the first sinking of a warship by a submarine occurred on February 17 , 1864 , when the Confederate submersible Hunley sank the blockader USS Housatonic . Daring Confederate sea raiders preyed upon Union commerce . Especially successful were the Sumter , commanded by Raphael Semmes , which captured 18 Northern merchantmen early in the war ; the Florida , captained by John Maffit , which in 1863 seized 37 Federal prizes in the North and South Atlantic ; and the Shenandoah , with James Waddell as skipper , which took 38 Union merchant ships , mostly in the Pacific . But the most famous of all the Confederate cruisers was the Alabama , commanded by Semmes , which captured 69 Federal ships in two years ; not until June 19 , 1864 , was the Alabama intercepted and sunk off Cherbourg , France , by the Federal warship Kearsarge , captained by John Winslow . A great many other Federal ships were captured , and marine insurance rates were driven to a prohibitive high by these Southern depredations . This led to a serious deterioration of the American merchant marine , the effects of which lasted into the 20th century . Besides fighting efficaciously with ironclads on the inland rivers , Lincoln 's navy played an important role in a series of coastal and amphibious operations , some in conjunction with the Federal army . As early as November 7 , 1861 , a Federal flotilla under Samuel Francis du Pont seized Port Royal , South Carolina , and another squadron under Louis M. Goldsborough assisted Burnside 's army in capturing Roanoke Island and New Bern on the North Carolina littoral in February \u2013 March 1862 . One month later , Savannah , Georgia , was closed to Confederate blockade runners when the Federal navy reduced Fort Pulaski guarding the city ; and on April 25 David Farragut , running the forts near the mouth of the Mississippi , took New Orleans , which was subsequently occupied by Benjamin F. Butler 's army . But in April 1863 and again in July and August , Federal warships were repelled at Fort Sumter when they descended upon Charleston , and a Federal army under Quincy A. Gillmore fared little better when it tried to assist . Farragut had better luck , however , when he rendered Mobile , Alabama , useless by reducing Fort Morgan and destroying several defending Confederate ships on August 5 , 1864 , in the hardest - fought naval action of the war . The Confederacy 's last open Atlantic port , Wilmington , North Carolina , successfully withstood a Federal naval attack by Porter on defending Fort Fisher when Butler 's army failed to coordinate its attack properly in December 1864 , but it fell one month later to Porter and to an ably conducted army assault led by Alfred H. Terry . Only Galveston remained open to the Confederates in the last months of the war . In short , \u201c Uncle Sam 's web feet , \u201d as Lincoln termed the Union navy , played a decisive role in helping to defeat the Confederacy .","annotations":[{"text":"the U.S. Navy","span":[350,362],"token_span":[68,70],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent blocks access to the Useful_location."},{"text":"Confederate ports","span":[1642,1658],"token_span":[312,313],"role":"Useful_location","label":"Useful_location","role_definition":"The Useful_location is the place the Theme is headed towards and the Agent has changed the accessibility of."},{"text":"Confederate ports","span":[1642,1658],"token_span":[312,313],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The general Place where the blocking or allowing of access occurs."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Agent causes a Useful_location to become accessible (or non-accessible) to a Theme to a certain Degree.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-4431-884-frame-Change_event_duration","frame":"Change_event_duration","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"On 12 August 2010 , Rangers announced that McCulloch had signed a two - year contract extension , keeping him at the club until 2013 .","annotations":[{"text":"12 August 2010","span":[3,16],"token_span":[1,3],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the change in duration of the Event is caused."},{"text":"McCulloch","span":[43,51],"token_span":[8,8],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The sentient entity that changes the duration of the Event."},{"text":"contract","span":[77,84],"token_span":[15,15],"role":"Event","label":"Event","role_definition":"The Event's duration is changed."}],"trigger":{"text":"extension","start_char":86,"end_char":94,"start_token":16,"end_token":16,"frame":"Change_event_duration"}},"source":{"text":"McCulloch will be 35 by the time his Rangers contract expires Lee McCulloch has signed a two - year contract extension with Rangers and the Scottish champions say the midfielder was wanted by other clubs .

As early as 1756 provision had been made for four maternity beds in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh ( RIE ) , and in 1793 the General Lying - in Hospital had been opened at Park House . However it was not until 1879 that money collected to commemorate the contribution of Sir James Young Simpson to obstetrics , ended the numerous moves to makeshift hospitals which had been made over the preceeding forty years , and enabled the City to open a purpose - built maternity hospital where the poor could have their children under medical supervision . Initially the hospital consisted of two lying - in wards , a labour ward , dispensary , kitchens and administrative quarters , as well as quarters for the matron , two house surgeons and seven or eight nurses . In 1895 Lady Tweedale opened the Married Women 's Pavilion . This was the west wing originally proposed by the architects MacGibbon and Ross , but postponed in 1879 because of insufficient funds . Four visiting physicians with their assistants undertook in rotation a three month term of duty . Besides hospital deliveries , medical students or pupil midwives , supervised by hospital staff , attended home deliveries . These are recorded in the Out - Door case books . The 1886 Amendment to the Medical Act made midwifery a compulsory course in the medical curriculum , and in 1890 women students were admitted to the hospital for clinical instruction . The risk of infection was always present and in 1899 the hospital closed becuase of puerperal septicaemia . Later cases were transferred as quickly as possible to the City Hospital to prevent cross-infection , and in 1924 Dr Nasmyth donated a new labour ward allowing the separation of infected cases . By 1910 the hospital was dealing annually with 616 indoor and 1327 district cases , and the hospital authorities were faced increasingly with problems such as lack of operating facilities , unsatisfactory accomodation , inadequate sanitation and gross overcrowding . After World War I three main - door basement flats in Lauriston Park and two flats in Graham Street were acquired to try to meet the increasing demands on the hospital . Throughout the first quarter of the twentieth century advances were made in obstetrics , pathology and paediatrics . In 1901 a pre-maternity bed was instituted at the hospital . William Ballantyne took a particular interest in the physiology and pathology of pregnancy and James Haig Ferguson furthered the cause of preventative medicine by stressing the benefits of routine antenatal supervision . As a result of his efforts the first out - patient antenatal clinic in Britain was opened in 1915 and in 1926 a postnatal clinic was opened . The Central Midwives Board for England and Wales ( established in 1902 ) recognised the Simpson as a training centre for midwives wishing to practice north of the border . In 1915 the Central Midwives Board for Scotland was established and the following year the hospital was recognised by them . Two years after the Notification of Births ( Extension ) Act of 1915 , The Edinburgh Local Authority launched a maternity and child welfare scheme in conjunction with the hospital . Seven antenatal out - patient clinics were opened in Edinburgh with the main consultative centre at the Maternity Hospital , for which the Corporation paid the hospital \u00a3 200 . In 1919 the Local Authority , acting on the recommendation of a Royal Commission report of 1916 , arranged with the hospital the establishment of an antenatal out - patient and in - patient venereal diseases department . In 1925 the first assistant paediatrics physician was appointed . With maternal deaths in Scotland reaching a peak of 651 in 1931 , a concerted effort was made to combat eclampsia and to generally reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality . This objective was achieved largely through advances in therapeutics such as the advent of chemotherapy and antibiotics , the work of the national blood transfusion service , and improved anaesthetics . From as early as 1910 overtures had been made to the RIE to alleviate pressure on the Maternity Hospital . Subsequent attempts had also come to nothing until in 1926 a conclusion was reached with the purchase of George Watson 's School from the Merchant Company . An obstetrical unit of 150 beds was constructed and at the same time the Florence Nightingale Nurses ' Home was built to provide accomodation for the midwives and their pupils . On 1st March 1939 the old Simpson closed and the Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion , which was incorporated into the RIE , assumed responsibility for maternity services . In the new Pavilion the principle of isolation as a means of containing infection was fully implemented and by 1979 the number of beds had increased to 225 while the hazards of childbirth and perinatal mortality had been drastically reduced . From 1939 to 1948 the hospital was administered by the Managers of the RIE ; from 1948 to 1974 it formed part of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and Associated Hospitals group ; from 1974 to 1984 the hospital was part of the South Lothian District of Lothian Health Board . From then on the hospital formed part of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh NHS Trust , now Lothian University Hospitals NHS Trust .

This season has been a belter , so we ca n't wait to find out what happens next . To celebrate the show 's return , we called up the lovely John Noble - who plays Walter ( and Walternate ! ) - to have a little chat . Read on to find out what he had to say about those flashbacks , Peter and Walter , and whether he thinks the show will be renewed ... How has it been playing both Walter and Walternate this season ? \" It 's been gift , really . I mean , Walter himself is a wonderful character to play , but then to be given this other [ role as well ] ... He 's a version of Walter , but one very much in the terms of the Fringe mythology - ' what would happen if ' stuff . So what would happen if you had a son stolen instead of having stolen one ? So it 's been based on the same characters but taking off in different directions . I 've loved it . \" Do you sympathise with one Walter more than the other ? \" In a sense , intellectually I do n't , because obviously this Walter on our side , he 's a loveable old character but in fact he did do what he did . He did take into his own hands this thing of crossing over and taking the son , albeit for good intentions , to save the kid 's life . You kind of sympathise with that and then you see he 's gone through hell ever since . Walternate on the other hand was a man who had his son stolen , and I can totally understand how that would twist the mind and turn him into a vengeful and very powerful character . So I kind of understand both of them . \" Do you like the fact that both Walter and Walternate have good and bad sides ? \" Oh , absolutely . At the time we introduced Walternate , I said to the writers , ' Please , please do n't make him a two -dimensional baddie . Down the track , give us something to humanise him ' . I was really insistent on that . As time 's gone by they 've started to give aspects of Walternate that say , ' Oh yeah , I understand now why he did what he did ' , and I really requested that to happen . Two -dimensional characters are fairly forgettable . \" Have you enjoyed playing a younger Walter in the flashback episodes ? \" I have ! It 's been great fun . It 's quite a shock , really . I think the most interesting part is finding the energy of the younger man as opposed to what we see in Walter and Walternate . And the passion that they have , which gets tempered a little bit with age . It 's interesting walking around looking at yourself 20 years younger with all that strange hair . It 's really cool , but my wife says she likes me better as I am ! \" Does it take a long time to prepare for the flashbacks ? \" Yeah , it does . Our makeup lady , particularly for the second flashback , worked out some terrific techniques to get the skin softer so it loses the wrinkles and so forth . This year we 've come up with some terrific technology . And [ I have ] a beautiful handmade wig which at that stage was the right length - should we go on further we 'd need to trim it back . We 've looked at it really carefully . As we become more efficient it 's generally about three or four hours in makeup . \" Walter can be quite quirky and eccentric - how much of that is in the script and how much is it your performance ? \" It 's a combination , because obviously I 've brought what I bring to it . They wrote the initial stuff and then I played with it , and as I played they wrote to it . So it 's been a dual effort . The more that I was prepared to do , the more that they would write . I 've never said no to anything so if they said , ' Walk naked along a tightrope ' , I 'd say , ' OK , whatever ! ' At this stage Walter continues to do outrageous things and as long as they keep writing them I ca n't think of anything I would n't do . \" Are you pleased with how Walter and Peter 's relationship has developed over the three seasons ? \" Obviously Josh [ Jackson ] and I loved the development in the first two seasons until it all fell apart . This season , even though it 's essential it 's been this way , it 's been really hard because we want to play them as getting along really well . But we ca n't because there 's obviously this friction between the two of them . We had a really interesting struggle this year personally because we like the relationship . To play all that tension has been challenging . But it 's been good for the characters and it 's real that they should be so strained at this point . \" Where do you think the show will go in the future ? \" The future depends on whether we finish this year or play for six seasons or ten , whatever . The writers have scenarios for all of those options . The first thing we need to do is come to some resolution about the alternate universe and our universe in conflict . Obviously we ca n't destroy one of them because by the law of physics , if we destroy one we destroy the other . So there has to be a resolution of that and I think there will be some resolution of that in this season - we still have n't had the last two scripts though . Beyond that , if that did happen , I would see a pact being created and then some external threat of some description would make complete sense . I know the writers have so many ideas . One of them said to me the other day , ' We could play for 20 years just with the ideas we 've got ' . We 've certainly played out this conflict between the two universes this year and that will need to be resolved to some degree , not completely but resolved to some degree , by the end of the season . \" What else can fans expect as the season comes to a close ? \" There will be a tremendous build up of tension . It 's a very dark period because you 're looking at the end of the world essentially , unless something is done . So we 're going through the doomsday scenarios . Unless we 're going to blow the world up , there has to be a resolution and that 's really difficult and creates tremendous tension and pressure on all the characters . I guess by the end of season three it will be an enormous buildup to someone about to hit the button and then they either will hit the button or they wo n't . But I know already that the tension is enormous in the stories . \" Fringe has evolved from one - off episodes to a longer story arc - how do you feel about that ? \" On a personal level I like it . It probably makes it more difficult for fans to drop in and say , ' Oh I 'm going to watch the show ' and have any idea what 's going on , because it 's so mythology - based now . But for our hardcore fans it 's perfect because they have an investment in the mythology and the ongoing stories and the ongoing character arcs . I do n't think it could have stayed as a ' monster of the week ' - I do n't think it would have been interesting to continue forever doing that . They could have , but to me personally I prefer the way we 've gone with it . \" We 've heard rumours that William Bell will be back - can you say anything about that ? \" I've heard the same rumours ! In fact , I think Leonard [ Nimoy ] announced it on his Twitter or something . All I can say is that there will be a return of Leonard 's character in a way . In a way . It 's not going to be , ' Hey , here 's Leonard again ' . It will be something different but really quite bizarre . Very bizarre , in fact . \" What are your hopes for Walter in the future ? \" Walter is a man who has gone through certain periods in his life and is now in his golden years and is trying to resolve himself with his creator , with the people around him . It 's quite biblical in a sense , the way he 's trying to come to grips with what he 's done and seek a rounding out and forgiveness . That continues on and it has to continue on , simply because he is an older man . He just continues to evolve almost in a religious sense until he finds some sort of peace and resolution . It would be ridiculous to do it otherwise . So I guess there will be a continuing unravelling and maybe a growing wisdom in the old man . I think that 's what will happen . \" Fringe has controversially been moved to Friday nights in the US - what are your thoughts ? \" I kind of like the move to Friday nights . I thought it was a really good move for us because it gave us a home base . Thursday night in America was never a good night for us ... It was n't a great spot for us up against Grey 's Anatomy and all those things . This is perfect for us . This is the spot that The X Files made their own . And it was sitting there waiting to be taken to be honest with you , because nothing was working in there . So far , so good . I 'd be quite happy to stay on Friday nights . \" Do you think Fringe will be renewed for another season ? The fans want it . \" The fans do want it , and the interesting thing about Fringe is that I know the executives at Fox and the executives at Warner Bros really love Fringe , they 're very proud of it . The challenge they have is , ' Well , OK , do enough people watch it to justify it ? ' That 's where they 're sitting at present . They obviously have to drop some shows this year to let other shows in . The chances of Fringe returning I 'd say are pretty good , but I ca n't really say any more than that . I would n't like to be making the decision they have to make and I think they 're probably making that decision almost as we speak . I know that sentimentally they want Fringe to remain - I know that for a fact . \" Fringe returns in the UK on Wednesday at 10 pm on Sky1 . Are you pleased that Fringe is back ?

Soldiers and health technicians hopped in jeeps and secretly roped sheep and cattle grazing near Hanford . Then , they pressed Geiger counters to the animals ' thyroids to check for the presence of radioactive iodine 131 . The roundup was ordered by the late Herbert Parker - a formal and aloof English radiologist who was Hanford 's first chief of health and safety . Parker fretted about the huge clouds of iodine 131 gas spewing from the stacks of central Hanford 's B Plant and T Plant - where plutonium was chemically extracted from nuclear fuel rods . Parker knew iodine 131 affected thyroid glands . But he did n't know what amounts were unsafe for people . It was a problem he kept trying to calculate . He and other scientists had struggled for years to find out how iodine 131 - which loses half its radioactivity every eight days - enters human bodies . Early on , they believed iodine and other radionuclides settled on vegetation that birds and animals ate . And they noted hunters ate game animals . In the late 1940s , technicians stalked rabbits , coyotes and birds to find excessive amounts of iodine 131 in their thyroids , according to On The Home Front , a Hanford history book written by longtime site historian Michele Gerber . For decades , the government kept secret any speculation about the risks of radioactive iodine to folks downwind from the plutonium plants . The official word was Hanford 's neighbors had nothing to worry about . But in the government - owned town of Richland , home to most of Hanford 's workers , there were some curious rules that seem aimed at preventing iodine 131 from moving through the food chain , Gerber noted . Chickens and livestock were banned , and Richland pasture land was off limits for grazing . The government constantly was testing the milk and water . Richland 's milk supply came from the Yakima and Ellensburg areas - upwind of Hanford . Hanford officials often cautioned Richlanders against drinking \" poor quality \" milk from the rural areas near town , Gerber said . Milk from cows grazing on contaminated pastures is one of the most direct ways for radioactive iodine to reach humans . Although Gerber did n't find evidence directly linking the Richland rules to iodine hazards , the circumstantial evidence is there . \" You certainly have to raise the questions , \" Gerber said . Of course , for most of the past 50 years , no one outside a small cadre of experts was asking serious questions about Hanford emissions , despite the threat to human health . Releases of iodine 131 from Hanford smokestacks began soon after the first nuclear reactors fired up at Hanford . By far , the greatest releases of iodine 131 came from 1944 and 1951 , when emissions totaled an estimated 727,900 curies . After 1951 , special filters and other safety practices cut emissions dramatically . In fact , 98 percent of the overall curies of iodine released over the 28 years ending in 1972 went out the stacks in the first eight years of Hanford operations , according to the Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project . The iodine emissions accounted for nearly all the radiation doses from all types of airborne releases at Hanford . A key reason for the peak during those early years of the Cold War was that Hanford was experimenting with ways to increase plutonium production . One way to get plutonium quicker was to shorten the time that irradiated fuel rods cooled before going to the extraction plants . A side effect of shorter cooling times was that the radioactive iodine did n't have as long to decay before the fuel went into the plants . As a result , thousands of curies of radioactive iodine routinely were sent out Hanford 's smokestacks . By contrast , about 15 curies of radioactive iodine was released in the 1979 Three Mile Island reactor incident in Pennsylvania . The wall of secrecy surrounding Hanford began to crumble as the Cold War drew to a close in the late 1980s . Among the thousands of pages of declassified documents was an account of the so-called Green Run of 1949 . In terms of radiation dose , the Green Run 's 8,000 - curie release pales in comparison with the years of routine emissions . But the federal government 's decision to use the Northwest as an outdoor laboratory for radiation experiments still rankles many . Much about the Green Run still is classified , but numerous clues indicate America 's Cold War scientists wanted to learn how to monitor Soviet nuclear weapon production by tracking iodine releases . So an intentional release of iodine was set up at T Plant . It was dubbed the Green Run because so - called \" green \" fuel was used . That fuel had cooled only 16 days instead of the then - normal 90 or more days - giving iodine little time to decay . Scientists wanted a night experiment when cold layers of air near the ground would keep particles airborne until they were diluted . Plus , they wanted no rain , no low clouds and light winds . They figured 4,000 curies of iodine would be released . But the night of Dec. 2 - 3 , 1949 , was cloudier than expected , and the winds kept shifting . Calculations were off , and almost 8,000 curies of iodine 131 were released . And soon afterward , rain and snow came to force the iodine particles down all over the inland Northwest . One follow - up iodine 131 reading on vegetation in Kennewick was almost 1,000 times the limit set at that time . In 1950 , special filters were put on the processing plants ' smokestacks to capture iodine . Emissions dropped to a fraction of previous counts . But Hanford had an accidental release of 15,000 curies over several weeks in 1951 when the filters failed . Meanwhile , scientists kept researching iodine 131's health effects . They fed iodine 131 pellets to sheep kept at a facility near Hanford 's F Reactor in 1950 and 1951 and did autopsies on the carcasses . The then - classified study showed thyroid damage and changes in blood and hormone levels in the sheep . Also in 1951 , the Atomic Energy Commission - the forerunner of today 's Department of Energy - released a public report that declared releases of iodine 131 and other radionuclides were low and posed no hazards to plants and animals . Gerber noted all Hanford 's iodine and thyroid studies were kept classified until the 1980s . Scientists continued studying iodine and thyroid disease at Hanford and elsewhere . In 1954 , Hanford scientists were sent to Utah to check on sheep killed from iodine - laced fallout from atomic bomb tests , she said . Meanwhile , some research addressed strong suspicions that iodine 131 landing on vegetation came to humans through cows ' milk . \" They did n't get the connection with milk for a long time . They knew ( iodine ) landed on the vegetation , \" Gerber said . In 1963 , an AEC scientist publicly acknowledged that link with a report on the abrupt increase of iodine 131 in milk and subsequently in human thyroids after atomic bomb tests in Nevada , Gerber said . She believes the AEC was certain about the connection prior to that publication . However , it was not until the mid-1980s that public questions and concerns about Hanford radiation releases and people 's health gained major momentum . That was spearheaded by newspaper articles on \" downwinders \" and a massive 1986 release of 19,000 pages of previously classified documents that included information on iodine and thyroids . The federal Centers for Disease Control began pondering the need to find out how much radiation people living \" downwind \" of Hanford would have absorbed from 1944 to 1972 . And the agency thought a study was needed to see if a link existed between Hanford 's iodine emissions and the region 's thyroid problems . DOE agreed to a dose- reconstruction study , and it put Hanford contractor Battelle in charge . But public concerns surfaced whether DOE and one of its contractors could conduct an impartial and credible study on Hanford emissions . So an independent panel of scientists - dubbed the Technical Steering Panel - was put in charge . Much of the public did n't believe the panel had the clout to assert its independence . And Battelle - while sharing technical data - balked at sharing budget information on the research . The panel had to pressure Battelle to open up . And it requested overall responsibility for the study be shifted from DOE to improve credibility . In 1992 , the Department of Health and Human Services assumed responsibility for the study , and CDC began providing the money . In 1994 , the panel unveiled its final estimates on how much airborne radionuclides - dominated by iodine 131 - Northwest downwinders likely absorbed through the food chain . The numbers varied according to geography , ages and eating and drinking habits . Babies and children were among the higher risks . And these were just estimates within ranges of maximum and minimum possible doses . Many average doses were a few hundred times the levels people would receive from naturally occurring background radiation . The remainder varied widely , from a few dozen times that of background levels to a few thousand times background levels . The big problem was : What did these numbers really mean when looking at thyroid problems ? And that 's what the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center 's thyroid study - begun in 1991 - was supposed to tell Thursday . Copyright 1999 Tri-City Herald . All rights reserved .

During an impromptu speech at the event at the Park Lane Hilton on Tuesday , Bob Geldof congratulated the Sun for its coverage of the Band Aid campaign for Africa but went on to attack the rest of the industry . He said the Daily Mail 's coverage of Comic Relief was ' a disgrace ' and criticised Independent editor Simon Kelner for failing to deliver a front - page story on the crisis in Africa . Daily Mirror editor Richard Wallace , reportedly furious with the rock star 's pro-Sun rant , later argued with Mr Geldof outside the event . Ten editors released a joint statement on Friday withdrawing their support for the awards because of the ' decline in conduct and prestige ' of the event . \" The editors of the Guardian , the Observer , the Daily Telegraph , the Sunday Telegraph , the Independent , the Independent on Sunday , the Daily Express , the Sunday Express , the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday believe the organisation of these awards brings little credit to the industry or to the newspapers who win them , \" said the statement . \" Discussions are now going on about what should happen in the future . \" The Evening Standard has since joined the boycott and the Financial Times and Mirror Group are also expected to follow suit . \" There seems to be a widespread feeling that we could , as an industry , come up with awards - and an awards ceremony - which better reflected the best of British journalism , \" said Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger . The British Press Awards are organised by the UK trade publication Press Gazette . \" What 's annoyed us is that some of the stuff written over the weekend has been about improving the judging process - some of it even implying there is something corrupt about it , \" said Press Gazette editor Ian Reeves . \" That is absolutely ludicrous . It 's a rigorous process - and there is no way it is corrupt . \" Mr Reeves was not able to say whether a category rewarding online journalism would be reintroduced for next year 's awards . The award for best online journalist was only offered in 2001 and 2002 . \" Some editors are saying there are too many categories , \" he told dotJournalism . \" It will be a root and branch review . \" More news from dotJournalism : Top prize- giver snubs online journalism ' Myopic ' press awards neglect UK web journalists British broadsheet site scoops more awards More coverage : Guardian Unlimited : http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,7495,1438881,00.html The Sun : http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2005122447,00.html Media Week : http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/articles/folder2005/Mar03/geldof-paperattack | Back to dotJournalism headlines Focus Daniell Morrisey : How to attract and recruit top talent Careers writer Daniell Morrisey on the steps employers can take to hire the best job candidates 15:14 21 December 2006 Who 's driving CAR ?

It also may be one of the more unlikely . A key cog in the Class A Lakewood offense , Scheiner reached what would have been the end of the road for most players in his situation four years ago . Despite a solid career at Maria Carrillo Pumas High School in Santa Rosa , California , the infielder received little interest from schools or scouts . His lone option as far as baseball was concerned was attending a local junior college , where he wound up red-shirting as a freshman . \" In high school I was good at defense , but I was a smaller player , \" said the 6 - foot - 1 , 200 - pounder . \" Then I had to red -shirt my first year in junior college because I would have been splitting time . In the meantime , I decided to improve my skills , lift weights , get stronger and work on my craft . \" His dedication and determination paid their first significant dividends in 2016 when he led Santa Rosa Junior College to a conference and state championship . Scheiner was recognized as the Big 8 Most Valuable Player as well as the NorCal Player of the Year , a First Team All - American and state championship MVP . While professional baseball continued to show little interest , he received offers from a handful of collegiate programs and wound up at the University of Houston . In what proved to be his lone season with the Cougars , Scheiner paced the team in the Triple Crown categories with a .346 batting average , 18 home runs and 64 RBIs . He led the American Athletic Conference in roundtrippers and was named the conference 's Player of the Year as well as a Second Team All -American . That performance finally impressed pro scouts , with the Phillies taking Scheiner in the fourth round of the 2017 Draft . \" I had a great year at Houston , \" he said . \" I loved the coaches there . I really wanted to prove myself , and I feel I was able to do that . I realized it 's the same game , only the pitching and competition is a little better . After my final season at Santa Rosa and my year at Houston , it helped me come to the realization that my dreams could come true if I continued to work hard and do everything I needed to do . \" His efforts have continued to produce solid results in the professional ranks . He made his debut in the New York - Penn League with a slash line of .250/.377/.317 at Williamsport in 2017 before receiving a promotion to Lakewood to open the current campaign . He helped guide the BlueClaws to the first - half North Division title and also earned a spot as a reserve in the SAL All - Star Game . Through games of July 18 , Scheiner is hitting .288/.357/.453 overall and has really turned it on of late with a .349/.455/.506 line since the break . His 23 doubles are tied for third on the circuit , and he leads Lakewood with 96 hits , 48 runs and 40 RBIs while tying for second with 10 homers . Scheiner also is making consistent contact , evidenced by his 59 strikeouts versus 33 walks . His offensive output is more impressive considering his defensive responsibilities . After splitting his time between second and third base last year at Williamsport , he has made 20 starts at first base , 45 at the hot corner and 21 in left field . While the first turn and the outfield are unfamiliar territory , Scheiner has responded to the challenge with aplomb by making only seven errors , two coming at third base on Opening Day . \" There 's been a lot of hours of work put in and it 's good to see things starting to pay off , \" he said . \" The goal now is to stay consistent while I keep working and getting better every year , which is what I 've been doing the last few seasons . I 'm trying to stay in the present and do what I can today to get better . \" In brief Home run barrage : After hitting 14 homers in its first three games at Greensboro on July 14 - 16 , Asheville leads the SAL with 111 roundtrippers , 15 more than second - place Lexington ( 96 ) . Tourists players own the second through fifth spots in the league home run race , led by first baseman Chad Spanberger and outfielder Casey Golden ( 22 apiece ) and followed by right fielder Ramon Marcelino ( 18 ) and infielder Bret Boswell ( 17 ) . Spanberger and Golden also rank 1 - 2 in the league RBI rankings with 73 and 62 , respectively . Nice homecoming : Columbia catcher Scott Manea smashed a 417 - foot home run and stroked three hits in the second game of a doubleheader on July 16 at Lakewood while playing in front of nearly two dozen friends and family members .

Gilliam shifted back to the center of the table and closed his eyes . His chest heaved three or four times . His lips began to flutter . At 10 : 27 p.m. , Gilliam was pronounced dead , the 83rd man to be executed in Maryland history . For years , the Doerfler family declined to speak publicly about the slaying . Those who know the Doerflers say the family regarded the murder as a private matter . Both parents wrote to Gov. Parris N. Glendening to share their differing views on Gilliam 's fate , and they asked that the letters be kept confidential . Mrs. Doerfler wanted Gilliam 's life to be spared ; Mr. Doerfler did not . Gilliam became well - known in national anti-death penalty circles . Raised in the working - class Baltimore County neighborhood of Middle River , Gilliam had had only one conviction -- for robbery -- at the time of the murder . In the months before his death , Gilliam spoke from Baltimore 's Supermax prison by telephone to activists around the country . Gilliam and his attorney fought furiously to block the execution . They claimed in the last few days that one of Gilliam 's partners pulled the trigger that night 10 years ago , and that Gilliam did n't deserve to die . But the arguments were rebuffed every step of the way . At noon yesterday , Glendening denied a plea for mercy , calling the murder \" particularly brutal [ and ] heinous . \" Five hours later , the U.S. Supreme Court turned down a final appeal . Minister Louis Farrakhan and Baltimore Cardinal William H. Keeler , who opposes the death penalty , sent letters urging Glendening to grant clemency to Gilliam , who belonged to Farrakhan 's Nation of Islam . At 5 p.m. , Gilliam was told that his appeals had been denied . A prison spokesman said Gilliam took the news calmly . \" He 's fully prepared to die , \" said Leonard A. Sipes Jr. In the hours before his death , Gilliam stayed in a cell about 35 feet from the execution chamber , where he was visited by his father , his mother , his grandfather , a Roman Catholic priest and two Islamic ministers . Gilliam refused his last supper , a choice between roast beef and fried chicken . \" He felt pensive , \" Sipes said . \" He knew he was going to be executed , and he wanted to spend the time with his family and his spiritual advisers . \" Gilliam spent much of the day on the phone . \" He 's been speaking with attorneys , religious leaders and his family , \" Sipes said early in the evening . \" He fully recognizes that he will be executed . He seems to be very much at peace with what 's coming . \" Death penalty protest Outside the prison , more than 200 death penalty opponents lined East Madison Street , shouting , \" One , two , three , four , stop the killing of the poor . \" They carried signs that read \" Stop State Killing , \" \" Death Penalty Equals Murder \" and \" Stop Glendening Before He Kills Again . \" \" I have to do my little part to say no , \" said protester John Furst of Parkville . \" There 's a general level of ignorance in the population , and executions are going to continue to happen , unfortunately . But I 'm not going to just sit at home and do nothing . \" Lorig Charkordian , a coordinator of the Maryland Coalition Against State Executions , a Baltimore group , said she was troubled by Gilliam 's execution because of questions about who pulled the trigger . \" One of the problems with the death penalty is that it sometimes puts to death innocent people , \" Charkordian said . \" This is one of those cases that makes you wonder . \" Speaking to reporters outside the penitentiary less than a half - hour after the execution , Gilliam 's attorney called the governor \" a coward . \" \" The whole state saw what he did , \" Nickerson said . \" He makes the statement that he believes that my client is a cold - blooded killer . Well , my client never got his day in court as to whether or not he was eligible for the death penalty . But there 's one thing that we did establish tonight , and that is that Governor Glendening is the coldest , bloodiest killer that we have ever encountered . \" Thomas Forsythe of Highlandtown was the only demonstrator outside the penitentiary to visibly support the execution . \" Somebody has to stand up for this lady , \" said Forsythe , a house painter . \" I think this guy and his two accomplices ought to all get the death penalty . There was no need for what they did . They could have taken the $ 3 and left . They did n't have to kill her . For that , they should die . \" Forsy the held a sign . \" We Must Mourn All Victims of Murder , \" it read . \" Ms. Doerfler had a life , too . \" Drugs and crime A month before the 1988 murder , Gilliam -- a longtime drug user -- secured a $ 2,600 school loan to become a barber , according to court records . Gilliam used the money to buy drugs . He and his co-defendants , brothers Delano \" Tony \" Drummond and Kelvin Drummond , started using cocaine daily , mixing it with PCP . When the trio ran up a $ 700 debt with a drug dealer , Kelvin Drummond stole a gray Chevrolet Nova and three snowsuits . They added a sawed - off shotgun to their inventory , and on Dec. 1 , 1988 , they hatched a plan for a robbery spree while using drugs at a friend 's house . Gilliam said he wanted to kill a woman . Kelvin Drummond thought he was joking . Their first stop on Dec. 2 was a Burger King in Harford County . Kelvin Drummond grabbed the shotgun and walked to the car window of a woman waiting in the drive - through . She sped off , escaping . The Doerfler slaying They then went to a nearby townhouse complex , where they robbed a woman of her pocketbook before heading south to Perry Hall . As the men drove down Joppa Road , Doerfler was having dinner with her father and sister . The youngest of nine children , Doerfler belonged to the Shrine of the Little Flower church in Northeast Baltimore and sang folk songs for Sunday Mass . After graduating from Mercy High School , Doerfler worked as a hardware store accountant and planned to attend Loyola College , just like her brothers and sisters . That December night , Doerfler 's father decided to order submarine sandwiches . They sat on the living room floor , watched television and ate . At 7 p.m. , Doerfler said she was going to rent a movie and drive to her sister 's house , 25 minutes away . When she pulled up in her blue Nissan , Tony Drummond and Gilliam forced their way into her car . Drive , they told her . Give us your money . She said she had none , just $ 3 and an ATM card . They looked for a bank and then told her to turn down Gum Spring Road , a dead - end lovers ' lane in Rossville . They pulled her keys kept on a Donald Duck ring from the ignition . Kelvin Drummond testified that he saw Gilliam standing at the side of Doerfler 's car . She was in the driver 's seat and Gilliam was talking to her , one hand on the shotgun , the other resting on the car . Kelvin Drummond said he suddenly heard a loud boom and saw the flash of the shotgun . \" She was , like , face - first into the steering wheel , \" he testified . Gilliam told his partners he killed Doerfler because he did n't want any witnesses . After the murder , the trio went to Golden Ring Mall , where they had dinner with their girlfriends at the Italian Delight restaurant . Two days later , Gilliam was arrested after robbing a convenience store . He confessed to the murder and told police that it was an accident . It was the first of several confessions . His attorney said in court that he shot Doerfler during a drug-induced daze -- an argument that Baltimore Circuit Judge John F. Fader II rejected . \" I do n't think that that is a proposition that society can abide by , \" he said during Gilliam 's sentencing hearing on Oct. 31 , 1989 . An apology Before he was sentenced , Gilliam apologized to the Doerfler family . \" I 'm sorry , and I could n't imagine how you feel toward me , and I do n't know if you forgive me or not . But I am truly sorry . \" He then turned to the judge . \" Your Honor , I know that I have to be punished for this and I am ready to pay for it , \" Gilliam said , \" but I just ask you not to give me the death penalty . \" Pub Date : 11/17/98","annotations":[{"text":"kidnapping Christine J.

Is there a future in writing records the same way back when Ritual de lo Habitual came out ? The way I look at it is this : Jane 's Addiction has got a catalog , and we can go out and perform for 70 minutes and people know all those songs , so for us , if you 're asking me my opinion , the best thing that we can do is try to come up with a single every once in a while to add into the set that you can distribute via online , and that 's where my head is at . But I do think it 's important to continue to be creative . Those creative juices , that 's musical currency . For as much as we love all the old songs , even I would love to hear a new song from Pink Floyd if they got back together , or Van Halen . I do n't need to hear a whole record , but I 'd love to hear one cool new song from them that was maybe being passed around via the Internet . That 's what I 'd like to see . It 's a different situation with a new group , a new group that does n't have 70 minutes worth of quality material that people want to hear , so you 've got to create that 70 minutes worth of quality material . That 's why there would be a need for new groups to have albums . Even you would probably not appreciate Jane 's Addiction if we showed up in your town and we only played 70 minutes of new material . If we did n't play any oldies , you 'd probably be bummed out . People want something that they 're familiar with . Something that they love . They fell in love . That 's what they want . So you 're not interested in the old album cycle ? I am not , but I tell you what , do n't count it out , because the business might dictate that something like that occurs someday in the future . Just out of , I guess , contractual obligations , you might say . I ca n't really speak too much more about that . ( laughs ) ( laughs ) Okay , but did the original goal of the recording process work of getting your creativity flowing together in a studio ? Yes , exactly . But not for the purposes of writing a record . It was just for the purpose of : We 're going out , there are all these great new tools for us to distribute our music , and let 's come up with something new so we can perform one new song in the set . I think that would be really fun . I 'm just looking at it purely as an artist , not as any kind of signed artist , or from the recording industry perspective , I 'm looking at it purely as a troubadour . At the same time , you just released this massive physical box set for collectors . Do you feel you have to maintain that relationship with this vast amount of new media and the people who want everyone on vinyl , on plastic , etc .? That is true , but let me tell you , that box set was supposed to be released two years ago . It just took so long . We cut that deal on the box set when we were still together on the last record , and it took that long to get it coordinated and gathered and all those other things and it was just kind of a happenstance that we were together at this time .

It 's true that the second half of his music career found him based in New York playing to the coffeehouse and cabaret set and hanging out with Burl Ives , Woody Guthrie , and fellow transplanted blues artists Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee . When I saw him in Chicago in the 1960s his shirt was unbuttoned to his waist \u00e0 la Harry Belafonte and his repertoire consisted of folk revival standards such as \" Scarlet Ribbons . \" He was a show business personality -- a star renowned for his sexual magnetism and his dramatic vocal presentations . What many people do n't know is that Josh White was a major figure in the Piedmont blues tradition . The first part of his career saw him as apprentice and lead boy to some of the greatest blues and religious artists ever , including Willie Walker , Blind Blake , Blind Joe Taggart ( with whom he recorded ) , and allegedly even Blind Lemon Jefferson . On his own , he recorded both blues and religious songs , including a classic version of \" Blood Red River . \" A fine guitar technician with an appealing voice , he became progressively more sophisticated in his presentation . Like many other Carolinians and Virginians who moved north to urban areas , he took up city ways , remaining a fine musician if no longer a down - home artist . Like several other canny blues players , he used his roots music to broaden and enhance his life experience , and his talent was such that he could choose the musical idiom that was most lucrative at the time . ~ Barry Lee Pearson , All Music Guide Great performance !

Some concern is definitely understandable , especially since certain infections are widespread and potentially dangerous , such as COVID - 19 and the flu . Fortunately , you may already be immune to a number of other contagious diseases . And thanks to a successful vaccination program , some illnesses , like rubella ( German measles ) , are now rare in the United States . You can also take comfort in the fact that most babies are n't harmed if their mother develops an infection during pregnancy . But some infections can be transmitted to babies through the placenta or during birth . When that happens , it may have serious consequences . What 's more , some infections can make you sicker if you get them when you 're pregnant , or they may lead to complications like preterm labor . Infections and pregnancy : Why you 're more at risk during pregnancy When you 're pregnant , your immune system works a bit differently than it normally does . Your hormone levels change considerably , as well . These factors make you more susceptible to some infections . You 're more likely to be infected with listeria , a foodborne illness , for example . Physical changes brought on by pregnancy can also raise your risk for certain infections . For instance , your odds of a kidney infection are higher , partly because of the pressure your growing baby places on your urinary tract . But your chance of getting sick in the first place is n't the only thing influenced by pregnancy . It can also affect how sick you may become . Pregnant women are more likely to get seriously ill with certain infections , including herpes simplex virus and the flu . In 2009 for example , pregnant women represented 5 percent of deaths from the flu , even though they only made up 1 percent of the population . Some infections present a greater risk to your baby , while others put you in more danger \u2013 and certain infections can be equally hazardous for both of you . Because of this , it 's important that you understand a few basics about common contagious diseases . What infections are common during pregnancy ? Here 's a list of some of the infections that can affect a pregnancy : Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) is an infection of the vagina that can cause itching and discharge . Though it 's not transmitted by having sex , you 're more likely to develop BV if you 're sexually active . During pregnancy , the infection can raise your baby 's chances of premature birth and low birthweight . Fortunately , BV is easily treated with antibiotics . Chickenpox is caused by the varicella- zoster virus ( VZV ) and was a common childhood illness in the United States until 1995 , when a vaccine became widely available . Its hallmark is an itchy , blistery rash , though fever and fatigue are also typical symptoms . Coming down with chickenpox when you 're pregnant can cause serious complications for both you and your baby , including pneumonia , birth defects , and low birthweight . The best way to prevent the disease is through vaccination prior to pregnancy , because you cannot receive the shot while you 're pregnant . So , be sure to avoid anyone you know that has chickenpox and let your healthcare provider know right away if you 're exposed . Chikungunya is a virus transmitted via an infected mosquito . Though there are occasional U.S. outbreaks , it is exceedingly rare here , with just 29 cases reported to the CDC in 2020 . Fever and joint pain are common symptoms , and recovery usually takes within seven days . Contracting chikungunya can lead to preterm labor , a lack of amniotic fluid in your placenta , and the death of the fetus . There is no vaccine or cure , though you can treat symptoms and lower your risk by guarding against mosquito bites in affected areas of the globe . Chlamydia during pregnancy is associated with leaking amniotic fluid , preterm labor , and low birthweight . Your baby can be infected during delivery , which may result in conjunctivitis ( pinkeye ) or pneumonia . There were about 1.8 million cases of the sexually transmitted disease reported to the CDC in 2019 , though the actual count is likely much higher . That 's probably because most people do n't have symptoms , which can include discharge , pain , bleeding , and burning . Chlamydia is treated with antibiotics and may be prevented by using a condom every time you have sex . COVID - 19 infection carries serious risks for pregnant and recently pregnant women , especially if you have other health conditions . Premature birth is one potential complication , and you 're at higher risk for having a stillbirth . You 're also more likely than non-pregnant women to become seriously ill and to need hospitalization , intensive care , or a ventilator . Your chances of dying are increased , as well . Being vaccinated is by far the best way of preventing COVID - 19 . The shot can be taken while you 're pregnant \u2013 it will not give you or your baby the coronavirus . Speak with your provider if you have n't received your vaccine already , if you 've come in contact with an infected person , or if you have COVID - 19 symptoms . Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) passes from one person to another via bodily fluids such as blood , saliva , or urine . It affects more than half of U.S. adults by age 40 and sticks around for life , though most people will never develop symptoms or even know they have the disease . Infected pregnant women can pass CMV to their babies , who are usually do n't have symptoms , but may develop problems with their brain , lungs , liver , or spleen . Hearing loss can occur up to 2 years later . The risk of growth problems and stillbirth is increased as well . If your provider suspects CMV , a blood test can detect the virus in adults , while a urine or saliva test is preferred for infants . Treatment is not yet recommended during pregnancy , but your baby may require treatment after birth . Dengue fever is , like chikungunya , transmitted by infected mosquitos and rare in the U.S. When Americans do develop the illness , it 's almost always because they 've traveled to high - risk areas . Symptoms include fever , rash , and pain . Dengue is potentially life - threatening if you become severely ill . If a pregnant person contracts the disease , it may cause low birthweight , premature delivery , or even death of the fetus . If you 're concerned about the possibility of dengue , speak with your healthcare provider before heading abroad . Fifth disease ( parvovirus B19 ) is a common , mild childhood illness that causes fever and rash and usually clears up between one and three weeks . It typically is n't an issue during pregnancy , though in rare cases , the mother may miscarry or her baby may develop anemia . While there is no treatment for fifth disease , avoiding sick people and washing your hands thoroughly and often can help keep you from getting sick . Your provider may want you to be tested if you 're exposed ; many pregnant women are already immune to parvovirus B19 . Flu can be extraordinarily harmful for both you and your baby if you 're infected while pregnant . You may end up with pneumonia , or deliver prematurely . If you have persistently high fevers early in the pregnancy , your baby may develop birth defects , as well , including some that affect the brain and spinal cord . So , contact your provider right away if you have fever , chills , a cough , a sore throat , or any other common signs . And keep in mind \u2014 year in and year out , the best way of preventing the illness is receiving your annual flu shot , which is recommended during pregnancy . Gonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics once the sexually transmitted disease is identified by a provider ; common symptoms include vaginal discharge and burning during urination . When left untreated , however , gonorrhea can lead to miscarriage , preterm delivery , and low birthweight . It may cause your water to break early , or for the fluid to become infected . Your newborn can also be infected at birth , and there 's a small chance they 'll develop pinkeye . Group B strep ( GBS ) is a kind of bacteria that lives in your digestive and reproductive systems . It affects about one - quarter of pregnant women , and you will be tested for it around week 37 of your pregnancy . If you 're positive and your GBS is not treated with antibiotics during labor , there is a small chance you could pass it to your baby at that point . Babies with a GBS infection may develop pneumonia , sepsis , or meningitis , which can cause additional health issues down the line . In a worst - case scenario , an infected baby can die . Pregnant people may develop complications , too , including a uterine infection . Testing and antibiotics are the best prevention methods for GBS . Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) affects more than 850,000 people in the U.S. , according to the CDC . A serious liver infection transmitted via blood , semen , and other bodily fluids , HBV can be short - or long - term , and may lead to life - threatening conditions such as cirrhosis or liver cancer . If you 're pregnant and have HBV , there is a 10 % to 20 % chance you will pass it to your baby during labor and birth . With no treatment , your baby can develop a chronic infection and severe liver problems . The best method of preventing HBV is through vaccination , which can be done during pregnancy , and immunization is recommended for all infants Herpes , or genital herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) infection , is a sexually transmitted infection that 's dangerous if it 's passed to your baby in the womb or during delivery . Sores , blindness , organ damage , and a serious brain disorder called herpes encephalitis can result . Lower your chance of contracting herpes by having safe sex . If you have a history of genital HSV , your provider will prescribe you medication in the last month of pregnancy to reduce outbreaks . You should be especially aware of skin-to - skin contact when you have mouth sores . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) can be passed to your baby if you 're infected . Transmission may happen through the placenta during pregnancy , via vaginal fluids during birth , or by means of breastmilk after birth . That said , treatment has come a long way since AIDS deaths peaked in the mid-1990s . Now , with the right medications and precautions , people with HIV live nearly as long as people without HIV . What 's more , fetal infection can almost always be prevented with medications . If you know you have HIV and are pregnant or trying to conceive , it 's critical that you speak with your provider about treatment . Listeriosis can be contracted by eating food contaminated by the bacteria L. monocytogenes \u2013 usually ready - to - eat poultry , meats , seafood , or dairy . Sometimes , it comes from eating produce grown in contaminated soil . The disease kills about 260 Americans each year , and pregnant people \u2013\u2013 are much more susceptible than others . Miscarriage , preterm labor , and stillbirth can result . If you pass listeriosis to your baby , it can cause infections , serious lifelong medical issues , and death . Reach out to your provider immediately if you suspect you have the illness , but know that symptoms , including fever , muscle aches , and fatigue , may not show for up to two months . To prevent listeriosis , refrigerate all perishable foods and leftovers , and throw away anything that 's been left on the counter for more than two hours . Rubella ( German measles ) is a viral infection . It may cause flu-like symptoms in adults , and life - threatening health issues for your baby if you become sick during pregnancy . Miscarriage , stillbirth , developmental delays , heart defects , and cataracts are just a few possible complications . Cases of rubella are extremely rare in the U.S. , with only 15 babies reported born with it from 2005 - 2018 , according to the CDC . That 's because the vast majority of Americans have had the measles , mumps , and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine \u2013 a safe , effective two - dose shot commonly given during infancy and young childhood . Still , your provider will make sure you 're up - to-date . Sexually transmitted infections ( STIs or STDs ) are diseases you can contract by having vaginal , oral , or anal sex with someone who is infected . They lead to a range of mild - to - severe medical problems for both pregnant people and their fetuses . Testing and treatment is key for averting these issues , though limiting your number of partners or using condoms can reduce your risk overall . Common STIs include : - Chlamydia - Genital herpes - Gonorrhea - Hepatitis B - Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) - Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) - Syphilis While some other illnesses can be transmitted by having sex , they 're more commonly spread in other ways . These include cytomegalovirus and Zika . Syphilis can lead to miscarriage , premature birth , umbilical cord problems , and stillbirth . If your baby is born with syphilis , they may die within a few days or develop severe health problems that will be with them for life . Awareness is especially important for pregnant women because cases of the sexually transmitted disease have skyrocketed in recent years , both in parents and newborns . A reported 1,870 babies were born with syphilis in 2019 , up from just 358 in 2011 . Though pregnant people are routinely screened for the infection , you should report symptoms to your provider right away . The first signs often include genital , anal , or oral sores , while later signs may include body rash and flu-like symptoms . Syphilis is treated with penicillin . Toxoplasmosis comes from contaminated cat litter or feces , though it can also be present in tainted soil or meat . Caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii , the disease is typically mild for adults . However , if it 's passed to the fetus , toxoplasmosis can lead to poor growth , premature delivery , miscarriage , and stillbirth . Infants may have eye issues or brain damage present at birth , though more often , problems do n't show up until years later . If you 're trying to conceive or are already pregnant and have a cat , ask someone else to change the litter each day . If the chore is left up to you , make sure you wear gloves , and wash your hands when you 're finished . Trichomoniasis also called tric , is a very common , very curable sexually transmitted infection . It causes symptoms in about one - third of infected people \u2013 typically itchy genitals , discharge , and burning when you pee . If you 're pregnant , the risk of early delivery and low birth weight increase . Let your provider know if you see signs of tric ; you 'll be given medication if you 're diagnosed . Urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) are typically caused by bacteria that travel up through your urethra . Most UTIs occur in your bladder ( cystitis ) , though some happen in your kidneys ( pyelonephritis ) , and you 're particularly prone to them during pregnancy . Bladder infections often lead to pain and burning when you pee , as well as a constant urge to use the bathroom . Kidney infections can cause fever , chills , vomiting , and pain in your lower back or sides . Tell your provider if you have any symptoms , but especially if you suspect your kidneys are affected , since it can have life- threatening consequences for both you and your baby . Providers treat UTIs with oral antibiotics over the course of a few days . Lower your risk of getting one by hydrating , not holding it when you have to pee , wiping from front to back after using the toilet , and keeping your genital area clean . Yeast infection during pregnancy is very common , thanks to changes in your hormones . The good news is , beyond an annoying itch and thick , white vaginal discharge , it wo n't pose much danger to you or your baby . Report symptoms anyway , so you can get treatment and just in case you may have a more serious problem . If you 're diagnosed , know that yeast infection pregnancy treatment differs slightly from the usual treatment in one big way : You wo n't be given an oral antifungal like fluconazole . Instead , you 'll receive a vaginal medicine , such as a tablet , suppository , or cream . Clotrimazole , miconazole , and terconazole are popular options . Zika virus is another illness mostly spread by mosquitos , though it can also be transmitted sexually . There is no vaccine , treatment , or cure . It 's very dangerous for pregnant people , linked to miscarriage , stillbirth , and birth defects like microcephaly , a condition in which a baby 's head is much smaller than it should be . Though there have been just a handful of U.S. Zika infections in recent years , 2016 saw a large outbreak . More than 5,000 cases were reported in the states and over 36,000 cases were found in U.S. territories \u2013 the vast majority in Puerto Rico . Pregnant people and those trying to conceive should avoid travel to places with Zika outbreaks . If you must travel , take precautions to prevent mosquito bites . How can I protect myself from infections during pregnancy ? You ca n't completely avoid all sources of infection while you 're pregnant . But you can take certain steps to make it less likely that you 'll get sick , and to reduce the risk of serious problems for you or your baby if you do get an infection . Most importantly , getting prenatal care is crucial . For example , simple blood tests can tell you whether you 're immune to certain infections , such as chickenpox and rubella . You 'll also be tested for infections you may not know you have , including UTIs , group B strep , hepatitis B , and HIV . If you think you 've been exposed to a serious infection or you become ill , getting care in a timely manner can often help prevent complications . You can do a number of things on your own , too . Basic measures will reduce your risk of getting sick : - Wash your hands . Do it thoroughly and often . If soap and water are not available , use an alcohol - based hand sanitizer and rub your hands together until they 're dry . - Avoid sharing personal items and toiletries . These include drinking glasses , utensils , and toothbrushes . - Be aware of how you handle animals . Wash up after touching pet food or poop . Ask someone else to change your cat litter . Stay away from rodents , lizards , and turtles in general . If you keep them as pets , have someone look after them while you 're pregnant . - Practice safe sex . Limit your number of partners and make sure to use condoms . - Safeguard your food . Wash fruits and vegetables . Make sure that your meat , fish , and eggs are well cooked , and your work surfaces are kept clean . Do n't eat certain foods that may make you ill , including raw cheeses and rare meat . - Stay away from anyone with a contagious disease . Of course , it 's easier said than done if you work together or share a living space , but do the best you can . Always follow your local COVID - 19 guidelines , too . - Travel smart . Speak with a healthcare provider before you head overseas . Skip places where infections could endanger you or your baby . If you must go , take the appropriate precautions . Protect yourself from mosquitos , wherever you 're . - Get vaccinated . If you 're pregnant or trying to get pregnant , check to see that you 're current on your immunizations . You can receive certain shots during pregnancy , but not all of them . Finally , if you 're sick or think you 've been exposed to a contagious disease , let your caregiver know right away . That way , you can be tested and treated if necessary .","annotations":[{"text":"their mother","span":[592,603],"token_span":[110,111],"role":"Protagonist","label":"Protagonist","role_definition":""},{"text":"an infection","span":[614,625],"token_span":[113,114],"role":"Disease","label":"Disease","role_definition":""},{"text":"during pregnancy","span":[627,642],"token_span":[115,116],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the Protagonist contracts the Disease."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"A Protagonist comes to suffer from a Disease, often implicitly acquired from a Source.","frame_ancestors":["Eventive_affecting","Event"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-7494-195-frame-Come_together","frame":"Come_together","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"On 3 March 1998 , some 50,000 people gathered for the burial of 24 Drenica massacre victims in the village of Likoshan .","annotations":[{"text":"On 3 March 1998","span":[0,14],"token_span":[0,3],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time is when the congregating occurs."},{"text":"some 50,000 people","span":[18,35],"token_span":[5,7],"role":"Individuals","label":"Individuals","role_definition":"The Individuals are self-movers who come together."},{"text":"in the village of Likoshan","span":[92,117],"token_span":[17,21],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place is where the congregating occurs."}],"trigger":{"text":"gathered","start_char":37,"end_char":44,"start_token":8,"end_token":8,"frame":"Come_together"}},"source":{"text":"7 March 1998 On Tuesday , March 3rd , over 50,000 people gathered on a hill in the village of Likosani near Drenica , some 40 kilometers north - east of Kosovo 's capital Pristina . Nine bodies wrapped in red-and - black Albanian national flags were lying in front of a makeshift stage . Only fifty yards away , there were nine freshly dug graves . The funeral was originally scheduled for one o'clock in the afternoon , but commenced in the early evening hours because police had erected barricades on all roads to Drenica . They tried to prevent people coming from all over Kosovo to attend the funeral . Rows of cars and buses at the Komorani checkpoint near Glogovac stretched for miles . Ten members of the Ahmeti family from Likosani and their neighbors had a good reason to be at the funeral : they had been dead for three days already . Their bodies were taken that morning from the Pristina morgue but the truck carrying them reached the village only late that afternoon , as the driver was forced to take almost impassable side - roads the police could n't barricade . When the bodies finally arrived , it turned out that the death toll was bigger than expected so three more graves had to be dug . A total of 24 persons , mainly peasants from Likosani and the nearby village Chirez , were buried that day . The four policemen and an ethnic Albanian buried the day before bring the total death toll of the bloody weekend in Drenica to 29 . The obviously exaggerated reports by both the Serb and the Albanian side , as well as controversial testimonies of eyewitnesses still in a state of shock , made it no easier to establish what exactly happened between Friday , when the clashes broke out , and Sunday , when police finally left Drenica . It is certain , however , that Kosovo has not seen so much bloodshed since 28 March 1989 , when 70 people were killed in riots following a government decision that effectively took away Kosovo 's autonomy . A protest rally by ethnic Albanians in Pristina following the Drenica bloodshed ended with a brutal police intervention in which 30 protesters were wounded and one was killed , allegedly with a shot in the mouth . The situation in the province is tense , there is no telling what could happen next . Ethnic Albanian political leaders , including the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo leader Ibrahim Rugova and head of the Parliamentary party Adem Demaci , have girded together and convened for days in an effort to take a common stand on the massacre . At the time this edition of Vreme was being put in circulation , it was still too early to predict how they might react to the aggravated situation in the province . Meanwhile , the Serbian media and the vast majority of both government and opposition leaders took turns in congratulating the police with some exaltation for \u201c dealing a decisive blow to the terrorists \u201d . Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic went out of his way to express his personal condolence to the families of the killed policemen , and duly praised the police for their \u201c courage , patriotism and commitment \u201d . The Commander of the special police troops , Miroslav Mijanovic , called the four killed policemen \u201c the knights of Kosovo slued by ethnic Albanian bandits \u201d , while the ethnic Albanians said the friends and relatives they buried in Likosane were \u201c martyrs and heroes , the innocent victims of Serbian terror \u201d . It appears that neither side is prepared to treat one another as human beings . The police version : The Serbian interior ministry released a statement to the effect that it all started on Saturday around half past noon , when a police unit allegedly on a routine patrolling assignment was ambushed near Likosane . The car ran into a ditch , and the officers in trouble requested back up . Another police vehicle with four officers in it was sent to rescue them , but they too were ambushed several miles down the road . That is when two officers were killed from automatic weapons , while another two were seriously wounded and taken to hospital . Around two o'clock in the afternoon , another back up unit was sent and \u201c engaged in battle against the terrorists , in full accord with the powers vested in the police \u201d . Clashes between the police and the self - styled Kosovo Liberation Army ( UCK ) , which claimed responsibility for the death of four Serbian policemen , went on all night and spilled into the nearby villages . By Sunday , when the fighting stopped , two more police officers were killed and another two were wounded , while the death toll on the other side rose to 15 . The Serbian interior ministry did n't bother to disclose the names of the killed \u201c terrorists \u201d nor the nine allegedly arrested , leaving that to the ethnic Albanian side . There are lots of facts indicating that the Interior Ministry statement is only partially true . There had been no routine patrol assignments in the central Kosovo region of Drenica and its border municipalities Glogovac , Mitrovica and Klina since last November , when the UCK effectively took control of the region . Several minor skirmishes occurred , and they all ended with police withdrawal . Since then , police going on business to Drenica have been backed up by helicopter and armored vehicles . It is therefore hard to imagine that the police unit ambushed on Saturday was on a routine mission . Most of the killed Albanians ( the death toll does not match police reports ) , were no terrorists . According to eyewitness reports from Drenica , clashes between police and the UCK broke out on Friday evening , a whole day prior to what the police said . According to eyewitnesses , the fighting broke out in Srbica , the largest village in the Drenica region , and not in Likosane . The fighting broke out when unidentified individuals drove by a primary school accommodating Serb refugees and fired at the building with automatic weapons . Police reacted instantly and started pursuing the assailants , who stopped their vehicle in a chicane near Likosani and opened fire at their pursuants . The police vehicle slid off the road into the ditch , and it seems that two police officers were killed in this shootout . The back up unit that consequently arrived could not make any progress at night . During the night and the following morning , both sides deployed reinforcements and prepared for battle . Full - scale clashes broke out when the police arrived with some 30 armored vehicles and two Gama assault choppers . The UCK fighters tried to repel the vastly superior enemy but had to withdraw and leave the inhabitants of Likosani and Chirez at the mercy of the police , who stormed into the villages and started searching the houses . It appears that someone fired at the police during the search , and that is when the massacre began . Brains in the grass : Those who somehow managed to reach Likosane and Chirez on Monday came across a sickening sight : in the bullet riddled houses lay the dead , surrounded by their family members in a deep state of shock . Four brothers of the Djelji family \u2013 Bechir , Nazmi , Bedri and Bekim were killed in their Chirez home . Muhamet Dzleja , 79 , his brother Naser and cousin Kadrid were apparently shot from close range , the photographs clearly showing gunpowder marks around the wounds . Dzemsir Nabihu and his pregnant wife Rukija had their heads blown off . Virtually all the victims were killed in their homes or just outside them . Some houses were hit by artillery , but reports that they had been torched and demolished fortunately turned out to be devoid of all truth . The worst fate befell the Ahmeti family of Likosani , the wealthiest in the village , as almost all its members were executed . Mirsije Ahmeti , 24 , who lost her father and three brothers , told Vreme that police stormed into their estate breaking through the gate with an armored vehicle at around four o'clock in the afternoon . \u201c My father shouted out that the door was open , but they shattered the windows and pointed their rifles at us . They told us to lie down on our fronts , put our hands behind our heads and locked us up in a small room . They took all the men out while we stayed locked until they left , \u201d Mirsije told Vreme 's reporter . When she and the other women got out , their men were nowhere to be seen . Traces of blood on the rocks near a bush led them to outside their estate , where the neighbors found bullet shells , dry blood on the ground , pieces of clothes , human bones and an entire human brain on a patch of grass . They sealed the area with a rope and let Vreme 's reporter take a look for himself . Ten dead members of the Ahmeti family between the age of 16 and 60 were delivered on Tuesday in the truck mentioned earlier . An individual who saw the bodies in the Pristina morgue said they looked \u201c pretty chewed up \u201d . \u201c They were alive when they left \u201d , Mirsije said in tears . Her cousin Dzevdet Ahmeti , 30 , who happened to be in Pristina over the weekend and fortunately avoided the fate of his relatives , said the police robbed their home of about 5,000 German marks ' worth of gold and foreign currency , ten kilos of meat and 200 eggs . They also took a satellite dish receiver and a car radio . \u201c I do n't understand these people \u201d , Dzevdet said with a strange calm in his voice . After they were done with the Ahmeti family , they moved into a neighboring house thinking it was abandoned . They were wrong , for 17 year old Nait N. ( the name has been changed for obvious reasons ) was hiding in the attic . \u201c I did n't see anything but I heard it all . I heard blows and screams outside the Ahmeti estate . Then I heard gun shots and the screams stopped \u201d , Nait said . He spent 27 hours in the attic , too afraid to move . The house he was hiding in was used by the police as a canteen in which they prepared food they took from the Ahmeti home . They ate , drank and sang all night . One climbed into the attic and peeped in , but he did n't see me . I was paralyzed with fear \u201d , Nait said . The Likosani villagers say that not a single member of the Ahmeti family was a terrorist . \u201c They were the only wealthy family in the village . They worked hard for their money , minded their own business and had good relations with everyone \u201d , one of the villagers said . Why were they killed then ? The villagers said the police saw someone run into the Ahmeti backyard , while a police source said the following : \u201c They shot at us from each and every house in the village . Our boys went wild . No one in the village would have survived if it were n't for orders from Belgrade to stop . \u201d Say hello to Gelbard : The ethnic Albanians of Likosani and Chirez believe there would have been far more casualties if it were n't for the UCK , whose reputation seems to have remained unstained after the latest events . \u201c They would have killed us all had there been no one to defend us \u201d , a villager said , and then answered our \u201c naive \u201d request for information on the whereabouts of the UCK and whether they would be willing to talk . \u201c Who do you think the UCK are and where do you think they came from ? Look around you , everything you see is the UCK \u201d , he said . The efforts by the Serbian regime to label the Likosani and Chirez victims as terrorists who got what they asked for will probably fail . \u201c Anti-terrorism , the way its done in the ' civilized world ' , does n't mean that suspects have no rights and that they should be shot on sight . We also have a problem with terrorism , but we apprehend our terrorists and give them a fair trial \u201d , a western diplomat said . \u201c Milosevic will have to bear the consequences of this action , but the immediate problem is that the western allies ca n't back their words by decisive action at the moment . The threat to bring back the sanctions is simply not enough \u201d , he added . The West , after all , should not feel completely innocent in this bloody drama . The Drenica incident occurred only days after US diplomat Robert Gelbard sharply condemned the UCK as a terrorist organization . Ethnic Albanian leaders feel this was tantamount to giving Milosevic the green light to order an onslaught , while many ethnic Albanians now tell western diplomats and reporters to \u201c give Gelbard their regards \u201d . The US administration now has to explain that encouraging Milosevic was not their intention . What happened last weekend will only widen the rift within the international community . Some of America 's European allies , not too fond of what they call US bulldozer diplomacy in the Balkans , are actually quite delighted that the US is now tangled up in the Kosovo mess , and they will most certainly look for a way to capitalize on any Washington error . There is a lot of evidence to suggest that the Drenica massacre was in fact a result of a cynical strategy . Serbian president Milan Milutinovic 's optimistic statements about the education agreement and the forthcoming visits of western diplomats to Belgrade could be a prelude to a \u201c Lex Specialis \u201d for Kosovo . Too bad there was no one to explain this to the dwellers of Likosani and Chirez , for they might have decided to spend the weekend somewhere else .","annotations":[{"text":"Tuesday , March 3rd","span":[16,34],"token_span":[4,7],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time is when the congregating occurs."},{"text":"over 50,000 people","span":[38,55],"token_span":[9,11],"role":"Individuals","label":"Individuals","role_definition":"The Individuals are self-movers who come together."},{"text":"on a hill in the village of Likosani near Drenica","span":[66,114],"token_span":[13,22],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place is where the congregating occurs."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"In this frame a group of Individuals meet to form a Configuration.","frame_ancestors":["Event"],"frame_descendants":["Assemble","Encounter"]},{"instance_id":"EN-1172-780-frame-Coming_to_be","frame":"Coming_to_be","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"Rivers flow out of the city , and on the banks spring up trees , covered in fruit for the healing of the nations .

The story begins with Adam and Eve 's first faltering steps as they leave the garden . The angel sends them forth , but one hand is raised in blessing : already we know how this \" divine comedy \" will end - in a new paradise . The New Testament door begins with Jesus ' baptism - the beginning of his active ministry , and , for every baptized person , the beginning of the Christian life . The New Testament door continues with the healing of the paralyzed man . Jesus not only cures the man 's physical infirmity ; he forgives his sins as well . Henn suggests this double healing in the figure of the man , who simultaneously steps from the stretcher carried by his two friends , and touches his heart . The figure just below who looks out at us and points boldly towards Jesus is the figure who , in that Gospel story , demands to know \" who but God alone can forgive sins ? \" That question , the artist suggested , is one that all seekers must ask as they come to the Cathedral . The journey continues with Christ 's triumphant entry into Jerusalem , where he is greeted with jubilation , people waving palm branches and shouting \" Hosanna ! \" The culmination of this human journey is depicted in the tympanum above the doors , which is a vision of the heavenly city using imagery from the book of Revelation . At the center of this city is Christ , the Lamb of God . Rivers flow from the city , and on the banks spring up trees , covered in fruit , full of life . Notice the angel in the upper right : where the first angel pointed the way out of paradise , this angel points the way to a new and greater paradise - through the Lamb of God . Henn also created four bronze doorstops for the Ceremonial Doors . The artist decided to dedicate these doorstops to the children of the Cathedral , and so created whimsical figures of saints and animals : a leaping fish with St. James , the patron of the Cathedral ; a crowing rooster with St. Peter , weeping ( le ft ) .

The Client Woolworths Limited is a major publicly listed trans - Tasman retail group , with more than 3,000 stores and 180,000 employees in New Zealand and Australia . Through its New Zealand business , Progressive Enterprises Limited , it is a significant player in the New Zealand grocery market . The Challenge A key business improvement focus for Woolworths over the past few years has been enhancing the integration of its own core IT systems with those of its Trade Partners , through Electronic Data Interchange ( EDI ) . It has also been deploying a web-based e-business portal called webforms . Webforms is a free online solution allowing Woolworths ' Trade Partners to receive Purchase Orders and then respond with purchase - order acknowledgments and electronic Invoices . The application has been introduced as an alternative to fax and email , allowing the company 's Trade Partners who may not be in a position to implement a full EDI process , to still access the benefits of electronic trading . In a bid to speed up Trade Partner uptake of these electronic trading options in New Zealand , Woolworths engaged B2BE , one of its Value - Added Network ( VAN ) providers with a New Zealand base , to undertake a 13 - week education project . This involved liaising with 943 of Woolworths ' New Zealand Trade Partners , to educate , encourage and assist as many of them as possible to make an early transition to webforms or EDI . Prior to the webforms / EDI engagement project , B2BE had a strong existing relationship with Woolworths and its New Zealand operation , Progressive , facilitating the connections for many of those Trade Partners already engaging in e-business with Progressive . This put B2BE in a good position to help Woolworths in its goals around uptake of e-business by its New Zealand Trade Partners . The Solution B2BE ran a campaign for Woolworths that involved contacting each Trade Partner several times . Initially B2BE tested the community 's preparedness for the changes using an online survey . Then , depending on responses , B2BE followed up via phone and email to all Trade Partners , directing them to a purpose - built B2BE web site . The site provided all the documentation Trade Partners needed along with a registration process . The registrations from the site were also integrated with the Woolworths TRM ( Trade Relationship Management ) system . Jason Steiner , Woolworths ' Senior Project Manager for e-business , says the key reason for engaging B2BE was the realisation that to get the most out of the project it would be best to use an organisation with strong e-business supplier engagement skills , with \u201c on - the - ground \u201d presence in New Zealand and expertise in Woolworths ' e-business solutions , as well as in VAN services in general . \u201c B2BE already had contact with the majority of our Trading Partners who were already connected with Progressive electronically . In addition , they had experience in previous e-business initiatives undertaken by Woolworths in the past , \u201d says Steiner . \u201c One of the challenges we faced was contacting the right person to liaise with on e-business issues within each Trade Partner organisation . This was an issue from a resourcing point of view if we were to do it in - house . We could have got on the phone and started contacting each organisations , but we realised it was more efficient and cost-effective to engage B2BE who could not only establish contact in the context of e-business but also provide expertise and guidance as a VAN should it be necessary \u201d says Steiner . \u201c We looked to employ expertise in a geography that 's in a different time - zone to our Australian headquarters , and where we do n't have our own significant in - house e-business expertise or resources to undertake such a task . \u201d He says Woolworths ' New Zealand Trade Partners vary significantly in the size of their businesses , and the IT and technical skills they have within their organisations . \u201c B2BE were in the ideal position to assist us , given they have a presence on the ground in New Zealand and could also add value , technically , to discussions with our Trade Partners about whether to go down the webforms or EDI route . \u201d The Result By the end of B2BE 's 13 - week campaign contacting and liaising with Woolworths ' 943 New Zealand Trade Partners , 361 had signed up to use the webforms platform and 67 others had opted to engage through EDI . More than 100 others had indicated their interest and intention to move to either webforms or EDI in the near future . This meant the result of the campaign was that of Woolworths ' potential e-business base , 48 per cent had signed up to the initiative within the campaign 's agreed time - frame , and 12 per cent were expected to do so in the very near future . \u201c When you look at the number of trading relationships transitioned to e-business from start to finish , I think it was an impressive outcome , \u201d says Steiner . \u201c We 're very happy with the results achieved . I do not think we would have been able to achieve the same result utilising our own resources alone . We definitely achieved what we set out to do . \u201d Further insights gained by B2BE into the e-business capabilities and preferences of the Woolworths ' Trade Partner base , during the course of the project , will enable Woolworths to progress most efficiently and effectively those yet to make an e-business transition , Steiner adds . \u201c We 've gathered key information to assist with this and future eBusiness initiatives , such as who the right contact is for e-business within the various Trade Partner organisations . Thus , we 're now well positioned for any follow - ups with those yet to sign - on . In addition , we are now able to conduct a discussion with the Trade Partner already aware of our e-business aspirations . \u201d One New Zealand - based Woolworths Trade Partner to sign up for webforms , as a result of the B2BE project , is organics products ' distributor Ceres Enterprises . Ceres distributes its range of dry goods through Progressive Enterprises ' supermarkets , typically supplying each store with between 200 and 300 lines of product . Ceres ' General Manager , David Josephson , says his company had previously been interacting with Progressive via email . \u201c Facilitating the changeover to e-business trading with Progressive was probably going to be out of our league without somebody like B2BE having the expertise to handle things as the go-between , \u201d Josephson says . \u201c Even though we had dabbled in the EDI side of things , to try and get e-business up and running , and to , eventually , consider moving towards a full EDI connection with Progressive , we needed somebody like B2BE to come in and assist us , \u201d he says . \u201d We have n't actually gone live with webforms yet , so have n't seen the benefits from that side . But we have definitely seen the benefits of working with B2BE . It 's certainly a lot easier dealing with somebody locally than it is trying to deal directly with a company based in Australia . \u201d And Josephson is also anticipating that significant benefits will flow through to Ceres ' operation when the company does go live with webforms in the near future . \u201c We get hundreds , if not thousands , of order lines through on a weekly basis which we currently have to manually key - in , so moving to an e-business platform will assist our operation greatly . \u201d For more information regarding Progressive , please visit www.progressive.co.nz or to find out more about B2BE and how they can help your organisation to reduce manual document processing and distribution visit www.b2be.com or contact B2BE","annotations":[{"text":"New Zealand","span":[478,488],"token_span":[94,95],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"Where the event takes place."},{"text":"Progressive Enterprises Limited","span":[501,531],"token_span":[98,100],"role":"Buyer","label":"Buyer","role_definition":"The Buyer wants the Goods and offers Money to a Seller in exchange for them."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"These are words describing a basic commercial transaction involving a Buyer and a Seller exchanging Money and Goods, taking the perspective of the Buyer.","frame_ancestors":["Getting","Event"],"frame_descendants":["Renting"]},{"instance_id":"EN-1480-243-frame-Commerce_pay","frame":"Commerce_pay","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"In the same year , Stavro repaid a $ 20 million loan that had been extended to Ballard in 1980 by Molson Brewery , which also owned the Leafs ' bitter rivals , the Montreal Canadiens .

From the team 's founding by Conn Smythe , through Harold Ballard and his Carlton St. Cashbox , to the Ontario Teachers ' Pension Plan , the history of the Leafs could be a course in how to make money by buying low and selling high . The once near- bankrupt franchise is the most valuable hockey team in the world and the cornerstone of a company worth well over a billion dollars . Consider the case of Charlie Querie . In 1927 , he had a chance to sell his money -losing Toronto St. Patricks to a consortium in Philadelphia for $ 200,000 , but was convinced by J.P. Bickell , one of his shareholders , that a hockey team was a matter of civic pride and it could n't leave town . Querie was talked into selling the team for less \u2014 $ 160,000 \u2014 to a consortium led by Conn Smythe . The World War I veteran changed the colours to blue and white from green and white , and the name of the team to the Maple Leafs , after the Maple Leaf Regiment . The team was n't much on the ice , but the owners kept busy off it . Smythe and Co. managed to buy a plot of land from the T. Eaton Co. Ltd. \u2014 at $ 150,000 below market price \u2014 and construction began on the $ 1.5 million Maple Leaf Gardens . Construction was partly funded through a public offering of preferred shares in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. at $ 10 each . Bickell \u2014 remember him ? \u2014 held on to his shares and became first president of Maple Leaf Gardens . From 1931 on , the Leafs made the Stanley Cup finals seven times in a nine - year span , but only won the trophy the first time . On Nov. 12 , 1931 , the Gardens opened . The Leafs lost 2 - 1 to the Chicago Blackhawks before an opening night crowd of 13,542 . They won the Stanley Cup that year and the Carlton St. Cashbox was born . Smythe held on to it until 1961 . That 's when he realized a tidy profit by selling nearly all his shares in Maple Leaf Gardens for $ 2.3 million to a partnership made up of his son Stafford Smythe , newspaper baron John Bassett and Toronto Marlboros president Harold Ballard . A decade later , Bassett sold his shares to Stafford Smythe and Ballard . In October 1971 , Smythe died . The next year all Smythe 's shares were purchased by Ballard . That left him with majority ownership of both the building and the Leafs . This was the darkest era for Leaf fans . The penny-pinching Ballard oversaw some of the team 's worst seasons and drove away its biggest names , like Dave Keon and Darryl Sittler . Wendel Clark kept the fans coming through the 1980s , a fan favourite who played on terrible teams . But the team was still making money and was still valuable . Ballard 's death on April 11 , 1990 laid the foundation for the future of the franchise . One of his executors , Steve Stavro , paid off a $ 20 million loan that Molson had been made to Ballard in 1980 . In return , Stavro was given an option to buy Gardens shares from Ballard 's estate . Molson sold its stake to Stavro in 1994 . The ownership of the team was unstable in the early 1990s . Curiously , on the ice the team performed better than it had in decades , with Doug Gilmour leading the Leafs deep into the playoffs in back - to - back seasons . Stavro and his partners \u2014 the TD Bank and the Ontario Teachers ' Pension Plan \u2014 eventually bought Ballard 's shares from the estate for $ 34 a share or $ 75 million in a controversial takeover . Stavro and his partners in MLG Ventures became the new owner of the Leafs and Maple Leaf Gardens . However , the courts later forced Stavro 's group to pay $ 23.5 million to charities listed as Ballard 's beneficiaries after a trial determined the charities had been shortchanged . In 1996 , Larry Tanenbaum bought a stake in MLG Ventures . The team missed the playoffs that year and the next . In 1998 , MLG Ventures took Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. private by buying out all minority shareholders . The two corporations amalgamated , becoming Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd . In February , MLG Ventures bought the Toronto Raptors and the $ 175 million Air Canada Centre , then under construction . Again the franchise , some say , got the land at below- market rates . A winner , however , has yet to develop . The Leafs have not made the playoffs since 2003 . The team has n't won a Stanley Cup since 1967 .","annotations":[{"text":"Steve Stavro","span":[2811,2822],"token_span":[565,566],"role":"Buyer","label":"Buyer","role_definition":"The Buyer has the Money and wants the Goods."},{"text":"$ 20 million","span":[2837,2848],"token_span":[571,573],"role":"Money","label":"Money","role_definition":"Money is the thing given in exchange for Goods in a transaction."},{"text":"loan","span":[2850,2853],"token_span":[574,574],"role":"Goods","label":"Goods","role_definition":"The role Goods is anything (including labor or time, for example) which is exchanged for Money in a transaction."},{"text":"Molson","span":[2860,2865],"token_span":[576,576],"role":"Seller","label":"Seller","role_definition":"The Seller has the Goods and wants the Money."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"This frame involves Buyers paying Money for Goods.","frame_ancestors":["Giving","Intentionally_act","Event","Lose_possession","Eventive_affecting"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-1222-23-frame-Commerce_sell","frame":"Commerce_sell","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"However , this upward trend may not last much longer as car sales continue to decline .

( F ) , founded in 1919 by Henry Ford , is a leader in the global automotive industry . Ford designs , manufactures , sells , and services a full line of cars , trucks , and utility vehicles . The company also offers a broad range of financial services to support car dealers and vehicle sales . The company currently is focused on boosting electric car production , mobility services , and self-driving technology . Ford has operations worldwide and employs about 186,000 people globally . Ford 's competitors include established automobile companies such as General Motors Co. ( GM ) and Japan - based Toyota Motor Corp . ( TM ) as well as newer entrants such as electric vehicle makers Tesla Inc. ( TSLA ) and China - based NIO Inc. ( NIO ) . Key Takeaways - Ford is an automotive company that sells cars , trucks , and sports utility vehicles . It also provides vehicle service and financing . - The vast majority of the company 's revenue comes from automotive sales . - Mobility is the smallest operating segment by revenue , but also the fastest-growing . - Ford Credit was the only operating segment to report positive earnings for the most recent quarter , as measured by earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) . - Ford announced in September 2021 a total of $ 11.4 - billion in investments in two U.S. sites that will focus on electric vehicle ( EV ) production and batteries . Ford 's Financials Ford 's most recent earnings report was for Q2 2021 , ended June 30 , 2021 . The company posted net income of $ 553 million , down substantially from net income of $ 1.1 billion for the prior- year quarter . Despite that , Ford reported company - wide adjusted earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) of $ 1.1 billion in Q2 2021 compared to adjusted EBIT of - $ 1.9 billion in the same quarter a year earlier . The company 's total revenue for Q2 2021 was $ 26.8 billion , up 38.1 % year - over - year ( YOY ) as sales began to recover from the major disruptions to the economy caused by the COVID - 19 pandemic beginning in early 2020 . Throughout the pandemic , Ford 's business has been negatively affected by production suspensions and the global semiconductor supply shortage . After suspending production at facilities around the world in March 2020 , Ford returned to normal production schedules in June of that year . Ford 's Business Segments Ford operates through three business segments : Automotive , Mobility , and Ford Credit . The company breaks out revenue and adjusted EBIT for each segment . EBIT is a measure of profitability calculated as revenue minus expenses excluding tax and interest . Additionally , Ford reports corporate governance expenses , interest income , and gains and losses from investments under a fourth category , Corporate Other , although this is not considered an operating segment . Automotive Ford earns the vast majority of its revenue by selling vehicles , service parts , and accessories around the world under the Ford and Lincoln brands . The automotive segment includes revenues and costs related to development , manufacture , distribution , service , and electrification vehicle programs . It also sells vehicles wholesale to dealers and distributors in five major geographical segments : North America , South America , Europe , China ( including Taiwan ) , and International Markets Group . With Q2 2021 revenues of $ 24.1 billion , Ford 's Automotive segment accounted for 90.2 % of revenues for Q2 2021 . Automotive revenues grew by 45.1 % YOY in that quarter , the second - fastest rate among Ford 's three operating segments . However , the Automotive segment reported a loss for Q2 2021 , measured by adjusted EBIT , of - $ 95 million . That was a dramatic improvement from - $ 2.1 billion EBIT in the same quarter a year earlier . For Q2 2021 , Ford 's adjusted EBIT for its Automotive business in North America and International Markets Group were each positive , while its adjusted EBIT for the Automotive operations in South America , Europe , and China were all negative . Combined , Automotive adjusted EBIT for South America , Europe , and China totaled - $ 493 million for the quarter . Mobility Ford 's Mobility segment includes development costs for the development and production of autonomous vehicles . It also includes Ford 's equity ownership of Argo AI , a developer of autonomous driving systems , and investments in Spin , a micro-mobility service provider . Mobility is the smallest of Ford 's segments by revenue . It generated just $ 21 million of revenue for Q2 2021 , or about 0.1 % of total quarterly revenue . It was the fastest-growing segment by revenue , tripling YOY for that period , though that growth was off of an extremely small base . Mobility reported adjusted EBIT of - $ 182 million for Q2 2021 , an improvement from - $ 286 million in the same quarter a year earlier . Ford Credit The Ford Credit segment is comprised of the company 's vehicle - related financing and leasing operations . The company offers a variety of automotive financing products to and through dealers worldwide . Most of the Ford Credit business involves financing of vehicles , supporting dealer operations , and lease contracts . Ford Credit posted quarterly revenue of $ 2.6 billion for Q2 2021 , or roughly 9.7 % of total revenues . This figure was down by 5.0 % YOY , making Ford Credit the only one of the company 's operating segments to see declining revenues YOY for the quarter . Despite that , Ford Credit generated adjusted EBIT of $ 1.6 billion in Q2 2021 , nearly tripling YOY , as it benefited from the rebound in vehicle sales compared to a year earlier . It was the only operating segment to report positive adjusted EBIT in the quarter . During the quarter , Ford Credit benefited from an historically low loss-to -receivables ( LTR ) ratio , which reflects low losses and strong net recoveries . Ford Credit 's U.S. auction values also were 39 % higher than a year ago , reflecting robust demand for used cars . Ford 's Recent Developments Under the leadership of Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Jim Farley since fall of 2020 , Ford has heavily prioritized electric vehicles and related technologies . In May 2021 , the company announced that it aimed to be a leader in electric vehicles and connected services . Ford anticipates that 40 % of its global vehicle volume will be fully electric by 2030 and plans to spend more than $ 30 billion on electrification and battery development by 2025 . On Sept. 27 , 2021 , Ford announced a series of steps to increase its electric vehicle technology and production . Ford will create a 6 - square - mile campus in Tennessee to build the next generation of F-Series electric pickup trucks and advanced batteries . Ford also will build twin battery plants in Kentucky . The company plans to invest $ 11.4 billion in the two sites , creating about 11,000 new jobs . Also in September , the company announced a partnership with retail giant Walmart Inc. ( WMT ) and Argo AI to launch an autonomous vehicle delivery service in select markets in the U.S. The service aims to use Ford self - driving vehicles to deliver Walmart orders to customers . This launch is an early effort in what Ford describes as \" large - scale autonomous vehicle operations across a broad footprint of U.S. cities . \"","annotations":[{"text":"Ford Motor Co.","span":[0,13],"token_span":[0,2],"role":"Seller","label":"Seller","role_definition":"The Seller has possession of the Goods and exchanges them for Money from a Buyer."},{"text":"worldwide","span":[452,460],"token_span":[83,83],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"Where the event takes place."},{"text":"cars","span":[818,821],"token_span":[152,152],"role":"Goods","label":"Goods","role_definition":"The role Goods is anything (including labor or time, for example) which is exchanged for Money in a transaction."},{"text":"trucks","span":[825,830],"token_span":[154,154],"role":"Goods","label":"Goods","role_definition":"The role Goods is anything (including labor or time, for example) which is exchanged for Money in a transaction."},{"text":"sports utility vehicles","span":[838,860],"token_span":[157,159],"role":"Goods","label":"Goods","role_definition":"The role Goods is anything (including labor or time, for example) which is exchanged for Money in a transaction."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"These are words describing basic commercial transactions involving a buyer and a seller exchanging money and goods, taking the perspective of the seller.","frame_ancestors":["Giving","Intentionally_act","Event","Lose_possession","Eventive_affecting"],"frame_descendants":["Renting_out"]},{"instance_id":"EN-1447-823-frame-Committing_crime","frame":"Committing_crime","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"Perpetrator Jiverly Antares Wong ( born Linh Phat Vuong , ; December 8 , 1967 \u2013 April 3 , 2009 ) , a resident of Johnson City , New York , was identified as the perpetrator .","annotations":[{"text":"Jiverly Antares Wong ( born Linh Phat Vuong","span":[12,54],"token_span":[1,8],"role":"Perpetrator","label":"Perpetrator","role_definition":"The individual that commits a Crime."}],"trigger":{"text":"perpetrator","start_char":161,"end_char":171,"start_token":35,"end_token":35,"frame":"Committing_crime"}},"source":{"text":"The first time he feared for his son 's sanity was in the fall of 1990 . Sitting alone , Henry Voong and his son Jiverly Wong , were having a conversation outside their home on Baker Street in Johnson City . Sprinkled into their father - son conversation was terror from the mouth of a 22 - year - old man . Wong told his father someone was trying to kill him . \" They 're in front of me and trying to capture me , \" Wong told his father , pointing to the empty air before them . Voong quickly realized his son was not joking and decided to take him to the hospital . Wong went willingly to escape his supposed captors . The family of six had been in the United States for about five months and only Henry Voong spoke English , broken at best . Voong said he realizes now that communicating with the doctors was unclear . After two hours , the doctors told Voong there was nothing wrong with his son and they sent him home . Nineteen years later , Voong and his wife wonder if the incident was a sign .

That incident 19 years ago is the only time they witnessed such erratic behavior or sought treatment for him . Wong 's paranoia did not surface publicly again until April 6 , when a letter written by Wong arrived at News 10 Now in Syracuse . The letter came three days after Wong opened fire at the American Civic Association in Binghamton , killing 13 people and then himself . Wong wrote how undercover police officers taunted him , tortured him and spread rumors about him wherever he went . Voong said he has never seen any officers calling or visiting his son . Why Wong did what he did remains a mystery , especially to the people who lived with him for nearly the last two years . His parents say he did not have any friends and rarely spoke to anyone . To them , he lived a quiet , nearly silent existence for the last 19 years . According to his father , that silence deepened two weeks before the shooting . Wong stopped eating dinner , stopped watching television and rarely emerged from behind his bedroom door . The letter Wong sent to News 10 Now was dated March 18 , a little more than two weeks before the shooting . \" He avoided being in the house at the same time with me , \" Voong said . \" At first , I thought maybe he was mad about something and was planning to ask him . This tragedy occurred before I even had a chance to ask him . \" Voong and Thong are trying to piece together the last few weeks -- even the last few years -- to find an answer to the question so many have : why ? \" All parents raise their children to be good human beings , \" Voong said . \" You never imagine in your wildest dreams that they would end up doing something so horrific . \" The couple contacted The Post-Standard on Thursday because they wanted to apologize to the Binghamton community and all those affected by their son 's actions . \" We are deeply sorry for our son 's actions , \" Voong said . \" Our family sincerely apologize to the victims ' families and ask for their forgiveness . \" The early days The Voong family moved to Binghamton from Vietnam in June 1990 . While ethnically Chinese , the Voongs said they left Saigon with the help of a program that assisted former South Vietnamese soldiers and political prisoners who were jailed after the Vietnam War ended . Voong served as a captain in the South Vietnamese Army . In the early 1990s , Voong said , his wife and their four children spent a lot of time together . Wong , the second oldest , would have been about 22 years old and spoke little to no English when the family moved to the Binghamton area . His parents say he often joked with his siblings during those early days . The family shared meals and often watched television together . \" We always stuck together because we were afraid we might get lost in our new surroundings , \" Voong said . Many members of the Vietnamese community in Binghamton fondly recall Voong during that time . Diep Nguyen says Voong helped many new immigrants by translating and taking them to school or a doctor appointment . \" The Voongs are a good family and always willing to help others , \" Nguyen said . \" Their son ( Wong ) kept to himself and rarely interacted with the Vietnamese community . \" About a year after settling in the states , Wong moved out of his parents ' home into a nearby apartment by himself . He worked at Felchar Manufacturer in Binghamton , a company that makes electric motors and power cords . Less than a year after that , Wong moved to California . In many ways Voong and Thong say , that was the last time they saw their son . A new name in California Binghamton police say Wong became an American citizen in November 1995 and left the country shortly after . Wong 's passport records , according to Binghamton police , say he returned to Los Angeles on Dec. 25 , 1999 , from Tokyo . Police say he was married and divorced in California but they have not disclosed the woman 's name has not been reported . Wong 's parents say they have no idea if any of that information is true . \" I do n't know anything about his life in California , \" Voong said . \" Something must of have happened there . \" During the nearly 15 years he spent in California , Wong rarely kept in touch with his family . He never visited or sent letters . His phone calls were few and short and he refused to share a mailing address . Mail addressed to their son occassionally arrived at the family 's Binghamton home . Voong recalls opening a piece addressed to Jiverly Wong , which was different from his son 's given name of Linh Phat Voong . \" He must have changed his name after he got his citizenship , \" Voong said . \" I was very angry because it 's our family name . He ca n't just change our family name . \" Back to the Southern Tier After years of nearly total silence , Jiverly Wong called his father in 2007 and told him he had lost his job as a truck driver in California . He asked his father if he could come home . Voong said he was upset about not hearing from his son for so long , but welcomed him home . Voong said the man who arrived at their house nearly two years ago , was not the same person who left 15 years earlier . He soon got a job working the 3 - to - midnight shift at the Shop-Vac plant in Endicott . Voong said he and his wife and their daughter Milline rarely saw or interacted with Wong , especially since everyone worked different shifts . Wong was more quiet . He did n't have any friends and he did n't make or receive any telephone calls . He never wore short sleeves , even in the summer . He spent most of his time in his bedroom , but did n't make much noise . He always emerged from the bathroom after a shower fully clothed in long sleeves and pants . Voong said his son kept to himself and spent most of his free time out of the house . About a year ago , Voong said Wong slapped his youngest sister Milline , 35 , who also lives with them , across the face during an argument . He said he did n't know what the argument was about but it was the only time he can recall his son being physically abusive . The only other time Voong can recall his son having a temper was a time when Wong raised his voice to his father several months ago . Voong asked Wong to move a portable heater away from their leather couch . In a raised voice , Voong said , \" Dad , you 're just being difficult . \" Life after the layoff In November 2008 , Wong told his parents he had been laid off from Shop - Vac . While out of work , Wong told his parents he was going to take classes to improve his English at the American Civic Association . Whenever he left the house , Wong said he was going to the library to use the computer . He checked out movies about animals . Posters and calendars of owls , cats , dogs and birds hung in his room . \" He liked animals , \" Voong said . \" He had a fish bowl with a fish in it . He liked watching ' Animal Planet ' and other channels showing animals ... I never saw him watch anything else . \" Voong and Thong say they know little else of the man who lived down the hall for more than a year . Voong said he never saw his son with a handgun , knew he owned one or heard him talk about going to a shooting range . Voong said he knew that his son owned an air rifle , which is similar to a BB gun . He also said he had never seen the room or setting in the photos of Wong holding guns that were sent to News 10 Now . The day of the shooting About noon on April 3 , Voong said , he was at work when co-workers began talking about \" an Asian guy shooting on Front Street by the American Civic Association . \" Voong was worried . His son took classes at the center . At their home on Taylor Street in Johnson City , Thong said she was sleeping that Friday when a police officer knocked on their door about 11 a.m . The officer told Thong something about a car being parked at the American Civic Association but she could not understand much because she speaks very little English . She asked the officer to wait until her husband got home from work since his English is stronger . The officer waited at the house until Voong arrived home between 3 and 4 p.m . Voong said he was surprised to see several Binghamton police cars at his house and immediately believed something had happened to Wong at the center . Police brought Voong , Thong and their daughter to the police station for questioning . Police spoke with the family for nearly four hours without a translator . Shortly before wrapping up the interview at about 8 p.m. , police told Wong 's parents that their son had died . Vong says they never explained his role in the shooting . Upset by the news of their son 's death , Voong and Thong returned home but did not watch any news , which by nearly that time included the name of the alleged shooter : Jiverly Wong . Voong and Thong said they learned of their son 's role in the shooting by reading Saturday 's newspaper . \" We were horrified and we could n't believe it , \" Voong said . \" I never suspected that my son would be dead . I especially never thought he would be a killer . \" Even family members in Vietnam heard about the shooting and called the family . Wong 's 91 - year- old paternal grandmother cried and could n't believe her grandson 's actions , according to Voong . Moving forward For more than a week , reporters from across the country have set up shop on the family 's street , in their front yard and on their answering machine . Voong and Thong say they are living in a constant state of fear and devastation . They are afraid to go out in public and have not yet returned to their jobs in assembly work . They say they cannot eat and have a hard time sleeping through the night . They fear retaliation from the victims ' families or anyone in the community . To their surprise , Voong and Thong say they have received more than 50 cards and dozens of many cards and floral arrangements supporting them and offering their sympathy and food at their doorstep . They say they are surprised and feel grateful . \" I thank members of the community who have been so kind and understanding , \" Voong said . \" Still , I am very worried about possible retaliation from some folks . We 're just two old parents who had no control over their 41 - year - old son 's actions .

The precise landscape may differ between France and the United States , for example , but common trends emerge regarding their use in science and academia . Certain disciplines , for instance , are more active on social networks than others . Which research fields benefit the most from scientific social networks , and why ? Which available tools are the most useful for scientific research ? The future evolution of such networks is uncertain , but the utility they offer to researchers is worth a second look . The following presents a view from France on the social networks currently available and their use among scientists . This article is part of our dossier on Scientific Social Networks and was translated from the French by Abby Tabor . Social networks allow us to extend the reach of our influence and to exchange with others , well beyond the few people making up our private circle and the colleagues that we cross paths with each day . This sphere of close contact can be extended to included even acquaintances that we see only rarely , due to the distance that separates us , for example . But social networks also put us in contact with all kinds of people that we would never have met by way of a common interest , a mutual friend , or anything else . Similarly , scientists generally work individually or within a small research team . But it is rare that the isolated work of a scientist is not part of a national or even international collaboration . In academic studies and scientific research , the benefit of social networks for bringing together scientists and institutions seems obvious , given their ability to extend our sphere of contact and exchange . However , until now , social media have been adopted by only a minority of scientists ; their systems of exchange , via specialist conferences or international publications , do not evolve readily . It seems that the benefits of social media vary according to the discipline . In social sciences , digital technologies have already modified practices , including the digitization of databases or the digital and cartographic analysis of data . Blogs and social networks , tools that are more than necessary in these disciplines , are expanding rapidly . Research Logs for Historians In an article for the blog Homo Numericus , Pierre Mounier , a professor at France 's School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences ( EHESS ) and associate director of the Center for Open Electronic Publishing at Revues.org , looks back at the symposium \u201c In the Web of Social Media : New Means of Communication and Publication for the Human and Social Sciences \u201d , held at the German Historical Institute of Paris . Pierre Mounier analyzes the use of social media by historians . Through his experience with hypotheses.org , an academic blogging platform , he shows that research logs allow historians both to structure their work \u2013 in this way , the research log is an integral part of the work of the researcher \u2013 and to communicate internally ( with colleagues ) as well as externally ( i.e. popularization ) . The log allows historians to share their literature review , comments on their readings , hypotheses , results \u2026via a flexible and personalized tool . They are , thus , free to use the log as they see fit . They do , however , take a risk in revealing all the steps of the research process : their drafts , reflections , and raw data . Social Networks for Environmental Sciences The journal VertigO , a French -language electronic journal of environmental sciences , in open access , conducted a poll on scientific social networks from November 2009 to January 2010 . 159 French speakers and 23 English speakers responded to questions about what they expected from scientific social networks and their opinion of existing networks . The vast majority of respondents were in the field of environmental sciences , due simply to the mailing lists used for the diffusion of the poll . This preliminary study showed that the principal uses of a social network in the scientific world are collaborations and information searches . In addition , although the survey respondents seemed unconvinced by the networks currently available , they expressed interest in joining an open , multidisciplinary professional social network , involving many different participants . And , in spite of having little time to devote to it , respondents stated that they would be ready to contribute to the content of such a network and to share information . In exchange , they expected an active network , led by dynamic community managers , providing quality content . Social Media by Discipline and by Academic Field There are already several networks for social sciences ( SAGE , hypotheses.org ) offering a variety of tools : research logs , discussion forums , blogs , resources , event calendars , sharing of documents and the literature review \u2026 Information and communication sciences also bring together numerous social media players , as do the fields of scientific and technical culture ( Knowtex ) and science and art ( Bamboo , Artscience Factory , ArtScience Labs . ) In these disciplines , the interest of social media is acknowledged and these tools have been widely adopted . For the so- called hard sciences , similar networks have already become established in the English -speaking research world ( Research Gate , colwiz , Academia.edu ) , albeit with a limited reach . In France , while some initiatives have recently emerged , it seems that the hard sciences do not view social media with the same interest as social or communication sciences . Very specialized media , like the bibliographic tools Mendeley and Zotero , have seen the greatest success , their interest being , above all , individual and , only secondarily , collective . Aggregators of scientific blogs are also successful ( C@f\u00e9 des sciences in French , ScienceBlogging , ResearchBlogging , Science Blogs , and others in English ) , but it seems that the demand among readers for such blogs is greater than scientists ' need to maintain them . Universities ' own social networks have appeared in recent years ( Carnets 2 at the University of Paris Descartes ) . Even if these networks are supported by universities , and instructors and researchers remain their most sought after participants , it is the students , recent graduates and young researchers , for the most part , who bring them to life . The social tools used on these university networks are also different from those used in research ( for example , e-learning ) . In conclusion , social and communication tools have not been adopted in the same way by all scientific fields . Certain tools ( blogs , research logs , bibliographic tools \u2026 ) appear to have greater success than others ( e.g. forums ) . But , although a majority of scientists are in favor of scientific and professional social networks , they may still view them as too time consuming . Several initiatives are currently in development in the world of research , but it is not yet clear whether they will be adopted to varying degrees by different groups , or if a network will emerge in a way common to all scientific disciplines .

Chol 's viral YouTube hit , ' Take U to Da Movies ' featured on The Tonight Show 's ' Do Not Play ' segment and was mocked by host and narrator Steve Higgins . The track fuelled global discussion , but why ? Was Fallon simply making fun of a Sudanese migrant for poorly mirroring US culture ? Or is it possible Ur Boy is at the beginning of the next movement in art history ? ' Take U to Da Movies ' went viral in 2009 , and like many other YouTube hits it briefly pushed its creator into the public eye . The video launched a kind of fad music career for Chol , with the rapper even performing at the 2010 Melbourne Big Day Out . The track is confusing from an artistic standpoint , as it parodies US gangsta rap culture while looking like a serious attempt at creating rap music . ' Take U to Da Movies ' upholds the egocentric rap aesthetic , yet the subject ( Ur Boy taking a girl to the movies , paying for the popcorn and so on ) is endearing and oddly polite . The lyricism along with the absurdity of the video ( Bangs performs in front of green-screened JPEG images of city skylines , expensive cars , Australian cash and so on ) could be the reason for its traction online . However , it is difficult to discern exactly what factors are pushing the clip repeatedly into the limelight . Most of Chol 's other music videos appear to be less outwardly ironic . For example , ' Better Place ' is about the reputation of Sudanese people in Australia , and ' I 'm Going to the Ghetto ' examines Chol 's experience living in this country : Let me tell you the truth , but do n't get me wrong I 'm not happy in this country at all I want to go back to where I 'm from , which is my home I do n't know why I 'm here These tracks are more serious , though they share same raw production values as ' Take You to Da Movies . The Sudanese - Australian videographer Ez Eldin Deng shot many of them . The two met in 2004 at the Western English Language School in Braybrook , Victoria , and have been collaborating since . Like many other viral videos , the success of ' Take U to Da Movies ' had an accidental element . Deng explained , ' It was an experiment ; I wanted to work out how green screen [ also known as chroma key compositing , a post-production filmmaking technique ] worked , and Bangs had the idea for the images . I did n't know anything about YouTube . ' Deng felt the popularity of ' Take U to Da Movies ' was due to its simplicity . ' There is no technology where I come from and I wanted to do something simple , something people could relate to . Some people find it funny and some just try to work out how we did it . ' ' Take U to Da Movies ' appearing on The Tonight Show created something of media frenzy in Australia and online . In the days following , Chol released a response in the form of a diss track entitled , ' Ur Boy Bangz \u2013 Response to Jimmy Fallon \u2013 Do Not Watch ' . It is difficult to tell if Chol is actually offended or if it 's an elaborate joke at Fallon 's expense . Following the online release of the diss track , Chol then participated in a number of radio and television appearances , including interviews with ABC Radio National , Ten 's Studio 10 and SBS Radio . These appearances and countless online articles were supportive of the rapper 's encounter with The Tonight Show , though were also extremely patronising . The public reaction makes you wonder if this is just another example of humanity 's inherent cruelty when it comes rejoicing the perceived failure of others . And , for the record , the other side of the Fallon 's mean-spirited coin is the condescending praise given by so many media outlets ; ABC RN Drive 's Patricia Karvelas was kind to Chol , but at times it appeared as if she was talking to a child . The media reception is indicative of an outdated thinking on the way art is created \u2013 that is , if it does n't share the qualities of something known to be successful , critically or otherwise , then it is trivial and not worthy of respect . Are the reactions of Fallon and the media just an extension of angry white male syndrome , a kind of nostalgia for the past when everything made sense and a community understood why something was being discussed and shared around ? The truth is that it does n't matter if you think ' Take U to Da Movies ' is a good example of rap music or not . It does n't matter if it was intended as a parody or if it was meant to be serious ( or somehow both ) . There is no longer a point in discerning the intention of a creator in the post-postmodern world . What is important is working out why one music video speaks to a global audience and countless others fall through the cracks . It is not arbitrary . My guess is that what Ajak Chol and Ez Eldin Deng are doing resonated because it represents a new honesty in art , a realness that 's far from the egotistical laughter of a talk show host that modern culture is likely to leave behind . There are now audiences for artworks that would usually be rejected due to dated notions on what art is . An example is the art / music style , Vaporwave , which emerged early this decade . Vaporwave is characterised by a preoccupation with an 80s and 90s yuppie aesthetic . The music typically involves extensive sampling of lounge and muzak from the 1970s onwards . In a sarcastic video ' How To Make Vaporwave ' , YouTuber Frank Jav Cee describes the music as ' basically 80s elevator / infomercial music digitally slowed down with effects . ' Vaporwave appears almost exclusively on the internet and functions as both a critique and embrace of consumer capitalism . It epitomises post-irony and ambivalence in modern culture , and it rejects most of the technical standards of traditional and contemporary art . Irrespective of how this music is being formally reviewed , it has a wide , growing audience online \u2013 and like Ur Boy Bangs , it warrants acknowledgement of its being more than just a failed artistic attempt . ' In that moment , poetry will be made by everyone , and there will be emus in the zone , ' says Chris Marker in his complex video-essay , Sans Soleil . The film is pieced together from decades of travel videography , where each shot functions as a memory or an unconscious moment in time . Marker 's film was created in a way that appeared both intentional and accidental . ' Take U to Da Movies ' lacks the technical expertise of traditional and mainstream art ; however , it captures a vulnerability that 's almost impossible to recreate in traditional art forms . Like Sans Soleil , ' Take U to Da Movies ' achieved this both consciously and by mistake . The YouTube hit was , in the truest creative spirit , an experiment by two Sudanese - Australians to learn about new technology and online platforms . The idea of the trained and self - aware artist is being dismantled . The internet is ushering in a new age unrestricted by craft and fixed notions about what art is .

Mee ; Scenes by Charles Mee & Jessie Bear ; Choreography by Jonathan Matthews Produced by This Is Not A Theatre Company Off Off Broadway , Immersive Theatre Runs through 11.20.15 Undisclosed NYC apartment by Stephen Kaplan on 10.11.15 Jonathan Matthews with rubber ducks in Versailles 2015 . Photo by June Xie . BOTTOM LINE : Be a guest at a very exclusive invite - only party ( spanakopita and pretzels included ) . One of the great things about any immersive theatre experience is that it immediately throws you into a situation where your senses are heightened and every experience is suddenly called into question \u2014 is that part of the show ? Is that an actor ? Is that supposed to be happening ? This Is Not a Theatre Company 's ( TINATC ) new production , Versailles 2015 , does exactly this in a delightful and provocative manner . 24 hours prior to the performance , audience members are emailed the address to an apartment where we are to attend a party hosted by TINATC 's founder and co-artistic director Erin B. Mee ( played by Mee herself ) . It seems as if the party is an opportunity to view TINATC 's commission of a bathtub dance piece , also entitled Versailles 2015 , by choreographer - dancer Jonathan Matthews ( the incredibly agile , focused , goofy and death-defying \u2014 bathtubs are slippery , after all \u2014 Matthews , playing himself ) . Greeted in the lobby by Erin 's \u201c niece , \u201d Judy ( Caitlin Goldie ) , the rules of the party are explained \u2014 only a few party - goers at a time will be able to fit into her aunt 's bathroom to watch the dance piece , but there are some snacks and beverages to nosh on while we wait our turn ; shoes will be left at the door ( hospital fabric booties are provided for anyone who 'd like them ) ; and this is not Sleep No More , so please refrain from opening up any drawers or rifling through her aunt 's stuff . We are then brought up in an elevator and , after shedding our shoes , enter the apartment where the party is already in progress . It 's a huge credit to all involved how effective this first \u201c scene \u201d is . While some audience members may be gung - ho to jump into any type of experience , many may be resistant and nervous and , from the moment we enter , we are made to feel welcome and comfortable . Though I was fully aware of the artifice of the party , it genuinely felt like many NYC parties I 've attended and I found myself , as did the other audience members , relaxing into the situation and making the usual get-to -know - you small talk , unsure of whether or not I was talking to a genuine guest or an actor playing a guest . In fact , I actually was duped and had a lovely conversation with a guest that I did not realize until later was actually an actress in the piece . But the fact that this amused rather than annoyed me speaks directly to the ingratiating tone of the overall piece itself . As we wait to be brought into the bathroom , we are also masterfully spirited away and divided into smaller groups of 4 or 5 to witness additional moments in the other rooms of the apartment : a rant on the unifying powers of gourmet food ( in the kitchen ) ; a discussion about the history of the neighborhood where the apartment sits as well as the preponderance of plays set in living rooms ( knowingly and ironically taking place in the living room ) ; a saga of the near death of an English bulldog ( in the bedroom ) . Simultaneously , videographer Stefan Hartmann 's collected footage of global crises streams unobtrusively on a TV or i Pad screen casually left on in the various rooms . This juxtaposition of images of struggling refugees and angry demonstrations alongside the innocuous minutiae that the characters obsess over points to the overall theme of the evening ( as does the play 's and the performance - piece - within - the - play 's title , directly referencing the opulence of Louis XIV and a life of excess ) . But Charles Mee and Jessie Bear 's script does not go the obvious route of simply mocking these partygoers and their 1 % lives \u2014 we are meant to connect with them , for it is very recognizably our lives as well ( the play 's final argument is that anyone working in the arts or able to take the time to spend an evening seeing theatre is living a privileged life \u2026 and we are ) . The text runs a seamless line between the exquisite poetry and mind - numbing humdrumness of our often devastatingly mundane lives and is often so heavy - handed in its heavy - handedness that it lulls rather than grates . Ms. Mee 's cast of charming young actors appealingly rides this line beautifully . They effortlessly deliver the moments of heightened language while making it appear improvisational and natural . They all seem like people I know . It 's a credit to the direction and performances that as much as we may want to roll our eyes at their superficiality , we do n't . We smile and recognize them . They work seamlessly as an ensemble , even when performing solo in a kitchen or bathroom , and are so at ease in the contradiction of their roles as party - goers and actors that I half expected them to continue exiting with us as we descended back in the elevator and out into the lobby at the play 's end . The evening is best summed up by Goldie 's lovingly shallow Judy as she stares at her reflection in a mirror and reveals an aching depth , disclosing , \u201c If my world never gets bigger than this , than me sitting in this bathroom and plucking my eyebrows , that would be just fine , just a-ok with me , that would actually be perfection . Because I 'm a person right now , at this moment . I am a person sitting in a bathroom and that 's really , really all I want in the world . \u201d Amidst the countless atrocities that confront us every day , at our core we are all struggling to find the naked honesty in our own lives \u2014 the person staring back at us from our bathroom mirror and to be \u201c a- ok . \u201d Versailles 2015 allows us the time to contemplate this in its characters and in ourselves .

The committee members highlighted that Metro and Kawasaki \u2014 the manufacturer of the rail cars \u2014 have been aware of the wheel alignment issues that ultimately caused problems since 2017 , and had been working on ways to address the issue since then . They requested Metro provide the committee with a detailed timeline of actions , reports and records relating to the 7000 - series cars ' wheel safety issues . The letter asked Metro to provide a detailed timeline of all actions taken regarding wheel issues with the 7000 - series trains . This included correspondence with Kawasaki or other suppliers of rail car parts related to the wheel assembly issue , and any analysis of safety risks posed by the assembly , Metro or other outside consultants . Finally , the senators asked that Metro provide full details on the cost incurred by the problems surrounding the faulty wheel assembly on the 7000 - series rail cars . A Metro spokeswoman told WTOP the transit agency has received the committee 's letter and appreciate its oversight . \u201c We are reviewing their request and look forward to submitting a timely response , \u201d Metro spokeswoman Sherri Ly said . An analysis of the Blue Line derailment on Oct. 12 , 2021 by the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) found that the incident had the potential to lead to death and injury of riders . No major injuries were reported following the derailment , though one person was transported to a nearby hospital . Metro pulled all 7000 - series trains in the wake of the incident , leading to a major reduction in service , as the newer rail cars represented a majority of the transit agency 's fleet . Older 2000 - and 3000 - series cars were returned to the system to help mitigate delays , but Metro admitted that normal service would not resume until the 7000 - series trains are able to return to the tracks . To that end , they submitted a plan to have the wheel assemblies tested regularly in order to detect any amount of shift between the axle and the wheels that could cause a derailment . Once the trains do begin returning to tracks , Wiedefeld warned Thursday that they would be brought back gradually , and that normal operating status for the transit system would not return overnight .","annotations":[{"text":"Four senators","span":[0,12],"token_span":[0,1],"role":"Communicator","label":"Communicator","role_definition":"The person who uses language in the written or spoken modality to convey a message to another person."},{"text":"Metro 's general manager","span":[38,61],"token_span":[7,10],"role":"Addressee","label":"Addressee","role_definition":"The person that receives the message from the Communicator."},{"text":"requesting updates on where the investigations into an issue with 7000 - series rail cars that caused a train to derail in October currently stand","span":[63,208],"token_span":[11,35],"role":"Communication","label":"Communication","role_definition":"The information that the Communicator wishes to impart to the Addressee, often to get a particular response.

In The Hairy Bikers ' Food Tour of Britain , BBC TWO early Autumn , Si and Dave are back on their bikes , sampling the best of British fare from across the isles . There are 86 counties in the British Isles and the Bikers have covered 30 of them , from Aberdeenshire to Cornwall , Fermanagh to Norfolk , north to south , west to east . Covering 15,000 miles in their culinary tour of Britain 's counties , they meet the locals and learn about how the land and the produce has informed the way we eat . In each episode , the Hairies will taste that county 's ' signature dish ' . They visit local food producers and hunt for their ingredients before cooking the county 's traditional favourite on location in front of an audience of locals . The crowd are then invited to sample the food and pass their verdicts . The boys are then pushed outside their comfort zone as they face a cook - off against some of each county 's best chefs to create a unique dish using local produce that typifies the county . Not used to cooking in the kitchens of fine- dining restaurants , the Bikers need all the help they can get to find inspiration and source their ingredients . Dave says : \u201c We have gone head - to - head in cook - offs with some of the best and most respected chefs in the country , often Michelin-starred . Then we do a blind tasting for local food enthusiasts . It 's good fun and challenging \u2013 and when the victor is announced there are a few surprises ! \u201c What we 've found is that food in Britain is going bonkers . People are more concerned now with what they 're eating . To research each recipe , we set off and find two or three local food heroes : for example , there is a lady in Herefordshire who comes from generations of producers of berries used for Ribena . Now they are using the blackcurrants to make cassis which rivals the French . We also visited England 's leading escargot producer in Herefordshire and the finest Welsh charcuterie in Monmouthshire . In East Sussex we visit RidgeView vineyards with a sparkling wine to rival the best champagne in the world . \u201c We source salt marsh lamb , scallops from Rye , oysters from Colchester , mutton producers from Dumfries and Galloway , oats from a mill in Alford in Aberdeenshire , mussels in Anglesey . We see some stunning beef . Everyone loves steak and chips and native British beef is a true treasure we ca n't ignore . \u201d Si laughs : \u201c We have had some real food epiphanies : asparagus in Evesham , picked from the ground at the very start of the season and then cooked on a griddle with salt and pepper . Completely delicious . At Ormskirk in Lancashire we dug up new potatoes and cooked them there and then . Amazing . At Goosenaugh we saw corn- fed ducks and chickens , supplied to top chefs like the Roux Brothers and Marcus Wareing , all buying from a man in Lancashire . \u201d He continues : \u201c We 've spent two - and - a- half years going around the world investigating other people 's cultures . We wanted to get back to our roots and celebrate the food culture we have in Britain . It 's just as much an exploration of wonderment for us as it is for the viewers to discover all these local foods . There are some amazing cultural dishes in the UK that have been cooked for hundreds of years that have nearly been forgotten about . We want to revive those great old recipes . Have you heard of Shropshire 's fidget pie , for instance ? It 's based around gammon and cooking apples with potatoes , sage and onions . Delicious . We 've discovered lots of great dishes like that . \u201d David adds : \u201c In Cornwall , we made proper Cornish pasties at the Eden project ; we have made Malvern pudding , Cheshire cheese soup in the jaguar house at Chester Zoo ; Cullen Skink soup in Moray . In Scarborough we made my mum 's Yorkshire pudding with Si 's mam 's gravy ; in Wales we made Carmathenshire cockles , laver bread and Welsh salty bacon ; in Somerset we cooked Somerset chicken , a traditional dish heavy with apples . These are dishes born out of the land and generations of cooks perfecting the recipes . \u201d Simon hopes the series will give local producers a well deserved boost and convince shoppers there is good value to be found outside major supermarkets : \u201c It 's a simple equation . The more we buy from local producers , the more successful they will be . We need more market - places \u2013 and they can be in supermarkets \u2013 where artisan producers can sell . That 's how it should be , with your local supermarket selling local farmers ' meat , dairy produce , eggs and bread . And if the producer can produce more it will get cheaper . \u201d David adds : \u201c The British can and do produce some of the best products in the world . We hope that the series will be really inspirational for anyone remotely interested in food - let 's get out there and feast ! \u201d Si concludes : \u201c British people really know and care about their food , there is a real pride and many regional treasures to uncover . We 've had great craic , great food , fabulous locations and found great roads for riding motorbikes . By the end of the series we will have ridden 15,000 miles on our motorbikes \u2013 a proper food tour of Britain . \u201d The Hairy Bikers ' Food Tour of Britain has been made by Cactus TV ( Saturday Kitchen , Rachel Allen , Richard & Judy ) .

Courts in some states of the UAE regularly order floggings , for women as well as men , particularly but not exclusively for moral offences under Islamic law such as adultery and drinking alcohol . JCP has allegedly been abolished in Dubai but remains on the statute book in at least five of the other six Emirates . As far as can be ascertained , the normal practice is to apply a leather whip to the offender 's upper back , though the use of straps and canes has been reported in some cases . Some reports refer to the shirt being removed in the case of men , while female recipients remain fully dressed . According to one anecdotal account in Dec 2000 , prisoners in the UAE may also be flogged with a cane for internal prison infractions such as smuggling cigarettes . However , this report appeared in a not particularly reliable tabloid newspaper , and I have not yet seen this claim corroborated elsewhere . It is not clear whether floggings are still administered in public in the UAE . In 1977 it was reported that a man was given 100 lashes for rape in the central market of Abu Dhabi . This was said to be the first such case \" since Muslim religious courts took over jurisdiction of criminal cases \" . An Amnesty International report in 1989 ( not on line ) stated that two youths aged 16 and 18 were sentenced to 550 lashes each for theft . \" The sentences were carried out in public with the youths receiving approximately 40 lashes every Friday for three months . \" Reuters reported in 1995 that the Emirate of Ras al - Khaimah had extended the scope of flogging to include the not notably Koranic offence of dangerous driving . It was later claimed that this had been successful in reducing the road accident rate . A not altogether clear June 2006 news report stated that the penalty was no longer to be applied for petty crimes . In December 2006 the law was changed so that non- Muslims could no longer be flogged . It is possible that this was in part a response to embarrassing international publicity when an Estonian soldier , serving with a UN peacekeeping force in Afghanistan , was sentenced to be lashed for drinking alcohol during a stopover at Sharjah airport -- having been sold the drink by the airport 's own duty - free shop . He was eventually freed without being flogged ( Agence France Presse , 11 Apr 2006 ; Middle East Times , 19 Apr 2006 ) . This Feb 2007 news item clarifies that the punishment is to be carried out \" moderately and not with force or with a thick whip \" and that it is not supposed to cause bleeding . The best-known flogging case in the UAE is that of a teenage Filipina maid , Sarah Balabagan , originally sentenced in 1994 to death for killing her employer who had tried to rape her . Following an international outcry , this was commuted to a year in prison plus 100 lashes . She was duly flogged in 1996 with 20 lashes at a time on five separate days , privately in prison . EXTERNAL LINKS : ( these will open in a new window ) US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 1993 Here it is claimed that in 1993 the Federal Supreme Court ruled that Shari'a punishments such as flogging should not be imposed on non-Muslims , as they had been previously . ( But see next item . ) US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 1994 This report described floggings of Muslims by Islamic courts in the UAE as \" frequent \" , especially for adultery , prostitution and drunkenness , with sentences ranging from 80 to 200 lashes . The 1993 court ruling ( see previous item ) was clarified as meaning that non- Muslims are not required to be flogged , not that they must not be flogged . However , the report says that , although several non- Muslims had received JCP sentences , there was no indication that any of them had been carried out . US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 1995 According to this , flogging in the UAE is administered in such a way as to prevent injury : \" The individual administering the lashing traditionally holds a Koran under the arm and swings the whip using the forearm only \" . The document refers to certain individual cases , including floggings of non-Muslims , and in particular that of Sarah Balabagan ( see main text above ) . US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 1996 This report notes that there is no JCP in Dubai . It says a few floggings of non- Muslims were carried out in some other parts of the federation . ( The reports for 1997 to 2000 inclusive repeat the same information . ) Imprisonment and Flogging for Marriage Across Faiths 1997 Amnesty report on a case in which a 30 - year - old Christian man was sentenced to 39 lashes for marrying a Muslim woman . Amnesty International Report 1997 Several flogging cases are mentioned . Amnesty International Report 1998 Notes that JCP was extended to cover traffic offences in Ras al - Khaimah and also reportedly to begging . Several flogging sentences are discussed . Amnesty International Report 1999 More flogging sentences were imposed but it was not clear whether they had been carried out . Amnesty International Report 2001 At least 18 sentences of corporal punishment were handed down in 2000 , 11 of them in the Emirate of Fujairah . US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 2001 Mentions a case in which two foreigners , a man and his friend 's housemaid , were found in the friend 's house , convicted of \" cohabitation \" and sentenced to lashes and deportation . ( The 2002 report adds nothing of substance . ) US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 2003 The report states that flogging was sometimes carried out \" symbolically \" , but there had been at least one case in Abu Dhabi of the authorities using a leather strap to administer the sentence , which caused the recipient significant pain and left substantial bruising . Cases of JCP for adultery are mentioned . ( The 2004 report adds nothing new . ) Flogging Amnesty International report ( Dec 2004 ) about two women sentenced to flogging in the UAE for becoming pregnant outside marriage . US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 2005 Having for years repeatedly told us that JCP was banned in Dubai , the USSD now announces , without further explanation , that the Dubai Shari'a court in March 2005 sentenced a pregnant housemaid to 150 lashes for adultery . Elsewhere in the UAE there were also floggings for drug abuse , consensual premarital sex , prostitution , and defamation of character . Some authorities used leather straps and canes to administer the punishment , leaving bruising and welts .

It 's the unusual chemistry facilitated by this molecule , however , that will attract the most attention from scientists . Marsha Lester , the University of Pennsylvania 's Edmund J. Kahn Distinguished Professor , and Joseph Francisco , William E. Moore Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at Purdue University , found the molecule , which had puzzled and eluded scientists for more than 40 years . A technical paper describing the molecule is published this week in a special edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science . Somewhat like a human body metabolizing food , the Earth 's atmosphere has the ability to \" burn , \" or oxidize pollutants , especially nitric oxides emitted from sources such as factories and automobiles . What does n't get oxidized in the atmosphere falls back to Earth in the form of acid rain . \" The chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear , \" Francisco says . \" This gives us important insights into this process . Without that knowledge we really ca n't understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere . \" Francisco says the discovery will allow scientists to better model how pollutants react in the atmosphere and to predict potential outcomes . \" This becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as China , India and Brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated , \" Francisco says . \" This chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern . \" Lester says the molecule had been theorized by atmospheric chemists for 40 years and that she and Francisco had pursued it for the past several years . \" We 've speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years , and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting , \" she says . What makes the molecule so unusual is its two hydrogen bonds , which are similar to those found in water . Chemists know that although water is one of the most common substances found on the planet , it has unusual properties . For example , the solid form - ice - is lighter than the liquid form and floats . Water also boils at a much higher temperature than would be expected from its chemical structure . The cause of these strange behaviors are weak hydrogen bonds that hold water molecules together . The new atmospheric molecule has two hydrogen bonds , which allows it to form a six-sided ring structure . Hydrogen bonds are usually weaker than the normal bonds between atoms in a molecule , which are known as covalent bonds . In fact , covalent bonds are 20 times stronger than hydrogen bonds . But in this case , these two hydrogen bonds are strong enough to affect atmospheric chemistry , Francisco says . Lester says the new molecule exhibits its own unusual properties . \" The reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures , which is the opposite of most chemical reactions , \" she says . \" The rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure , and most reactions do n't depend on external pressure . The molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties . \" Lester says the unusual properties prevented scientists from being able to model the reaction for so long . \" This is not how we explain chemistry to high school students , \" she says . Francisco says that this discovery will be used in areas other than atmospheric chemistry . \" Here 's a situation where we were studying this purely environmental problem , but , because the findings are so fundamental , it may have broader ramifications to biological systems that depend on hydrogen bonds , \" he says . The breakthrough was enabled by laser - based laboratory techniques at the University of Pennsylvania and the supercomputing resources available at Purdue , Francisco says . The computation was done on an SGI Altix supercomputer operated by the Office of Information Technology at Purdue . \" The key is knowing where to look and how to identify new chemical entities , and with the computing resources we have at Purdue we can help identify processes to within experimental uncertainty , \" he says . \" We could n't have done this without the supercomputing power that we have available . \"","annotations":[{"text":"the Earth 's atmosphere","span":[760,782],"token_span":[125,128],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The individual that corrodes the Patient."},{"text":"pollutants","span":[825,834],"token_span":[139,139],"role":"Patient","label":"Patient","role_definition":"The Patient is corroded by the Cause."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"In this frame, the Patient, an inorganic item, undergoes a chemical process caused by another entity, which renders it less useful, desirable or stable.","frame_ancestors":["Transitive_action","Objective_influence","Event"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-4913-133-frame-Counterattack","frame":"Counterattack","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"The destruction of the PVA 180th Division of the 60th Army during the counterattack has been considered to be the worst Chinese defeat during the entire Korean War ..

The interrogators etched the Chinese characters for \" Fight the Chinese Communists , Oppose the Soviet Union \" into Zhang 's left arm . During his incarceration , Zhang witnessed U.S. military police killing his comrades during a POW uprising on the island of Cheju . But after the war , Zhang -- who dug the offending words from his arm with a knife , leaving a long , white , numb trench -- was not welcomed home . For 30 years , he and thousands of other returning POWs were looked upon as traitors for failing to fight to the death and because of their close contact with Americans in POW camps . During the Cultural Revolution of 1966 - 76 , Zhang was the subject of a nationwide manhunt because he was considered an American spy . It was not until 1980 that China 's government acknowledged mistreatment of former POWs in an ambiguously worded explanation called Document 74 . But like the Korean War in the United States , what is officially called the \" War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea \" has remained very much a forgotten conflict here , with China 's role largely unexamined . Zhang and other veterans say it 's time for that to change . Fifty years after the eruption of the Korean War , a sensitive and significant debate is beginning in China . Spurred in part by the rapprochement between North and South Korea and improving ties between the United States and its old enemy in Pyongyang , Chinese scholars are for the first time posing difficult questions about the decision to send more than 1 million troops over the Yalu River into North Korea . Should China have entered the war ? Who started the war ? Were China 's losses and expenses -- estimated at almost 1 million killed or wounded and $ 10 billion -- worth it ? Why does n't China 's military code give its soldiers the right to surrender ? And , even , did China fight on the right side ? \" We were told that the war was to protect China , \" said Zhang Zeshi , another POW from the 180th Division , who is not related to Zhang Da . \" But later we discovered we were n't really fighting for China . We were fighting for [ North Korean leader ] Kim Il Sung . Then we discovered he was a feudal lord . And that he started the war . If North Korea had turned out like South Korea , rich and democratic , then it would have been worth it . But that 's not what happened . \" China officially marked the 50th anniversary of its entry into the conflict on Wednesday with documentaries and celebrations emphasizing its victory and the righteousness of its cause . But in Internet chat rooms and in several magazines , Chinese are for the first time publicly mulling over questions that the United States , South Korea and Russia have been discussing for years . Only the Stalinist government in North Korea remains closed more tightly than China on these matters . Although subdued , the debate marks the first public criticism of the foreign policy of Mao Zedong , the dictator who steered China into the conflict . Everything else Mao did -- from his disastrous economic policies to his political campaigns that ruined millions of lives -- has been the subject of faultfinding by the Chinese . But Mao 's geopolitical strategy , which kept China at loggerheads with the West for decades after the Communist victory in 1949 , has remained untouchable until now . The first stone thrown in the debate came late last year in an article in Suibi , an obscure magazine published in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou . For the first time in China , a writer argued that Kim Il Sung started the war , that the United States had no intention of crossing the Yalu River and attacking China , and that China 's losses far outweighed its gains . The article , written by Yuan Xi , a reporter for the People 's Daily , the mouthpiece of the Communist Party , acknowledged that the war helped the Communist government consolidate its power . But it argued that the conflict also kept China out of the United Nations for more than two decades and retarded its economic and social development . The war also helped turn Japan , China 's main Asian rival , into an economic power and greatly benefited the Soviet Union , the article contended . Citing both Western research and internal reports , the article challenged Chinese official statistics , arguing that 900,000 Chinese were killed or wounded instead of the 740,000 acknowledged by China . It said that China spent $ 10 billion fighting the war , not $ 3.5 billion . It also complained that the \" free \" support promised by Joseph Stalin never arrived . China ended up owing Moscow $ 1.34 billion for \" used weaponry from World War II , \" it said . Finally , the article suggested something that Chinese scholars have discussed for years but that no one has dared to print : that Mao 's decision to enter the Korean War prevented China from recovering Taiwan . Reunification with the island remains a Holy Grail for China 's aging Communist leadership . \" Did China do right ? \" the article asked . \" Did China have a better choice ? Should the Chinese people have a new perspective about this war ? And from the lessons of this experience should we get a new understanding and appropriately confront the challenges of the future ? \" Last month , the article was attacked in the journal of the Academy of Military Science , the leading research arm of the People 's Liberation Army . Senior Col. Qi Dexue , a Korean War scholar , defended the decision to enter the conflict , arguing that doing so stymied U.S. plots to destabilize China . The war firmly placed China in the camp of the \" anti-imperialists , \" and protected China from further U.S. plots by establishing a buffer zone in North Korea , Qi wrote . \" In today 's society , there is definitely a tendency to find fault with , unveil the scars of , look for the dark side and even totally negate the history of the Communist Party , \" Qi wrote . In the murky world of Chinese politics , the debate about Korea is seen as an indirect way of questioning China 's current foreign policy . Beijing 's leadership remains wary of the West ; in recent years it has again started to lean toward Russia , from which it buys more than $ 1 billion of weapons a year . China continues to back regimes at odds with the West , such as those of ousted president Slobodan Milosevic in Yugoslavia and Saddam Hussein in Iraq , as well as those in Libya and Burma . Chinese strategists have spent years proving that the Korean War showed how China could take on powers stronger than itself , especially the United States . The army has used this as the basis of its policy of military modernization , which is aimed at conquering Taiwan and keeping the United States at bay . \" If the Korean War is shown to have been a mistake , then it calls into question the wisdom of taking on the United States over Taiwan , \" said Thomas Christensen , an expert on modern Chinese history at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . \" It raises doubts about the military 's belief that force can solve the Taiwan issue . There is really little that is more sensitive than that in China 's strategic thinking . \" In his article , Qi argued that the defeat of the 180th Division was not caused by the army 's senior officers , but by mistakes by lower - ranking soldiers . Their persecution upon returning to China was justified , he said . China 's military code does not permit its soldiers to surrender . Unlike such countries as the United States or France , where such former POWs as Arizona Sen . John McCain and the late French president Francois Mitterrand have become leading politicians , being a POW in China marks one as a traitor . For Zhang Zeshi , a Communist Party member , the criticism was even more severe . \" A revolutionary soldier is not permitted to surrender , especially a party member , \" Zhang said . \" But I think that 's a feudal idea . \" Zhang was stripped of his party membership in 1954 and , despite having a degree from prestigious Qinghua University , was forced to take a job as a high school teacher . A party official forced Zhang 's fiancee to denounce him ; the official then took her as his bride . Zhang was dispatched to the countryside for almost 10 years . During the Cultural Revolution , his students placed a dunce cap on his head and called him a traitor and a spy . He was jailed and lived in a cowshed . After the Cultural Revolution , Zhang fought to restore the reputation of POWs and the fighters of the 180th Division . Backed by Gen. He Min , who persuaded Zhang and his comrades to return to China following the war , Zhang and others ultimately persuaded party leaders to issue Document 74 . That document had a direct effect on Zhang Da 's life . He came out of hiding and in the mid-1980s embraced China 's economic reforms , opening a successful Sichuanese restaurant in Beijing . \" I 'm lucky , \" said Zhang , who as a wounded POW almost lost his leg to an American surgeon 's knife . \" I've lived through it all . But my biggest complaint is still about the Communist Party . They do n't respect history . . . . If you do n't face your history , you 're going to repeat it . \" \u00a9 2000 The Washington Post Peruse More InterNetwork Notices Peruse Older InterNetwork Notices DISCLAIMER : The content of this message is the sole responsibility of the originator .

When she was thirteen , the Count d'Amerval made a proposal of marriage to her father , Jacques Paulze . The Count d'Amerval was an influential nobleman , but of bad character . He threatened Mr. Paulze with the loss of his job if he refused . Jacques Paulze instead asked a young man who worked with him if he would marry his daughter instead . This young man , only 28 then , was already famous in France as a geologist and chemist . He was also quite rich and a nobleman himself . The young man , Antoine Lavoisier , accepted . And that 's how Marie Anne became Madame Lavoisier . Though being a desperate marriage , Marie Anne shared many interests with her husband . Unlike many women of her time , she was very interested in chemistry . She had a flair for languages which her famous husband did not have . This was very useful , for she was the first to read about scientific advances in Britain in Germany first ! She would then translate articles into French or Latin , which Antoine Lavoisier could read . The Lavoisiers ' experiment on phlogiston is considered among the most beautiful in science . Do you know how it came about ? Madame was translating a book on the subject by Irish scientist Richard Kirwan . She found that he made a lot of errors , which she pointed out at every step . When she gave the translated book to Antoine Lavoisier , it had more of her notes than Kirwan 's writings . And that was how he was convinced that phlogiston was false . While Lavoisier was quite an academically minded person , Madame was more practical . She used to keep the lab records and ensured that the experiments were carried out according to procedure . Having learned drawing , she would make neat diagrams of the experiments . That made understanding the experiments much easier . It was also a lesson to other scientists on how to do experiments properly . Antoine Lavoisier was quite happy doing experiments , but did n't bother to share the results with people . Madame Lavoisier on the other hand was very keen . She organised all his results and made him write a proper book . She had it published in 1789 . Known as the ' Elementary Treatise on Chemistry ' , it is considered among the best chemistry books ever written . Sadly , Antoine Lavoisier was executed in 1784 in the French Revolution . His property was seized and his wife was thrown to the mercy of the streets . However , she fought all these difficulties to try and publish the remaining experiments . She finally succeeded , in a book called The Memoirs of Chemistry . By the time she died in 1836 , she had restored her husband 's reputation .

EoE is a rare , chronic , inflammatory disease that occurs when eosinophils , a type of white blood cell , accumulate in the oesophagus causing injury and inflammation . 1 The FDA grants ODD status to medicines and potential new medicines intended for the treatment , diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the US . Mene Pangalos , Executive Vice President , BioPharmaceuticals R&D , said : \u201c Eosinophilic oesophagitis is an allergic inflammatory disease that can affect children and adults , and typically patients experience a range of debilitating symptoms including severe pain and difficulty swallowing food . Currently there are no FDA - approved treatments for eosinophilic oesophagitis . Because Fasenra depletes eosinophils in blood and tissue , it could become a potential new medicine to treat patients with this rare disease . \u201d Fasenra is AstraZeneca 's first respiratory biologic medicine and is currently approved as an add - on maintenance treatment for severe , eosinophilic asthma in the US , EU , Japan and other countries . In November 2018 , the FDA granted ODD for Fasenra for the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis ( EGPA ) , and also granted ODD for the treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome ( HES ) in February 2019 . About EoE EoE is a rare , chronic , inflammatory disease of the oesophagus characterised by the accumulation of eosinophils , a type of white blood cell that are a normal part of the immune system , in the oesophageal lining tissue . The disease results in injury , fibrosis and dysfunction that if not effectively treated can make eating difficult or uncomfortable , potentially leading to chronic pain , difficulty swallowing , poor growth , malnutrition and weight loss . 1 The most common symptoms of EoE include reflux that does not respond to medication , difficulty swallowing , food becoming stuck in the oesophagus , nausea and vomiting , abdominal or chest pain , poor appetite and difficulty sleeping . 1 Patients are often treated with corticosteroids to manage inflammation . Currently there are no FDA - approved treatments for EoE.1 About Fasenra Fasenra ( benralizumab ) is a monoclonal antibody that binds directly to the IL - 5 receptor alpha on eosinophils and attracts natural killer cells to induce rapid and near-complete depletion of eosinophils via apoptosis ( programmed cell death ) . 2,3 Fasenra is AstraZeneca 's first respiratory biologic , now approved as an add - on maintenance treatment in severe eosinophilic asthma in the US , EU , Japan and other countries , with further regulatory reviews ongoing . In June 2019 , the European Medicines Agency 's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) issued a positive opinion for Fasenra self - administration and the Fasenra pen , a new auto-injector delivery device . Fasenra is in development for severe nasal polyposis , eosinophilic oesophagitis , eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis , hypereosinophilic syndrome and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Fasenra was developed by AstraZeneca and is in - licensed from BioWa , Inc. , a wholly - owned subsidiary of Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. , Ltd. , Japan .

The Magic Flute In 2013 , I received a copy of The Magic Flute by Kaye Feather Robinson , now published on this site and also available as a PDF file ( [ Robinson - KW 2012 ] ) . It tells the story of an afternoon journey in October 2006 to a petroglyph site in Utah by Feather , Peter Phippen , Jan Seiden , and Cecelia Turbyville . Here 's are some excerpts : After I finished the stories , I noticed a yucca stalk on the floor . \u2026 I told Peter that the teachings were over and it was time to give an offering of Flute Music . \u2026 He saw what others did not see . He saw six small holes that tiny critters had left in the old hollow stick . \u2026 \u201c I think I can play the stick . \u201d Peter surprised everyone with this statement . I thought I knew plants and plants usages . But this was new to me . He picked up the stick and so began the music of the Yucca . With spiffy suit and shiny shoes , Peter crawled up into the circular place below the Great Teacher and began the haunting music . Time stopped . Peter forgot to look at his watch . The need to get back to the reception was no more . The World stood still and the music of the ancient ones blended with the music of today . The Ancient Flute Players came alive through Peter\u00e2s breath . Plant united with Man. Past united with Present . The Center Place was vibrating with new life . The hum of the Universe was heard once again . We were one . In June 2015 I found this description by Peter Phippen of this potential origin for the embouchure hole , the earliest mention of which I am aware . From [ Crawford 1999 b ] : I live in Wis [ consin ] and in my backyard there is a cane - like plant that bugs burrow into to hibernate for the Winter . One Spring I noticed a flute - like sound coming from one of these stalks . Upon investigating , I found that a bug had left a small hole in the side of the stalk , making a flute - like sound when the wind blew . Could early man have stumbled onto something like this ? If so , the cane or bamboo flute would have come first . Perhaps the earliest flutes were one - or two - note flutes with no holes , with the second note and possibly a few overtones ( depending on the length of the instrument ) being achieved by over blowing . Yucca and related plants The group of plants that might be considered for proto-flutes includes yucca , sotol , and agave . An excellent primer on these plants can be found on The Agaves and Nolinas page of the Saguaro - Juniper web site . | | | | Yucca plant with inflorescense . Photo courtesy of Keith Stanford These plants produce an inflorescense \u2014 a cluster of flowers arranged on a stem . The stem can be composed of a main branch or a complex arrangement of branches . The photo at the left , courtesy of Keith Stanford ( Kieta [ key - eh - tah ] ) of Cherry Cows Flutes shows a small yucca plant with two inflorescense stalks - an old , dried stalk and a new stalk emerging . Kieth describes this picture : Here are a couple of pictures I took last week down on my ranch by Tombstone , AZ . You can see the old stalk on top of this small Yucca , and the ' new ' stalk just starting to come out . These stalks grown at an unbelievable rate of about two feet per month . Ethnobotany These excerpts from [ Gibbs 2003 ] ( pages 2 - 1 and 6 - 7 ) and gives some background on the ethno-botany of yucca and related plants in the San Andres National Wildlife Refuge , New Mexico : The San Andres Mountains contain five general plant communities , including desert shrub , desert riparian , grass - shrub , mountain shrub and pi\u00c3\u00b1on juniper . Vegetation found within the San Andres National Wildlife Refuge includes needle and thread grass ( Stipa comata ) , gramma grass ( Boteuloua spp. ) , mountain mahogany ( Cercocarpus montanus ) , prickly pear cactus ( Opuntia spp. ) , agave ( Agave spp. ) , Yucca ( Yucca spp. ) , and ocotillo ( Fouquieria splendens ) . Higher elevations contain stands of pi\u00c3\u00b1on pine ( Pinus edulis ) and juniper ( Juniperus monosperma ) . Desert willow ( Chilopsis linearis ) and apache plume ( Fallugia paradoxa ) are found around springs and major drainages ( [ RMC 1998 ] ) . While still speculative , several studies of the Apache Indians can be valuable in understanding prehistoric subsistence patterns . Basehart\u00e2s ( 1973 ) study ( [ Basehart 1973 ] ) , for example , based on ethnographic research , examines water gathering , agriculture , and place names with territorial references . The study provides a long list of usable stone , animal , and plant resources in semi-desert brush , grassland , woodland , and forest ecozones . His study strongly indicates that almost every plant was of some subsistence , medicinal , or architectural value . The four wild food crops that proved most important , primarily for food storage purposes , were mescal , datil fruit from Yucca bacatta , pi\u00c3\u00b1on nuts , and mesquite beans ( [ Basehart 1973 ] ) . The majority of all the wild foods utilized by the Mescalero are known to exist within 2 km of the bajada slope ( [ Johnson - M 1991 ] ) . Who drilled the holes ? What creatures made those holes in the yucca stalks ? Several citations from ethno-botanists provide some clues . From [ Castetter 1938 ] , page 51 \u00b6 2 : Small quantities of honey , the product of large wild carpenter bees , were occasionally obtained from agave flower stalks by the Maricopa ( [ Spier 1933 ] , page 73 \u00b6 3 \u2014 see below ) , while in Havasupai territory wild carpenter bees had their hives in flower stalks of dead agave ( [ Spier 1928 ] , page 108 \u00b6 3 \u2014 see below ) . From [ Spier 1933 ] , page 73 \u00b6 3 : Honey was occasionally obtained form the flower stalks of mescal , but these contained very little . This was the product of large bees ( m \u00c5spo'kw \u00c4ni'ly \u00c8\u00a7 , \" black bee \" ) . This classification of \" bees \" is rather interesting : working bees were called flies ( xaly\u00c8\u00a7smo''kw\u00c4ly\u00c8\u00a7vi'na ) ; another bee with a yellow back ( not a hornet ) was m \u00c5spo'cilyam\u00c5'kk\u00c8\u00a7kw\u00c4's \u00c4c ; a fourth variety , resembling a was was m \u00c5spo'kw \u00c4s\u00c4 'c , \" yellow bee . \" The nests of working bees were found and the insects killed individually , but their honey was not eaten . From [ Spier 1928 ] , page 73 \u00b6 3 : Wild bees hive in dead logs and the flower stalks of dead mescal . According to Brad Young of 4 Wind Flutes , ( information he provided in an open forum for flute makers on May 4 , 2013 ) : In the desert , carpenter bee females nest in sotol and various yucca and agave bloom stalks , or they may take up residence in dead tree trunks and limbs , firewood or wooden structures . Beginning in the spring , a female , like a miniature carpenter , will burrow a half - inch - diameter horizontal tunnel so perfectly circular that it could have been produced by a power drill . She leaves , in her wake , a small pile of sawdust beneath her construction site . Within her tunnel , which extends perhaps six to 10 inches deep into wood , she excavates a gallery where she deposits her eggs . Here is a photo of a nest , or \u201c gallery \u201d , created by carpenter bees in a 2 \u00d74 piece of wood : | | | | Carpenter bee nest ( gallery ) in a 2\u00d74 piece of wood . Photo April 25 , 2011 by Wikimedia user Belchergb Here is a photo provided by Keith Stanford from his Native Yucca Stalk Flute Making Manual ( [ Stanford 2012 ] ) showing \u201c a perfect , insect - made bore , except that it is too narrow for what I wanted , so I gouged it out wider .

Photo courtesy of Keith Stanford Keith Stanford Flute maker Keith Stanford ( Kieta [ key - eh - tah ] ) of CherryCows Flutes provided a first - person experience with sotol plants and their inhabitants . From an email on May 3 , 2013 : Last summer , I harvested about a dozen Yucca - stalks and was driving down the Interstate back to Tucson . I looked in the rearview mirror and saw what appeared to be a black bat hovering near my ear . After trying to control the resulting swerve across both lanes of the highway , I was able to get my SUV stopped and I bailed out of my vehicle . Now remember , there are cars speeding by at 75 MPH and it is about 105 degrees in the shade \u2026 I was in the sun \u2026 and I am running around the vehicle like a madman trying to open all the doors . Out flew about a half dozen MONSTER - sized black bumble bees ! They came out of those large holes in the Yucca-stalks . Interesting side note , when I got back to Tucson I laid these Yucca - stalks on my work bench outside , and for about two weeks I had two black bumble bees hovering around \u2026 even after I moved the Yucca-stalks to a different location away from my house . | | | | Bee photographed by Keith Stanford Later in 2013 , Keith captured one of the critters on his cell phone . From an email on October 28 , 2013 : I was out harvesting Sotol-stalks and after I got the batch home I commenced to cutting them all to the proper length for flutes . While I was doing this , I noticed my dog , who was standing next to me , started twisting her head the way dogs do when they hear something that is ' odd ' to them . So I turned off the band - saw to see if I could hear what was of interest to her , and out popped a bee from one of the holes on the Sotol-stalk and landed on my book . ( It was buzzing quite loudly on it 's exit from the stalk , but once it exited it was quite lethargic and did n't fly off . Just sort of crawled around for a while . I think it had already passed its usefulness as an insect and was about ready to call it quits . ) I grabbed my cell phone and snapped this picture for y'all . You now have an actual picture and a bona fide witness for Flutopedia of a real live insect that made the holes in these stalks ! Evidence for Yucca Flutes in the Archaeological Literature This section is an analysis by Christine Oravec , version 3 dated April 2 , 2014 . Published reports of flutes made of yucca stalks may be found in the work of archaeologist Walter Hough . In 1901 and 1905 he accompanied expeditions to the Mogollon area of west central New Mexico . Two organizations sponsored the expeditions . The first was a group of private individuals that later founded the Southwest Museum of the Archaeological Institute of America , at that time located near Pasadena CA . The second was the United States National Museum , a division of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , DC . The artifacts collected during the expeditions were distributed between the two organizations . After the 1905 expedition Hough returned to the USNM . He eventually became head curator of anthropology and spent the rest of his career documenting the Smithsonian\u00e2s vast collection of Native American artifacts ( [ Pavesic 1999 ] , page 140 ) . Hough published two reports mentioning yucca flutes unearthed during the expeditions . The first report included only a brief statement about the instruments themselves : \u201c Music was also a pastime of these ancients , who used flutes of reed and yucca stalks \u201d ( [ Hough 1907 ] , page 27 ) . Nevertheless his identification of the artifacts as made of yucca was credible . Hough was an ethnobotanist as well as an archaeologist , and he published several articles on succulents and their use among such Southwestern native tribes as the Hopi ( [ Judd 1936 ] , page 477 ) . In 1914 Hough published another report for the Smithsonian ( [ Hough 1914 ] ) that commented upon and illustrated artifacts of flutes . These were specifically identified as excavated at the Tularosa and Bear Cave sites in the Mogollon region . Under the title \u201c Flute Pahos \u201d he included detailed descriptions and pictures of flutes made of cane , reed , yucca slats and yucca fibers . In particular , the illustration shown in Figure 330 represented a flute paho made of a single hollowed - out yucca stalk with no identifiable breath or finger holes . Note : In this section of the report Hough frequently used the term \u201c paho . \u201d Otherwise known as \u201c prayer sticks , \u201d pahos were solid pieces of wood or vegetal fiber decorated with feathers , twine and paint . They were primarily used as ceremonial objects . The Hopis , for example , inserted small sticks made of willow or cottonwood topped with feathers into the ground in front of altars during the Flute Ceremony . These sticks functioned as symbolic flutes ( [ Payne 1993 ] , pages 19 and 55 \u2013 56 ) . Apparently Hough distinguished pahos representing flutes from other kinds of pahos by their length ( from 9.25 to 12.5 inches ) , their straight shape , and the fact that they were bored from end to end . As for their functionality as musical instruments , Hough did not require that a hollow stick should display identifiable breath and finger holes to qualify as a conventional flute ( Figure 327 ) . He appeared however to be more confident when a stick did display such holes ( Figure 328 ) . Hough\u00e2s criteria evoke the possibility that some ancient Southwestern rim-blown overtone flutes may have required neither breath holes nor finger holes , in part because of their ceremonial significance . In 1950 , Paul S. Martin conducted another excavation of the Tularosa cave complex and confirmed the presence of flutes made of cane . See The Tularosa Cave Flutes . More information might be obtained from Walter Hough 's original Field Notes ( [ Hough 1905 ] ) .

This image of a rock art panel near the San Juan River , near Bluff , Utah was published in [ Manning - SJ 1992 ] , figure 20 . Manning states that the plant image \u201c resembles \u201d yucca . It was also analyzed in [ Slifer 1994 ] , figure 148 , who state ( pages 89\u201390 ) that : [ O ] ne interesting petroglyph panel portrays a row of figures : five fluteplayers to the right and four fluteplayers to the left of a centrally placed plant form ( yucca in bloom ? ) . All nine fluteplayers are phallic and wear and unusual variety of head - dresses ; one is humpbacked . Christine Oravec notes that \u201c From my personal experience , it is difficult but not impossible to distinguish rock art depictions of plants according to species . Most are corn . Having seen well - defined corn depictions , however , and noting the sheer number of flower and leaf stalks in this depiction and their relative directions with relationship to the main stalk , I think Slifer and Duffield made a pretty good guess . \u201d | | | | Nine flute players facing a central plant form .

Here are six narratives in the Origin of the Native American flute section of the Narratives page on this site , and a very brief summary of the source of the flute : - Comanche Flute Origin ( [ Bee 2006 ] ) : \u201c a man who had suffered greatly \u2026 had a dream \u2026 old cedar trees \u2026 dead branches in which the woodpeckers had drilled holes \u2026 wind blew , creating a sweet and soothing sound \u201d . - The Sound of Flutes ( [ Erdoes 1976 ] , [ Wapp 1984 ] ) : \u201c a young hunter \u2026 meat was scarce \u2026 redheaded woodpecker \u2026 alighted on a cedar tree and began tapping and hammering on a dead branch \u2026 a gust of wind \u2026 the hunter heard that beautiful sound right \u201d . - The Origin of the Courting Flute ( [ Deloria 1961 ] , [ Wapp 1984 ] ) : \u201c a youth who \u2026 loved only one maiden \u2026 heard human voices coming from a grove of trees \u2026 two \u2026 unsurpassably handsome young men \u2026 their bodies seemed to emit glimmering light \u2026 had with them a long flute and one began to play \u2026 from the mouth of this flute , which was made like that of the gar , came a sweet , piercing sound \u201d . - The Origin of the Flageolet ( [ Densmore 1923 ] , pages 80 \u2013 84 ) : \u201c Old Granny ( a.k.a. the Old Woman Who Never Dies ) \u2026 went into the field and got a large sunflower stalk . She took a long section of this , bored a hole lengthwise through it , and cut seven holes in one side of it . She said the seven holes represented the seven months of winter , and told the boy that when he blew in it something would come out of it which would resemble snow . It was her intention to bring the snow to punish the two men for frightening the little boy \u201d . - Flute Origin Story from \u201c The Whirlwind and the Elk in the Mythology of the Dakota \u201d ( [ Wissler 1905 ] , pages 262\u2013266 ) : \u201c a young man \u2026 fell in love with the daughter of a wealthy man \u2026 [ he ] saw a man , scarcely visible . The man looked old , and his hair was white \u2026 gave him a thick red stick wrapped in sage grass \u2026 ' you are to go out and circle around the camp blowing upon this flageolet ' \u2026 The flageolet was inside of the grass bundle . This is the way they got the flageolet \u201d . - The Legend of the Flute \u2014 Brule Sioux ( [ Erdoes 1984 ] , pages 275\u2013278 ) : similar to The Sound of Flutes , described above . Next Steps One of the next steps in this line of inquiry would be to try some basic experiments . The idea would be to set up yucca stalks with naturally bored holes and a hollow core in a controlled environment where a wind could be driven at the stalks at varying angles and speeds .","annotations":[{"text":"insect","span":[9408,9413],"token_span":[1849,1849],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent is the person cutting the Item into Pieces."},{"text":"a yucca stalk","span":[9624,9636],"token_span":[1900,1902],"role":"Item","label":"Item","role_definition":"The item which is being cut into Pieces."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Agent cuts a Item into Pieces using an Instrument (which may or may not be expressed).","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-0820-109-frame-Damaging","frame":"Damaging","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"Bernard Wientjes , the president of the Dutch employers ' organization Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers ( VNO - NCW ) , also accused Wilders of \" seriously \" damaging Dutch interests abroad .","annotations":[{"text":"Wilders","span":[152,158],"token_span":[25,25],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The conscious entity, generally a person, that performs the intentional action that results in the damage to the Patient."},{"text":"Dutch interests","span":[186,200],"token_span":[31,32],"role":"Patient","label":"Patient","role_definition":"The entity which is affected by the Agent so that it is damaged."}],"trigger":{"text":"damaging","start_char":177,"end_char":184,"start_token":30,"end_token":30,"frame":"Damaging"}},"source":{"text":"The head of the Dutch employers ' federation has accused far-right politician Geert Wilders of \" seriously \" damaging Dutch interests abroad .

Some of those songs are almost 50 years old , and they have stood the test of time . I have a few favourites : Yesterday , because it 's as great a song as could ever be written , and the fact it has been covered thousands of times attests to that ; and I love , Here There and Everywhere , and Maybe I 'm Amazed . I have two older sisters who took me to see the Beatles when I was about seven . It was so galvanising ; I got a little guitar and wanted to play their songs . I have met McCartney a couple of times . We were both up for an Academy award [ in 2001 ] the year Randy Newman won , and I remember standing there , thinking : \" Wow , if the little kid version of me knew that one day I would be a loser with Paul McCartney ... \" As a songwriter you need a gift for melody , and for saying something you 've heard a million times in a different way . There are only so many notes and ideas , but you twist it and turn it and make it new , by the chords or melodies or a weird key change . In just a few years , the Beatles created this genius body of work , and those songs will never go away . Diane Warren has written for Elton John , Barbra Streisand and Aretha Franklin ; she has been Oscar-nominated six times . Brian Higgins on Brandon Flowers I have a lot of admiration and respect for Gary Barlow , Cathy Dennis and more recently Skylar Grey , who I think is an outstanding talent . But the person whose songs have been with me for most of the last decade is Brandon Flowers , lead singer and principal songwriter of the Killers . The first time I became fully aware of his songwriting was when Somebody Told Me became a big hit in 2004 . At the time my production company Xenomania was having a lot of success , and I remember I brought this song into one of our production meetings and played it to everyone , saying that we had been \" beaten \" . In many ways it encapsulated everything we were trying to achieve : it was aggressive but catchy , very witty but also deep and believable . Songwriting is highly competitive , and it is very difficult to listen to things without any cynicism . But Brandon 's material is so good , powerful and moving that it destroys any attempt I might have made to criticise it . I listen as a fan . Brian Higgins 's Xenomania company has written for Girls Aloud , Kylie Minogue and New Order . Amanda Ghost on Joni Mitchell She is one of the greatest lyricists of the 20th century . I do n't like it when people call songwriters poets because I do n't think we are : poems and lyrics are incredibly different . Lyrics fall into a melody . When we read lyrics on a page they can be profound , but it 's only when you put them with music that they take on another dimension . Mitchell pioneered the female singer -songwriter perspective in modern pop music . Nobody really did introspection and personal confession like her . She is the standard that unfortunately I measure everyone against , and nobody really comes up to the bar . My favourite is A Case of You , and my favourite lines are : \" You 're in my blood like holy wine / You taste so bitter and so sweet / I could drink a case of you / And I would still be on my feet . \" They 've deeply changed me and the way I write . Before I heard Mitchell , I would never go to the point of being so confessional ; she taught me to strip away the poetry and get to the heart and bones . When you do that , the public reacts because it is honest ; that is why her work has endured . Amanda Ghost has written for James Blunt , Beyonc\u00e9 and Florence and the Machine . Rob Fusari on Lady Gaga I first heard her work when she came to my studio in New Jersey in March 2006 . She performed two songs : Hollywood and Again and Again . I had n't heard songwriting like this since the days of Freddie Mercury and David Bowie . It felt like Christmas morning , and the first time I had my heart broken , all tightly wrapped up in three minutes . My favourite song of hers is Brown Eyes . In certain songs you feel the pain or the joy of the author , but we do n't hear or see a lot of that today . It 's the most creatively naked song and performance I 've heard from Gaga to date . I believe she is one of those songwriters who can find the balance between personal experience and pop culture . She writes songs for the stage as opposed to the radio , which lends itself to a more theatrical approach . Rob Fusari has written for Lady Gaga , Beyonc\u00e9 and Britney Spears . Nina Woodford on Kate Bush I find her melodies beautiful and unexpected , and it 's the same for her lyrics . The fact she released [ her debut album ] The Kick Inside when she was 19 is amazing in itself . Even the few things I have n't liked have always been thought - provoking and interesting ; as a writer , she makes me feel free to dare to try different things . There are very few women who write that kind of direct poetry . A lot of women get judged on other things . She has n't been intimidated into feeling she has to be cute , or charming . There are loads of great female writers , but not many who were n't trying to be sexy or attractive or cool . She has written two of my top 10 songs ever : Wuthering Heights and This Woman 's Work .

Clumsy use of the mysterious nerve agent caused the deaths of at least 115 hostages in addition to disabling most of the 50 Chechen hostage - takers . The antidote being used is for the group of nerve agents related to the gas BZ , developed by the US military in the 1970s . BZ is a \" glycolate \" which attacks the central nervous system . It was developed by the US Department of Defence and is considered non-lethal if applied correctly . Russian authorities initially refused to name the gas that killed the hostages , leading to complaints that it was making their job of treating patients with antidotes much harder . Yet chemical warfare experts told the Guardian that Moscow doctors had been given an antidote by the Russian military for a rare nerve agent developed by the US military , called BZ . Professor Steven Rose , of the Open University , said a Russian counterpart had told him that doctors had been supplied the antidote from a military stockpile . \" All nerve agents , like Sarin gas and those that the Iraqis use , block the transmissions between nerve and muscle \" , said Professor Rose . \" These would produce the memory deficits that hostages have talked about . \" The symptoms usually caused by BZ match those of the hostages carried out of the building . It causes skin to be drained of colour , sweating , victims to appear concussed , possibly have respiratory problems . Victims can also experience hallucinations and huge anxiety attacks . Prof Rose said he had been in contact yesterday with a Russian counterpart , Professor Konstantin Anokhin at the Institute of Normal Physiology in Moscow , who shared his suspicions about the identity of the gas . Prof Anokhin said he had spoken to doctors treating the hostages who had been supplied by the Russian military with an antidote for general class of substances to which BZ belonged . \" BZ is a muscarnic cholinergic blocker , \" said Prof Rose . \" It affects a special type of nerve , known as a muscarnic receptor , in the brain . When it is released into the atmosphere , it gets into the lungs . It then passes through the blood stream and through the entire brain . \" Prof Rose said the agent affected the chemical acetylcholine , which carries messages from one nerve cell to another . \" BZ interacts with this and stops the message getting across \" , he added . \" It 's like turning the volume up on a radio , and stopping any changes in the signal , so the message loses all its meaning . \" The agent works on the brain and paralyses its ability to interpret what is going on . \" It turns off the lights , and destroys the body 's headquarters . \" Prof Rose added that the people least likely to be affected by the gas were the terrorists themselves as they are the healthiest and the most prepared for such a situation . \" It will affect the young and the old more than the fit , \" he said . There were many young women among the casualties carried from the theatre . \" Obviously in this case it was used in grossly high concentrations , \" he said . \" The victims appear to be the very young and old , which you would expect if it was used in a confined space . \" The gas has never been used before , Prof Rose said , except perhaps in secret , or in a US propaganda film in the 1970s , by the US Department of Defence . \" It was stockpiled and never used in the west . \" Prof Rose said he had experimented with the gas - which originally comes as a white powder mixed with a propellant , in a laboratory , but never on humans . He was not aware if the Soviet Union had obtained the gas . \" It is bound to be lethal in high concentrations , \" said Prof Rose . \" It would shut down the brain and if this happens for long enough the body stops getting oxygen and the brain itself dies . \" The use of chemical agents , whether BZ or other similar agents which attack the central nervous system , had two major implications , according to Dr Malcolm Dando , professor of international security at Bradford University 's school of peace studies , who also advises the UN . They are new forms of agents in which both the American and Russian military are increasingly interested as they develop \" non-lethal \" weapons following growing understanding of the nervous system . \" They are a harbinger of what 's to come , \" warned Dr Dando . He also pointed out that because of a loophole these nerve agents are not covered by the international chemical weapons convention . The US has said they have the right to use them . \" We are going down a very slippery path towards new forms of agents , \" Dr Dando added . He said the agents could be developed for mind control . The International Commitee of the Red Cross recently expressed concern about the development of so -called \" non-lethal \" weapons . The Russian military have considered using such \" non-lethal incapacitants \" before , said Lev Feodorov , the president of the Union of Chemical Security , to stop the coup attempt of 1993 . Yet they decided against it . One analyst said such gases were highly delicate substances whose improper use could be disastrous . \" It is a very exact process putting them together , \" said defence expert Paul Beaver .","annotations":[{"text":"Moscow theatre","span":[84,97],"token_span":[13,14],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The role Place indicates where the death takes place."},{"text":"at least 115 hostages","span":[318,338],"token_span":[54,57],"role":"Protagonist","label":"Protagonist","role_definition":"The role Protagonist is the being or entity that dies.

But , in regard to Texas , enough has now been given to party . It is time for the common duty of Patriotism to the Country to succeed ; -- or if this claim will not be recognized , it is at least time for common sense to acquiesce with decent grace in the inevitable and the irrevocable . Texas is now ours . Already , before these words are written , her Convention has undoubtedly ratified the acceptance , by her Congress , of our proffered invitation into the Union ; and made the requisite changes in her already republican form of constitution to adapt it to its future federal relations . Her star and her stripe may already be said to have taken their place in the glorious blazon of our common nationality ; and the sweep of our eagle 's wing already includes within its circuit the wide extent of her fair and fertile land . She is no longer to us a mere geographical space --a certain combination of coast , plain , mountain , valley , forest and stream . She is no longer to us a mere country on the map . She comes within the dear and sacred designation of Our Country ; no longer a \" pays , \" she is a part of \" la patrie ; \" and that which is at once a sentiment and a virtue , Patriotism , already begins to thrill for her too within the national heart . It is time then that all should cease to treat her as alien , and even adverse -- cease to denounce and vilify all and everything connected with her accession -- cease to thwart and oppose the remaining steps for its consummation ; or where such efforts are felt to be unavailing , at least to embitter the hour of reception by all the most ungracious frowns of aversion and words of unwelcome . There has been enough of all this . It has had its fitting day during the period when , in common with every other possible question of practical policy that can arise , it unfortunately became one of the leading topics of party division , of presidential electioneering . But that period has passed , and with it let its prejudices and its passions , its discords and its denunciations , pass away too . The next session of Congress will see the representatives of the new young State in their places in both our halls of national legislation , side by side with those of the old Thirteen . Let their reception into \" the family \" be frank , kindly , and cheerful , as befits such an occasion , as comports not less with our own self - respect than patriotic duty towards them . Ill betide those foul birds that delight to file their own nest , and disgust the ear with perpetual discord of ill-omened croak . Why , were other reasoning wanting , in favor of now elevating this question of the reception of Texas into the Union , out of the lower region of our past party dissensions , up to its proper level of a high and broad nationality , it surely is to be found , found abundantly , in the manner in which other nations have undertaken to intrude themselves into it , between us and the proper parties to the case , in a spirit of hostile interference against us , for the avowed object of thwarting our policy and hampering our power , limiting our greatness and checking the fulfillment of our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions . This we have seen done by England , our old rival and enemy ; and by France , strangely coupled with her against us , under the influence of the Anglicism strongly tinging the policy of her present prime minister , Guizot . The zealous activity with which this effort to defeat us was pushed by the representatives of those governments , together with the character of intrigue accompanying it , fully constituted that case of foreign interference , which Mr. Clay himself declared should , and would unite us all in maintaining the common cause of our country against foreigner and the foe . We are only astonished that this effect has not been more fully and strongly produced , and that the burst of indignation against this unauthorized , insolent and hostile interference against us , has not been more general even among the party before opposed to Annexation , and has not rallied the national spirit and national pride unanimously upon that policy . We are very sure that if Mr. Clay himself were now to add another letter to his former Texas correspondence , he would express this sentiment , and carry out the idea already strongly stated in one of them , in a manner which would tax all the powers of blushing belonging to some of his party adherents . It is wholly untrue , and unjust to ourselves , the pretence that the Annexation has been a measure of spoliation , unrightful and unrighteous -- of military conquest under forms of peace and law -- of territorial aggrandizement at the expense of justice , and justice due by a double sanctity to the weak . This view of the question is wholly unfounded , and has been before so amply refuted in these pages , as well as in a thousand other modes , that we shall not again dwell upon it . The independence of Texas was complete and absolute . It was an independence , not only in fact , but of right . No obligation of duty towards Mexico tended in the least degree to restrain our right to effect the desired recovery of the fair province once our own -- whatever motives of policy might have prompted a more deferential consideration of her feelings and her pride , as involved in the question . If Texas became peopled with an American population ; it was by no contrivance of our government , but on the express invitation of that of Mexico herself ; accompanied with such guaranties of State independence , and the maintenance of a federal system analogous to our own , as constituted a compact fully justifying the strongest measures of redress on the part of those afterwards deceived in this guaranty , and sought to be enslaved under the yoke imposed by its violation . She was released , rightfully and absolutely released , from all Mexican allegiance , or duty of cohesion to the Mexican political body , by the acts and fault of Mexico herself , and Mexico alone . There never was a clearer case . It was not revolution ; it was resistance to revolution : and resistance under such circumstances as left independence the necessary resulting state , caused by the abandonment of those with whom her former federal association had existed . What then can be more preposterous than all this clamor by Mexico and the Mexican interest , against Annexation , as a violation of any rights of hers , any duties of ours ? We would not be understood as approving in all its features the expediency or propriety of the mode in which the measure , rightful and wise as it is in itself , has been carried into effect . Its history has been a sad tissue of diplomatic blundering . How much better it might have been managed -- how much more smoothly , satisfactorily , and successfully ! Instead of our present relations with Mexico -- instead of the serious risks which have been run , and those plausibilities of opprobrium which we have had to combat , not without great difficulty , nor with entire success -- instead of the difficulties which now throng the path to a satisfactory settlement of all our unsettled questions with Mexico -- Texas might , by a more judicious and conciliatory diplomacy , have been as securely in the Union as she is now -- her boundaries defined -- California probably ours -- and Mexico and ourselves united by closer ties than ever ; of mutual friendship and mutual support in resistance to the intrusion of European interference in the affairs of the American republics . All this might have been , we little doubt , already secured , had counsels less violent , less rude , less one - sided , less eager in precipitation from motives widely foreign to the national question , presided over the earlier stages of its history . We cannot too deeply regret the mismanagement which has disfigured the history of this question ; and especially the neglect of the means which would have been so easy of satisfying even the unreasonable pretensions and the excited pride and passion of Mexico . The singular result has been produced , that while our neighbor has , in truth , no real right to blame or complain -- when all the wrong is on her side , and there has been on ours a degree of delay and forbearance , in deference to her pretensions , which is to be paralleled by few precedents in the history of other nations -- we have yet laid ourselves open to a great deal of denunciation hard to repel , and impossible to silence ; and all history will carry it down as a certain fact , that Mexico would have declared war against us , and would have waged it seriously , if she had not been prevented by that very weakness which should have constituted her best defence . We plead guilty to a degree of sensitive annoyance -- for the sake of the honor of our country , and its estimation in the public opinion of the world -- which does not find even in satisfied conscience full consolation for the very necessity of seeking consolation there . And it is for this state of things that we hold responsible that gratuitous mismanagement - wholly apart from the main substantial rights and merits of the question , to which alone it is to be ascribed ; and which had its origin in its earlier stages , before the accession of Mr. Calhoun to the department of State . California probably , next fall away from the loose adhesion which , in such a country as Mexico , holds a remote province in a slight equivocal kind of dependence on the metropolis . Imbecile and distracted , Mexico never can exert any real governmental authority over such a country . The impotence of the one and the distance of the other , must make the relation one of virtual independence ; unless , by stunting the province of all natural growth , and forbidding that immigration which can alone develop its capabilities and fulfil the purposes of its creation , tyranny may retain a military dominion , which is no government in the , legitimate sense of the term . In the case of California this is now impossible . The Anglo - Saxon foot is already on its borders . Already the advance guard of the irresistible army of Anglo - Saxon emigration has begun to pour down upon it , armed with the plough and the rifle , and marking its trail with schools and colleges , courts and representative halls , mills and meeting - houses . A population will soon be in actual occupation of California , over which it will be idle for Mexico to dream of dominion . They will necessarily become independent . All this without agency of our government , without responsibility of our people -- in the natural flow of events , the spontaneous working of principles , and the adaptation of the tendencies and wants of the human race to the elemental circumstances in the midst of which they find themselves placed . And they will have a right to independence -- to self - government -- to the possession of the homes conquered from the wilderness by their own labors and dangers , sufferings and sacrifices -a better and a truer right than the artificial tide of sovereignty in Mexico , a thousand miles distant , inheriting from Spain a title good only against those who have none better . Their right to independence will be the natural right of self - government belonging to any community strong enough to maintain it -- distinct in position , origin and character , and free from any mutual obligations of membership of a common political body , binding it to others by the duty of loyalty and compact of public faith . This will be their title to independence ; and by this title , there can be no doubt that the population now fast streaming down upon California win both assert and maintain that independence . Whether they will then attach themselves to our Union or not , is not to be predicted with any certainty . Unless the projected railroad across the continent to the Pacific be carried into effect , perhaps they may not ; though even in that case , the day is not distant when the Empires of the Atlantic and Pacific would again flow together into one , as soon as their inland border should approach each other . But that great work , colossal as appears the plan on its first suggestion , cannot remain long unbuilt . Its necessity for this very purpose of binding and holding together in its iron clasp our fast-settling Pacific region with that of the Mississippi valley -- the natural facility of the route -- the ease with which any amount of labor for the construction can be drawn in from the overcrowded populations of Europe , to be paid in die lands made valuable by the progress of the work itself -- and its immense utility to the commerce of the world with the whole eastern Asia , alone almost sufficient for the support of such a road -- these coast of considerations give assurance that the day cannot be distant which shall witness the conveyance of the representatives from Oregon and California to Washington within less time than a few years ago was devoted to a similar journey by those from Ohio ; while the magnetic telegraph will enable the editors of the \" San Francisco Union , \" the \" Astoria Evening Post , \" or the \" Nootka Morning News , \" to set up in type the first half of the President 's Inaugural before the echoes of the latter half shall have died away beneath the lofty porch of the Capitol , as spoken from his lips . Away , then , with all idle French talk of balances of power on the American Continent . There is no growth in Spanish America ! Whatever progress of population there may be in the British Canadas , is only for their own early severance of their present colonial relation to the little island three thousand miles across the Atlantic ; soon to be followed by Annexation , and destined to swell the still accumulating momentum of our progress . And whosoever may hold the balance , though they should cast into the opposite scale all the bayonets and cannon , not only of France and England , but of Europe entire , how would it kick the beam against the simple , solid weight of the two hundred and fifty , or three hundred millions -- and American millions -- destined to gather beneath the flutter of the stripes and stars , in the fast hastening year of the Lord 1945 !","annotations":[{"text":"our","span":[3702,3704],"token_span":[716,716],"role":"Protagonist","label":"Protagonist","role_definition":"The Protagonist is the one for whom the future State_of_affairs is destined."},{"text":"our","span":[3702,3704],"token_span":[716,716],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location in which State_of_affairs is destined to occur to the Protagonist."},{"text":"to overspread the continent","span":[3723,3749],"token_span":[719,722],"role":"State_of_affairs","label":"State_of_affairs","role_definition":"The State_of_affairs that is destined to occur to the Protagonist."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An State_of_affairs will come to hold with respect to a Protagonist at some future time.","frame_ancestors":["Eventive_affecting","Event"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-1543-1234-frame-Destroying","frame":"Destroying","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"On August 4 2020 , the museum sustained significant damage and some of its artworks were destroyed as a result of an ammonium nitrate explosion .","annotations":[{"text":"On August 4 2020","span":[0,15],"token_span":[0,3],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the Destroyer destroys the Patient."},{"text":"some of its artworks","span":[63,82],"token_span":[11,14],"role":"Patient","label":"Patient","role_definition":"The entity which is destroyed by the Destroyer."},{"text":"an ammonium nitrate explosion","span":[114,142],"token_span":[21,24],"role":"Cause","label":"Cause","role_definition":"The event or entity which is responsible for the destruction of the Patient."}],"trigger":{"text":"destroyed","start_char":89,"end_char":97,"start_token":16,"end_token":16,"frame":"Destroying"}},"source":{"text":"A devastating blast ripped through the Lebanese capital of Beirut yesterday , August 4 , killing at least 135 people and injuring approximately 5,000 according to the latest reports . The massive explosion , thought to be caused by a fire that broke out at a storage facility containing explosive materials at the port of Beirut , has decimated large parts of the city , including many of the Beirut 's galleries , museums , and art centers . Gallery director Gaia Foudolian and prominent architect Jean - Marc Bonfils both died in the blast . The explosion flattened much of the port district and sent shockwaves that shattered windows and ceilings of buildings across the city . Beirut 's city governor Marwan Abboud said that up to 300,000 people have lost their homes because of the devastation . Lebanon 's President Michel Aoun said that a fire detonated 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate , a chemical component used in fertilizers and bombs . The chemical had been stored at the port unsafely since 2014 , according to officials . The explosion is now under investigation . This calamity comes after months of political unrest in Lebanon and a crippling economic crisis exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic . Many of the city 's leading art venues were damaged in the blast . Marfa ' Gallery and Galerie Tanit , both located close to Beirut 's Port , were hit hardest . Sfeir Semler Gallery , a gallery in the Karantina district north of the port , was also damaged . The gallery , a staple in Beirut 's art scene , represents world - renowned Lebanese artists like Etel Adnan , Walid Raad , and Akram Zaatari . Gaia Foudolian , the director of Letitia Gallery in the Hamra district , died in the explosion , her colleagues confirmed to Hyperallergic . Architect Jean- Marc Bonfils , who designed the East Village building which houses Galerie Tanit in the Mar Mikhael neighborhood , also died from the blast . A gallery employee was seriously wounded , according to her colleagues . The blast also hit major art institutions in the city like the Sursock Museum , Ashkal Alwan , the Arab Image Foundation , and the Beirut Art Center , among others . Zeina Arida , the director of the Sursock Museum , was at her office when the explosion shook the building shortly after 6 pm on Tuesday . \u201c Luckily , the museum closed 15 minutes before the blast , \u201d Arida told Hyperallergic in a phone conversation from Beirut , adding that no visitors or staff were hurt . The blast , she said , was \u201c incomparable to anything we have ever witnessed . \u201d The explosion shattered the museum 's doors , windows , skylights , and collapsed the ceilings of some of its rooms . It also damaged a large number of artworks in its permanent collection , including a valuable 1930 portrait of the museum 's founder Nicolas Sursock by Dutch painter Kees van Dongen . Two ceramics by the Lebanese - American artist Simone Fattal were completely destroyed , among many other items in the collection . \u201c At first , we feared it was bombing , and that there would be more to follow , so we stayed in the building , \u201d Arida described the moments after the explosion . \u201c We quickly realized how great the damage is . \u201d In the face of this massive destruction , art institutions in Beirut are helping each other to protect their collections . The Arab Image Foundation , which suffered significant damage , relocated its servers to safe storage at the Sursock Museum , by Arida 's invitation . \u201c Our storage rooms are still sound and they are open to any organization that needs to store its collection , \u201d Arida said . Arida , who estimates the damage to the museum to be in the millions of dollars , expects restoration efforts to be hampered by the country 's economic crisis . \u201c The banks have confiscated our funds , \u201d she said . \u201c I do n't how we 're going to do it .

Class 221 Voyager diesels were to have covered all the Holyhead - London workings ; four of these had been built as four - car sets rather than five - car for this purpose and allocated to the Virgin West Coast franchise , all other 221s being Virgin CrossCountry stock . It had become a railway tradition to refer to locos stationed around the network for rescue purposes ' Thunderbirds ' after the famous TV show , and Virgin took this one step further by arranging for the 57/3s to be named for characters in the series . Cleverly , the first five have the final digit of their numbers the same as the relevant character 's transport in the stories . 57 301 is Scott Tracy , who piloted Thunderbird 1 , etc. 57 307 Lady Penelope has pink- backed nameplates to match the colour of the lady 's Rolls - Royce . Our picture shows 57 311 Tin Tin fresh out of the Brush works at Loughborough . In Summer 2003 , during the process of creation of the 57/3s , a change of plan occurred ; legend has it that this was brought about by the desire of North Wales MPs for a full breakfast service when travelling to London , something that the small Class 221 galley could not offer . Two weekday return workings to London would therefore be Pendolinos , hauled by Class 57 / 3s between Holyhead and Crewe . The original order for locos was increased from 12 to 16 , and the fitting of a ' Dellner ' automatic coupler to the locos was hastily designed , so that the coupling and uncoupling at Crewe could be done more quickly than by using the 390 's emergency screw - coupling as had originally been envisaged for ' dragging ' and diversion work . After 12 locos , there were no Thunderbirds characters left to use for names , so places and things from the show were resorted to for the final four . By January 2004 we were reporting that the couplers were in process of fitting , and work was under way to modify the exhaust system of the locos to prevent diesel fumes entering the 390 's air - conditioning . At one time it was thought that the 57/3 might have to push the train , but eventually this was resolved . Then the whole plan nearly foundered as it was discovered that a Pendolino , with its pantograph in the lowered position , was too high for the ' structure gauge ' in North Wales , and Network Rail had to do some work to allow them to run . But after all these problems were overcome , Pendolino service did begin in Spring 2005 . The weekday turns were , at various times , supplemented by summer weekend operations to release Class 221s to relieve overcrowding elsewhere in Britain . The two weekday trains , and some weekend workings , continued as Pendolinos until the December 2008 timetable change , after which only a single Saturday - only Pendolino return working remained . This was suspended for a while , but from May 2009 began running again , to maintain staff familairity with the procedure . By 2008 Virgin Trains had found that they had too many locos for their requirements , even though they were already hiring them out for use on timber trains to Chirk . Arriva Trains Wales were being asked by the Welsh Assembly Government to provide a loco - hauled express from North Wales to Cardiff , and Virgin Trains successfully bid to supply the locos , to be driven by ATW drivers , who were given a referesher course , as ATW had used the ' Thunderbirds ' for a while a couple of years before . The last four locos , 313 - 316 were chosen , perhaps because their ' vehicle ' names ( Tracy Island , Firefly , The Mole , FAB 1 ) not match the ' character ' names of the other twelve . 57 314 and 57 315 were de-named and re-liveried in a new version of Arriva Trains Wales colours for use on the Monday - Friday express from Holyhead to Cardiff and return , which commenced on 15 December 2008 . 57 313 and 57 316 appeared shortly afterwards , de-named , in a so-called ' neutral ' livery - the same blue but minus the lighter parts , and the logos - and are supposedly used ' when the branded locos are unavailable ' ( although in practice they appeared just as often as the branded ones ) . The Arriva service was taken over by DB Schenker Class 67s from the evening working of 26 March 2012 . In 2010 57s were replaced by Colas Rail Class 66s on timber traffic to Chirk ; from December 2009 on they could be seen on First Great Western loco - hauled trains in south - west England , but were soon removed from this duty due to unreliability . In August 2011 , six of the locos were given up by Virgin for further use by Network Rail , and were repainted in NR 's all - yellow livery . Changes were made to their couplers to allow them to haul various types of electric railcars used in the south - east . The nameplates were removed for sale in a charity auction . In March 2012 three more locos were de-branded , this time for transfer to DRS , and received DRS blue livery . In 2014 , Network Rail decided to give up its locos , and all six have passed to DRS and gained its livery . As for the four Arriva blue ones 313 - 316 , at the start of 2013 they were sold to charter train operator West Coast Railway Company and when repainted have appeared in maroon livery ; they make occasional forays to North Wales on excursions . Farewell to North Wales At the December 2012 timetable change , marking the end of Virgin 's franchse term ( although an abnormal extension was awarded to the company following much - publicised fisaco relating to the award of the next franchise ) the story of Class 57s and Pendolinos come to an end as far as the normal working of the North Wales line is concerned . It was planned to replace the solitary Saturday train with a pair of Class 221 Voyagers after the workings of 8 December , but in view of a series of problems in previous weeks , culminating in a failure to establish a control connection between loco and train on 1 December resulting in passengers being transferred to a Voyager at Crewe , it was decided to begin Voyager service a week early on 8 December , to the dismay of railfans who had hoped for a last ride . The three 57/3 locos which remained allocated to Virgin and in their livery ( 307 , 308 , 311 ) transferred to the DRS fleet , and ceased to be the maintenance responsibilty of Alstom 's Manchester Longsight depot . All are expected to receive DRS livery . By 7 December it was reported that 57 307 had already been sent to Eastleigh Works . Interestingly when it emerged in DRS blue livery the pink ' Lady Penelope ' nameplates were retained - a nice gesture by DRS . In spring 2013 57 311 was re-named simply as ' Thunderbird ' with a standard style nameplate . In future provide the Class 57/3 locomotives for ' rescue ' duty are hired by Virgin from DRS , although staffed by Virgin drivers , and will normally be located at Euston , Rugby , Crewe , Preston and Carlisle stations . DRS locos are also likely to appear from time to time on passenger charter trains in North Wales and elsewhere .

Skip to Comments Topics : Environment , Nuclear Weapons , Science Driving south on Christmas Island 's lone north- south road , Tonga Fou and I are heading to the spot where , 50 years ago , the British military detonated a couple of thermonuclear weapons . Fou , 81 , smokes USA Gold Full Flavor 100 cigarettes . As he runs a leathery hand across his forehead , he recalls his experience during one of the test explosions . Crowded onto a military vessel in case of an emergency evacuation , Fou huddled with his wife and two children . The blast shook the boat , as if it had been shoved by a deity , and everyone winced as their ears popped . About a minute after the detonation , Fou wandered on deck , looked up and thought the world was coming to an end . \u201c It was just terrible , \u201d he says . \u201c The mushroom cloud was beginning to come up , with these bright colors , like breaking waves of fire , going up , bigger and bigger , until the sky was all red . \u201d Between 1957 and 1962 , this former British colony in the equatorial Pacific played involuntary host to 30 nuclear explosions conducted by the British and U.S. militaries . Code-named Operation Grapple , Britain 's tests at Christmas ( also known as Kiritimati ) and neighboring Malden Island ranged from a 3,000 - kiloton explosion 8,200 feet in the air and far out to sea , to a 24- kiloton \u201c balloon - suspended air burst over land . \u201d ( For comparison , the bomb dropped at Hiroshima had about a 15 - kiloton yield . ) With thousands of troops , weekly DDT spraying to keep fly populations at bay , and a steady stream of boats and airplanes delivering ever more provisions , it 's safe to say that the Cold War 's tenure on Christmas Island did n't exactly follow the mindful traveler 's dictum : Take only pictures , leave only footprints . But things change , even in places where WMD have inflicted their catastrophic toll . The Partial Test Ban Treaty , signed in 1963 , brought an end to U.S. and British testing in the region . In the ' 70s , the British government followed up at Christmas with Operation Hard Look , investigating whether radioactive fallout might be found on the island and , if so , determining what to do with it . They did n't find any , although there was no shortage of trash \u2014 abandoned vehicles and drums , mostly , decaying rapidly in the humid climate . In 1975 , American surveyors drew the same conclusion about lingering radioactivity . Still , for goodwill , to avoid future liability , or both , the British recently carried out a cleanup operation on Christmas , carting away tons of decades - old debris , most of which had been concentrated in a junkyard next to the village of Banana and totaled more than 30,000 cubic yards of material . Last May , the final shipment of waste was loaded onto a vessel bound for the U.K. Fou is the last living person on Christmas Island who was here when the nukes , nuke scientists and soldiers came to town . Now only fragments of that era remain : old truck tires stacked as a makeshift fence between village huts , concrete platforms where buildings once stood , a rotted wooden backboard on a metal pole \u2014 what was once a basketball hoop for recreating servicemen \u2014 and a crumbling church constructed of dead coral and concrete . What can be found in abundance , however , is nature . In the intervening decades since the era of nuclear - weapons testing , the natural world has quietly rebounded . Today , Christmas Island , Bikini Atoll and other Cold War proving grounds , like Monte Bello north of Perth , Australia , constitute some of the most ecologically intact corners of the world , emitting not radiation but a peculiar allure ; it 's atomic tourism with a naturalist spin . Marine biologists diving at Bikini have returned with glowing reports . Inspecting a mile - wide crater left by a hydrogen bomb that exploded with a force 1,000 times greater than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima , researchers recently found the lagoon to be 80 percent covered by thriving corals , with some species growing into huge , treelike formations . Karen Koltes , a coral specialist with the U.S. Department of the Interior , says reefs around places like Bikini \u201c are among the few examples left in the world of what an ecosystem looks like absent human presence and exploitation . \u201d ( Unintentionally pouring on the irony , scientists will sometimes employ the word \u201c pristine . \u201d ) This nature - despite - nukes contrast can be seen at other former test sites , such as the waters surrounding Alaska 's Amchitka Island where , 40 years ago , the U.S. conducted three underground explosions . The same is true of the desolate dunes of a former French test site in Algeria , and even the scrublands inside the fence at the Nevada Test Site . Radioactive materials are long - lasting , which is what makes them both scary and misunderstood . The smoke detectors in your home likely contain a radionuclide called americium . But the reason to worry about them has nothing to do with radioactive material and everything to do with whether the detector 's battery is working . Contrary to popular belief , previously bombed geographies are not transformed into lifeless , poisoned landscapes for the next 50,000 years . Hiroshima and Nagasaki look just like every other bustling Japanese city , and crawling around in the grass of a city park there is no different than doing so in Seattle or Milan , Italy , or Auckland , New Zealand , at least as far as radiation hazard is concerned . But that 's not to say everything is peachy with former nuke test sites . Radioactive fallout , and the dizzyingly complex study of it , depends on factors such as microclimates , local geography , wind , altitude of detonation , size of the bomb and environmental conditions on the ground like soils , rock type and vegetation . There are places in the Pacific you do n't want to go and probably ca n't \u2014 that 's why they 're off limits . The same is true for parts of the Nevada Test Site and other detonation locations . On or around once - pummeled Pacific Islands , the matter of harmful radiation depends on where you go and whom you ask . Christmas Island , as far as anyone can tell , was always safe from radioactivity , thanks to winds that carried fallout out to sea . And in the ocean \u2014 not just around Christmas but anywhere \u2014 radioactive materials dilute quickly , rendering them essentially harmless . It 's when they 're concentrated that they can be dangerous . At places like Bikini and Rongelap Atolls in the Marshall Islands , the picture gets murkier . In the 1950s , the locals on Rongelap watched fallout , delivered on the wind , sprinkle down from above like snow . ( And this from a people who had never seen snow . ) The islanders were evacuated , only to return and then evacuate again years later because of renewed fears about perceived radiation hazards . Today , the people of Rongelap are planning to resettle their homeland yet again . The government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands wants the U.S. to cough up money and medical support for cancers caused and damage done during the era of nuclear testing . The U.S. says a previous settlement of $ 150 million should have done the trick , and this conflict remains a contentious one , at least for the Marshallese . As for existing radiation hazard , U.S. and independent scientists say there is none , although you would n't want to dine month after month on certain local plants that accumulate radioactive material . Still , it 's one thing to accept government reports declaring that a place once used for thermonuclear target practice is fallout - free and not hazardous to one 's health . It 's quite another thing to travel there on vacation . Geiger counter in hand , I hopped off the skiff and onto the coral beach at the tiny island of Motu Tabu , inside the lagoon at Christmas Island . Rain showers gave way to a mix of billowing clouds and hammering equatorial sunshine . The cacophony from the seabird colony intensified as I approached , but the thousands of noddy and sooty terns did not leave their posts , standing guard over black - speckled eggs . Encountering animals so unaccustomed to human visitors , I thought of Darwin in the Galapagos . I switched on the Geiger counter and squinted at the digital display . The readings were minuscule \u2014 0.008 , 0.003 , 0.006 milli-Roentgens per hour \u2014 numbers indicating nothing more than background radiation from the sun , and noticeably lower than the background radiation levels one would find in a typical American city . For an unconventional island adventure away from it all , Bikini may have the name recognition , but Christmas is easier for most Americans to get to \u2014 just a three - hour flight from Honolulu . The largest coral atoll on the planet , Christmas is 124 square miles of land , set in the shape of a globular crucifix , with two spits at the northern end enclosing a lagoon . ( The island first became known to the Western world when Capt. James Cook discovered it on Christmas Eve , 1777 . ) The island is perfectly \u2014 no , ridiculously \u2014 flat . The highest point is a 35 - foot-high mound , Joe 's Hill , erected by a British serviceman who was bulldozing coral and tar sands to construct the road that runs the length of the island . According to one account , he made the miniature hill as a perch for camping , preferring the seaside solitude to the military barracks . The rest of the island setting is made up of palm trees , a ubiquitous plant called saltbush , inedible crabs skittering everywhere , and sun that will burn you through a T-shirt . In 1979 , the British ceded possession of the island , and Christmas became the easternmost outpost of the scattered island nation of Kiribati . Straddling the international dateline , the country covers an area of the Pacific Ocean equal to that of the continental U.S. , even though the tiny islands together total 311 square miles . The island 's 5,000 residents subsist on international aid , tropical fish exports and scarce tourist dollars . They live in tiny villages composed of huts and yards patched together with tin , palm -thatched roofs and pigs roaming streets littered with rusting corned beef cans . The splendor of this place is out on , and in , the water . Fly- fishing enthusiasts who come to Christmas are on a pilgrimage to stalk the elusive , torpedo - fast and deceptively strong bonefish . Christmas is home to the largest bonefishing flats in the world , shallow waters in which the fish feed on tiny shrimp , sometimes revealing their whereabouts by nosing into the sand and extending their sparkling silvery tails above the waterline . When I called one fly - fishing expert who had been to Christmas to ask for a few travel tips , he said , \u201c If you go there without a fishing rod , you should be shot . \u201d Vacationing anglers , decked out in $ 100 UV - protective shirts , long - billed hats and polarized sunglasses , carrying in their rod setup and tackle cases another $ 1,500 worth of gear , spend upward of 10 hours a day wading in the calf - deep waters of the lagoon , casting shrimp - shaped flies toward their prey . The visiting sport-fishermen are so essential to the barely extant island economy that locals are , at least on paper , forbidden from eating the bonefish . ( Inedible in the eyes of most Westerners , bonefish are part of the islanders ' regular menu . ) But some non-fishing - obsessed travelers do manage to make their way to Christmas . One morning , paddling kayaks on the far side of the lagoon , Garry and Kerry Phillips of Brisbane , Australia , were delighted to spend an afternoon in a place where they did n't see another soul for hours \u2014 only manta rays gliding through the shallows . Having traveled and scuba-dived throughout the Pacific and points beyond , they were stunned by the quality of what they saw on the island of nuclear detonations . \u201c When we were looking into this trip , I did consider the weapons , \u201d recalls Garry . \u201c I wondered if it might look like a concrete wasteland or something . \u201d But after a week spent kayaking in the aquamarine flats , snorkeling among kaleidoscopic reef fish , and then , at the seabird colony , appreciating the chance to spot rare bird species such as the phoenix petrel and red-footed booby , Phillips laughed at his pre-trip preconceptions . \u201c The contrast of it is amazing . I mean , the hydrogen bomb is the most powerful and destructive thing there is , right ? Yet out here , this place , and the reefs we saw yesterday \u2014 it 's just gorgeous . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"Christmas Island","span":[54,69],"token_span":[10,11],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the place where the Agent detonates the Explosive."},{"text":"the British military","span":[311,330],"token_span":[58,60],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent detonates the Explosive."},{"text":"Between 1957 and 1962","span":[1085,1105],"token_span":[216,219],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the Agent detonates the Explosive."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Agent causes an Explosive device to explode.","frame_ancestors":["Using","Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-4452-124-frame-Dispersal","frame":"Dispersal","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"The attacks occurred during a three - week period causing a \" Jaws - like mania \" and the construction of lifeguard towers and the establishment of a shark patrol for the beaches of Zihuatanejo and north .

It was a rare phenomenon that subsided after the sharks dispersed . This spring in Zihuatanejo , the sleepy neighbor of Ixtapa , surfers planning spring and summer trips will again be mindful of sharks .

Kunze said the main route through the area , Highway 200 , is \" the only route that the narcos can take their product overland to get to the north \" and that some of that product , marijuana and opium poppies , are grown in Guerrero 's mountain villages . \" A cartel needs to have exclusive rights to a crop of a village , and it needs to be able to get it moved north , \" Kunze added . But the construction contractor / fly - fishing guide stressed that those who are n't involved in the drug trade or in the war with cartels are not affected . \" Just use common sense , \" Kunze advised . \" Do not go out late at night to strip joints , high - profile bars or discos , where young men with a lot of money to flash around would hang out .

In what university did he teach ? Finally , someone him found him \u2014 on the docks of San Francisco , loading freight . Eric Hoffer spoke with a gruff German accent , but he was an American original . He never traveled outside the country . Orphaned at eighteen , he \u201c wandered up and down the land , dodging hunger and grieving over the world . \u201d He pondered suicide , survived Skid Row , and worked as a field hand , dishwasher , longshoreman . Yet he kept his faith in America , and shared it . Hoffer , said CBS ' newsman Eric Sevareid , \u201c made millions of confused and troubled Americans feel very much better about their country . He showed them again the old truths about America and why they remain alive and valid . \u201d All writers live for ideas but Eric Hoffer lived with them . He had no siblings , wife , or family . His sad but inspiring life made Hoffer himself a true believer \u2014 in truth . Hoffer claimed he was born in the Bronx at the turn of the century , but there was no birth certificate , no census record . More certain was the signature moment in his childhood when his mother , carrying him down the stairs , fell . Elsa Hopper never recovered , dying two years later . Her son soon went blind . For eight years , Hoffer lived deep inside his darkness . When he recovered his eyesight , fear of recurring blindness gave Hoffer , who never spent a day in school , an insatiable appetite for reading . A few years later , when his father died , Hoffer threw himself into America . Throughout the 1920s , he lived in L.A. , working odd jobs , living in tenements , reading , reading . From stacks of index cards scribbled with quotes , he culled his philosophy . During the Depression , he again hit the road , working in California 's vast farm fields . In every town where he picked crops , he had a library card . \u201c My writing is done in railroad yards while waiting for a freight , \u201d he said , \u201c in the fields while waiting for a truck , and at noon after lunch . Towns are too distracting . \u201d In 1938 , Hoffer sent an article about tramps to a magazine . The magazine turned it down , but the editor kept in touch . A decade later , settled in San Francisco , Hoffer sent the woman a hand - written manuscript . She typed it , submitted it , and in 1951 , The True Believer : Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements was published . Its author was a middle - aged longshoreman hailed by the New York Times as \u201c a genius against insuperable odds , capable of amazing insights into history . \u201d So who was Hoffer 's True Believer ? In the age of Hitler , Stalin , and Mao , he was the fresh convert to a cult of personality . \u201c The true believer is everywhere on the march , \u201d Hoffer wrote . But tyrants , he cautioned , do not rule solely by coercion . True believers surrender their independence because it has gotten them nowhere . Disillusioned and defeated , they follow promises of greatness en masse . Fascism . Communism . Nationalism . Believe . Join . Trust us . \u201c The less justified a man is in claiming excellence for his own self , \u201d Hoffer wrote , \u201c the more ready he is to claim all excellence for his nation , his religion , his race or his holy cause . \u201d Hmmm . The True Believer made Hoffer 's name but not much money . He published more books \u2014 The Passionate State of Mind , The Ordeal of Change \u2014 but kept his job on the docks . On into the 1960s , he walked daily in Golden Gate Park , stopping to write in notebooks . Living alone in a small flat with no phone , no TV , he courted ideas . \u201c I get the longshoremen mad when I say , ' You know , I ca n't think of anything more exciting than going to bed with a half - finished paragraph . ' \u201d Amidst growing acclaim , Hoffer taught classes at Berkeley and wrote a syndicated column . LBJ consulted with him . Journalists sought his opinions . Finally , in 1967 , Hoffer quit working and withdrew from public life . ' I 'm going to crawl back into my hole where I started , \u201d he said . \u201c I do n't want to be a public person or anybody 's spokesman . . . Any man can ride a train . Only a wise man knows when to get off . \u201d Hoffer died in 1983 . He left behind nine books and 100 + notebooks now at Stanford 's Hoover Institute . But he also left a unique understanding of charismatic leaders and the followers who trade reason for blind faith . True believers , it seems , are still on the march and the longshoreman-philosopher can help us understand them . \u201c Power corrupts the few , while weakness corrupts the many , \u201d Hoffer wrote . \u201c Hatred , malice , rudeness , intolerance , and suspicion are the faults of weakness . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"Eric Hoffer","span":[560,570],"token_span":[105,106],"role":"Dodger","label":"Dodger","role_definition":"The Dodger acts to avoid an oncoming Bad_entity."},{"text":"hunger","span":[749,754],"token_span":[142,142],"role":"Bad_entity","label":"Bad_entity","role_definition":"The Bad_entity is the oncoming entity to avoid."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"A Dodger acts to avoid an oncoming moving Bad_entity.","frame_ancestors":["Avoiding","Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-2780-724-frame-Dominate_competitor","frame":"Dominate_competitor","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"But East Carolina could n't get its ground game going , either \u2014 Brandon Fractious led the Pirates with 13 yards rushing , and the Pirates finished with 41 yards on the ground .

( AP ) -- Patrick White showed there 's more to West Virginia 's offense than just handing off to Steve Slaton . White threw for a personal - best 216 yards and two touchdowns and ran for another score , and the No. 4 Mountaineers overcame Slaton 's least - productive game of the season and pulled away late in a 27 - 10 victory over East Carolina on Saturday night . \" I guess we can throw it around a little bit , \" White said . \" They did a good job of defending the run . Their safeties came down , defended the run well . \" White was 17 - of - 24 passing with touchdown passes of 3 yards to Owen Schmitt and 60 yards to Darius Reynaud . The Mountaineers ( 4 - 0 ) shook off some sloppy play -- including White 's three interceptions -- to win their 11th straight game . \" I go back to a few years ago , when we were mad at certain wins if we did n't think we won by enough , \" coach Rich Rodriguez said . \" I 'm not going to be that way . \" The Pirates held Slaton , who entered as the nation 's third - leading rusher , to 80 yards -- less than half of his 168 - yard average -- and afterward he said he was bothered by cramps blamed on the hot , humid weather . \" They came in very prepared , and we were in their yard , \" Slaton said . \" We ca n't have the best games every week . There 's going to be times you get stopped , and that 's what happened today . \" West Virginia entered as the nation 's top rushing team and hoped to roll up big numbers again on an East Carolina defense that ranked among the worst in Conference USA against the run . But coach Skip Holtz 's Pirates refused to allow the Mountaineers to run wild , leaving it up to White to make the big plays . West Virginia led just 17 - 10 early in the fourth quarter when White flipped a pass to Reynaud , who zigzagged 60 yards back across the field and through the Pirates ' defense for the clinching touchdown . \" That was a good gut check for us , \" Rodriguez said . Reynaud finished with five catches for 110 yards and became the first West Virginia player with more than 100 yards receiving since November 2004 , when Chris Henry had 118 against Boston College . West Virginia needed big passing numbers because East Carolina derailed the Mountaineers ' ground game for the second straight year . \" We probably pressed a little bit too much , \" Rodriguez said . The Mountaineers had just 153 yards rushing -- 197 fewer than its nation - leading average of 350 ; a year ago , East Carolina held West Virginia to just 127 yards rushing . James Pinkney was 20 - of - 40 for 247 yards with a touchdown for the Pirates ( 1 - 3 ) , and Aundrae Allison had four catches for 54 yards and a touchdown . But East Carolina could n't get its ground game going , either -- Brandon Fractious led the Pirates with 13 yards rushing , and the Pirates finished with 41 yards on the ground . \" We have to start running the ball to win games , \" Holtz said . \" We ca n't put the quarterback back there and have everyone know what we 're doing and let him continue to take the shots he 's taking . \" West Virginia dominated the first half , holding three - touchdown underdog East Carolina to 2 yards rushing and gaining 221 yards to the Pirates ' 87 , but led just 14 - 7 at halftime largely because of two interceptions thrown by White in the end zone . White capped West Virginia 's opening drive with a 5 - yard touchdown run , then flipped his scoring pass to Schmitt early in the second quarter to snap a 7 - all tie . Pinkney found his favorite target -- Allison -- behind the West Virginia defense for a 47 - yard touchdown pass midway through the first , tying it 7 - 7 . Pat McAfee had field goals of 26 and 29 yards in the second half for West Virginia . The Pirates closed to seven points early in the fourth on Robert Lee 's 27 - yard field goal . \" It 's frustrating to watch a team play that hard and improve as much as they have in some areas but continue to come up short , \" Holtz said .

Please visit www.Hendersonville.com for the latest news , events , and more . As part of North Carolina 's statewide celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Wright Brothers ' flight , Smith - McDowell House Museum will host a special exhibit , \" Kiffin Rockwell and the Lafayette Escadrille , \" from April 17 through August 24 , 2003 . Developed by the Museum , this exhibit showcases the important role Kiffin Rockwell and the French Foreign Legion 's Lafayette Escadrille played in the advancement of the early days of military aviation . Kiffin Yates Rockwell , born September 20 , 1892 , in Newport , Tennessee , moved to Asheville with his widowed mother , older brother , and younger sister in 1906 . As a young child , he attended the Orange Street School . Always considered handsome , intelligent , and adventurous by those who knew him , he was well educated , attending Virginia Military Institute and Washington and Lee University before leaving his educational career behind , along with his brother Paul , for a career in advertising in Atlanta . But adventure was calling , and the family 's French roots had always intrigued the brothers . So , when France found itself fighting for its very existence in World War I - prior to the United States ' entry into the war - both Kiffin and Paul volunteered for the French Foreign Legion ( the legendary French Foreign Legion , still active today , accepts foreign nationals in military service for France ) . Following service in the trenches with the infantry - during which both Paul and Kiffin received gunshot injuries that required extended recovery - Kiffin , along with six other Americans , formed the Escadrille Americaine , an airplane fighter unit that was later expanded to include thirty - one American aces and renamed the Lafayette Escadrille . Kiffin Rockwell became an overnight international sensation when he became the first American pilot to shoot down a German airplane in a dogfight in the skies over Alsace , France , on May 18 , 1916 , only five days after the unit flew its first mission . For his actions , Rockwell was awarded the Medaille Militaire and the Croix de Guirre . Rockwell was dogged in his pursuit of German enemy planes - in spite of being wounded in the face with an explosive bullet from an enemy airplane on May 26 , 1916 , he refused treatment in a French hospital and continued to fly . Unfortunately , Rockwell 's remaining days of heroism were few . On September 23 , 1916 , only four short months after his first enemy engagement , Rockwell was shot and killed over France , only two miles from where he had scored his first enemy kill . He was buried in France two days later with full military honors . He was awarded posthumously the Cross of the Legion of Honor . He was only 24 at the time of his death . Rockwell family home in Asheville was on Hillside Street , off the west side of Merrimon Avenue . A North Carolina historic sign marks the site . The Smith - McDowell House Museum is located at 283 Victoria Road in Asheville on the campus of AB Tech . The Museum is open Tuesday through Saturday , 10 AM -4 PM , and on Sunday from 1 - 4PM . Admission is $ 5 adults , $ 4 seniors and students , and $ 3 for ages 5 - 18 . Children under 5 are admitted free .

She was signed to a major record label the day after moving to Los Angeles a few years ago , but left that behind because the label did n't see her full artistic vision . The rocker , who glams it up with her platinum blond and black hairstyle and skin-tight outfits , previously landed on Virgin Records but has crafted her debut album on Universal Republic . The 25- year- old worked alongside RedOne , who 's worked with the likes of Lady Gaga and Kat DeLuna , on the effort . Black , a Detroit native , has already hit stadiums around the country on the sold - out I Am Music II tour with Lil 'Wayne , Nicki Minaj and Rick Ross . You recently wrapped up a sold - out run with Lil Wayne . What 's it like to be back home after being on the road for so long ? It feels so good . I was so excited to lay on my bed ! It 's been nice . I 'm getting to see all my friends again . Not to sound like a stalker here , but you just tweeted a picture of your bed . Tell me about some of the things hanging on your wall . I have this friend that does artwork and he did the photo of me with a gas mask and the Ol' Dirty Bastard one . I have this weird painting of a cow and a silver horse head with a Barbie riding it . I just have all sorts of weird , random stuff . My whole apartment is randomly out of control . Tell me what you 're like on stage . I noticed you tour with a full band . How 's that going over live ? I 've got a full band and two back - up dancers . We 've been getting a great reaction from people . I 'm excited . People are getting into it and they 're not really familiar with the music yet . Is life on the road something that 's easy for you to get used to ? It 's a lot of fun . Everybody on the whole tour is like family . It 's like one big party \u2013 hanging out with everybody , getting dressed up , playing shows and doing what we love to do . I 'm into it . Getting to see the country is interesting . I 'll tell you a secret here . Most people think of me as a metalhead or the rocker guy , but I quietly own every Britney Spears CD . When I first saw you and heard the single I thought , \u201c Holy shit ! It 's about time I heard something like this ! \u201d The attitude is through the roof ! Tell me a little about yourself and how Porcelain Black came to be . I 've been working in music for a while . I had a deal with Virgin Records originally and that ended up not working out . That project was called Porcelain and the Tramps . They did n't understand the vision of what we were going for . I 've had this vision for a long time . I 've always said if Britney Spears and Marilyn Manson fucked and had a kid then it would be me ! I tried to explain that to the people at Virgin and they just did n't get it . They wanted me to do an Avril Lavigne pop thing . I 'm doing music I love and this is the kind of music I love to write . I ended up meeting Red One and we started working on the record . We clicked right away and he totally got the vision . He was into it . We went in the studio and the first song we did was \u201c This Is What Rock N Roll Looks Like . \u201d Red is a total metalhead at heart , too . He used to have long hair and play in metal bands and stuff . After watching the video for \u201c This Is What Rock N Roll Looks Like , \u201d I 'm just curious what you were like in high school . Did you carry this same attitude with you then ? I only went to high school until I was 15 . I got kicked out of two high schools in three months . I faked being home schooled online until I was 16 because you ca n't legally drop out until then . My hair was always crazy , different colors . I 'm pretty much the same now . I had a mohawk . It was black and blue , then it was red . I do n't think I 've changed too much . I 've always known who I was from the beginning . I 'm still that way ! ( laughs ) I was pretty out of control when I was younger . My mom was like , \u201c Oh god , I hate my life ! My daughter is such a psycho ! \u201d ( laughs ) Your dad was a hairdresser so he at least got to help you color your hair , right ? Yeah , yeah ! It 's funny because my mom is super-straight and is an accountant for a living . My dad was a hairdresser and played in a band and was super rock 'n roll . I know you want to hit as many people as you can with your music but what audience is going to grab onto it first ? There are so many directions it could go . I do n't know .

Watford were fifth in the Premier League when Silva was allegedly ' tapped up ' by the Toffees with regards to taking the vacancy left by Ronald Koeman 's departure .

Watford had placed a formal complaint with the league over Everton 's ' illegal approach ' , suggesting that Everton had turned the head of Silva whilst in charge of the Hornets and destabilised their season .

In a club statement confirming the sacking of Silva , Watford stated : \u201c The Club is convinced the appointment of Silva was the right one and had it not been for the unwarranted approach by a Premier League rival for his services we would have continued to prosper under his leadership . \u201c The catalyst for this decision is that unwarranted approach , something which the Board believes has seen a significant deterioration in both focus and results to the point where the long - term future of Watford FC has been jeopardised . \u201d Watford currently sit one place above Everton in eighth .

Their construction was put to a halt for the projects , most of them hydro - or thermal power plants , failed to have an environmental impact assessment according to law . All would have obvious environmental consequences if no measure is taken to curb their possible hazardous impact , so an advanced assessment on their environmental impact is necessary according to law . However , construction of these projects was launched without proper environmental assessment before hand . Hailed by media and the public as \" an environmental storm , \" SEPA 's act to halt their construction marked a departure from its old image as a rubberstamp of such wrongdoings . \" We are determination to investigate and punish any violations of environmental laws and environmental assessment is never a rubber stamp , \" says Pan Yue , deputy -director of SEPA . Interestingly , the top three on the \" black list \" were all hydro - power plants under China 's Three Gorges Project Company , which claims millions yuan of government input as key projects to alleviate the country 's energy plight and hinges on the same administrative level with SEPA . So the unprecedented campaign certainly incurred great pressure on SEPA . Yet the move won the praise from Premier Wen Jiabao , who openly applauded SEPA 's campaign at a State Council conference . Also backing the move were more than 50 environmental non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , which have enthusiastically responded by co-signing a public letter to welcome the act . Although one month later , most of the 30 halted projects resumed their construction , reportedly having passed the environmental assessment , the act that these key projects ' construction was ever suspended made a history , says an official of SEPA . SEPA alone can never guarantee the full enforcement of environmental laws and regulations , observes Prof . Wang Canfa , director of the center to help environmental victims at China University of Political Sciences and Law . In fact , according to Wang , the rate of China 's environmental laws and regulations that are actually enforced is estimated to be barely 10 percent . For instance , he notes , China 's criminal law that includes clear stipulations on crimes of serious environmental accidents took effect in 1997 . In the following five years the country recorded at least 50 serious environmental accidents a year based on official estimation , but to date no more than 20 people have been held accountable . \" This is what happens with the enforcement of criminal law that deals with the most serious cases of environmental accidents in the legal system , and you can imagine what happens to other environmental laws , \" laments Prof . Wang . A joint investigation by SEPA and Ministry of Land and Resources in 2004 shows that 30 to 40 percent of the mining construction projects went through the procedure of environment impact assessment as required , while in some areas only 6 to 7 percent did so . This partly explains why China has witnessed so many mining accidents in recent years . Wang and his colleagues started to offer legal assistance to the victims of environmental accidents five years ago , and the biggest obstacle remains in the \" environment \" to enforce law . Last year , Wang recalls , he tried to help a local fisherman in southwestern China 's Chongqing , who went bankrupt as his fish farm was poisoned by the waste water discharged into the river from a local chemical plant . The fisherman sued the chemical plant with help from Wang . But a judge from the county court told Wang matter - of - factly that a county leader had made phone calls asking favor for the chemical plant , which set the tone of verdict even before the trial . The reason was simple : the chemical plant turns is a major contributor to the local revenue . China 's central government has embraced the \" scientific approach to development , \" which emphasizes the balance between economic development and environmental sustainability . But some local officials still prioritize GDP growth over environmental protection , partly due to the current evaluation system of political performance , says a senior official from SEPA on condition of anonymity . The evaluation system is being re-structured by introducing the new concept of green GDP , which would calculate the environmental and ecological cost along with the economic growth , and the achievements may be offset if the cost is too dear . SEPA and the Organizational Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China , which is in charge of Party officials ' promotion , are studying how to incorporate environmental parameters into evaluating an official 's performance , such as overall environmental quality based on public survey , quality of air and drinking water , forest coverage and so on . While the \" economy - goes - first \" mentality lingers on the minds of many local officials , environmental departments are expected to be watchdogs to form some counter - balance . But this is not easy to realize in reality , as local environmental protection bureaus remain part of the local government , which controls their budget and staff , instead of reporting directly to SEPA . \" When you are opposed to a project out of environmental concerns , you have to think of the possible consequence , as your boss is certainly not in favor of your objection , \" says the SEPA official . To change this situation , reforms in power structure have been started on a trial basis . For two years the provincial environmental protection administration of Shaanxi in northwestern China has required the local environmental bureaus at city and county levels to directly report to the provincial administration instead of local governments , so as to guarantee their independence to enforce environmental laws and regulations despite local administrative interventions . Similar experiments have been carried out for the past ten years in dozens of large and medium - sized cities nationwide , such as Dalian , Ningbo and Xiamen . Further steps are being considered for SEPA , the theoretically highest body to enforce environmental laws and regulations , to set up monitoring mechanism directly at major sites of significant ecological or geographical values , lest local bureaus fail to function as they should . An encouraging progress in China 's enforcement of environmental laws lies in the greater public participation , evidenced by the emergence of environmental NGOs as among the most active players in China 's growing civil society . Domestic organizations like Friends of Nature have successfully launched high - profile environmental awareness campaigns among the general public for years , while international activist groups like Greenpeace have been whistle - blowing about grave environmental damages caused by multi-national companies in China . On the individual level , more and more victims have resorted to law thanks to help from professionals like Prof . Wang and his colleagues . The fisherman from Chongqing remains unbeaten even though the local judge would not support him . \" I 'm going to appeal my case to the highest court in Beijing if local courts fail to do me justice , \" he claims . \" If Beijing also fails me , I 'm going to bring my case to the United Nations ' Environment Program ! \"","annotations":[{"text":"the State Environmental Protection Administration ( SEPA )","span":[174,231],"token_span":[31,38],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent, often an institution, governmental organization, or arm thereof, puts into effect (i.e., enforces) a Rule."},{"text":"in December 2004","span":[233,248],"token_span":[39,41],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time at which the Agent enforces the Rule."},{"text":"China","span":[252,256],"token_span":[43,43],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place at which the Rule is or is not enforced."},{"text":"environmental laws","span":[304,321],"token_span":[52,53],"role":"Rule","label":"Rule","role_definition":"The Rule is the set of constrants on behavior that the Agent implements (i.e., forces others to obey or face consequences)."},{"text":"SEPA 's act to halt their construction","span":[871,908],"token_span":[147,153],"role":"Medium","label":"Medium","role_definition":"This role describes the medium through which the rule was enforced.

Between 1565 and 1815 , when Mexico revolted against Spain , hundreds of Filipino mariners jumped ship in Mexico to escape the brutality of Spanish masters and some migrated east to Louisiana . Filipino settlements were established in Louisiana as early as 1765.1 The early Filipino population was exclusively male and intermarried with local women , including Indian women . 2 During the 19th century , large numbers of Chinese and Filipinos came to the United States to work on plantations and railroads . Modern descendants recount the marriage of Hilario Hongo , a Chinese farm worker who arrived in Louisiana via Cuba in 1867 , and Azelie Phillip , an Indian woman . 3 Some other Filipino and Chinese laborers who remained in the U.S. were adopted into Indian nations and intermarried with Native women . Their descendants are counted among Indians . Filipinos worked as crew members aboard whaling ships which wintered in Alaska in the 1850s . Research from the Alaska Historical Commission reveals the oral tradition of the Inupiat Eskimos to contain words picked up from Filipinos . 4 Alaskan fish canneries saw an influx of thousands of Filipino workers during the 1920s and the decades following . Filipino American communities grew in the coastal villages of Southwestern , Southcentral and Southeastern Alaska when some of these cannery workers stayed and married Alaskan Native women . Their children have been among stockholders in the Native corporations established by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 . Some of these second - generation Pinoys , Filipino - Alaskan Natives , had taken leadership roles in the Native corporations . 5 Filipino men came to the West Coast in the 1920s and 1930s , to fill the labor shortage caused by immigration bans against Chinese and Japanese . On Bainbridge Island , WA , many of these immigrants settled down with Native American women . Their descendants celebrate their unique heritage in the annual Bainbridge Island Indipino Festival . 6 Born Bernie Reyes to a Filipino immigrant father and indigenous Indian mother , Bernie Whitebear grew up in poverty on the Colville Indian Reservation in Eastern Washington , and eventually worked at Boeing as an engineer . His parents later separated and his mother remarried a Chinese American . Bernie took on the name Whitebear in honor of his maternal grandfather , and became a prominent leader among Seattle 's Indians . In 1970 , he founded the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation . In the same year , UIATF occupied Fort Lawton in Seattle , which was originally Indian land . This effort received the support of non-Indians , including Filipino American activist Bob Santos . 7 UIATF and the city eventually reached an agreement for a 99 - year lease on a parcel of land in the former Fort Lawton . The land was used to build an Indian cultural center which also provided educational and social services . Whitebear passed away in 2000 . He was survived by siblings Luana Reyes , Teresa Wong , Laura Wong Whitebear , Lawney Reyes and Harry Wong . For an overview of Whitebear 's life and achievements , see AP article Seattle Indian activist dies of colon cancer . Dale Tiffany , a Flathead Indian from Spokane , became involved in Filipino community activism in the course of his marriage to Jeannette , a member of a pioneer Seattle Filipino family .

Speakers emphasised the urgent need for more Buddhist teachers and organisations to get involve with the Dalit Buddhist movement . Workshops looked at the issues around the self empowerment of the Dalits and the need to take the Dharma to these communities . In addition there was a concert given by the sitar virtuoso Baluji Shrivastau who identified himself with the work for the Dalit cause . \u201c I feel honoured to take part in this momentous event \u201d he said to the packed shrine room of the North London Buddhist Centre .

and general Kim Pusik ( 1075 - 1151 ) was a minister in the Kory\u00f3 dynasty government and wrote the earliest official Korean history . The literary appelation of Kim Pusik was Noech '\u00f3n ( Thunder River ) , and his style was lpji ( Establisher ) . He was the son of Kim K\u00fan , a public official . In 1097 , together with his brothers , Kim Pusik qualified in the government entrance examination on the Book of Documents . In 1115 Kim was appointed to a junior position in the Office of Remonstrance . He held positions of gradually increasing responsibility until 1124 , when he was made fourth secretary of the Board of Rites . Two years later he rose to the position of assistant inspector general . Late in 1126 Kim was dispatched as an envoy to Sung China , which was under great pressure from the J\u00fcrchen troops of Wu-ch'i-mai , the second ruler of the newly founded state of Chin in Manchuria . The Chin had superseded the Khitan Liao as the power in Manchuria and were succeeding in devasting the northern areas of Sung when envoys from Sung arrived to request Kory\u00f3 aid in dealing with the usurpers . Kim was entrusted with the task of evaluating the true situation before Kory\u00f3 would make a firm commitment ; however , when Kim 's mission reached Ming-chou , they were forced to turn back by the J\u00fcrchen . Eventually Kory\u00f3 was forced to accept nominal Chin suzerainty instead of the normal tributary relationship with Sung . Upon his return Kim was made third minister of finance and then chancellor of the National Academy in 1128 . In 1134 Kim was made field marshal and put in charge of the nation 's armies to put down a rebellion in P'y\u00f3ngyang led by the monk Myo Ch'ong , who had declared himself emperor . After putting down the rebels and restoring the Kory\u00f3 authority , Kim was rewarded for his service with grandiose titles and lands . Late in 1136 his younger brother Puch '\u00f3l , who had fought with him against the rebels , died . In 1145 Kim finished the work on his History of the Three Kingdoms ( Samguk sagi ) , which was the earliest Korean official history . In 1148 he was enfeoffed as \" Marquis - Who-Established - Loyang \" ( Nangnang ) , and he retired from public service a short time later . Kim died , 3 years after his retirement , at the age of 76 . He was given the posthumous title of Muny\u00f3l ( Grand Word ) . S\u00f3gy\u00f3ng Rebellion The monk Myo Ch'ong , who is invariably given the epithet \" vicious monk \" in the Korean records , came from S\u00f3gy\u00f3ng ( Western Capital ) , modern P'y\u00f3ngyang . Representing P'y\u00f3ngyang interests , he tried to persuade King Injong to move the capital from Songdo ( Kaes\u00f3ng ) to P'y\u00f3ngyang . He argued that the geomantic considerations involved were so propitious that the King would surely be enabled to become the ruler over all Manchuria and perhaps China as well from his new capital . Kim and his brothers were in the forefront of those who vehemently opposed Myo Ch'ong 's power play . When it became evident that he would not gain his concessions , Myo Ch'ong returned to P'y\u00f3ngyang and , together with Cho Kwang and others , he rebelled against Injong and declared himself emperor of Tawi . Kim Pusik and his brother Puch'\u00f3l , a general , were dispatched to punish the rebels . The armies under Kim made quick progress north to P'y\u00f3ngyang , and Cho Kwang , in an effort to save himself , beheaded Myo Ch'ong and offered surrender for pardon . Cho 's offer was refused , and it was nearly a year before P'y\u00f3ngyang again came under the royal standard . \" History of the Three Kingdoms \" Kim 's monumental work , History of the Three Kingdoms , was published in 1145 in 50 chapters . It is the earliest officially sanctioned Korean history . The title and the history itself were modeled upon the Shih-chi of Ssu-ma Ch'ien , which became the model for later Chinese official histories . The Shih-chi , in 130 chapters , was completed before 90 B.C. and was divided into sections \u2014 annals , chronologies , treatises , and biographies ; this is the form that Kim Pusik utilized . The first 12 chapters of Kim 's work record the annals of the kingdom of Silla . The next 10 chapters cover the kingdom of Kogury\u00f3 . The final 6 chapters of the section of annals are devoted to the kingdom of Paekje . The section of chronologies is contained in volumes 29 to 31 , and treatises on subjects such as music , geography , and officials are included in chapters 32 to 40 . The final 10 chapters constitute the section of biographies . According to Kim Pusik 's own writings , the history , which was culled from earlier Chinese official and unofficial histories and included fragmentary Korean accounts , was intended as a \" bequest to the myriad successive generations , a history to gleam like the sun and stars . \" Comparison of Kim 's work with earlier Chinese records indicates that much of the material included under the earlier periods of each of the three kingdoms was worked into the chronology to fill it out . In this sense , it is a very unscholarly piece of historical writing . There was probably much greater coverage of the later periods in the records available to Kim , and this material is more reliable . The work as a whole , however , remains an interesting piece of literature . Kim was also one of the historians charged with compiling the Veritable Records of King Injong ( Injong Sillok ) .

On a day when the Dockers also picked up Perth utility player Tendai Mzungu and Adelaide ruckman Jonathon Griffin , Tarrant was returned to his former club for draft picks 43 and 55 . Fremantle also gave up pick 44 to the Magpies as part of the complicated deal . The two clubs spent several days at loggerheads over the deal and Tarrant had warned he would retire unless he could go back to Collingwood . He played nine seasons at the Magpies before joining the Dockers in 2007 as part of the deal that brought Paul Medhurst and Ben Reid to Collingwood . Originally a key forward , Tarrant has reinvented himself as a defender at Fremantle . The 30 - year-old has played a total of 233 games - 161 for Collingwood and 72 for the Dockers . Earlier , the Dockers traded pick 38 in the draft to the Gold Coast Suns , which had registered Mzungu as a pre-listed player . Gold Coast also sent pick 44 in the draft to Fremantle . Mzungu , 24 , has played more than 70 games for WAFL club Perth . In 2010 , he averaged 29 disposal per game and polled 20 votes in the Sandover Medal . He won the Butcher Medal as Perth 's fairest and best player for 2010 . \u201c Tendai played most of his footy across half - back but pushed into the midfield this year and was very impressive , \u201d Fremantle 's general manager of player management Brad Lloyd said . \u201c He is an exceptionally hard worker and is a very smart footballer \u2026 very clean below his knees , uses the ball very well and takes the game on with his run and carry . \u201d Mzungu is the second mature - age player secured by Fremantle in the 2010 trade period , joining Victorian defender Peter Faulks on the club 's list for next season . Fremantle exchanged pick 55 in the draft with the Suns in return for pick 61 and Faulks , who was also pre-listed by the Gold Coast . The Dockers have since traded pick 61 for Adelaide ruckman Griffin after the Crows were able to secure a deal for Carlton 's Sam Jacobs . Griffin , a former East Fremantle player , had requested a trade back to his home state earlier this year . The 24-year-old was drafted by the Crows at pick 21 in the 2005 rookie draft and was elevated to the main list a year later . Griffin played 11 games in 2010 for a total of 41 . Adelaide general manager of football operations Phil Harper said the club was disappointed to lose Griffin , but understood his reasons for wanting to return to Perth . \" You never want to lose someone like Jonathon and we ideally would have liked him to stay , but we recognise that it is best for him to return to his home state , \" he said . \" Jonathon was an important part of our ruck department , and we thank him for his contribution to the football club and wish him all the best at Fremantle . \" A trade for veteran defender Chris Tarrant is still yet to be confirmed . The Dockers and Collingwood - Tarrant 's preferred new home - have until 11 am ( Perth time ) to complete a deal . Meanwhile , Carlton and Adelaide have confirmed a deal that will see Blues ruckman Sam Jacobs return to his home state of South Australia , with the Crows giving up draft picks 33 and 67 . And the Western Bulldogs and Brisbane have confirmed the Justin Sherman deal as the AFL trade week deadline approaches . The Bulldogs will give up the compensation pick they received for losing Jarrod Harbrow to Gold Coast in exchange for Brennan . But Bulldogs forward Josh Hill is unlikely to be traded to Hawthorn , with the two clubs unable to reach agreement as the 11 am ( Perth time ) deadline looms . The paperwork for several other deals has also gone through . with Patrick Veszpremi headed from Sydney to the Bulldogs and Richmond 's Andrew Collins swapping with Carlton 's Shaun Grigg . Geelong traded 21 - year-old defender Jeremy Laidler and pick 41 to Carlton for picks 36 and 53 in the upcoming national draft . Laidler played two games in three years at Skilled Stadium and asked for a trade in search of more opportunities . \u201c We are obviously disappointed to lose Jeremy as we considered him to be a required player , \u201d Geelong general manager of football operations Neil Balme said . \u201c Jeremy considered the Carlton offer of a longer contract and more opportunities to be right for him . Rather than the possibility of losing Jeremy for nothing if he chose to enter the draft we have managed to improve our position and obtain another pick in the national draft . \u201d Subscribe to our Email Newsletter","annotations":[{"text":"Chris Tarrant","span":[17,29],"token_span":[2,3],"role":"Theme_1","label":"Theme_1","role_definition":"The item that begins in the possession of Exchanger_1."},{"text":"pick 44","span":[384,390],"token_span":[70,71],"role":"Theme_1","label":"Theme_1","role_definition":"The item that begins in the possession of Exchanger_1."},{"text":"Collingwood","span":[45,55],"token_span":[7,7],"role":"Exchanger_2","label":"Exchanger_2","role_definition":"In cases where the Exchangers involved in a conversation are construed as two separate groups with different levels of volitionality or control, Exchanger_2 refers to the semantically and grammatically less prominent group.

This Article Covers Provisioning and configuration Software developers have embraced the value of virtualization technology and are incorporating hypervisor capabilities into some software products . Nested VMMs , however , place performance - draining demands on system hardware . As hardware developers look for ways to meet these new hardware demands , VMCS shadowing has emerged to extend the capabilities of Intel - VT and provide additional flexibility in the way that system resources are virtualized and shared . Virtualization typically requires the use of one virtual machine monitor -- a hypervisor -- in order to abstract and manage the system 's computing resources . The single VMM approach works well , but continued software development is fostering a new generation of applications that effectively utilize a unique virtual machine monitor ( VMM ) that is not associated with the primary hypervisor 's VMM . This multiple - VMM environment can , however , present serious performance issues for the underlying system . Processor developers , such as Intel , are addressing this emerging problem with the introduction of a new feature called virtual machine control structure ( VMCS ) shadowing . What is VMCS and why do I need VMCS shadowing ? A virtual machine monitor is the core of a hypervisor , responsible for handling the system 's virtualized computing resources . In a typical computing environment , a system hosts a single VMM , which supports each guest virtual machine . When software such as McAfee Deep Defender incorporates a unique VMM , however , it does not share the system equally with the hypervisor 's VMM . Instead , the primary hypervisor forms a root VMM , and the VMM features of other software tools -- guest VMMs -- sit on top of the hypervisor and communicate with the system hardware through the hypervisor . Thus , the guest VMM is nested in the root VMM . Software currently controls nested VMM switching . As you might imagine , forcing a guest VMM to run through the root VMM can introduce latencies that impair the performance of workloads dependent on the guest VMM . As you introduce new software that uses additional VMMs , you need a new means of switching control between VMMs . The VMCS tracks the state of the host and guest VMs as control is handed between them . This feature of Intel - VT helps to accelerate VM switching and improve virtual server performance . Unfortunately , guest VMMs must take the time to access the root VMM and its VMCS . To overcome the performance penalties of nested VMMs , the VMCS is shadowed in hardware , which allows the guest VMM to access a VMCS directly without disrupting the root VMM . VMCS shadow access is almost as fast as a non-nested VMM environment . How is VMCS shadowing implemented on a virtualized server ? Current VMCS features are implemented on the processor as part of the Intel - VT architecture . Multi-VMM support will require the addition of VMCS shadowing , which is also implemented on the processor as part of the CPU 's virtualization capabilities . Intel currently deploys VMCS shadowing in certain fourth - generation Intel Core vPro processors , such as i5 v Pro and i7 v Pro , used in desktop and notebook systems , as well as the Xeon E5- 2600 , E5- 1600 and E3- 1200 processor families for enterprise servers . The technology should eventually appear across a wider range of enterprise processors . For multiple - VMM support , you should only require a system with a processor that has VMCS shadowing enabled in properly developed firmware . If you do not deploy software with its own VMM on the hardware platform , then the VMCS shadowing feature will not enable . Aside from VMCS shadowing , is there another method for VMM nesting ? If the system processors do not support VMCS shadowing , then the system will use software emulation instead . Unfortunately , software emulation forces the guest VMM to operate through the host VMM . In an emulation scenario , the guest VMM will take control of the system from the host VMM in order to perform a read / write task , and the guest VMM will access the VMCS used by the host VMM . When the guest VMM completes the task , it hands control back to the host VMM . An active guest VMM can disrupt the host VMM 's operation and cause significant performance degradation . VMCS shadowing creates a second ( shadow ) VMCS that the guest VMM accesses independently of the host VMM 's VMCS . Thus the guest VM does not disrupt the host VMM , which improves system performance . You must only periodically synchronize the shadow VMCS with the primary VMCS .

On the evening of August 22 , 1961 , a car containing lovers Michael Gregsten and Valerie Storie , was parked by a field near Slough . A man threatened the couple with a gun . After climbing into the car 's back seat , he ordered Gregsten to drive off . They covered about 30 miles before the gunman ordered Gregsten to pull into a lay - by on the A6 at Clophill at around 01:30 am . Deadman 's Hill on the A6 Left for dead The man said he wanted to sleep and that he would have to tie them up . The man tied Storie 's hands behind her back with Gregsten 's tie and then saw a bag in the rear of the car with some rope . He told Gregsten to pass the bag but , as Gregsten moved , there were two shots . Gregsten was hit twice in the head and died instantly . According to Storie 's testimony , when she asked the gunman why he had shot Gregsten he replied that Gregsten had frightened him by turning too quickly . The gunman then raped Valerie Storie before shooting her five times , and leaving her for dead . She was discovered by farm labourer , Sydney Burton , at 06:45 later that morning . He ran down the road and came across John Kerr , a student occupied with taking a road census . Kerr flagged down two cars , shouting at them to get an ambulance . Investigation An identikit picture was constructed from Storie 's description , but as this differed from other descriptions provided by other witnesses , two pictures were issued . Meanwhile , the police discovered two .38 cartridge cases from a hotel room occupied on the night before the murder by Mr J Ryan ( an alias later known to be used by James Hanratty ) . However , the room had also been occupied by Peter Louis Alphon . The police then took the unusual step of publicly naming Alphon as the murder suspect . Alphon subsequently turned himself in , and was subjected to an intensive interrogation . Valerie Storie failed to pick him out of an identity parade , and he was released four days later . Police then turned their efforts into locating Hanratty , a petty car thief and robber , who in fact was facing a six - year jail sentence for robbery . Hanratty is arrested Arrest Hanratty was eventually arrested in Blackpool on 11 October , and on 14 October Valerie Storie picked him out of an Identity Parade , after each of the men in the parade had repeated the phrase used by the murderer , \" Be quiet , will you ? I 'm thinking . \" Hanratty , with his cockney accent , pronounced thinking as ' finking ' , as did the murderer . Hanratty was sent for trial . The trial centred on the issue of identification . Hanratty 's initial defence was that he was in Liverpool on the day of the murder , but then , halfway through the trial , changed part of his story , claiming that he was in fact in Rhyl in North Wales , 200 miles away from the crime scene in Bedfordshire . At that time there was no conclusive forensic evidence to connect Hanratty with the car or the murder scene . Although he was a professional thief , he had no known convictions for violence , and had never owned a gun . Moreover , according to Valerie Storie , the murderer drove badly , whereas Hanratty was an experienced car thief . Hanratty did not know either of the two victims , and did not appear to have any logical motive to commit the murder . Following over nine hours ' deliberation , the jury convicted Hanratty of the capital murder of Gregsten . Hanratty was sentenced to death and was subsequently hanged at Bedford Prison on April 4 , 1962 . However , this was not the end . Discrepancies When family members , journalists and lawyers , began to delve into the case , some discrepancies emerged together with the prospect that an innocent man may have been hanged . To cloud the issue further , Alphon confessed to the murder , although he later withdrew this claim . Hanratty 's family campaigned tirelessly for decades for a posthumous pardon , maintaining that he was nowhere near the scene of the murder . Appeal In March , 1999 , The Criminal Cases Review Commission ( CCRC ) announced that the case was to be referred back to the Court of Criminal Appeal . The court would then decide whether to quash the Hanratty 's conviction , or let the conviction stand . Hanratty 's body was exhumed . On March 22 , 2001 , James Hanratty 's remains , which by then had been moved from Bedford prison to a cemetery near Bushey in Hertfordshire , were exhumed so that a DNA sample could be taken for analysis . The results showed there was a 2.5 million to one chance that the samples came from someone other than Hanratty . In March 2001 , DNA sample extracted from Hanratty 's exhumed body was matched by forensic experts to two samples from the crime scene . Ruling On May 10 , 2002 , the Court of Criminal Appeal ( Lord Chief Justice Woolf , Lord Justice Mantell and Mr Justice Leveson hearing the appeal ) ruled that Hanratty 's conviction was not unsound and that there were no grounds for a posthumous pardon . There was a risk that the DNA could have been placed there by ' contamination ' but crucially no - one else 's DNA , apart form Hanratty , Storie and Gregsten was found . Despite years of campaigning by Hanratty 's family and a host of journalists , film - makers and lawyers , this DNA evidence suggests that the right man went to the gallows \u2026 last updated : 08/04/2009 at 09:53 SEE ALSO You are in : Beds Herts and Bucks > History > Crime & Punishment > James Hanratty - The A6 Murder Abolition About the BBC | Help | Terms of Use | Privacy & Cookies Policy","annotations":[{"text":"The A6 Murder James Hanratty","span":[127,154],"token_span":[25,29],"role":"Executed","label":"Executed","role_definition":"The Executed is the person who is killed by the Executioner in retribution for the crime that the Executed was convicted of."},{"text":"at Bedford Prison","span":[3715,3731],"token_span":[719,721],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"Where the execution takes place."},{"text":"on April 4 , 1962","span":[3733,3749],"token_span":[722,726],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the execution occurs."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Executioner punishes an individual (Executed) with death as a consequence of some action of the Evaluee (the Reason).","frame_ancestors":["Killing","Transitive_action","Objective_influence","Event","Rewards_and_punishments","Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Response","Eventive_affecting"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-0458-673-frame-Exercising","frame":"Exercising","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"By the 5th Century BC , halteres were of common use in Ancient Greek training regimes .

Most of what passes for \u201c old school strength training \u201d advice \u2014 for instance here , there , or there \u2014 amounts to multi-joint barbell movements like squats , bench press , and deadlifts , a lot of volume , and fairly heavy weights . That 's pretty solid advice but calling it \u201c old school \u201d is hardly more than a term of endearment . As Jamie Lewis reminds us in Destroy the Opposition the bench press has been around for less than a century . And squats ( as we know them ) are not that much older . Since barbells appeared sometimes in the middle of the 19th century ( [ 1 ] , p.10 ) , deadlifts are not that old , either . Long before barbells , there were stones and tree trunks , but we do n't need to go that far back . Ancient Rome will do . But why should anyone care about the Romans ? The short answer is \u201c science \u201d . The details will have to wait for a sequel because I 'm already going to break my usual 1.500 - word count just to tell the story , but I promise that it will be worth it . For now , let 's get the Greeks out of the way . How the Greeks almost figured it out Ancient Greeks invented the first sport-specific piece of gym equipment . They called them halteres . [ EDIT : I incorrectly wrote halteroi in a previous version , having mistaken the article ' oi ' for the plural , which speaks volumes for my Ancient Greek skills . Thanks to Antti Ij\u00e4s for spotting the mistake . ] That 's where the French word for dumbbells ( halt\u00e8res ) comes from . They came in a variety of shapes but all had the common characteristic of being weights with handles . Ancient Greeks also seem to have understood progressive overload . The principle is illustrated in the story of Milo of Croton , a 6th century BCE wrestler who was said to have trained himself to carry a bull , beginning with carrying a calf . ( I'd rather assume that you are familiar with progressive overload . If you are not , shame on you . Still , it 's nothing that ca n't be fixed . Visit a library and shuffle through the first chapter of Pr. Zatsiorsky ' Science and Practice of Strength Training . You can also read it online but I 'm unsure about how legal it is . And there 's a Wikipedia page . Finally , if you are in a lazy mood , you can watch Chad Wesley Smith talking about it on YouTube but he 's making it more complicated than it actually is , and the background music is annoying . ) So , why not credit the Greeks ? For two reasons : - dumbbell training was mostly developed by Romans , and : - Milo 's story may not reflect a scientific understanding of progressive overload . As for ( 1 ) , halteres were used in Greece primarily as counterweights for jump training . The most common were of the shape depicted in the right - hand picture and held at arm 's length to gain momentum in the long jump . Now , there is some textual evidence that other models were used for a handful of accessory exercises , like curls , lunges , and some sort of swing ( [ 1 ] , p. 1 ) . Since function usually dictates form , swinging halteres may have looked like modern kettlebells ( where modern means \u201c 16th century and onward \u201d and not \u201c after Pavel Tsatsouline defected to the West \u201d ) . Still , it was not until the 2nd century CE that Roman physician Galen compiled halteres exercises for the whole body . Galen 's interest in physical culture continued a long history of Roman concern for physical fitness as a civic virtue ( I'll come back to that ) . Moreover , Galen 's treatises on hygiene \u2014 in particular , De Sanitate Tuenda ( \u201c On the preservation of health \u201d ) \u2014 were still being used as strength training textbooks well into the 19th century , when barbells gradually supplanted dumbbells , and new exercises were developed . As for ( 2 ) , the origin of the notion that the Greeks understood progressive overload is that stories agree that it took about 4 years to Milo to develop the strength to carry a bull . But we know that the calf - to - bull story is most likely a fabrication aimed at comparing Milo with Hercules whose author never knew Milo . The time frame was probably dictated by the internal logic of the tale , something like : \u201c Milo could carry a bull just like Hercules , but he was not a demigod . It must have taken a few years to develop the strength . How long does it take for a calf to grow into a bull already ? \u201d So , exit the Greeks . Let 's jump to 107 BCE , one of the most important years in the history Rome and ( for much of the same reason ) in the history of fitness . ' The Year of the Consulship of Ravilla and Marius ' In 107 BCE , Rome is the only superpower left in the Mediterranean . Forty - odd years earlier ( 146 BCE ) Rome has dealt once and for all with its archenemy Carthage , putting an end to centuries of political , economic and military rivalry . The same year , Roman legions sacked Corinth and added the Peloponnese to the Roman province of Macedonia , putting an end to centuries of inferiority complex towards the Greeks . And yet , Roman legions are embroiled in a low-intensity conflict against rebel forces led by Jugurtha in Numidia ( still nominally an ally of Rome ) and are playing hide - and - seek with German invaders in Transalpine Gaul ( a Roman province ) . The body count is nowhere near what it used to be during the Carthaginian wars , but the operations have been dragging for years , fueling sourpuss conversations in the motherland . Gaius Marius , one of the two consuls elected for this year , has promised to put a swift end to the Numidian war . A military genius who has served under Metellus , commander of the legions in Numidia , Marius has run on a simple electoral platform : crush the enemy , see them driven before him , and hear the lamentation of their women get the boys back home . On the campaign trail , Marius implied ( with good reason ) that high - ranking Roman officers were not above taking bribes not to attack the enemy . This , he said , would explain the protracted war in Numidia . Marius is not a conspiracy - theory - loving populist and his half - veiled accusations hide a deeper concern ( I'll come to that soon ) . But the Senate did not like them and has retaliated in its usual passive - aggressive manner , nitpicking on the legal details to avoid transferring the imperium over the Numidian legions from Metellus to Marius . While Marius and his allies are trying to get around the Senate , word comes of a possible barbarian invasion of Cisalpine Gaul . The fear of a barbarian invasion is just what Marius needed . Roman fitness is about to change forever . Fitness , a forgotten civic duty Until 107 BCE , Roman levies depended on the wealth - based census , essentially because Roman soldiers had to purchase their own equipment . There was no formal military training , boot camp , or the like . Getting in fighting shape and learning the basics of martial arts was a civic duty . Mastery would come with field experience . And for those citizens who could afford their equipment and were eligible for military duty , field experience had never been in short supply . Since its foundation , Rome had conducted almost non-stop military business against enemy foreign and domestic , on its own or on behalf of allies . Consequently , citizens from census classes eligible for levies had been almost guaranteed to be part of a legion once in their life . Furthermore , an impeccable military record had become a condition to run for the lucrative offices of the Republic , and a reputation of heroism was always welcome \u2014 something that Marius knew well . Thus , generation after generation of wealthy Romans had had powerful incentives to get and stay in fighting shape : survive wars first in order to line their pocket with tax money later serve the Republic in both war and peace . But the victory against Carthage has changed it all . General officers could now capitalize on Rome 's reputation without going into battle too often ( \u201c How much would you pay me not to level your city like Scipio did to Carthago ? \u201d ) . The rank- and - file of the legions was beginning to lack of field experience . And citizens eligible for duty do not see the point of spending as much time and money for martial training as they once had . Soon , Romans citizens will be too out - of - shape to be of real military value . Marius ' mules Fear of a barbarian invasion in Italy gave Marius the opportunity he needed to recruit the first ever professional army in the history of Rome . Census classes eligible for military duty had been depleted by the Numidian and Gallic operations . With no wealthy Romans to send against Barbarians , Marius convinced the Senate to lift the census requirement and let him recruit professional soldiers . This required a huge investment in equipment and food , but Marius placated the cheeseparing Senate by agreeing that soldiers would repay their equipment and food with their wages . Marius then set to enlist the capite censi ( literally : the \u201c head count \u201d ) whose numbers had swelled in the last hundred years or so , following an unprecedented job crisis created by an influx of cheap slaves . These Romans were nominally citizens but did not own property worth registering in the census , and were \u201c counted by the head \u201d rather than ranked by the wealth . They were not allowed to vote , let alone run for office , and had no prospect whatsoever of upward social mobility . Given the right incentive , they would rush to enroll . And thus Marius ' supporters in the Senate passed a law guaranteeing that after completing a 16 - year engagement , veterans would receive a pension and a plot of land in the province they had helped pacifying . In other words , surviving veterans were guaranteed to make it into the census ( with all its collaterals ) . This gave the disenfranchised masses the same incentives to serve the Republic as wealthier Romans . But the capite censi was underfed , lived in unsanitary conditions , and was overall badly out of shape . All of which Marius had anticipated . Marius had designed a military fitness curriculum to whip the lowly plebs recruits into fighting shape . He had based it on his vision of a new army ( mobile , self - reliant and tireless ) , and had even poached from the private sector the toughest drill instructors he could find ( gladiatorial school trainers ) . By the end of Marius ' basic training , Roman legionaries could wake up at dawn , break camp in an orderly fashion , walk all day at an average of 5.3 km / hr [ 2 ] while carrying 25 kilograms ( 55 lbs ) of equipment ( including food rations ) , set a fortified camp with protective ditch and earth-and - timber wall , cook and eat porridge for dinner , sleep , wake up at dawn and go kick barbarian ass . Day-in , day out . As fresh as if they had just returned from R&R in Campania . Wealthy Romans were all too happy to leave the increasingly tiresome military business to the penniless masses . They would later mock the new breed of professional soldiers , calling them muli mariani , \u201c Marius ' mules \u201d ( Note to Latin buffs : mulus also means \u201c stupid \u201d . The translation \u201c Marius ' ass \u201d would thus convey the same kind of connotation as mulus marianus . ) To be continued The Cisalpine invasion never came and Marius concluded the Numidian affair without raising new legions . He outmaneuvered the Senate , took command of the legions already in Numidia , and he terminated the war using back - channel negotiations of the very kind he had campaigned against . But the law was in place . Three years later , after one of the worst military disaster in Roman history , the Senate would call upon Marius again to end the terror cimbricus ( \u201c Cimbric terror \u201d ) in Transalpine Gaul . Marius ' professionally - trained soldiers would prevail against the enemy , and survive battle after battle . Less than a century later , so many veterans had retired in good a shape that there was not enough land to grant them in the provinces . The Republic was forced to transfer executive powers to generals such as Gaius Julius Caesar , Mark Antony , and Octavian , who would undertake expansion wars ( in all but name ) in order to solve the \u201c veteran crisis \u201d . One could well say that Marius ' training regimen was a contributing factor to the end of the Republic and the beginning of the Empire . This should be no surprise : the training regimen of the Roman legion was pretty much what the latest science would recommend for forging elite fitness . This will be the topic of a follow - up , someday . But I can already tell you that it did not look like Cross*it .

Pinochet was the Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army until 1974 when he assumed the title of President of the Republic . His presidency lasted until 1990 and his role as Commander in Chief until 1998 . His regime was known for its systematic and widespread violations of human rights , with allegations of murder , torture and hostage taking of political opponents . In 1998 , during a visit to the United Kingdom for medical treatment , Pinochet was arrested by the English authorities with a view to extraditing him to Spain where a Spanish judge had issued an international arrest warrant . His extradition was , however , not to proceed smoothly as Pinochet applied to have the arrest warrant quashed on the grounds that as a former Head of State he enjoyed immunity from criminal proceedings . By a decision of 25 November 1998 , the House of Lords in a 3:2 majority held that Pinochet was not entitled to immunity from criminal proceedings and could therefore be extradited . back to top Procedural history On 16 October 1998 , a Spanish judge issued an international arrest warrant for the Respondent , Augusto Pinochet Ugarte . In order to respond to the need to execute the international arrest warrant as the Respondent was at the time in England on a medical visit and due to depart to Chile the following day , a Metropolitan Magistrate issued a provisional arrest warrant on the grounds that between 1973 and 1983 he murdered Spanish citizens in Chile . This arrest warrant was deficient as the offence on which it was based was not an extraditable offence . Consequently , on 18 October 1998 , the Spanish judge issued a second international arrest warrant for the Respondent ( see here in Spanish only ) . That same day , a second provisional arrest warrant was issued by another Metropolitan Magistrate on the grounds that between 1988 and 1992 the Respondent committed , inter alia , acts of torture and hostage taking . On 23 October 1998 , the Respondent was arrested in England . On 22 and 26 October , the Respondent applied to quash the first and second provisional arrest warrants respectively . On 28 October 1998 , the High Court granted the Respondent leave to apply for a writ of certiorari . At the same time , the first arrest warrant was quashed . The quashing of the second arrest warrant was stayed pending an appeal to the House of Lords , the highest court in England . Hearings before the House of Lords were heard on 4 , 5 and 9 to 12 November 1998 . back to top Related developments Pinochet petitioned the House of Lords to set aside its decision of 25 November 1998 on the grounds of an appearance of bias between one of the members of the Appellate Committee , Lord Hoffmann , and Amnesty International , the human rights organisation who was admitted as intervener in the appeal . By a decision of 17 December 1998 , the decision of 25 November 1998 was set aside ( see also ' The Law Lords and the General ' , The Economist , 17 December 1998 ) . Pinochet was therefore entitled to a new hearing on his original immunity claim . By a decision of 24 March 1999 , the House of Lords held that Pinochet does not enjoy immunity in respect of acts of torture committed after the entry into force of the 1984 Torture Convention for the UK , that is after 8 December 1988 . In response to questions about the Respondent 's allegedly fragile state of health , the Home Secretary ruled in January 2000 that the Respondent should not be extradited . Accordingly , by a decision of 2 March 2000 , the Home Secretary ordered the release of the Respondent who returned to Chile ( see ' Pinochet Set Free ' , BBC News , 2 March 2000 ) . On 8 August 2000 , the Supreme Court of Chile voted to strip Pinochet of the immunity he enjoyed by virtue of his parliamentary position . On 1 December 2000 , Pinochet was indicted for the kidnapping of 75 political opponents ( see ' Pinochet Charged with Kidnapping ' , BBC News , 1 December 2000 On 11 December 2000 , the Court of Appeal of Santiago halted the proceedings for medical reasons . On 30 January 2001 , the judge reissued the arrest warrant for Pinochet but proceedings were again halted for medical reasons . In July 2002 , the Supreme Court of Chile dismissed Pinochet 's indictment in the various cases against him for medical reasons ( see ' Pinochet Arrest Ordered ' , BBC News , 30 January 2001 ) . Shortly after the decision , Pinochet resigned from the Senate but continued to enjoy immunity from prosecution by virtue of a constitutional amendment that was brought about in 2000 . On 8 September 2006 , the Supreme Court of Chile stripped Pinochet of his immunity ( see ' Court Lifts Pinochet Immunity ' , BBC News , 8 September 2006 ) . On 30 October 2006 , Pinochet was charged with 36 counts of kidnapping , 23 counts of torture , and one of murder for the torture and disappearance of opponents of his regime at Villa Grimaldi ( see Human Rights Watch , ' Chile : Pinochet Finally Faces Torture Charges ' ) . On 28 November 2006 , Pinochet was placed under house arrest ; he died twelve days later , on 10 December 2006 . back to top Legally relevant facts On 11 September 1973 , General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte assumed power in Chile after a military coup . He was appointed president of the governing military junta on the same day . On 22 September 1973 , the new regime was recognised by the British government . By a decree of 11 December 1974 , General Pinochet assumed the title of President of the Republic . Following democratic elections in December 1989 , General Pinochet handed over power to President Aylwin on 11 March 1990 ( p. 24 ) . back to top Core legal questions back to top - Is the Respondent entitled to immunity either by virtue of State immunity or Head of State immunity ? Specific legal rules and provisions back to top - Articles 4 and 6 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide . - Articles 28 , 29 and 31 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations . - International Convention against the Taking of Hostages . - Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment . - Section 134 ( 1 ) of the 1988 UK Criminal Justice Act. - Sections 2 ( 1 ) ( b ) and 8 ( 1 ) ( b ) of the 1989 UK Extradition Act. - Sections 1 , 14 , 16 ( 4 ) , 20 ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) of the UK State Immunity Act. - UK Diplomatic Privileges Act. - Uk Taking Hostages Act. Court 's holding and analysis It is necessary to distinguish between three different principles . First , State immunity , as codified in Part I of 1978 State Immunity Act. Second , personal immunity of Heads of State , codified in Part II of the same Act . Third , the act of State doctrine , which remains a common law matter ( p. 43 ) . Although State immunity under Part I extends to Heads of State , it does not apply in respect of criminal proceedings ( p. 44 ) . The act of State doctrine is inapplicable in the present instance as Parliament has shown that the conduct with which the Respondent is charged is a justiciable matter before the English courts by enacting section 134 ( 1 ) of the 1988 Criminal Justice Act defining torture and section 1 ( 1 ) of the 1982 Taking Hostages Act ( p. 45 ) . With respect to personal immunity , section 20 of the 1978 State Immunity Act confers immunity from criminal proceedings upon Heads of State . Following an interpretation of Article 39 ( 2 ) of 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations , incorporated by reference , this immunity extends to former Heads of State in respect of official acts ( p. 46 ) . Official acts are those recognised by international law as functions of a Head of State , irrespective of the terms of individual 's domestic constitution . Accordingly , acts of torture and hostage taking are not functions of a Head of State and therefore no immunity can attach to them in respect of criminal proceedings ( p. 47 ) . By a majority of 3:2 ( Lords Hoffman , Nicholls and Steyn ) , their Lordships allowed the appeal and held that the Respondent was not entitled to immunity ( pp. 49 , 56 ) . back to top Further analysis back to top - N.

On the east the Barlik ranges rose to an altitude of 9,500 ft. , and , far away in the dim distance , the loftier snows of the Ala-tau lifted themselves into the blue ; but , separating us from them , was a break in the mountain - wall , -a deep - cut depression dividing the Siberian plains from the Dzungarian deserts , and lying between the ramparts of the Ala-tau on the west and those of the Barlik on the east . We had frequently heard of the terrors , dangers , and winds of the Dzungarian Gate . We had read the records of such early travellers as Carpini and Rubruck , both of whom mentioned that \u201c there blows nearly continuously such a wind through this valley , that persons cross it with great danger , lest the wind should carry them into the sea . \u201d We therefore approached this remarkable geological phenomenon both with interest and a certain amount of anxiety , for the weather was unusually unsettled , snow - clouds were threatening us , and we were unwilling our caravan should be \u201c blown away into the sea . \" Even at a distance , with the Dzungarian Gate lying before us \u2014 unseen , we instinctively became aware of its presence ; for when we came within sight of Ala Kul , whilst crossing the open foot -hills of the Barlik Range 1 The Barlik proper overlooks the Dzungarian Gate on the east . We found the natives using Barlik for the whole mountain - group to the oast . I use the term , therefore , to include the Chagan-oba , the Dzusau , and the Maili ranges . some twenty miles from the lake - shore and some 2,000 ft . above it , we were in absolute stillness ; and yet , strangely enough , the waters of Ala Kul were tossed into waves the white crests being clearly seen with a glass , while even with the naked eye breakers could be distinguished dashing on to the southern shore of an island in the middle of the lake . Although we were becalmed , there was evidently a gale blowing through the \u201c Gate , \" and as we approached nearer we became at every step more keenly alive to the action of this wind - trough . At night we heard a distant roar as the imprisoned winds of the Dzungarian deserts escaped through this narrow defile . The only night we camped on the very shore of the straits , the wind increased to such a violence that our tents , though well protected in a valley , were by the morning all blown away , for the wind swept in great gusts over the hills , and the back eddies tore them down ; the noise was terrific , and sleep out of the question . This wind came from the south , but threatening storm - clouds to the north made us far more uneasy . Fortunately we succeeded in crossing the depression in a nine hours ' trek without mishap , a strong head - wind being the only cause for annoyance . Had there been rain or snow falling , travelling would have been impossible , but the wind was luckily from the south and comparatively warm , the temperature at night only just touching freezing - point . Only just in time did we escape from this home of the winds , for the day after crossing the valley , \u2014 when travelling southwards along its western flanks , \u2014 the wind swung round to the north and swept cruelly through the gap , bringing with it hail and frozen snow . Had we then been journeying north wards the making of any headway would have been out of the question , for neither man nor beast could have faced the elements ; travelling as we were \u2014 with the wind \u2014 we endured the cold and congratulated ourselves on our fortunate escape . A bleak , inhospitable landscape now surrounded us , mountains , clad in fresh snow , showed up here and there through breaks in the blurred atmosphere , and great cloud - banks swept through the straits , \" as if rushing through some gigantic funnel . We enjoyed no rest until we were safely ensconced in the broken and wind - worn granite range lying to the north - west of Ebi Nor . The natives relate the usual traditions as to the origin of the winds in this locality . In the myths of Central Asia a \u201c hole in the mountain , \u201d or \u201c an iron gate in a lake \" is the usual explanation of the origin of winds . In the case of which I am writing the island called Ala-tyube \u2014 a small extinct volcano in Ala Kul - is made responsible for the furious winds which sweep through the depression ; the wind is called \u201c ebe , \u201d or yube \u201d by the Kirghiz , and in special cases , when it reaches its maximum velocity , the term \u201c buran \u201d is applied . From autumn to spring the prevailing wind is from the south - east . ' I think , however , that the \" I found considerable difficulty in getting reliable information as to the prevailing winds of this district . A Russian who had lived at a frontier post in the Dzungarian Gate said that the strongest burans always came from the south - east , while the rain - winds came from the north - west . He said that \u201c the air was always moving , \" but that autumn and spring were especially marked as the windy seasons . Chinese soldiers in the guard - houses on the high - road which passes the south end of Ebi Nor where there is a belt of sand dunes , claimed that , when the sand moved , it always came from the north - west , or the direction of the Dzungarian Gate . Their statement was proved by the fact that their guard - houses in the sand - belt were banked up by high sand dunes on the north- west . The burans , they said , also came from the direction of the Gate . In contra wind which causes havoc amongst the nomads , and kills off men and flocks when caught unprotected , is this . north wind when it attains the velocity of what is called a \u201c buran . \" We experienced one buran only during our journey across Asia , and it took place in this very locality during the following summer . On June 20th a buran struck us from the north when camped on the south side of the main ridge of the Dzusau portion of the Barlik group , which stood up like a wall close above our camp , , and gave us protection from that quarter . In Central Asia the highest gale is inconsiderable in comparison with a buran . A vast difference lies between the two : a buran blows steadily , without lulls , and with a force against which it is useless to contend . Miller describes how this buran caught him , when on a hunting expedition :- \" On the second day away an everincreasing wind began to blow from the north - west , though the sky was cloudless . By the evening it had blown up into such a gale that we had the greatest difficulty in reaching the yurts for which we were making . It was all our horses could do to move against the force of the wind , which frequently shifted us in our saddles . By night - time the yurt in which we had taken shelter began to suffer . The huge pieces of felt which covered the roof worked loose , and were whisked away , causing the frame - work to rattle down upon us . It was only the diction of this , I noticed that all the sand - dunes at the south end of Ebi Nor were formed by winds which must have blown from the eastnorth -east . Ebi Nor , by its very name , is \u201c wind - lake , \u201d and it would be hard to give an impression of the sight its frozen waters presented in midwinter . We saw it in January , from the crest of a sand - dune on its southern edge . Its southern shores were a jumble of great blocks . of ice piled up in fantastic shapes , and the actual surface of the ice was as if its waves had been instantaneously frozen solid in stormy weather .","annotations":[{"text":"winds","span":[779,783],"token_span":[154,154],"role":"Topic","label":"Topic","role_definition":"The Topic is the general area in which the emotion occurs.

Copyright \u00a9 Practical Fishkeeping Some fishkeepers , and possibly even a few traders , may be puzzled as to why so much fuss has been made about dyed fish . On the face of it , the practice of dyeing or \" painting \" the fish seems fairly innocuous and the artificially dyed specimens are certainly very eye-catching in their various \" day-glo \" colours . So why push for a voluntary ban on selling them ? Our investigations have revealed the truth behind the dyed fish saga . Disco fish Our first encounter with dyed fish was back in the late 1980's . Thousands of artificially coloured glassfish , Parambassis ranga ( formerly Chanda ranga ) were imported into the UK . The glassfish , so named because of its naturally semi-transparent body , obviously makes it an ideal subject for \" painting \" . They were seen with fluorescent shades of either blue , purple , red , yellow , orange or green produced by dyes . They were ( and still are ) imported under the names \" painted glassfish \" or \" disco fish \" ( presumably because their almost fluorescent colours resemble discotheque lights ) . How is the dye applied ? Intrigued as to how the dye was applied we decided to carry out a little research . A few coloured glassfish were sedated in MS222 anaesthetic and observed under a binocular microscope . It became apparent that the dye is not on the surface of the fish , but lay under the epidermis . Furthermore , the dye appeared fluid and could be moved slightly by gently squeezing the coloured area . This suggested that it must have been injected into the fish at various sites over the body in order to form the distinctive colour patterns . Our fears were confirmed a few years later when we were shown photographs of the colouring process , revealing that each fish is individually injected using a syringe and needle . The practice of dye injection is undertaken by fish farmers in some regions of Asia ( but not Singapore as far as we know ) . Clearly , the common name \" painted glassfish \" is a cruelly misleading description . If one considers the relative bore size of the injection needle with that of a glassfish , it would be the equivalent of us receiving several jabs using a needle of pencil-sized diameter - not a pleasant thought . As experienced fish scientists , we would never dream of injecting fish of such small size . No wonder the injection process is alleged to cause high mortalities . Increasing the risk of disease ... A survey which we carried out in the south of England revealed that over 40 % of painted glassfish appeared to be suffering from lymphocystis virus . This disease manifests itself as a small whitish growths on the fish 's body and fins . An examination of the white growths under the powerful electron microscope confirmed our diagnosis . In contrast , less than 10 % of the natural ( unpainted ) glassfish had lymphocystis . It is possible that the injection process increases the risk of this disease , perhaps by transmitting the virus from fish to fish via the needle ( the same needle is used to inject tens or even hundreds of fish ) . Alternatively , the stress of being injected with the dye may lower the fish 's natural immunity to lymphocystis . It must be said that , in our experience , those glassfish which survive the injection process go on to live fairly normal lives , despite the gaudy dyes present within their bodies . In time , the dye fades . Moral issue Many people believe that fish do not feel pain and so injecting them with dyes is perfectly acceptable . In fact , increasing scientific evidence suggests that fish are indeed capable of feeling pain , though we have no way of telling whether they perceive painful events in the same way as we do . So dye injection is likely to be a painful experience for the poor glassfish . In fairness , many traders and hobbyists were mislead , just as we first were , into thinking that these fish were simply painted with the dye . Now that the truth is out , it 's time to stop this cruel practice , once and for all . Other species which are sometimes dyed Glassfish are not the only species which are subjected to artificial colouring . Many types of albino fish also make ideal \" white canvasses \" for colouring . We have observed the following artificially coloured fish in the UK , and suspect there may be others . Albino versions of Corydoras catfish , such as aeneus ; Tiger barbs ; Albino Epalzeorhynchus ( formerly Labeo ) such as the Red-finned shark ; Black widow tetras ; Rams and some Botia species . Typically these exhibit red or blue on part of the body , but the dyes are not as bright or gaudy as those used to inject glassfish . Fish which have pale or semi-transparent bodies such as the glassfish , Kryptoterus , also suffer .

The PFK Ban Dyed Fish Campaign Practical Fishkeeping ran an award - winning campaign which started in 1996 and asked aquatic retailers to sign a pledge that they would not sell dyed fish .

Compare Aesch . Seven 1005 ff . A different version of the story is told by Hyginus , Fab. 72 . According to him , when Antigone was caught in the act of performing funeral rites for her brother Polynices , Creon handed her over for execution to his son Haemon , to whom she had been betrothed . But Haemon , while he pretended to put her to death , smuggled her out of the way , married her , and had a son by her . In time the son grew up and came to Thebes , where Creon detected him by the bodily mark which all descendants of the Sparti or Dragon - men bore on their bodies . In vain Herakles interceded for Haemon with his angry father . Creon was inexorable ; so Haemon killed himself and his wife Antigone . Some have thought that in this narrative Hyginus followed Euripides , who wrote a tragedy Antigone , of which a few fragments survive . See TGF ( Nauck 2nd ed. ) , pp. 404ff . 2 As to the flight of Adrastus to Athens , and the intervention of the Athenians on his behalf see Isoc. 4.54 - 58 ; Isoc. 12.168-174 ; Paus. 1.39.2 ; Plut. Thes. 29 ; Statius , Theb. xii.464ff. , \uff08 who substitutes Argive matrons as suppliants instead of Adrastus\uff09 . The story is treated by Euripides in his extant play The Suppliants , which , on the whole , Apollodorus follows . But whereas Apollodorus , like Statius , lays the scene of the supplication at the altar of Mercy in Athens , Euripides lays it at the altar of Demeter in Eleusis \uff08 Eur. Supp. 1 ff.\uff09. In favour of the latter version it may be said that the graves of the fallen leaders were shown at Eleusis , near the Flowery Well \uff08 Paus. 1.39.1 ff . ; Plut . Thes. 29 \uff09 ; while the graves of the common soldiers were at Eleutherae , which is on the borders of Attica and Boeotia , on the direct road from Eleusis to Thebes \uff08 Eur. Supp. 756 ff . ; Plut . Thes. 29 \uff09 . Tradition varied also on the question how the Athenians obtained the permission of the Thebans to bury the Argive dead . Some said that Theseus led an army to Thebes , defeated the Thebans , and compelled them to give up the dead Argives for burial . This was the version adopted by Euripides , Statius , and Apollodorus . Others said that Theseus sent an embassy and by negotiations obtained the voluntary consent of the Thebans to his carrying off the dead . This version , as the less discreditable to the Thebans , was very naturally adopted by them \uff08 Paus. 1.39.2 \uff09 and by the patriotic Boeotian Plutarch , who expressly rejects Euripides 's account of the Theban defeat . Isocrates , with almost incredible fatuity , adopts both versions in different passages of his writings and defends himself for so doing \uff08 Isoc. 12.168 -174 \uff09 . Lysias , without expressly mentioning the flight of Adrastus to Athens , says that the Athenians first sent heralds to the Thebans with a request for leave to bury the Argive dead , and that when the request was refused , they marched against the Thebans , defeated them in battle , and carrying off the Argive dead buried them at Eleusis . See Lys. 2.7-10 . 3 As to the altar of Mercy at Athens see above Apollod . 2.8.1 ; Paus. 1.17.1 , with my note \uff08vol . ii. pp. 143ff.\uff09 ; Diod. 13.22.7 ; Statius , Theb. xii.481-505 . It is mentioned in a late Greek inscription found at Athens \uff08 Corpus Inscriptionum Atticarum , iii .170 ; G. Kaibel , Epigrammata Graeca ex lapidibus conlecta 792 \uff09 . The altar , though not mentioned by early writers , was in later times one of the most famous spots in Athens . Philostratus says that the Athenians built an altar of Mercy as the thirteenth of the gods , and that they poured libations on it , not of wine , but of tears \uff08 Philostratus , Epist. 39 \uff09 . In this fancy he perhaps copied Statius , Theb. xii.488 , \u201c lacrymis altaria sudant \u201d . 4 The branch of olive which a suppliant laid on the altar of a god in token that he sought the divine protection . See Andoc. 1.110 ff . ; Jebb on Sophocles , OT 3 . 5 For the death of Evadne on the pyre of her husband Capaneus , see Eur. Supp. 1034 ff . ; Zenobius , Cent. i.30 ; Prop. i.15.21 ff . ; Ovid , Tristia v.14.38 ; Ovid , Pont. iii.1.111 ff . ; Hyginus , Fab. 243 ; Statius , Theb. xii.800ff. , with the note of Lactantius Placidus on Statius , Theb. v. 801 ; Martial iv . 75.5 . Capaneus had been killed by a thunderbolt as he was mounting a ladder at the siege of Thebes . See Apollod . 3.6.7 . Hence his body was deemed sacred and should have been buried , not burned , and the grave fenced off ; whereas the other bodies were all consumed on a single pyre . See Eur. Supp. 934-938 , where \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03ae\u03be\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf \u03bd refers to the fencing in of the grave . So the tomb of Semele , who was also killed by lightning , seems to have stood within a sacred enclosure . See Eur. Ba. 6 - 11 . Yet , inconsistently with the foregoing passage , Euripides appears afterwards to assume that the body of Capaneus was burnt on a pyre \uff08 Eur. Supp. 1000 ff .\uff09. The rule that a person killed by a thunderbolt should be buried , not burnt , is stated by Pliny , Nat. Hist. ii.145 and alluded to by Tertullian , Apologeticus 48 . An ancient Roman law , attributed to Numa , forbade the celebration of the usual obsequies for a man who had been killed by lightning . See Festus , s.v. \u201c Occisum , \u201d p. 178 , ed. C. O. M\u00fcller . It is true that these passages refer to the Roman usage , but the words of Eur. Supp. 934-938 seem to imply that the Greek practice was similar , and this is confirmed by Artemidorus , who says that the bodies of persons killed by lightning were not removed but buried on the spot \uff08 Artemidorus , Onirocrit. ii.9 \uff09. The same writer tells us that a man struck by lightning was not deemed to be disgraced , nay , he was honoured as a god ; even slaves killed by lightning were approached with respect , as honoured by Zeus , and their dead bodies were wrapt in fine garments . Such customs are to some extent explained by the belief that Zeus himself descended in the flash of lightning ; hence whatever the lightning struck was naturally regarded as holy . Places struck by lightning were sacred to Zeus the Descender \uff08 \u0396\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \uff09 and were enclosed by a fence . Inscriptions marking such spots have been found in various parts of Greece . See Pollux ix.41 ; Paus. 5.14.10 , with \uff08 Frazer , Paus. vol. iii. p. 565 , vol. v. p. 614 \uff09 . Compare E. Rohde , Psyche ( 3 ) , i.320 ff . ; H. Useher , \u201c Keraunos , \u201d Kleine Schriften , iv.477 ff . , \uff08 who quotes from Clemens Romanus and Cyrillus more evidence of the worship of persons killed by lightning \uff09 ; Chr. Blinkenberg , The Thunder-weapon in Religion and Folklore \uff08 Cambridge , 1911 \uff09 , pp. 110 ff . Among the Ossetes of the Caucasus a man who has been killed by lightning is deemed very lucky , for they believe that he has been taken by St. Elias to himself . So the survivors raise cries of joy and sing and dance about him . His relations think it their duty to join in these dances and rejoicings , for any appearance of sorrow would be regarded as a sin against St. Elias and therefore punishable . The festival lasts eight days . The deceased is dressed in new clothes and laid on a pillow in the exact attitude in which he was struck and in the same place where he died . At the end of the celebrations he is buried with much festivity and feasting , a high cairn is erected on his grave , and beside it they set up a tall pole with the skin of a black he-goat attached to it , and another pole , on which hang the best clothes of the deceased . The grave becomes a place of pilgrimage . See Julius von Klaproth , Reise in den Kaukasus und nach Georgien \uff08 Halle and Berlin , 1814 \uff09 , ii .606 ; A. von Haxthausen , Transkaukasia \uff08 Leipsig , 1856 \uff09 , ii.21 ff . Similarly the Kafirs of South Africa \u201c have strange notions respecting the lightning . They consider that it is governed by the umshologu , or ghost , of the greatest and most renowned of their departed chiefs , and who is emphatically styled the inkosi ; but they are not at all clear as to which of their ancestors is intended by this designation . Hence they allow of no lamentation being made for a person killed by lightning , as they say that it would be a sign of disloyalty to lament for one whom the inkosi had sent for , and whose services he consequently needed ; and it would cause him to punish them , by making the lightning again to descend and do them another injury . \u201d Further , rites of purification have to be performed by a priest at the kraal where the accident took place ; and till these have been performed , none of the inhabitants may leave the kraal or have intercourse with other people . Meantime their heads are shaved and they must abstain from drinking milk . The rites include a sacrifice and the inoculation of the people with powdered charcoal . See \u201c Mr. Warner 's Notes , \u201d in Col. Maclean 's Compendium of Kafir Laws and Customs \uff08 Cape Town , 1866 \uff09 , pp. 82 - 84 . Sometimes , however , the ghosts of persons who have been killed by lightning are deemed to be dangerous . Hence the Omahas used to slit the soles of the feet of such corpses to prevent their ghosts from walking about . See J. Owen Dorsey , \u201c A Study of Siouan Cults , \u201d Eleventh Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology \uff08 Washington , 1894 \uff09 , p. 420 . For more evidence of special treatment accorded to the bodies of persons struck dead by lightning , see A. B. Ellis , The Ewe-speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast \uff08 London , 1890 \uff09 , p. 39 ff . ; A. B. Ellis , The Yoruba-speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast \uff08 London , 1894 \uff09 , p. 49 ; Rev. J. H. Weeks , \u201c Notes on some customs of the Lower Congo people , \u201d Folk - Lore , xx. \uff08 1909 \uff09 , p. 475 ; Rendel Harris , Boanerges \uff08 Cambridge , 1913 \uff09 , p. 97 ; A. L. Kitching , On the backwaters of the Nile \uff08 London , 1912 \uff09 , pp. 264 ff . Among the Barundi of Central Africa , a man or woman who has been struck , but not killed , by lightning becomes thereby a priest or priestess of the god Kiranga , whose name he or she henceforth bears and of whom he or she is deemed a bodily representative . And any place that has been struck by lightning is enclosed , and the trunk of a banana- tree or a young fig-tree is set up in it to serve as the temporary abode of the deity who manifested himself in the lightning .

He was lucky to have all the major competition surgically removed by a combination of the stewards and a fast-starting Villeneuve , but pulled away steadily until his stop on lap 34 . The race changed complexion for everyone as rain started to fall , but Schumacher reacted quickest and pitted for rain tyres - to the cost of his team mate , who pitted the same lap to find no tyres out for him . An incident on lap 47 , where he understeered off the racetrack and skated over the grass - only to recover unabated - was the only real drama , the result of a slight brake niggle . \" Because of the problems at the back we had guessed what to do about it and put the brake balance completely to the front and I locked up going into turn one , \" explained Schumacher . \" The car went sliding straight into the gravel trap so I decided it was such an easy gravel area I would carry on going through it rather that spin the car . But it was n't really a worry . \" The Ferrari star led away from the start , to be followed by David Coulthard . The Scot was left solely to challenge Schumacher in the early stages of the race , but a storm was already brewing - in more ways than one . An incident before the race even started was to prove Coulthard 's downfall . Unbeknown to the championship second - place man , the stewards were preparing to bring him in for a ten second stop- and - go - penalty . Coulthard had discovered , to his anguish , that his clutch had developed a fault as the cars sat on the grid before the parade lap . He signalled to his crew , and as the thirty - second signal sounded , the crew were attempting to rectify the fault . The problem was solved just as the signal sounded , but Coulthard had already become a victim of the rule book . Any competitor who experiences trouble as the fifteen second signal sounds must raise his arm and wait until the cars have left the grid before receiving assistance , according the regulations . This was unequivocally breached by the team , and so Coulthard would be set to drop from hero - second - to zero - ninth - in the space of a lap . \" I do not want to criticise anyone because the rules are the rules but the FIA should allow the stewards to show some common sense if someone does not gain an advantage , \" said Coulthard . \" This is what turns people off the sport . They were deprived of a race . \" The Scot was deprived of more than just a race , as six points went begging . His complaints came to no avail , and he later admitted that he had , in fact , stalled the car . The race changed complexion for everyone as rain started to fall , which it threatened to do on lap 22 , and then did in earnest 22 laps later . Further back , Jacques Villeneuve got a blinder of a getaway and leapt into fourth by the first turn . As Barrichello and Hakkinen argued over third into the first hairpin , the Canadian grabbed his opportunity , dived down the inside , and took third . Barrichello sheepishly followed him past Hakkinen , leaving a trail of cars bottled up behind the BAR . Villeneuve was driving his heart out at his home circuit , but his position meant that Schumacher was now twenty seconds ahead of the second placed man , and no - one would be able to match his pace until they got past the BAR Honda . The BAR star was clearly becoming a hindrance to Barrichello and Hakkinen , but proving why he is rated so highly among team managers along the pitlane . By lap 24 , the car beneath him would allow him to stay ahead no longer . Barrichello got a run at the BAR at the first chicane , but Villeneuve forced the Brazilian to do the hard work and held his line to put Barrichello on the outside for the second part of the corner . Through the second chicane , both Ferrari and BAR were side by side , neither giving an inch . It was the kind of racing that F1 fans have experienced only sporadically for many years , and Villeneuve could uphold his honour as one of the sport 's top dogs . Barrichello , though , held his nerve , and dived down the inside into the Casino hairpin . This time , there was nothing the ' 97 Champion could do , and was forced to cede . The early moves were being made by the Arrows drivers - light on fuel and enjoying good handling . Pedro de la Rosa took sixth from Heinz Harald Frentzen at the hairpin , then set about chasing Hakkinen 's McLaren , but prodigious though the Supertec-powered Arrows is , the Spaniard could not work it close enough on the straight to challenge . The Arrows were performing well in the early stages of the race , and Jos Verstappen echoed his team - mate 's performance by taking tenth from Giancarlo Fisichella 's Benetton . The car was obviously well balanced and allowed the drivers to exploit its capabilities , as Verstappen 's charge continued unabated even as the rain started to fall . Indeed , the Dutchman appeared to be in his element . De La Rosa , who was the first driver to stop , on lap 20 , had a little more trouble adjusting to the conditions and was off the road several times . He was off the road for good , and in the biggest possible way , when Pedro Diniz 's Sauber simply drove him into the barriers along the back straight as his namesake tried to pass . It was a worrying incident , and one that the stewards were considering action over as the race ended . Verstappen , on the other hand , kept on getting better the wetter the conditions got . With ten laps to go , he had shaken out in eighth place . After a tussle with Ralf Schumacher , the Dutchman latched onto the group of lower points - scoring places . Quickly he caught and passed Alexander Wurz 's Benetton , and set about chasing down Jarno Trulli in the Jordan . Within a couple of laps he was right with the Italian , and pulled ahead with a demon move from way back , into the third chicane on lap 59 . He held fifth until the end to score his first points of the year . Barrichello , releasedafter passing Villeneuve , darted away and by lap 31 was lapping at the same pace as his team - mate . On lap 31 he had surpassed it , setting the fastest lap of the race thus far . He took the lead when Schumacher pitted , and pulled slowly away , his lighter fuel load working to good effect . The Brazilian pitted on lap 43 , but lost the chance of a win in doing so . The following lap , Schumacher was in for wets , and had the Ferrari pit crew fitted these on Barrichello 's scheduled stop , he would have been uncatchable . It was not to be , however , and the precedence of his team mate within Ferrari played against him again . When he himself pited for wet tyres on th following tour , the pits were not ready for him , having just waved Schumacher away . He was forced to wait while , agonizingly , tyres were brought out of the garage and the warmers removed . He recovered to finish a strong second , having caught Schumacher in the final stages . He set fastest of the wet part of the race , and was clearly at one with the car and conditions . Another podium and six points was the reward . Biggest beneficiary of the rain was Giancarlo Fisichella , who jumped out of nowhere - the lower reaches of the top ten , to be precise - to take third . Hakkinen was , in contrast the biggest loser , as he had just passed the pit entrance as the rain began to fall . In consequence , he had to crawl round a lap on slicks , and ended the race behind Fisichella , in fourth .. The World Championship has thus swung back in favour of Schumacher and Ferrari . He now has a 22 point lead over Coulthard , and 24 points over Hakkinen . For full results , click here . To see the autosport.com lap-by-lap coverage , click here .

Some use powerful legs to take to the air . Others , like the click beetle , rely on a latching mechanism built into their bodies to build up energy , then release it suddenly .

Bertone joins Ira to talk about the unique form of locomotion , and where the researchers might look next for the behavior .

I 'm Ira Flatow . If you 're a regular listener to our show , you know that we like to find unusual creatures , even charismatic ones . And lots of those are creepy crawly things or real jumpers . Think leaping leafhopper or a springy cricket . Well , this week , we found another one for your consideration \u2013 a common beetle that you can find in a dead tree on your lawn , whose larva are able to jump in a way that had n't been described before . This work was published this week in the journal PLOS One . Joining me now is Dr. Matt Bertone , an entomologist at NC State University and one of the authors of the report . Welcome to Science Friday . MATT BERTONE : Oh , thank you for having me . IRA FLATOW : OK , tell us about this beetle . What is it , and where does it live ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so it 's a little , fairly nondescript beetle . And what we described was the actual larval stage , behaviors of the larval stage . But this species is common throughout Eastern North America , fairly small , and kind of obscure typically , so people do n't usually see it . The adults are small brown beetles with a very flattened body and two spots on the body . And the larvae are just small worm - like critters that crawl around under the bark of dead trees . IRA FLATOW : And you found this one actually on the bark on campus , right ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , that 's correct . There was a standing dead oak tree that was developing some fungus on it right outside of our building . And of course , because I pass it every day , I had to just collect some insects from it , especially for the specimens and my photography . And that 's\u2013 IRA FLATOW : This is what you do . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , yeah , this is what I do , so regular day for me . IRA FLATOW : Let 's talk about what makes this beetle and the larva so different from other jumping insects . MATT BERTONE : So , many adult insects jump . You think of crickets and grasshoppers . Even adult beetles , there are many species that jump . And they usually have large hind legs , and they just kind of launch off the surface . What this larva does , though , is very interesting . In fact , it builds up energy in its body and latches onto the ground with its claws . And as its body builds up energy , it releases those claws . And this causes the insect to somersault into the air a short distance . IRA FLATOW : And there 's nothing weird about the claws then . MATT BERTONE : Nope , they 're fairly typical larval claws . Nothing special really about them . IRA FLATOW : Well , if they live under the bark , why do they need to be able to jump ? They 're not going to be jumping any place under that bark , are they ? MATT BERTONE : Yes , so that 's a great question . And we 've been trying to figure out exactly why . The logic will be that since it 's under bark , it does n't need to jump , of course . So part of what we thought was maybe this is some artifact of a behavior they do under the bark . There are other larvae that are known to wedge push , so they kind of bump up a little bit under the bark to give it more space to crawl under . But we did n't think that was really the case . Why develop that behavior if you 're under bark most of the time ? Other beetles that have kind of jumping larvae often do that to escape predators or parasites . But we noticed that these larvae , you put them down on the ground , they crawl a little bit , and then they 'd hop on their own . You would n't have to kind of touch them or do anything to make them jump . So it came down to us thinking about their lifestyle . And my ideas and our thoughts were that this source , rotting wood and trees that are standing with bark that 's kind of falling off , could easily expose these larvae . And they 're light - colored . They 're on a dark surface . They could easily be picked off by predators . So one of my hypotheses is that they do this to get away from their sites , either when exposed or just because they want to . And it 's more energy effective to do that than to crawl . IRA FLATOW : Now you mentioned before that they 're not\u2013 how shall we say\u2013 great jumpers . And so the height of their jumping and their jumping ability , their talent for jumping is not what interests you , but it 's the way that they jump that interests you , right ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so they 're definitely not record setters . They 're definitely not even super impressive . They are when you see them with the naked eye because it 's fairly quick . But when we actually went to record the distance and the heights , they were not jumping very far , really . But beetle larvae jumping are really rare . And beetles are a huge group of insects . There are over 350,000 described species on Earth . And so you would think you would find it more commonly , but it 's actually fairly rare in beetles . And then the second aspect was the way they jumped using this latching mechanism with the ground is very unique . IRA FLATOW : And they do this pretty quickly because I was watching a video of your colleagues showing us how they jump , and you had to use a really high speed camera to see the details . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so Dr. Adrian Smith at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences downtown in Raleigh , one of his specialties is filming high speed videos of insects . And so this was a great collaboration . So when you see the jump with the naked eye , it 's very quick . When we showed it at 3,500 frames per second , we could see the basics of it . But he actually went to a special lab to get filming of 60,000 frames per second , in which we were able to see even more details . IRA FLATOW : Wow . Now does it matter what surface they are on ? If they have to use their claws to sort of set the spring in their body , right , does it matter that they 're on a slippery surface ? MATT BERTONE : So that 's actually one of the lines of evidence we used to show that this is actually a latching mechanism . Adrian did film some on Plexiglas and glass surfaces , and they were unable to jump . So that leads us to believe that they really do need something to latch on with their claws . IRA FLATOW : Do you get the impression that this is a talent that , evolutionarily speaking , they had to develop a little bit later in their evolution because they just do n't have the jumping body style that the other big jumpers have ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , this seems to be \u2013 I 'm not sure when they developed it , but it does seem to be a fairly simplistic way to do it if you think about it because most insects have claws . And they 're crawling on the surface . They can grab down . So it really did n't require any specialized anatomy that in many insects that do have those special organs to latch and jump , they did n't have to evolve those . IRA FLATOW : I kind of find it interesting that after the jump is finished , they sort of curl up into a little ring and then bounce around on as they land . It 's like a tire . It reminded me of a tire , right ? MATT BERTONE : Exactly , I love the little bounces when they hit the ground . I do n't know how they feel when they 're doing that . Luckily , they 're pretty light animals , and they can resist it . And yeah , it 's pretty erratic , their jumping . They do n't really aim somewhere . They 're not trying to get somewhere special , but we think that it helps kind of introduce different areas for them to explore . IRA FLATOW : Do you have any feeling about what actually makes them jump\u2013 loud noises ? Do you have to poke them ? What 's the stimulus there ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so they seemed to just jump when they were kind of exposed out in the open , crawling around . That was what led us to believe that it was n't so much them directly responding to some kind of predator or parasite . You could grab them with the soft forceps or touch them with a paintbrush , and they 'd crawl along and jump . But even if they were put out on the surface alone with no kind of stimulation like that , they would crawl around for a bit and then jump . And so that 's what we were able to observe with the specimens we had . But unfortunately , we do n't have a lot of live specimens to experiment with . So a lot of that stuff is still a mystery . IRA FLATOW : And to bring that up , to take that one step further , I noticed that when you posted this behavior online , other folks had seen it , too , in their species . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , that \u2013 IRA FLATOW : So you found other comrades . MATT BERTONE : That was one of the greatest things about this . Actually , in fact , it was really interesting . So we talk about these jumping larvae . Under the same bark with these larvae , there were also fly maggots . And many maggots are known to jump . And what they do is they latch their mouth parts onto their rear end and then stretch their body and then releasing that energy . So they use a body - to - body latch . But at the end of a video that Adrian produced about those jumping maggots , he alluded to and showed a clip of this beetle larva jumping just as a teaser . And out of the blue , he got a message from a Japanese researcher , Takehiro Yoshida . And he is a world expert on this group of beetles . And because he collects them , he had noticed one of his larvae doing the same thing . And this was actually from a different genus across the world in Japan . So it 's really interesting that it evolved at least twice in these beetles . IRA FLATOW : So it 's possible that this is more common than you know about . MATT BERTONE : Yes , and that would be great to find out how common . But again , these are very obscure , little critters that not a lot of people pay attention to . IRA FLATOW : Well , we have a big audience . So if people are listening , and they want to do some of their own research , can they look for these under the bark of their own trees ? MATT BERTONE : They could . These beetles are associated with kind of micro fungi that are under dead and dying trees , the bark of them . They can be found under the bark of logs on the ground , things like that . They 're not uncommon , and there 's other groups of beetle larvae and insect larvae that would be associated with those fungi . So you 're going to find a lot of different things to observe . If you do that , I would just make sure to be careful to leave some habitat left and to replace bark and things like that to just make sure that the insects and other arthropods have a good home . IRA FLATOW : Do they have a jumping signature that if I peeled up the bark and I looked and I saw there were a lot of other insects and larvae under there , that I would say , hey , look , it 's jumping in a certain way . That 's the one . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so I 'd be interested to see , opening up the bark and seeing a bunch of larvae , if you could just sit back and watch and see if they jump . We as scientists would always want to collect those specimens then and get them identified for sure , which was actually the first step of the process , was finding out what type of larva it was , because we actually did DNA work to link it to the adults , and we got confirmation through identification keys . It was really exciting to know that we had seen something possibly the first time and definitely reported for the first time . IRA FLATOW : You mean the reporting the jumping of it . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , exactly . So we do n't know without publications whether people have seen it before . Somebody could have just been tearing up a box , saw a little beetle , a little larva or grub jumping around , and thought , ah , well , whatever . But recognizing the importance is really a part of it . IRA FLATOW : Now I noticed in the video I was watching that you guys went through great trouble to scan the larva , to look at , poke it , see in every direction that you can . Is there still something you do n't know about it that you would like to know ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , I think we would definitely like to have or would have liked to have more specimens to kind of do some more experiments , like manipulating them on different surfaces or doing different experiments to see what might cause them to do this jumping behavior . Again , they 're very ephemeral . It 's hard to pinpoint where they 're going to be and collect a number of the specimens to experiment on . It 's not like a pest species that 's so common or something that we keep in colonies . So that 's where one of the difficulties comes about . IRA FLATOW : So you do n't want our listeners sending you their samples that they 're collecting \u2013 MATT BERTONE : I mean \u2013 IRA FLATOW : \u2013from their trees . MATT BERTONE : I 'd love to see some . I mean , I love seeing the diversity of all the things under there . I also do n't want everybody to kind of go out and collecting all these things without kind of proper methods and whatnot . But yeah , I would love to see if people have photos of these things or videos or have the specimens alive , reach out to me , and I 'd love to help you identify them . But there are a lot of different ones under the bark , so you may get confused . IRA FLATOW : OK , well , there you go . There 's the challenge to all of you . If you 've got something , you can contact Matt at NC State University . Thank you , Dr. Bertone , for taking time to be with us today . MATT BERTONE : Of course . Thank you very much to you , too .

It was 2009 . Two young female goalies Griffin knew had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Griffin , associate head coach for the University of Washington 's women 's soccer team , had started to visit the women and other athletes in local hospitals , helping them pass the time during chemo with war stories from her three decades of coaching . That day , the nurse looked down at the woman Griffin was sitting with and said , \" Do n't tell me you guys are goalkeepers . You 're the fourth goalkeeper I 've hooked up this week . \" Later , the young woman with the chemo needle in her arm would say , \u201c I just have a feeling it has something to do with those black dots . \u201d Artificial turf fields are now everywhere in the United States , from high schools to multi-million - dollar athletic complexes . As any parent or player who has been on them can testify , the tiny black rubber crumbs of which the fields are made -- chunks of old tires -- get everywhere . In players ' uniforms , in their hair , in their cleats . But for goalkeepers , whose bodies are in constant contact with the turf , it can be far worse . In practices and games , they make hundreds of dives , and each plunge sends a black cloud of tire pellets into the air . The granules get into their cuts and scrapes , and into their mouths . Griffin wondered if those crumbs \u2013 which have been known to contain carcinogens and chemicals \u2013 were making players sick . \u201c I've coached for 26 , 27 years , \u201d she said . \u201c My first 15 years , I never heard anything about this . All of a sudden it seems to be a stream of kids . \u201d Since then , Griffin has compiled a list of 38 American soccer players -- 34 of them goalies \u2013 who have been diagnosed with cancer . At least a dozen played in Washington , but the geographic spread is nationwide . Blood cancers like lymphoma and leukemia dominate the list . No research has linked cancer to artificial turf . Griffin collected names through personal experience with sick players , and acknowledges that her list is not a scientific data set . But it 's enough to make her ask whether crumb rubber artificial turf , a product that has been rolled out in tens of thousands of parks , playgrounds , schools and stadiums in the U.S. , is safe for the athletes and kids who play on it . Others across the country are raising similar questions , arguing that the now-ubiquitous material , made out of synthetic fibers and scrap tire -- which can contain benzene , carbon black and lead , among other substances -- has not been adequately tested . Few studies have measured the risk of ingesting crumb rubber orally , for example . NBC 's own extensive investigation , which included a review of the relevant studies and interviews with scientists and industry professionals , was unable to find any agreement over whether crumb turf had ill effects on young athletes , or even whether the product had been sufficiently tested . The Synthetic Turf Council , an industry group , says that the evidence collected so far by scientists and state and federal agencies proves that artificial turf is safe . \u201c We 've got 14 studies on our website that says we can find no negative health effects , \u201d said Dr. Davis Lee , a Turf Council board member . While those studies are n't \u201c absolutely conclusive , \u201d he added , \u201c There 's certainly a preponderance of evidence to this point that says , in fact , it is safe . \u201d Do You or Your Kids Play on Synthetic Fields ? Share Your Story Environmental advocates want the Environmental Protection Agency and the Consumer Product Safety Commission to take a closer look . While both the CPSC and the EPA performed studies over five years ago , both agencies recently backtracked on their assurances the material was safe , calling their studies \u201c limited . \u201d But while the EPA told NBC News in a statement that \u201c more testing needs to be done , \u201d the agency also said it considered artificial turf to be a \u201c state and local decision , \u201d and would not be commissioning further research . \u201c There 's a host of concerns that are being raised , \u201d said Jeff Ruch , executive director of PEER , an environmental watchdog group . PEER has lodged complaints against both agencies . \u201c None have risen to the level of regulatory interest . \u201d The EPA refused multiple requests from NBC News for an interview , and declined to expand on their statement that \u201c more testing needs to be done . \u201d From ' Chemgrass ' to crumb rubber Invented in 1964 by Monsanto , the first iterations of artificial turf were little more than synthetic ' grass ' laid on top of concrete . First called \u201c ChemGrass , \u201d the product became famous as \u201c AstroTurf \u201d after it was installed in Houston 's Astrodome in 1966 . Some athletes , however , complained that the thin , synthetic surface made for hard landings . By the early 2000s , a better form of artificial turf had emerged . Called styrene butadiene rubber , or \u201c crumb rubber , \u201d the new turf contained tiny black crumbs made from pulverized car tires , poured in between the fake grass blades . The rubber infill gave the field more bounce , cushioned the impact for athletes , and helped prevent serious injuries like concussions . Since then , the material has become increasingly popular . Municipalities across the country have floated multi-million - dollar bonds to pay for new fields . Local leaders , some facility managers and companies say that turf costs less than natural grass to maintain , and can withstand heavy use year - round . \u201c There are benefits here . The potential risk , as we know it today , is extremely low . \u201d Today , according to figures from the Synthetic Turf Council , more than 11,000 synthetic turf sports fields are in use in the U.S. Most of them are crumb rubber . Crumb rubber infill is also used in children 's playgrounds across the country . Crumb rubber is an \u201c environmental success story , \u201d said Dan Zielinski , spokesperson for the Rubber Manufacturers Association . Not only have turf fields diverted millions of tires from landfills , said Zielinski , but they do n't require fertilizer or pesticides , and can save municipalities hundreds of thousands of gallons of water each year . \u201c There are benefits here , \u201d Zielinski said . \u201c The potential risk , as we know it today , is extremely low . \u201d ' Turf Bugs ' Jordan Swarthout , 22 , started playing soccer when she was 4 . She became a goalie at 9 , already addicted to the \u201c adrenaline rush \u201d that comes each time the ball hurtles toward the net . By 11 , Swarthout , who grew up in Sumner , Washington , about 45 minutes south of Seattle , was playing almost entirely on crumb rubber turf . When she and her team asked what was in the turf , \u201c old tires \u201d was the best answer she got . \u201c We always wondered what was underneath it , \u201d she said . \u201c What we could n't see . \u201d But the smell that hangs over crumb rubber fields \u2013 the scent of tires baking in the sun -- became as familiar to Swarthout as her endless goalie drills . She even got used to the \u201c turf bugs , \u201d as she and her teammates called them . During high school , she played on multiple teams at once , with two - hour practices five days a week , and games at least twice a week . Every day , she tried to clean the black rubber pellets , the \u201c turf bugs , \u201d out of the abrasions and burns she suffered as a goalkeeper on turf . Every day , to the chagrin of her mother , she shook them from her clothes and cleats onto the laundry room floor . She brushed them out of her hair , and spit them out of her mouth . \" The little black beads , \" she said . \" In the games and practices they 'd get in my eyes , they 'd get in my mouth , they 'd get in my nose . My mom would get so mad at me because I 'd go to the bathroom to take a shower , and the turf bugs would be everywhere . \u201d Jordan 's mother , Suzie Swarthout , said her daughter probably swallowed hundreds of tire crumbs a year . Yet neither Jordan nor Suzie worried much about it . \u201c We all had the confidence that the proper steps had been taken , the research had been done , that it had been proved to be safe , \u201d said Suzie . \u201c We all know how bad tires are , \u201d said Jordan . \u201c You do n't eat tires . Yet we were . You 'd get it in your mouth and you would n't think about it . \u201d In 2013 , after more than a year of mysterious thyroid problems , a biopsy determined that the star athlete had stage three Hodgkin lymphoma . It was one night this past May , months after doctors declared her daughter to be in remission , when Suzie Swarthout saw Amy Griffin 's story on a local news broadcast . \u201c I immediately after the newscast emailed [ Amy ] and said , \u201c You could add another subject to your statistics , ' \u201d recalled Suzie . Griffin said that since she first started collecting names of goalies with cancer and other diseases , she 's had people like the Swarthouts contact her , and her list has grown . Griffin and the Swarthouts said that they know it 's nearly impossible to figure out the origin of a disease like cancer , and that young people are exposed to hundreds of carcinogens . But , said Jordan Swarthout , \u201c If we have it available to us to research this , why should n't we ? Why ca n't we ? \" ' Every tire is different ' One of the problems with researching the potential health hazards of crumb rubber fields is the sheer variety of materials used in the product . Tens of thousands of different tires from different brands may be used in one field . According to the EPA , mercury , lead , benzene , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , and arsenic , among several other chemicals , heavy metals , and carcinogens , have been found in tires . Darren Gill , vice president of marketing for FieldTurf , a prominent turf company , said that those ingredients might worry consumers , but the manufacturing process ensures that their product is safe . \u201c If you look at the ingredients that go into a car tire , some people take those ingredients and turn them into health concerns , \u201d Gill said . \u201c But after the vulcanization process , those ingredients are inert . \u201d Industry leaders say while they encourage additional research , studies have shown that the substances found in crumb rubber are not at levels high enough to be at risk to children or athletes . \u201c There are certainly chemicals in small amounts [ in turf ] as in many other things , \u201d said Lee , of the Synthetic Turf Council . \u201c You could evaluate most any material out there and you 're going to find at some level , some chemical that might cause concern . \u201d \u201c The levels as they exist in tires , ground up tires , are very , very low , \u201d he added . \u201c The EPA has not found adverse health effect . Several state organizations have investigated it quite thoroughly . \u201d Existing research has attempted to measure the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals through the inhalation of gasses and particulate matter , as well as skin contact . Studies have found that crumb rubber fields emit gases that can be inhaled . Turf fields can become very hot -- 10 to 15 degrees hotter than the ambient temperature \u2013 increasing the chances that volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) and chemicals can \u201c off - gas , \u201d or leach into the air . One study performed by the state of Connecticut measured the concentrations of VOCs and chemicals in the air over fields . In addition to VOCs such as benzene and methylene chloride , researchers identified various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) . The report concluded that \u201c the use of outdoor and indoor artificial turf fields is not associated with elevated health risks , \u201d but that more research was needed to better understand chemical exposures on outdoor fields during hot weekends and in indoor facilities , which showed higher levels of chemicals in the air . Other studies have looked at whether run-off from crumb rubber turf is harmful to aquatic life , or whether the rate of injury on turf is lower than on natural grass . Few studies have looked at the issues unique to goalkeepers \u2013 whether ingesting the particles by mouth or absorbing them into the body through cuts and scrapes is dangerous . While many studies conclude that the fields studied do not present acute health risks , they often add the caveat that more research should be conducted . - One , published in 2013 in the scientific journal Chemospheres , which analyzed rubber mulch and rubber mats , concluded that , \u201c Uses of recycled rubber tires , especially those targeting play areas and other facilities for children , should be a matter of regulatory concern . \u201d - A 2006 Norwegian study evaluated inhalation , ingestion and skin exposure to crumb rubber in indoor fields . Researchers identified VOCs such as xylene , acetone and styrene , in the air above the fields . The study determined that inhalation of such compounds would not cause \u201c acute harmful effects \u201d to health , but that it was \u201c not possible \u2026 to carry out a complete health risk assessment . \u201d Researchers also concluded that oral exposure to artificial turf would not cause increased health risk . - Another 2013 study attempted to measure ingestion , inhalation and dermal exposure risk to users , and determined that the fields presented little risk . But researchers identified lead in the turf tested , including a \u201c large concentration \u201d of lead and chromium in one sample . \u201c As the turf material degrades from weathering the lead could be released , potentially exposing young children , \u201d the report states . According to Dr. Joel Forman , associate professor of pediatrics and preventive medicine at New York 's Mt. Sinai Hospital , in all these studies , data gaps make it difficult to draw firm conclusions . \u201c None of [ the studies ] are long term , they rarely involve very young children and they only look for concentrations of chemicals and compare it to some sort of standard for what 's considered acceptable , \u201d said Dr. Forman . \u201c That does n't really take into account subclinical effects , long - term effects , the developing brain and developing kids . \u201d Forman said that it is known that some of the compounds found in tires , \u201c even in chronic lower exposures \u201d can be associated with subtle neurodevelopmental issues in children . \u201c Those are always suspect , \u201d he said . \u201c If you never study anything , \u201d said Dr. Forman , \u201c you can always say , ' Well there 's no evidence that 's a problem , ' but that 's because you have n't looked . To look is hard . \u201d \u201c I would like to see some more research , \u201d he concluded . ' Not an Issue ' It is unlikely , however , that further research will be conducted by federal agencies . In 2008 , tests performed by New Jersey found lead on three artificial turf fields . The results spurred media coverage and concern across the country . The Consumer Product Safety Commission , the federal agency in charge of regulating consumer products , tested turf samples . While the tests detected lead in the synthetic grass blades , the agency announced that turf was safe to play on . That same year , an official from a regional EPA office wrote to three agency offices in D.C. , including the Office of Children 's Health Protection , and recommended that the EPA undertake extensive testing , according to documents obtained by the watchdog group PEER . \u201c My staff has reviewed the published research on the safety of tire crumb , \u201d wrote the official , \u201c and has found information suggesting that children 's chronic , repeated exposure to tire crumb could present health hazards . However , sufficient data to quantify toxicological risks from tire crumb exposure are not available . \u201d Shortly after , the EPA tested samples from two artificial turf fields and one playground . The concentrations of VOCs and other chemicals researchers found presented a \u201c low level of concern , \u201d the agency reported , but it declared that due to the \u201c very limited nature \u201d of the study and the diversity of crumb material , it was \u201c not possible to reach any more comprehensive conclusions without the consideration of additional data . \u201d While the industry cites both studies as evidence that rubber crumb is safe , in response to complaints filed by PEER , both the CPSC and the EPA declared last year that their studies were limited in scope . In its press release , the CPSC wrote , \u201c The exposure assessment did not include chemicals or other toxic metals , beyond lead . \u201d Since its initial tests , according to the CPSC , the agency has worked with the industry to develop voluntary standards for lead content . The EPA refused repeated requests from NBC News for an interview . It said in a statement that the agency \u201c does not believe that the field monitoring data collected provides evidence of an elevated health risk resulting from the use of recycled tire crumb in playgrounds or in synthetic turf athletic fields . \u201d \u201c The agency believes that more testing needs to be done , \u201d said the agency in a separate statement , \u201c but , currently , the decision to use tire crumb remains a state and local decision . \u201d When NBC News first contacted the EPA in 2013 , Enesta Jones , an agency spokesperson said that in 2010 , after a meeting with state and federal officials , \u201c EPA determined that this is not an issue . \u201d The agency does not have plans to conduct further studies , but is currently working on a \u201c summary \u201d of available research . New Controversy Others across the country say their questions about crumb rubber turf remain unanswered . Some cities have elected to scrap crumb rubber turf in favor of alternative infill . The New York City Parks Department stopped installing crumb rubber turf in 2008 followed the next year by the Los Angeles Unified School District . In Maryland , a group called the Safe Healthy Playing Fields Coalition has been organizing against a bill that would allocate state funds to build artificial turf fields . The group has also been trying to advance legislation that would require warning signs to be placed around artificial turf fields . For at least four years , citizens and advocacy groups concerned about crumb rubber turf have been fighting against the installation of artificial fields in San Francisco 's Golden Gate Park . Early this year , a judge dismissed a suit against the city that alleged the environmental impact report conducted by the city violated California law by failing to disclose the risks associated with turf . The case is currently being appealed . Two turf - related propositions are on the ballot for the city 's upcoming elections . One would bar the city from installing the fields in Golden Gate Park , and the other would give wider latitude to the city 's Parks and Recreation department to install similar projects . Those concerned about turf suggest using alternative in - fill for artificial fields , such as coconut fiber and cork , or prohibiting toddlers or other young children from using fields and playgrounds with crumb rubber . An environmental group called the Center for Environmental Health ( CEH ) led litigation against several artificial turf companies in California for violations of Proposition 65 , a state law that prohibits companies from knowingly exposing consumers to specific chemicals and heavy metals , such as lead , without clear warning . In a series of settlements , the companies agreed to reduce the amount of lead in their products sold in California and agreed to replace fields under certain conditions . Caroline Cox , research director for CEH , said that while studies have n't definitively established that crumb rubber turf is harmful , the surface contains chemicals known to be hazardous . \u201c We know they 're there , \u201d said Cox . \u201c The point is , let 's go with better alternatives instead of spending years and millions of dollars establishing harm . If there 's a better way to do this , let 's just do it . \u201d Follow NBC News Investigations on Twitter and Facebook . \u201c Turf fields come with a number of real risks and a number of real benefits , \u201d said Dr. Joel Forman . \u201c And every community \u2026 has to kind of weigh the different risks and benefits . \u201d Looking for answers When Amy Griffin first started using turf -- her team practices on it throughout the year -- she thought it was a \u201c win - win . \u201d Now , her team collects paper cups of crumb rubber on each field they play on , handing them off to her so she can ship the granules to a lab to be tested . \u201c I 'm looking for answers , because I 'm not smart enough to come up with them on my own , \u201d Griffin said . \u201c I would love someone to say , ' We 've done some tests and we 've covered all of our bases . \u2026 And yes , it 's safe . ' That would be awesome . \u2026 I would love to be proved wrong . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"the United States","span":[910,926],"token_span":[175,177],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the Grinder grinds the Patient."},{"text":"By the early 2000s","span":[5011,5028],"token_span":[952,955],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time when the Grinder grinds the Patient."},{"text":"recycled rubber tires","span":[12622,12642],"token_span":[2431,2433],"role":"Patient","label":"Patient","role_definition":"The Patient is the entity which undergoes the change brought about by the Grinder or Grinding_cause."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"In this frame a Grinder or Grinding_cause causes a Patient to be broken into smaller pieces.","frame_ancestors":["Transitive_action","Objective_influence","Event"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-2608-464-frame-Grooming","frame":"Grooming","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"Hand sanitizer ( also known as hand antiseptic , hand disinfectant , hand rub , or handrub ) is a liquid , gel or foam generally used to kill many viruses / bacteria / microorganisms on the hands .

CDC recommends washing hands with soap and water whenever possible because handwashing reduces the amounts of all types of germs and chemicals on hands . But if soap and water are not available , using a hand sanitizer with at least 60 % alcohol can help you avoid getting sick and spreading germs to others . The guidance for effective handwashing and use of hand sanitizer in community settings was developed based on data from a number of studies . Why ? Soap and water are more effective than hand sanitizers at removing certain kinds of germs , like Cryptosporidium , norovirus , and Clostridium difficile 1 - 5 . Although alcohol - based hand sanitizers can inactivate many types of microbes very effectively when used correctly 1 - 15 , people may not use a large enough volume of the sanitizers or may wipe it off before it has dried 14 . Why ? Many studies show that hand sanitizers work well in clinical settings like hospitals , where hands come into contact with germs but generally are not heavily soiled or greasy 16 . Some data also show that hand sanitizers may work well against certain types of germs on slightly soiled hands 17,18 . However , hands may become very greasy or soiled in community settings , such as after people handle food , play sports , work in the garden , or go camping or fishing . When hands are heavily soiled or greasy , hand sanitizers may not work well 3,7,16 . Handwashing with soap and water is recommended in such circumstances . Why ? Although few studies have been conducted , hand sanitizers probably cannot remove or inactivate many types of harmful chemicals . In one study , people who reported using hand sanitizer to clean hands had increased levels of pesticides in their bodies 19 . If hands have touched harmful chemicals , wash carefully with soap and water ( or as directed by a poison control center ) . Why ? Many studies have found that sanitizers with an alcohol concentration between 60\u201395 % are more effective at killing germs than those with a lower alcohol concentration or non-alcohol - based hand sanitizers 16,20 . Hand sanitizers without 60 - 95 % alcohol 1 ) may not work equally well for many types of germs ; and 2 ) merely reduce the growth of germs rather than kill them outright . Why ? The steps for hand sanitizer use are based on a simplified procedure recommended by CDC 21 . Instructing people to cover all surfaces of both hands with hand sanitizer has been found to provide similar disinfection effectiveness as providing detailed steps for rubbing - in hand sanitizer 22 . Why ? Ethyl alcohol ( ethanol ) - based hand sanitizers are safe when used as directed , 23 but they can cause alcohol poisoning if a person swallows more than a couple of mouthfuls 24 . From 2011 \u2013 2015 , U.S. poison control centers received nearly 85,000 calls about hand sanitizer exposures among children 25 . Children may be particularly likely to swallow hand sanitizers that are scented , brightly colored , or attractively packaged . Hand sanitizers should be stored out of the reach of young children and should be used with adult supervision . Child - resistant caps could also help reduce hand sanitizer - related poisonings among young children 24 . Older children and adults might purposefully swallow hand sanitizers to become drunk 26 . - Barbee SL , Weber DJ , Sobsey MD , Rutala WA .

Zinedine Zidane , who watched on from the touchline in Cardiff , volleyed in an all - time great final goal way back in 2002 - but how does Mandzukic 's stand up ? Great games are often graced by great moments but few , if any , have seen a goal as good as Mario Mandzukic 's against Real Madrid . After Cristiano Ronaldo had given the Spanish champions the lead early Juventus were dragged back on level terms by a goal of supreme quality from Croatian Mandzukic . After a cross - field ball to Alex Sandro was crossed back into Gonzalo Higuain whose chested pass was brought down with precision before being fired , over his shoulder into the net by Mandzukic leaving Keylor Navas in the Real goal with no chance . Zinedine Zidane , who watched on from the touchline in Cardiff , volleyed in an all - time great final goal way back in 2002 while Lionel Messi 's 2011 effort was another spectacular piece of individual brilliance . So where does Mandzukic 's effort rank ? Our writers have their say : Miguel Delaney A goal made in the air , and above it only sky ? This was a level above in so many ways . It was also fitting that Mario Mandzukic 's 27th - minute goal came against Zinedine Zidane , because the instant question was whether it betters the Real Madrid manager 's famous strike from 2002 against Bayer Leverkesen . It was that good , and has that kind of claim . One way it was certainly better than Zidane 's was in the build - up . While that 2002 volley came from a deflected cross , this was from the most supreme and vaunted game of heads and volleys that has ever been seen . Leo Bonucci pinged the ball to Alex Sandro , he sent it across for Gonzalo Higuain , who chested it and teed it up for Mandzukic . Three players , four touches , and not a single touch of the ground until the ball hit the net . As regards how it got to the net , Mandzukic 's arched overhead was exquisite , but probably did n't quite have the purity of strike of Zidane 's volley , that was technically harder to pull off and keep down . It is also open to debate whether Keylor Navas - or simply a taller goalkeeper , like say David De Gea - should have saved it . So , while this was a better team goal , Zidane 's was maybe a better single strike . From there , it comes down to preference . Ed Malyon Start with Leo Bonucci 's raking ball , and Alex Sandro volleying it back across . Gonzalo Higuain had lots of work to do , but he chested it , keeping it close , and he looped it into the path of Mario Mandzukic . Mario , formerly of Atletico Madrid , then executed a bicycle kick of ludicrous technical excellence , looping over Keylor Navas and levelling the Champions League final . Zinedine Zidane 's volley was one hit . A sensational one but just one hit . This was a move where the ball did n't even bounce in Real Madrid 's half . It was a team goal of barely believable touch and technique . It was exquisite . It was the best . Luke Brown Zinedine Zidane 's goal against Bayer Leverkusen in the 2002 final was world - class , but he had so much time to adjust his body position and wait for the ball to drop , with Leverkusen 's defence nowhere to be seen by the time he had volleyed the ball into the back of the net . Mandzukic did n't have that luxury . With two defenders bearing down on him , and with his body awkwardly twisted away from goal , his was a purely instinctive finish . And then there was the build - up play leading up to the finish : Bonucci 's fine long - ball forward , Alex Sandro 's perfectly weighted cutback , Higuain 's control under pressure \u2026 An outrageous goal that will be remembered for years to come . Ben Burrows Cometh the hour , cometh the man and I wo n't argue strongly that Mandzukic 's sublime effort here is n't the best goal we 've ever seen on such a stage . To control the ball , have the sixth sense of where the goal is , and then to volley it over the shoulder into the one place the goalkeeper could n't reach was truly majestic . But give me Zidane , just . That volley is one for the ages , a hit so clean you would n't match it in a million attempts in your back garden . It was the crowning moment of a truly great player 's truly great career . So I 'll go with that , but only just .

Springs Memorial Endowed Scholarship that will help eligible Porter-Billups Leadership Academy ( PBLA ) alumni attend Regis University . PBLA was established in 1996 by Regis University head men 's basketball coach Lonnie Porter to help at-risk students graduate from high school and attend college . He was joined in 2006 by NBA star Chauncey Billups with a goal to provide students that qualify for admittance to Regis University , scholarships for tuition and fees . Walter Springs was enrolled in Regis College in 1939 and had to take scholarships and work two part-time jobs to pay for his education . \u201c He was curious about Catholicism , \u201d said his niece Meredith Springs - Levert . \u201c What got him interested in Regis was his affiliation with Sacred Heart Church and the priests there . \u201d In 1938 , Denver native Walter Springs , a Black man , enrolled in to Regis College as a freshman . The youngest of eleven children , he was the first in his family to go to college . Springs was known for his kindness and sense of humor -- he also boxed and played fullback on the football team for Regis College . \u201c The fact that he even went to Regis and worked two jobs tells you what kind of sacrifice it meant , \u201d said his niece . Springs converted to Catholicism and was even voted the school 's \u201c Most Popular Student \u201d in 1941 . A few months later , he left college to serve his country in a segregated US Army during World War II . \u201c He believed it was his patriotic duty , \u201d Springs - Levert said . \u201c There was a widely held thought at that period that Black people , if you served your country , you were a good upright citizen . \u201d Like most young men who fought in World War II , Springs never came back . But his death did n't happen overseas , he lost his life before he even left the country . On December 17 , 1942 , Sgt. Walter Springs was shot and killed by a white military police officer in a Texas caf\u00e9 , a few miles from the Army base where he was about to report for officer training . \u201c He gets off the train an goes into the caf\u00e9 , \u201d Springs - Levert said . \u201c MP 's asked him about a pass , and he said ' Yes , I have a pass but address me according to my rank ' . That was not going to fly with these 3 White MP's and what ended up was this altercation around his willingness to comply because he was being ' uppity ' . \u201d That 's when his family believes Walter Springs lost his life . \u201c He was shot when he was laying down , had defensive wounds on his hands where he was probably hit with something , and had a mark on the side of his face , \u201d his niece said . \u201c What we now learn is that his story was not an uncommon story for a lot of African - American soldiers during World War II . \u201d After his death in 1942 , Walter Springs ' classmates at Regis raised money and set up a scholarship in his name for racial justice and equity through education . \u201c The whole idea was to start a scholarship that would bring one Black kid and one White kid to Regis \u201d Springs - Levert said . Over time , donations declined , and the money ran out until recently when the school partnered with the PBLA to re-instate the scholarship that still bears Walter 's name . \u201c The scholarship honors the legacy and the sacrifice of Mr. Springs who epitomized the Jesuit values of service and justice , \u201d said Regis University President Rev. John P. Fitzgibbons , S.J. \u201c We want to graduate outstanding citizens who are able to think clearly and communicate justice clearly and are rooted in our Jesuit and Catholic values . \u201d \u201c The response from the students and from the faculty and the president has been overwhelming , \u201d Springs - Levert said . \u201c The commitment to re-instate that has just put us all over the moon . \u201d Walter Springs ' family hopes the scholarship will serve as an inspiration and as reminder of a former student who gave all he could . \u201c Nothing can bring Walt back , but people can know about who he was , \u201d his niece said . \u201c They can know what he stood for and that he made an awful sacrifice and our family made a sacrifice . Somebody can benefit from it in terms of getting an education and living out that dream that he had , and our family had for him . \u201d SUGGESTED VIDEOS : Education stories from 9NEWS","annotations":[{"text":"December 17 , 1942","span":[1889,1906],"token_span":[360,363],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the Agent hits the Target."},{"text":"Sgt.

The trials and tribulations of the Bethel Pentecostal Church are the subject of a BBC Northern Ireland Spotlight programme . It offers a fascinating insight into the colourful world of the Belfast evangelists , their passionate views of religion and Catholicism in particular . The dispute , over an anti-Catholic pamphlet , involves controversial clergyman Clifford Peeples . He was the assistant pastor of the Bethel congregation until he was arrested in 1999 for loyalist paramilitary offences . He was sentenced to ten years after he was caught with hand grenades and a pipe bomb in his car . The conviction shocked many members of the church which has been led since 2001 by Pastor John Hull . Stormy meeting He says he only took on the job on the understanding that Mr Peeples would have nothing further to do with the church . However , on his release from prison in 2004 , Clifford Peeples returned to Bethel and his influence began to grow again . He was installed as its minister at Easter after a stormy meeting of senior churchmen concluded with some of them demanding Pastor Hull 's resignation . | | Pastor with a paramilitary past : Clifford Peeples He and his supporters later walked out vowing not to return until lawyers sorted out the dispute . John Hull has accused Mr Peeples ' faction of trying to politicise the church by bringing in a lurid anti-Catholic leaflet called \" Rome Watch \" . He tells the programme : \" The magazines contained photographs and articles on what they called Roman terror , Orange halls , Protestant houses , Protestant buildings and churches , that had been defaced in one way or another , or attacked , or vandalised , by those who were from the Roman Catholic community or republican community , \" Clifford Peeples brought it in without permission and when I approached him about it he told me that regardless of whether I wanted it or not , he would continue to bring it there . \" Closer to God The deposed minister says : \" There seems to be this innate hatred of Catholics but the gospel is for everybody - Protestant and Catholic . | | John Hull says he has been deposed from the Bethel Church \" Catholics need to be born again , Protestants need to be born again and that 's the gospel we have always preached . \" But Pastor Peeples rejects the charge of bigotry : \" That is not true .

Lamberto Leoni ( Mario Andretti ) What ? Ensign-Cosworth N177 ( Lotus -Cosworth 78 ) Where ? Long Beach When ? 1978 US West GP ( qualifying on 1 April 1978 ) Why ? With his single GP start Lamberto Leoni achieved more than he managed as a Formula One team owner ! His final try in the spring of 1978 , here pictured at Long Beach during practice , led to another DNQ and the end of a very short Grand Prix career . A decade later , Leoni was back on the brink of F1 , now proudly presenting his First F1 car to the press . Its lines , penned by respected Brazilian designer Richard Divila , looked promising . But although it was tested at the hands of Gabriele Tarquini , the car never raced . Or did it ? In its First life the car remained stillborn , but it got an unexpected second , erm , Life . After Leoni's F1 plans were scuppered he sought ways to cut his losses . Soon he found his victim in the shape of one Ernesto Vita , the Italian businessman who had already been fooled by veteran ex- Ferrari engineer Franco Rocchi , who had been involved with the Scuderia since 1949 . The man had some fame for having a part in the great Ferrari flat - 12 , which must have meant to Vita that he had talent to throw away . Which was exactly what he did when coming up with his latest dream engine . Rocchi had convinced Vita to create Life Racing Engines as a vehicle for his aircraft - style W12 motor , which used a peculiar 4 - 4 - 4 configuration . Initially intended as test bed , the First 189 , now rechristened Life F190 , was extensively rebuilt to conform to FIA 's latest crash test regulations and could thus be promoted to race car . The idea of using such an outdated design to debut its revolutionary engine did n't seem a bright idea to followers at the time . Still , the 12 - team restriction being years away from entering the Concorde agreement , anyone could enter F1 and around 1990 the common feeling looked to be the more , the merrier indeed . Life 's subsequent disgrace as the worst modern - era Grand Prix team is fairly well documented , as the car was so hugely off the pace and unreliable at that , that we had to go back to Al Pease 's overambitious entry into F1 to find an effort that was similarly out of place . The engine reportedly produced a mere 360 bhp while McLaren 's Honda engine had about 800 bhp ! ' Nuff said Sticking a Judd V8 in the back - the engine the First was originally designed for - did n't help and the outfit folded before having to spend lashes of lire on the two Asia - Pacific long - haul events . Quickly , Leoni returned to his well - oiled F3000 enterprise and just as rival F3000 team DAMS never made it to F1 . Lamberto had started his association with the F1 junior category as a driver , though . In the series ' debut year , Leoni teamed up with the PMC outfit to form a driver pairing with Belgium 's Thierry Tassin . Like the Barron Racing team , which fielded Tyrrell 012s for Roberto Moreno and Claudio Langes , and Roger Cowman entering a sole Arrows A6 for Slim Borgudd , the two used the transitional rule that DFV - engined F1 cars were also eligible for the championship and thus ran a pair of Williams FW08Cs . It proved a disastrous decision as the pukka F3000 machinery such as the March 85 C or Ralt RT20 completely outclassed the ageing F1 cars . Tassin and Leoni always managed to finish but usually were several laps down , as last of the classified runners - that is , in case they managed to get classified at all . After the opening two British rounds the team wisely decided to skip Estoril . Tassin moved over to Eddie Jordan 's team , while Lamberto had to sit out the event . He returned with PMC for his home race at Vallelunga , but got involved in a tangle with Ivan Capelli 's Genoa March after just four laps . Then at Pau , there was a sudden upturn in fortunes , as Lamberto survived the usual Pau carnage at the infamous Foch Square to finish 3rd of the five remaining runners , while also finishing on the leader 's lap , ahead of Olivier Grouillard no less . PMC 's podium finish was the highest - ever finishing position for an F1 chassis during any F3000 event . But soon the team were back to its old ways . Spa saw another retirement while at Dijon Leoni was making up the rear as usual . After that , enough was enough and Lamberto grabbed the opportunity to replace Alain Fert\u00e9 in the Corbari Italia team , which was running Marches . At Enna , he took over the Frenchman 's seat but retired in the Sicilian heat waves . Then the F3000 circus moved to the \u00d6sterreichring and there Leoni equalled his best result , taking a fighting third right behind Ivan Capelli and John Nielsen 's Ralt . Again , it was reason for temporary happiness , as Leoni left Zandvoort with nothing to show for and showed similar lacklustre form at the final event at Donington . In 1986 , the quantity ( and quality ! ) of the F3000 field almost doubled compared to 1985 , Leoni decided to go his own way and entered a March 86 C as driver / team owner . The International Trophy at Silverstone , now part of the F3000 championship , was the first time First Racing entered a race . Leoni finished an undistinguished 11th . In the following races , the new combination only attracted attention by falling off at Vallelunga and in Belgium , and at Mugello Lamberto even faced the ignominy of not qualifying , with a repeat embarrassment at Zeltweg after crashing out during the warm - up session . It was a big hit and car nor driver were ready to enter the first Birmingham Superprix , nor were they present at the final two events at Le Mans and Jarama . Leoni was undeterred . For 1987 , he created a three - car Italian superteam which March - Mader 87 Bs for himself , Aldo Bertuzzi and star driver Gabriele Tarquini . Still in the first part of the season , a 6th for Leoni at Pau was the only reward , as the hapless Bertuzzi DNQ 'ed his heart out and Tarquini was found crashing his car at several events . Suddenly , at Enna , the disappointing Gabriele turned his form around and produced a podium finish for First , with Leoni taking 5th . Strangely , Tarquini was soon back to his habit of finishing last in a season dominated by Stefano Modena . But then Gabriele found new form as Modena won again at Imola . There the First team took its best result of the season , Tarquini finishing second and Leoni fourth . Even Bertuzzi managed to qualify and finish the race , albeit in last position . On a roll , Leoni and Tarquini took fourth and fifth at Le Mans -Bugatti , with the team boss taking another fourth at Jarama , where Claudio Langes replaced Bertuzzi . In the championship table , Leoni and his main man Tarquini finished equal 8th with 12 points each . 1988 was supposed to be Johnny Herbert 's year , as JH comfortably took the opening race at Jerez . Meanwhile , Leoni had decided to step down from his driving duties and managed to win a classy driving pairing for his March - Judd 88 Bs . Both Pierluigi Martini - two-timing with F1 after his mid-season return to Minardi - and Marco Apicella were hot title favourites and expectations ran high . After two strike - outs the season got underway for Martini with third at Pau , breathing down the neck of Jean Alesi . The team hen had to wait until Monza for Marco Apicella to put himself on the scoreboard , finishing runner - up to Bromley 's later champion Moreno . A couple of weeks later , at Enna , Martini won First 's first race , while at Brands he took second to Martin Donnelly and in Birmingham snatched the final podium spot . His F1 schedule clashing with the F3000 calendar , Martini chose to go to Estoril with Minardi , while Alain Fert\u00e9 subbed at the mini-sized Le Mans -Bugatti track . His return for the two final races went nowhere in the way of results . And so another season of high expectations had gone by without the success to show for it . Granted , the team had taken its first win but the mercurial Martini could - and should - have been a major detractor to Roberto Moreno 's title aspirations . As it was , he took a distant fourth in the championship . Thus it was not without surprise that Leoni launched his plan to move up to F1 . During the time the car was drawn , built and put through its first motions by Gabriele Tarquini , First had its usual F3000 business to take care of , and this was n't a job to be taken lightheartedly , as Leoni again decided to go for a three - car team , new team leader Apicella being joined by Fabrizio Giovanardi and later FIRST boss Jean - D\u00e9nis D\u00e9l\u00e9traz . Incidentally , Leoni's First squad should not mixed up with the French FIRST sportscar outfit formed by Fabien Giroix and D\u00e9l\u00e9traz some years ago Ironically , 1989 was to be First 's most successful season in F3000 , as young Giovanardi took a surprise victory in just his second race for the team while Apicella took several podiums to take fourth in the championship . If it had n't been for those quick and ultra-professional DAMS Lolas of Bernard and Comas and of course that man Jean Alesi Still , Marco had been in the thick of it during most of the races and looked like real championship material for 1990 . And so the F1 project was set aside to give Apicella a real shot at the title , supported by the same drivers as in 1989 , although D\u00e9l\u00e9traz was replaced by Marco Greco during the year . Also standing in the way of First 's F1 ambitions was F3000 chassis supplier March , which had just given First a semi-works status and was going from strength to strength themselves with their Adrian Newey -penned 881 . It is rumoured March more or less prohibited First to continue their F1 operation on the sanction of the Bicester factory withholding its support for Apicella 's title bid . All the more sadly that in the end it was n't to be , not by a long - shot . The 1990 season was all about the singularly efficient DAMS team , their Lolas only breaking under the hands of Allan McNish , while Erik Comas strolled to the championship , seemingly unperturbed . Apicella duly followed the DAMS cars home on many occasions but also had to contend with opposition from Forti's Gianni Morbidelli , Eddie Irvine in Jordan 's Camel Reynard and GA 's Eric van de Poele , who took three wins . While Van de Poele was easily Comas 's best opponent , Apicella 's form tailed off at the end of the season , hitting a low point with disqualification at Brands Hatch . Having lost Apicella 's services to Paul Stewart Racing for 1991 , First started all over with Reynard 91D chassis , Mader-tuned Cosworths , the returning D\u00e9l\u00e9traz , the promising Giovanni Bonanno and French hotshoe \u00c9ric H\u00e9lary , now an Opel DTM regular . The young Frenchman showed his speed on many occasions , but was unlucky to score just a third at Pau . While the season unfolded into a Zanardi / Fittipaldi benefit , the First team 's first shake - up came at the same classic track , where Bonanno - who later returned with a self - run Reynard - was released in favour of Steffi Graf 's boyfriend , Michael Bartels . A second blow followed when after Jerez D\u00e9l\u00e9traz left the team for the second time . He was not replaced . Then Bartels and H\u00e9lary failed to show up at Enna for the Gran Premio del Mediterraneo . It was the end of the line for First Racing , which came close to the championship on two occasions , only to have its foolhardy F1 ambition get in the way . By then the mantle of leading Italian F3000 team had long been taking over by Forti , Crypton and the lusciously named Il Barone Rampante , before F3000 domination also passed over to British teams . Having abandoned his F3000 outfit , Leoni followed in Didier Pironi 's footsteps in going for the ultimate modern - day danger ride : powerboat racing . This venture became rather more of a success , Lamberto taking many wins and almost taking the World Championship in 1993 . It would be cruel to say that Lamberto Leoni 's seven - year association with Formula 3000 left him with nothing . His team took just two wins but had been a front -runner at best and a mainstay at the least during its stay in the category . Last year , while still competing in offshore powerboat racing , Leoni even made a return to the junior formula , this time fielding a two - car entry under the Monaco Motorsport banner . Main drivers Thomas Biagi and Cyrille Sauvage seldomly starred and the outfit was relegated to Italian F3000 . Still , it was more than could be said of Leoni 's involvement in Formula One . Lamberto 's initial road to F1 was very similar to that of many of his countrymen , particularly that of Siegfried Stohr . Taking a Formula Italia title into F3 , Leoni regularly produced steady drives to some podium positions , but he never set the world alight with a particular performance . Then , after a slow start in a Ralt RT1 , Leoni signed to drive Scuderia Everest 's curious Ferrari V6-engined Chevron in the European F2 Championship . With this car he then proceeded to win the Adriatic GP at Misano on aggregate . Before that , he had n't scored a single top-six finish ! And he was n't in the remainder of the season A one - off rent -a-drive for Surtees in his 1977 home race preceded Leoni 's real F1 break . This came through Ensign 's Mo Nunn losing the services of Clay Regazzoni to Shadow . Two races into the season more woe followed for the little team as lead driver Danny Ongais quit , taking along his Interscope dollars to get himself a private Shadow . At Kyalami , Lamberto was thus promoted to the No.22 seat , the team now reduced to a single - car outfit . But with two more DNQs following - pictured is his last qualifying attempt - there was little chance of his staying with the team , especially now Nunn was able to lure the able Jacky Ickx into his pretty competent design - at least it was so the year before , as Ickx was about to find out , although the Belgian 's young replacement Derek Daly managed to grab a point with it in Canada . And what about Leoni ? For the next couple of years he was in and out of Formula 2 , a 6th at the 1983 International Trophy on board a March - BMW 832 his best result . Only when F3000 was introduced Lamberto 's interest was rekindled and , as is proven above , he became one of the category 's staunchest supporters . Reader 's Why by Don Capps It looks like Mario Andretti is trying to pass someone . The car is carrying the number 22 and wearing Tissot sponsorship . So that narrows it to the Ensign . And looking at the background , it says , \" Long Beach ! \" That means this must be Andretti coming up to pass Lamberto Leoni during practice for the 1978 race . Leoni is one of those shooting stars that flashes through the firmament and is soon over the horizon . A good , competent F3 driver , Leoni moved into F2 and was never quite there in the placings at the end of the race that one would expect . He did manage to win an F2 race , the 1977 Misano race , driving a Chevron -Ferrari . His win was at the expense of Eddie Cheever who spent most of the weekend overcoming some sort of adversity - although he did win the first heat after an amazing race from deep on the grid . However , Leoni won the second heat and beat Cheever on the aggregate . Leoni immediately parlayed this into an F1 drive , getting enough lire to hire a Surtees at the Italian GP . He then did a deal that saw him in the Ensign for 1978 . Although he did make the grid for the Argentine race , he retired when the engine let go . At Brasil he had a driveshaft break during the warmup and he failed to start the race . He then failed to qualify in south Africa and at Long Beach and was then dumped by the team . He did the odd F2 and F3000 races , but a serious accident while racing F3000 in Austria led him to found an F3000 team - FIRST - and work that side of the bargain . Ensign was the Mo Nunn marque that always seemed to be well - done despite restricted budgets and not standing in the correct line when luck was being handed out . The original Ensign was helped along with money from Ricky von Opel and later Teddy Yip . The N177 cars were wonderful machines that certainly deserved better . They are among the best looking cars from this era and in 1977 with Regazzoni in the works car and Patrick Tambay in the Yip car , they did very well indeed and one can only imagine what could have been should they had some serious sponsorship . However , these cars soldiered into the 1978 and 1979 seasons and struggled to qualify much less compete for placings although the potential was clearly there even when the \" wing - car \" revolution hit .","annotations":[{"text":"Marco Apicella","span":[92,105],"token_span":[17,18],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The object that undergoes change."},{"text":"the end of the season","span":[10597,10617],"token_span":[2048,2052],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the improvement occurs."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Entity improves from a less desirable Prior_state to a more desirable Post_state.","frame_ancestors":["Undergo_change","Transition_to_state","Event"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-0960-122-frame-Ingest_substance","frame":"Ingest_substance","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"When John 's drinking gets out of hand , Siri Lill decides to move back with her parents .

This behavior is unheard of before in the animal kingdom . The Eleonora 's Falcon ( Falco eleonorae ) is mainly insectivorous outside the breeding season . During the nesting period , which is very late ( from July to October ) as an adaptation to coincide with autumnal bird migration , both adults and chicks consume mainly birds . These are mainly passerines and other small non- passerine birds like hoopoes and swifts that migrate through the Mediterranean islands and Atlantic coast . In Morocco , there are two breeding colonies of Eleonora 's Falcon , both on the Atlantic coast . The first is located at Mogador islands , off Essaouira which is one of the the biggest in the world . The second is located in mainland cliffs at Bouknadel , north of Rabat / Sal\u00e9 . During a fieldwork study in the framework of PIM - Initiative in 2014 , Prof A. Qninba and his colleagues recorded an unusual predation behaviour by this falcon in the Mogador islands . The authors remarked that Eleonora 's Falcons kept alive some of the captured prey . To do this , \u201c the falcons keep or ' imprison ' some preys in a relatively deep cavities or in rock fissures from where they ca n't escape as their flight feathers were already plucked ( example of the Common Chiffchaff below ) . The falcons also keep the small birds they catch trapped in a tight and deep holes which makes them unable to move neither their wings nor their hanging legs ( photo 2 of the Common Whitethroat ) \u201d . The authors reported also that this behaviour can occur even before the eggs hatch , and was already well known to a local fisherman who is staying in the islands in a more or less regular basis for decades . The authors interpreted this hitherto unknown behaviour \u2013 for the Eleonora 's Falcon or any other raptor species \u2013 as a form of food storage behaviour . They wrote : \u201c keeping prey alive , one or two days ( the precise period not yet known ) , may allow the falcons to have a fresh food on the right moment , because the dead prey brought to the nest and untouched can no longer be consumed as it dries out too quickly \u201d .

( AP ) -- Steve Slaton 's sophomore season started the same way he ended last year -- with a big performance . Slaton ran for 203 yards and scored two touchdowns to lead No. 5 West Virginia past Marshall 42 - 10 on Saturday . Slaton , the nation 's top freshman in 2005 with 19 rushing TDs , had his second straight 200 - yard game . He set a Sugar Bowl record with a career - high 204 yards in a win over Georgia in January . Slaton was the backbone of the nation 's fourth - best rushing attack last season and he tore up Marshall ( 0 - 1 ) in just the second meeting between the state 's two Division I - A schools since 1923 . \" The line and I had a good game plan coming in and we just executed , \" Slaton said . \" I have been here a year and now know better what the coaches want . I make reads better and I recognize defensive schemes and what they are trying to do to stop me . \" During preseason practices , coach Rich Rodriguez protected Slaton , who wore a special white jersey with red numerals that limited contact on him . Rodriguez let him loose Saturday . Slaton 's 33 carries were one shy of a career high . \" I think I can sustain that for 12 games , \" Slaton said . \" I feel good . \" Rodriguez did n't realize that Slaton had 21 first-half carries until he heard an announcement over the stadium 's public-address system . \" That 's an awful lot of pounding on a guy , \" Rodriguez said . \" We 've got to be conscious of that . \" West Virginia ( 1 - 0 ) , which is 6 - 0 all - time against Marshall , scored on four of its first five possessions and totaled 312 rushing yards . \" I 'm very surprised that they could run the ball on the defense like they did , \" Marshall coach Mark Snyder said . \" I do n't see any positives with this game because there 's a lot of work to do . We need to work on everything . \" Slaton surpassed 100 yards early in the second quarter and had 140 by halftime . He had a 14 - yard TD run around right end midway through the first quarter and scored untouched from 16 yards out after making a hard cut to the right late in the half for a 28 - 7 lead . Slaton also had a 10 - yard TD run negated by a holding penalty in the second quarter . West Virginia , whose ranking was its highest to start a season , opened its normally quiet passing game a bit , too . Pat White completed 10 - of - 14 passes for 168 yards . He found Brandon Myles with first - half TD tosses of 8 and 18 yards as West Virginia built a 21 - 0 lead . It was the first career multiple TD game for Myles , a senior . \" He 's seeing the field very well , \" Rodriguez said . \" Pat 's got a great feel for the game . He 's always had that . And as he continues to grow , I think he 's going to get even more explosive in the passing game . \" Marshall , limited to just seven first downs in the first half , went to its passing game late in the second quarter for its only touchdown . Freshman tight end Cody Slate caught passes of 26 and 14 yards to give Marshall its best field position at the WVU 25 . Matt Morris then made up for a dropped pass in the end zone earlier in the game by grabbing a 21 - yard TD toss from Bernie Morris . The pass initially was ruled incomplete but Marshall challenged and the play was overturned for a touchdown . Morris and Slate helped make up for the loss of two other receivers . Hiram Moore was suspended for the game after a drunken driving arrest last month and 6 - foot - 6 Shawn Lauzon was lost for the season with a hip injury in preseason practice . \" You have to play with who you have , \" Snyder said . \" It does n't matter who you are missing . \" West Virginia fullback Owen Schmitt scored on a 3 - yard run midway through the third quarter to cap a 66 - yard drive that was set up by an interception by freshman Quinton Andrews . WVU backup quarterback Jarrett Brown closed the scoring on a 7 - yard TD run with 1:13 left in the game .

In between world tours with Ultravox and appearances on Live Aid , multi-instrumentalist Midge Ure has somehow found time to write and record an excellent solo album entitled The Gift . We spoke to him at home in his studio where he explained how the album was put together . \" I originally talked about doing a solo album three years ago when I released my first solo single ( a version of the Walker Brothers ' hit No Regrets ) , but I never found the time . It was n't until November ' 84 that I began planning this album and then the Band Aid Christmas single took priority , so I shelved the idea . What had initially started out as a two to three month project eventually turned into a six month one because of my involvement with Band Aid - and that is much longer than I like to take over recording any album . \" The songwriting itself was staggered over a similar period since Midge had no reserve of reject Ultravox songs to fall back on . \" What most solo albums are usually comprised of , \" he explained \" are rejected songs from previous band albums . Ultravox only write the right amount of material for each album we 're working on and we tend to scrap things as we go along ; we do n't ever finish a track and then say it 's not good enough to make the album . \" And that for Midge , meant writing a whole new collection of songs for the project . With The Gift , Midge Ure manages to produce an altogether more convincing music than we 've come to expect from Ultravox of late . Listening to the album , it 's easy to recognise specific elements of the Ultravox group ' sound ' , in particular the famed tiers of synthesized string parts , but as Midge says , \" it 's very difficult to separate the two . What I hear on my solo album as being Ultravox - ish is me ! I ca n't change that fact . That 's how I sound . \" Judged simply as a statement of what he is personally capable of creating outside of the inevitable musical confines of a successful band structure , The Gift is certainly a fine achievement . Stylistically , the album covers a wide range of material from out - and - out instrumental music - the oriental flavoured ' Edo ' ( surely destined to accompany innumerable future TV documentaries on the Far East ) ; to an excellent cover version of a rock classic - Jethro Tull 's ' Living In The Past ' ; then to the powerful , yet sad , social commentary of ' Waste Lands ' . Mixed with these are several instantly memorable tracks ( ' She Cries ' is one ) that would undoubtedly make potential hit singles ( were they released ) , so I asked Midge who was responsible for the choice of the less than obvious first single release ' If I Was ' . \" I chose it \" came the reply . \" I just think it 's a good pop song . I do n't discriminate between pop or rock music , I just believe that a good song should always be well - crafted and , to my mind , that 's true of ' If I Was ' . There 's some better stuff on the album sure , but as an initial single it 's quite a good track . People do n't expect to hear me singing an out - and - out pop song I 'm sure and I felt it was a suitable thing to immediately establish the solo album as different from Ultravox . It was either that or releasing one of the instrumental tracks ... \" With the single nestling in the No.4 slot of the UK charts at the time of writing , it seems the British public firmly agree with his decision . Midge 's appreciation of a well - crafted song is the main reason for including on the album a cover version of ' Living In The Past ' - a Jethro Tull tune that first caught his attention at the ripe old age of fifteen . \" It was around the time when I was forming my first bands back in Scotland , and that song really stood out for me . Probably because it was one of the first ever songs by a bonafide rock band to successfully cross over to the singles market and become a hit . And it has stuck in my mind ever since . \" Midge 's version of the song departs radically from the original recording except for his vocal rendition which emulates the dry , up - front production style so characteristic of Tull 's original . The result , for me , is one of the best Ure vocal performances yet captured on record and , in an age when even the best vocalists are rarely heard without their voice first being processed through expensive ADT and reverb devices , to expose himself like that was a brave move indeed . It only goes to show how surprisingly good a vocalist he actually is . \" I went for a very intimate vocal sound on that track in particular \" he said . \" To achieve it , I had to sing quietly , close - up to the studio microphone which I do n't normally do . I usually stand well back and belt it out , especially when I 'm going for the high notes like on ' Vienna ' . \" The overall arrangement of the song is quite different to Jethro Tull's . The bass part , for example , is newly composed and played by Level 42's Mark King who really has helped add sparkle to the track . How , I asked , did Mark 's involvement in the project come about ? \" I happened to bump into him last year when Ultravox and Level 42 were appearing on the same TV show and whilst having a few drinks at the bar , I asked him whether he 'd kindly play on my solo album if I ever got around to doing something in the future . He accepted , I mainly think because he really enjoys playing different types of music , though people only know him for his slapping funk bass style . He actually played the bass on ' If I Was ' , which is probably the simplest bass line in the world - and you would n't expect Mark King to play anything like that - but it 's very effective on the record . \" A solo record is usually a chance for established recording artists to show their expertise ( or lack of it ) on instruments with which they are not generally associated . Fortunately , Midge was wise enough to recognise his own musical limitations and , instead , enlisted the help of those more able to translate his ideas of how a particular bass or drum part should sound , into a musical reality . A decision that has produced an altogether more enjoyable and certainly less indulgent collection of music . So , apart from Mark King and himself , which other musicians contributed to the recording ? \" They were mainly bass players and drummers . People like Mark Brzezicki of Big Country , who 'd impressed me on a recent Steve Harley session I did ; Nigel Ross -Scott , who plays bass with Reflex , and Lindsay Elliott , who used to drum for Cockney Rebel and who I 've known for some time . \" \" I handled the keyboards , guitars and vocals myself but I did make a conscious effort to get away from the sequenced bass lines that Ultravox are so well known for . I thought the best way of doing that was through the influence of other musicians . A solo album , for me , should always be a solo effort and that 's certainly true of The Gift because every idea on it originated in some way from me . But I see no point , for example , in bringing in a musician of Mark King 's calibre and forcing him to stick rigidly to the notes you 've already composed ! That would be a dreadful waste of his talent . \" \" With the drummers , for example , I already had guideline drums programmed into a Drumtraks purely to give the players an indication of where the build - ups and fills would occur in each song . But they were then totally free to expand on that guide , which they did , and the end result was always more interesting having the benefit of the human touch . \" \" Every song used a pre-recorded click - track to drive sequencers but I did n't want to use only machinery because you can tell it 's just a machine . It would have been too easy to use programmed drums . Half the challenge of making the album was working with the other people . And that was the most exciting part as well . \" The Gift features three instrumental tracks : ' Edo ' , ' Chieftains ' and ' Antibes ' - which was recorded on the Caribbean island of Montserrat using a Casio CZ- 101 ! Hardly what you 'd expect from a musician whose public profile is so closely allied to the role of frontman / vocalist . What comes as even more of a shock to the system is Midge 's revelation that his initial intention was to produce an album that contained five songs and five instrumentals ! Somewhere along the line , however , matters were diluted somewhat but he decided to retain three of the instrumentals , even though he was well aware that \" more often than not , when you get a couple of instrumentals on an album , it means the guy 's run out of ideas ! \" . The reason for their inclusion ? Simple : \" I like instrumental music . I find it very easy to listen to and it allows you to use your imagination in a way that most pop music does n't . It 's refreshing . \" Part of the power and appeal of instrumental music undoubtedly lies in its ability to conjure up images in the mind . Yet it functions superbly too as a reinforcement to the visual image . This is never more prevalent than in the hypnotic television advertising and jingle markets where a good music track is recognised as being a vital element of a successful commercial . \" MIDI I find baffling ... I really do . \" Prime examples of this approach have been the stylish Levi jean commercials that exploded across our television and cinema screens a few years back . Anyone remember the first ' Rivets ' advert featuring an Ultravox - style synthesized soundtrack and filmed explosions in a sun-drenched quarry ? Well , the man responsible for the music was Midge Ure , though that first foray into the advertising business was n't a particularly enjoyable one as he explained . \" I do n't know if I 'd ever do it again . Working with advertising agencies is the pits ... just awful ! You 're usually dealing with half a dozen people who all agree with each other , none of whom have a clue what they 're talking about , musically . Nevertheless , I rattled off the music quickly and was really pleased with it . I think it went very well with the visuals because I was given the finished visuals to write the music to , which is a rare occurrence , so I 'm told . Normally , you 're only given a written outline of what the finished visuals may be like and have to create something to complement them . \" Creatively -speaking , Midge Ure never appears to be stuck for an idea , whether it be for a song or one of the many Ultravox promotional videos he has produced . But what , I asked him , shapes a song 's development ? \" Well , there are a million ways to come up with song ideas . They may be sparked off by a particular riff or chord sequence or simply a mood . But once I 've got a basic idea or a feel for a song , then that starts to dictate how the lyrics are going to follow . I might , for example , have a seed of an idea in the back of my mind but no clue how to go about recording it . So , I begin crafting the music in the studio , working layer by layer until eventually , the lyrics start to form where the verses and chorus will appear . It all becomes apparent as you 're doing it usually - a bit like painting by numbers . \" As the lucky owner of a fully - equipped studio in his back garden , I wondered whether the Ure songwriting method was helped at all by the nature of multi track recording ? \" Very much so . Using my own 24 - track studio as a writing tool is great . I still use a Yamaha keyboard with a built - in drum machine , which I keep at home in my kitchen , purely for coming up with basic song ideas , but nothing ever takes shape until I actually start working in the studio . \" \" I begin by putting down a SMPTE timecode on one track , and recording a very basic snare and bass drum part on tape as a guide . Then with everything I put down after that , I 'm always looking to get a high quality sound on tape as it will potentially be something I keep . \" \" I tend to do a lot of track bouncing - even though there are 24 tracks available - to build up a sound . I may record four or five instruments all playing the same phrase but in various octaves , then do a stereo bounce of the lot , simply to get closer to what I hear in my head . I used to do that a lot on string machine parts with Ultravox but on The Gift I used mainly sampled string sounds from the Emulator 2 . Working that way , you force yourself to make decisions halfway through the recording process of how things will sound in the mix and bounce tracks when required . It 's very good training having your own studio . \" Good training it can be , but it can easily create a whole new set of problems for the musician if not careful . \" Initially , when my studio was built , like everybody else , I thought I 'd do everything in it myself . But you get too involved . Everybody I 've talked to who has a home studio tried at the start to do it all themselves but ended up getting too involved in the technical side of things . Then their playing side goes all to pot ! That 's why I have an engineer come in and help me when I wish to do some real recording . \" Concentrating on the musical aspects of the recording seems to have paid dividends for Midge and listening to the album ( recorded in his Chiswick studio and mixed at Air Studios in Montserrat ) , there 's nothing amiss in the audio quality department either . Taking , as an example , the oriental - sounding instrumental track ' Edo ' from his album , Midge set about explaining just how it was pieced together in the studio . \" It started off as two romantic melodies - the very ' breathy ' sounding one and the one played on a koto in the middle section . At the end of the song the two melodies cross over perfectly and I was very pleased with that effect . But it did n't start to sound Japanese until I started to use a koto on it ( laughs ) ! Although I love the koto sounds you get on a Yamaha DX7 , for instance , I wanted to use a real koto , so you 'd hear the fingers scraping across the strings . If you listen to ' Edo ' on headphones , the track really opens up when the koto comes in because of the ambient way it was miked up . Once it started to sound Japanese , I just followed through the imagery and used Japanese flutes and various instruments which I sampled from a collection of compact discs I had of Japanese tunes . \" Sampled sounds are used tastefully and to great effect on many tracks from The Gift . So what did Midge think of the technique ? \" I find sampling great fun but it 's got a jokey image through people over-using the classic ' Orch 4 ' Fairlight preset which we 've all heard a million times before . I like the idea of sampling odd items like pots and pans to form rhythm tracks . In fact , we recorded my metal garage door being banged and sampled that on the Emulator 2 , then wrote a pattern into the drum machine and used that to trigger the Emulator . It produced this odd Burundi-like rhythm which I used as the basis of another instrumental on the album called ' Chieftain ' . I also sampled the anvil sound on ' The Gift ' using a Powertran MCS - 1 as my Emulator 2 was away having its software updated . \" Something else Midge found himself doing whilst recording the album , was sampling the guitar . \" I 'd record a guitar solo played through a Rockman and break it down into one - or two - note pieces , mainly string bending noises or really fast vibratos . Then I 'd sample those bits I wanted and play them back at half speed from the Emulator keyboard , totally out of context . Then I 'd start constructing the solo again but by playing it from the keyboard , in stereo , using those samples . \" If you 're intrigued to hear this technique in action , take a listen to the guitar solo on the track called ' When The Wind Blows ' from The Gift . It 's quite an arresting sound . As a recording artist , one benefit of owning your own studio is undoubtedly the freedom it brings you to experiment with equipment . And one criticism levelled at people , like Midge Ure , who utilise the latest technological instruments on their albums , is that they often lack imagination when it comes to using such devices to anywhere near their full creative potential . The studio , Midge reckons , certainly helps him overcome that problem : \" It took me over a year to get into the PPG , for example . I really started to hate the thing and it was so complex to use , as ordinarily , you never have the time in someone else 's studio to learn how to use it . But having one around my studio and having time to actually use one , everything just suddenly clicked into place and I began enjoying it and appreciating the sounds it made . \" \" The DX7 , on the other hand , I still think is impossible to programme ! I ca n't be bothered with it . It 's capable of producing some great sounds I admit , but Casio have now come up with some synthesizer that 's just as good I feel - and a lot easier to work . I 'm a great advocate of user-friendly instruments you know ! \" Continuing on the theme of instrumentation , Midge had this strong viewpoint to express : \" Just because there 's a wealth of keyboards , drum machines and samplers on the market does n't automatically mean your guitarist sitting in his bedsit has got to go out , sell his guitar and buy the stuff . He does n't have to use it . It 's there if he wants to use it . \" \" It 's like MIDI . He does n't have to get sucked into it or feel he has to understand it if he does n't want to . MIDI , I find baffling ... I really do . \" ( Well there 's honesty for you ! ) \" It 's too in - depth for me . If it had been around when I bought my first synthesizer then I would have grown up with it . But to start to understand all the aspects and parameters of MIDI now is beyond me . My head is full of musical notes and arrangements , and I should n't have to be worrying whether or not there 's a ten millisecond delay on such and such a MIDI channel . \" Midge Ure may not like being drawn into the technical side of MIDI but , like everyone who relies so heavily on the application of hi-tech instruments in their music , he must come to terms with it . Just as he has had to learn about timecodes and click - tracks in order to run his studio . \" Using drum machine and sequencer codes is an absolute nightmare at times but I find myself unable to avoid getting caught up in that side of things . Even so , it 's still less baffling to me than MIDI ! \" \" Timecodes are a fundamental necessity for synchronisation purposes . Without them , you run in to all kinds of problems . For example , one of the album tracks we recorded without laying down a timecode first , so we could n't sync up the Emulator 's sequencer to play a sampled cello part that I wanted to put on the track . And I could n't physically play the cello part using the Emulator 2 because I 'm not a good enough keyboard player . So we ended up scrapping the whole track and starting again . \" Whatever the problems encountered during the making of the album , The Gift conclusively proves that Midge Ure is a fine songwriter who is not afraid to use whatever tools he has available to realise his ideas . And that is something he can be proud of .

The White House press secretary , Sean Spicer , claimed the \u201c British spying agency \u201d GCHQ had carried out the bugging . Spicer cited an unsubstantiated report on Fox News . Fox later distanced itself from the report . The claims prompted an extremely unusual rebuke from GCHQ , which generally refrains from commenting on all intelligence matters . The agency described the allegations first made by a former judge turned media commentator , Andrew Napolitano , as \u201c nonsense \u201d . \u201c They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored , \u201d a spokesperson for GCHQ said . Instead both US and UK intelligence sources acknowledge that GCHQ played an early , prominent role in kickstarting the FBI 's Trump - Russia investigation , which began in late July 2016 . One source called the British eavesdropping agency the \u201c principal whistleblower \u201d . The Guardian has been told the FBI and the CIA were slow to appreciate the extensive nature of contacts between Trump 's team and Moscow ahead of the US election . This was in part due to US law that prohibits US agencies from examining the private communications of American citizens without warrants . \u201c They are trained not to do this , \u201d the source stressed . \u201c It looks like the [ US ] agencies were asleep , \u201d the source added . \u201c They [ the European agencies ] were saying : ' There are contacts going on between people close to Mr Trump and people we believe are Russian intelligence agents . You should be wary of this . ' \u201c The message was : ' Watch out . There 's something not right here . ' \u201d According to one account , GCHQ 's then head , Robert Hannigan , passed material in summer 2016 to the CIA chief , John Brennan . The matter was deemed so sensitive it was handled at \u201c director level \u201d . After an initially slow start , Brennan used GCHQ information and intelligence from other partners to launch a major inter-agency investigation . In late August and September Brennan gave a series of classified briefings to the Gang of Eight , the top-ranking Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and Senate . He told them the agency had evidence the Kremlin might be trying to help Trump to win the presidency , the New York Times reported . One person familiar with the matter said Brennan did not reveal sources but made reference to the fact that America 's intelligence allies had provided information . Trump subsequently learned of GCHQ 's role , the person said . The person described US intelligence as being \u201c very late to the game \u201d . The FBI 's director , James Comey , altered his position after the election and Trump 's victory , becoming \u201c more affirmative \u201d and with a \u201c higher level of concern \u201d . Comey 's apparent shift may have followed a mid-October decision by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( Fisa ) court to approve a secret surveillance order . The order gave permission for the Department of Justice to investigate two banks suspected of being part of the Kremlin 's undercover influence operation . According to the BBC , the justice department 's request came after a tipoff from an intelligence agency in one of the Baltic states . This is believed to be Estonia . The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the same order covered Carter Page , one of Trump 's associates . It allowed the FBI and the justice department to monitor Page 's communications . Page , a former foreign policy aide , was suspected of being an agent of influence working for Russia , the paper said , citing US officials . The application covered contacts Page allegedly had in 2013 with a Russian foreign intelligence agent , and other undisclosed meetings with Russian operatives , the Post said . Page denies wrongdoing and complained of \u201c unjustified , politically motivated government surveillance \u201d . Late last year Comey threw more FBI resources into what became a far-reaching counter - intelligence investigation . In March he confirmed before the House intelligence committee that the agency was examining possible cooperation between Moscow and members of the Trump campaign to sway the US election . Comey and the NSA director , Admiral Michael Rogers , said there was no basis for the president 's claim that he was a victim of Obama \u201c wiretapping \u201d . Trump had likened the unproved allegation to \u201c McCarthyism \u201d . Britain 's MI6 spy agency played a part in intelligence sharing with the US , one source said . MI6 declined to comment . Its former chief Sir Richard Dearlove described Trump 's wiretapping claim on Thursday as \u201c simply deeply embarrassing for Trump and the administration \u201d . \u201c The only possible explanation is that Trump started tweeting without understanding how the NSA - GCHQ relationship actually works , \u201d Dearlove told Prospect magazine . A GCHQ spokesperson said : \u201c It is longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters \u201d . It is unclear which individuals were picked up by British surveillance . In a report last month the New York Times , citing three US intelligence officials , said warning signs had been building throughout last summer but were far from clear . As WikiLeaks published emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee , US agencies began picking up conversations in which Russians were discussing contacts with Trump associates , the paper said . European allies were supplying information about people close to Trump meeting with Russians in Britain , the Netherlands and in other countries , the Times said . There are now multiple investigations going on in Washington into Trump campaign officials and Russia . They include the FBI - led counter - espionage investigation and probes by both the House and Senate intelligence committees . Adam Schiff , the senior Democrat on the House committee , has expressed an interest in hearing from Christopher Steele , the former MI6 officer whose dossier accuses the president of long - term cooperation with Vladimir Putin 's Moscow . Trump and Putin have both dismissed the dossier as fake . One source suggested the official investigation was making progress . \u201c They now have specific concrete and corroborative evidence of collusion , \u201d the source said . \u201c This is between people in the Trump campaign and agents of [ Russian ] influence relating to the use of hacked material . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"GCHQ","span":[219,222],"token_span":[35,35],"role":"Interceptor","label":"Interceptor","role_definition":"The volitional agent who without authorization of sender or recipient takes control of a Theme that is en route to a destination."},{"text":"in late 2015","span":[243,254],"token_span":[39,41],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time period during which the Interceptor takes control of the Theme."},{"text":"suspicious \u201c interactions \u201d between figures connected to Trump and known or suspected Russian agents","span":[259,358],"token_span":[43,57],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The entity, physical or abstract, construed as traveling from a sender to a goal location, which is taken hold of by the Interceptor without permission."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"A volitionally acting Interceptor takes control, without being authorized to do so by the sender, of a Theme that is underway from a sender to a recipient.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-4469-592-frame-Interrupt_process","frame":"Interrupt_process","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"The BBC paid \u00a3 7 million ( $ 10.1 million ) as co-production partner , the most it had ever paid for a bought - in program , and screened it on BBC Two .

The surprise move of the 10 - part series was announced as part of the BBC One autumn schedule launch . Band of Brothers , about the D-Day landings , was co-produced by US cable channel HBO and is the most expensive programme ever bought by the BBC at \u00a3 7 m . But BBC schedulers said they considered the series better suited to BBC Two . \" It was decided to move it to BBC Two because we would be able to give it an uninterrupted 10 - week run on the channel , which may not have been possible on BBC One , \" said a spokesman . The spokesman denied that Band of Brothers had been moved because it was not mainstream enough . Dramatic As the corporation 's flagship TV channel , BBC One seemed the natural place for a series as high profile as Band of Brothers . Spielberg 's involvement was a natural headline grabber . Tom Hanks was also involved as producer . The two previously collaborated successfully on blockbuster World War II movie Saving Private Ryan . The cost of making the series - \u00a3 87 m - made Band of Brothers newsworthy . It is said to be one of the most expensive TV programmes made to date . On 6 June - the 57th anniversary of the 1944 landings by allied forces - the first programme in the series was shown in a 1,000 seater auditorium beside Normandy 's Utah Beach . Band of Brothers is based on a true story adapted from the best-selling book by Stephen Ambrose . It traces the dramatic exploits of a US army unit as it fights its way across Europe . Spielberg filmed much of it in the UK , recreating elaborate sets from across Europe and the US . But although boasting a cast of 50 speaking parts and 1000 extras , most of the actors are virtual unknowns . In the US , HBO is noticeably excited about the start of the series on its network on 9 September . A large area of its website has been dedicated to it for some weeks . HBO organised the beach screening for the series .

In 1968 at the height of the movement against him , young protesters in Karachi and Lahore began describing him as a dog ( Ayub Khan Kutta ! ) . This was a time when politicians and rulers in Pakistan hardly ever used any derogatory language against their opponents , so Ayub was supposedly shocked when he heard that some of his ' children ' ( the term he used to describe his subjects ) , had called him a dog . Ayub had come to power in 1958 on the back of a popular military coup ( Pakistan 's first ) , and had enjoyed a significant run of admiration from a majority of Pakistanis in the first four years of his dictatorship . Vowing to make Pakistan a powerful and influential military - industrial state , Ayub encouraged and facilitated an unprecedented growth in the process of industrialisation in the country . He also initiated the introduction of technical innovations in agriculture and brought Pakistan closer to the United States , thus benefitting from the military and financial aid that came with the enhanced relationship . By 1961 the Ayub regime had largely restored the country 's economy that had begun to weaken from the mid-1950s onwards , mainly due to the political chaos that prevailed in the country , as various factions of Pakistan 's first ruling party , the Muslim League , indulged in constant infighting and intrigues , and were unable to address the growing disenchantment and cynicism exhibited towards politicians by those who were kept out from the political process dominated by the country 's political - bureaucratic elite . Ayub was at the height of his power and popularity when he decided to lift Martial Law in 1962 and restore at least a semblance of political activity by the parties that had been banned in 1958 . He became the president and handpicked an assembly through a complex electoral system that he called ' Basic Democracy ' . After discarding the 1956 Constitution , his assembly passed a brand new constitution that enshrined Ayub 's idea of ' Jinnah 's Pakistan ' . It revolved around the construction of a strong military - industrial state , propped - up by state - backed capitalism , free enterprise , agricultural reforms and a ' progressive interpretation of Islam that was compatible with science , technology and modernity . ' Ayub detested politicians , from both the left as well as the right . His regime came down hard on left - wing parties and then went on to also ban parties such as the Jamat - i-Islami ( JI ) \u2014 though the ban was overturned by the courts . Leftists accused him of encouraging crony capitalism , the exploitation of workers and the suppression of the rights and ethnic-nationalism of the Bengalis ( in East Pakistan ) , Sindhis , the Baloch and the Pakhtun , and of dislodging the Urdu-speaking ( the Mohajirs ) from important state and government institutions that they had helped build after Pakistan 's creation in 1947 . | Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in a crowd of his supporters | The religious right denounced him of being overtly secular and undermining ' Pakistan 's Islamic culture and traditions ' . Ayub easily glided through the many periodical protests that took place against him after 1962 and then won a second term as president in a controversial presidential race in 1965 . Buoyed by his victory and his status as a ' benevolent dictator ' , Ayub then made an uncharacteristic mistake by allowing himself to be convinced by the hawks in his cabinet ( led by his young foreign minister , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto ) , to crown his economic and political achievements with a military triumph against India . India had suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Chinese army in 1964 and Bhutto and his supporters in the cabinet were convinced that the Pakistan army would be able to crush the weakened Indian armed forces . Though the Pakistani armed forces made rapid gains in the initial period of the 1965 war , the conflict soon turned into a stalemate . Ayub settled for a ceasefire , apparently sending Bhutto into a rage . Ayub eased out Bhutto from the government but the damage was done . The war had drained the country 's resources and the economy began to slide . Ayub 's opponents accused him of ' losing the war on the negotiation table ' . Bhutto went on to form the PPP , and along with the already established left-wing groups , such as the National Awami Party ( NAP ) and the National Students Federation ( NSF ) , he became the most prominent face of left - wing opposition in West Pakistan . In East Pakistan , Shiekh Mujeebur Rehman 's Awami League ( AL ) , upped the ante against the regime and accused it of leaving East Pakistan open to an Indian attack during the 1965 war . As the Bengali nationalist movement led by AL and by various militant / Maoist Bengali nationalist groups in East Pakistan gathered pace , in West Pakistan , Ayub was suddenly faced by a spontaneous students ' movement when in October 1968 , a large contingent from the NSF gate - crashed a ceremony being held by the government at Lahore 's Fortress Stadium ( to celebrate the government 's ' Decade of Progress ' ) . The students began to chant anti-Ayub slogans and clashed with the police . They accused the regime of enriching a handful of cronies and letting everyone else suffer unemployment and economic hardship . Then in November 1968 , police opened fire on a left - wing student rally in Rawalpindi , killing three protesters . In response , students formed a Students Action Committee and announced that students across Pakistan would begin a concentrated protest movement against the regime . As the students began their campaign ( with most of the student groups demanding a socialist system and parliamentary democracy ) , Bhutto 's PPP joined the fray along with NAP and their entry brought with it the participation in the movement of the radical trade and labour unions that were associated with these parties . By late 1968 the movement had spread beyond Karachi , Lahore , Rawalpindi and Peshawar and reached the smaller cities and towns of Punjab and Sindh . Meanwhile in East Pakistan , AL and other Bengali nationalist groups began to demand complete provincial autonomy for East Pakistan . Schools , colleges and universities stopped functioning ; workers went on strike and closed down a number of factories , and white - collar professionals refused to attend office , further crippling an already deteriorating political and economic order . After failing to quell the protests ( through police action and wide - scale arrests ) , Ayub invited opposition parties to hold a dialogue with the government . But the PPP and NAP boycotted the negotiations that were largely attended by religious parties and some moderate right - wing parties . However , Mujeeb 's AL did participate , but the talks ultimately broke down . By early 1969 the movement had also been joined by peasant committees and organisations in the country 's rural areas . In March 1969 a group of senior military men advised Ayub to step down , fearing the eruption of a full - scale civil war in East Pakistan and political and social anarchy in the country 's west wing . A weakened and tired Ayub finally decided to throw - in the towel and resigned , handing over power to General Yahya Khan who immediately imposed the country 's second martial law . He promised to hold the country 's first general election based on adult franchise and to relinquish power after introducing parliamentary democracy in Pakistan . With this announcement , the movement came to a halt . Elections were held in 1970 . In East Pakistan the AL won 98 per cent of the allotted national and provincial assembly seats , whereas in West Pakistan , the PPP swept the polls in the region 's two largest provinces , Punjab and Sindh . NAP performed well in the former NWFP and Balochistan . Most of the ' status quo parties ' ( such as the many Muslim League factions ) and most religious outfits ( except Jamiat Ulema Islam ) were decimated . However , a three - way deadlock between AL , PPP and the Yahya regime ( over a power - sharing formula ) regime triggered a crisis that finally saw the feared eruption of a civil war in East Pakistan and then India 's entry into the conflict . After that disastrous conflict , a group of military officers ( most of them Bhutto sympathisers ) , forced Yahya to resign and then invited Bhutto and his party to form the country 's first parliamentary government . Ayub , who had gone into seclusion , died in 1974 .

Officers are seeking legal advice to see if the gang 's assets can be frozen under the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance , which enables the proceeds of organised crime to be confiscated . Cheung has been detained in Guangzhou with 17 Hong Kong residents and 14 mainlanders in connection with a string of crimes including the kidnapping of two SAR tycoons whose families paid a total of more than $ 1 .6 billion ransom in 1996 and 1997 .

Cheung is believed to own a number of properties in Hong Kong , including a 3,000 - square - foot Ho Man Tin home . His gang was also said to have laundered some of the money on the mainland by buying more than 50 properties and 11 vehicles , the proceeds of which have been seized by Guangdong police . Another $ 40 million in cash has been found there .

The exhibition is based on research by Andrejs Edvins Feldmanis ( born in 1939 ) , a Latvian cinematographer and board member of the Occupation Museum Foundation . Feldmanis dedicated the exhibition to his father , First Lieutenant Fridrichs Feldmanis of the Latvian Army , who was murdered by U.S.S.R. NKVD units at an army summer training camp in Litene , Latvia , on June 14 , 1941 . Excerpts from the exhibition 's brochure allude to the dangerous political backdrop of Europe in the late 1930s , which portended a bleak future for Latvia . \" The government of Latvia had to pay special attention to its eastern border , because under Stalin the U.S.S.R. actively pursued the idea of ' exporting the Revolution , ' [ with the aim of dominating the world ] in the name of protecting the proletariat . Soviet Special Forces exerted considerable pressure on Latvia 's eastern border in the form of intelligence activities ( with a training center for spies located in the Russian frontier city Ostrov ) , and the activities of members of the outlawed Latvian Communist Party , smugglers , saboteurs , and the like . \" Between the two world wars Latvia 's eastern border was in many ways a dividing line between the East and West in Europe . [ \u2026 ] Contrasting political systems and ideologies [ sparked various countries ' intelligence activities in Latvia ] . Local people and border guards were actively recruited and became involved in these activities . Some local Russian families [ \u2026 ] were pro-communist and supported the Soviet secret service . [ \u2026 ] Some local inhabitants and border guards were double agents \u2026 \" On the night of June 15 the [ Latvian ] border is being guarded by Janis Macitis on patrol and Peteris Cimoska in the blind . Karlis Beizaks and Valdis Grinvalds are in the duty room . The wife of patrol leader Fricis Purins , Hermine , and his son Voldemars are in his apartment . In a house rented by Zanis Krievins , his wife Lida -Julija , his son Arturs , and his daughter Rita , and the children 's guest , 6 - year - old Erika Kalnina , are asleep . \" At around 2:30 a.m. 25 NKVD [ Interior People 's Commissariat ] men cross the Ludza River and surround the Maslenki border guards ' [ patrol ] house and the Krievins ' house . The attackers place hand grenade packets around the guardhouse . Possibly , the initial plan is to capture the patrol , but the attackers are spotted by Macitis . As an exchange of gunfire ensues , the tactics of the NKVD unit turn to destroying the patrol . Macitis is seriously wounded and retreats towards the guardhouse . Cimoska returns the attackers ' automatic rifle fire and , retreating towards the guardhouse , steps on a grenade packet and is torn to shreds in the explosion . \" Grinvalds returns the fire through the guardhouse window , while Beizaks tries to run for help to the 1st Patrol . After running 199 meters , he is gunned down . \" The attackers throw a firebomb into the guardhouse , first setting the interior on fire and then the entire house . Hermine Purina tries to save herself by jumping through the window but is shot 8.5 meters from the guardhouse . Her son Voldemars runs out the door and seeks refuge in a nearby woodpile . He is shot by the attackers in the leg and stomach and dies from his wounds the following day at the hospital in Rezekne . Macitis , too , has been mortally wounded . He is found dear close to the house , with his legs burned . Grinvalds runs unhurt from the burning house and throws himself into the river , where he is captured . \" As the guardhouse is attacked , the NKVD men also storm the Krievins ' house , tossing in hand grenades . These seriously wound Krievins ' wife and she loses consciousness . Krievins and his son sustain lighter wounds and are captured by the attackers . The girls escape by hiding under a bed . \" The NKVD posts an advance guard 250 meters from the Maslenki cordon to prevent possible aid to the Maslenki patrol . Here the leader of the 1st Patrol , Vilis Lazdins , and guards Arvids Polis and Jezups Abrickis are captured as they hasten to the tragic event . \" When the attackers have overcome the guard , they capture some other survivors , including the family of farmer Dmitrijs Maslovs , who lives nearby . Rounding up their own wounded and their casualties , they hastily gather some of the evidence and retreat beyond the border , into Soviet territory . \" \u2026 After the October 5 , 1939 treaty [ which provided for the establishment of ] Soviet army bases on Latvian territory , the Latvian Army [ was ] forced to design a new mobilization and defense plan . This plan [ had ] a single objective : to resist the U.S.S.R. armed forces should they attempt to take over all of Latvia . According to [ Latvian ] historian Edgars Andersons , mobilization was to take place in three days ' time , and two defense lines were to be established in the east . The Daugava , Aiviekste , and Pededze rivers were to form the defense line . \" As is well known , neither the Latvian Border Guard nor the Latvian Army received orders to resist the occupation forces . The government of Latvia and its army [ were ] forced to accept the situation in Europe , when none of the Western powers [ were ] willing or able to help the Baltic States [ defend themselves against the Soviet invasion ] . \" The Soviet invasion of Latvia on June 17 , 1940 , following its ultimatum , interrupted the official investigation of the attack on the Maslenki border post . There had been attacks on other posts . Only after Latvia regained independence in 1991 was the case reopened . The case concluded that Soviet military persons had killed three Latvian border guards - Karlis Beizaks , 25 , Janis Macitis , 27 , and Peteris Cimoska , 26 , and two civilians , Hermine Purins , 44 , and Voldemars Purins , 14 . Three members of the Purins family were wounded . Ten Latvian border guards and 27 civilians in all had been captured . Several small children and one infant were among the captives . Less than a month later , on July 7 , 1940 , all the captives except Dmitrijs Maslovs were returned . Maslovs was later tried by an NKVD court , sentenced to death , and shot in 1942 . Seven-year- old Silvija Smukkalne suffered a nervous breakdown ; she contracted a disease of the nervous system after her release and died .","annotations":[{"text":"First Lieutenant Fridrichs Feldmanis","span":[492,527],"token_span":[90,93],"role":"Victim","label":"Victim","role_definition":"The living entity that dies as a result of the killing."},{"text":"U.S.S.R.

The Equal Justice in the Courts task force , led by former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson , was a four-month project commissioned by Chief Judge Janet DiFiore in June , amid nationwide demonstrations against institutional racism touched off by the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor . Their report specifically calls on court leaders to establish a \u201c zero tolerance \u201d policy against racism and discrimination , implement comprehensive bias training programs and increase the hiring of people of color and other underrepresented populations throughout the court system . The report 's authors also advised court leaders to assign an independent monitor to evaluate and report on the court system 's handling of the recommendations . Chief Judge Janet DiFiore has appointed Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David to that role . Johnson and his team of attorneys and advisers interviewed hundreds of judges , attorneys , court staffers , observers , litigants and other court stakeholders and accepted testimony and reports from people involved in the legal - justice system . \u201c In my assessment as a lawyer , a student of history , a former public official , and as an African American , this is a moment that demands a strong and pronounced rededication to equal justice under law by the New York State court system , \u201d said Johnson , a partner at Paul , Weiss , Rifkind , Wharton & Garrison , LLP . DiFiore said she and the Office of Court Administration endorse the recommendations , which \u201c offer a tangible framework for a court system that truly reflects the diversity and inclusiveness of our communities , ensures the fair administration of justice and promotes the public trust . \u201d Nearly three decades after the last review on court system bias , judges , attorneys , court personnel and other stakeholders continue to report implicit and explicit racism , the report found . \u201c The good news is that today 's New York State judiciary is more diverse than it was 30 years ago , \u201d the authors state . \u201c The bad news is that the accounts of explicit and implicit racial bias we heard as part of this review were strikingly similar to the testimony from decades ago . \u201d The report found that people of color are underrepresented on county and municipal benches across the state , including in every borough of New York City . In Queens , for example , over 60 percent of the judiciary is white , compared to less than a quarter of the population , the report found . Latino and Asian populations are the most underrepresented on the bench in Queens . While the judiciary has become more diverse statewide , the gap between the percentage of non- white residents and non- white judges has actually increased since 1991 , according to the report . In 1991 , people of color made up 30.7 percent of the state population and just 8.2 percent of the bench \u2014 a 20.5 percent gap . In 2020 , people of color made up 44.8 percent of the state population and 23.9 percent of the bench \u2014 a 20.9 percent gap . The most explicit accounts of racism pertain to the conduct of court officers , based on interviews with various attorneys , personnel and litigants . Multiple people described court officers using racial slurs , including the n-word , in courthouses . One court officer sergeant called a group of Black teenagers the n-word in an elevator , according to a public defender interviewed by the commission . Court officers of color told interviewers that they did not feel comfortable coming forward to report the abuse for fear of being ostracized and that officers faced few consequences for their behavior . \u201c Although interviewees stressed that not all court officers behave in a hostile manner , almost every interview touched on what appears to be a culture of toxicity and unprofessionalism exhibited by court officers towards litigants , litigants ' relatives and attorneys of color , \u201d the report states . Observers have long noted the demographic disparities and institutional racism in the court system . The report has galvanized many groups , including bar associations and organizations representing judges , to share their concerns \u2014 often backed up by demographic data and personal testimonies . In August , for example , an organization representing more than 200 New York judges of color released a report on institutional racism in the state court system that they had submitted to the Commission on Equal Justice in the Courts . The report by the Judicial Friends Association highlighted racial and ethnic disparities in judicial leadership , detailed impediments to equal justice for Black and Latino defendants and made recommendations for addressing pervasive biases . \u201c To assess the extent to which racism affects the New York State Unified Court System , one must start at the top and ask , \u201c are Black judges participating in the most powerful , policy making positions within OCA ? \u201d The answer is a resounding NO , \u201d the Judicial Friends wrote . None of the executive judges in the Office of Court Administration are Black , the association wrote . Just three Black judges hold statewide positions and the disparities continue down the judicial ranks , including the presence of just six Black judges on the 81 - member Court of Claims appointed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo , they added . The Judicial Friends cited OCA statistics showing that roughly 76 percent of New York 's 1,291 state judges are white , about 14 percent of judges are Black , 7 percent are Latino and 2.7 percent are Asian . Their report described disparities at all levels of the criminal justice system , such as a jury selection process that allows attorneys to strike potential jurors based on their negative interactions with police officers or their support for the Black Lives Matter movement . Judicial Friends President Erika Edwards , Manhattan Supreme Court Justice , told the Eagle that the commission enabled judges and other stakeholders to speak out on the key matter of representation and bias . \u201c The difficulty as judges is we are precluded from speaking on political matters , \u201d Edwards said last month . \u201c It 's difficult , being a judge of color , dealing with COVID , dealing with shootings of unarmed men and women of color because there 's not much we can do . \u201d \u201c But this was something we could do to help improve our system and the world , \u201d she continued . The demographic disparities have also galvanized activism among Queens ' bar association and legal groups . Attorneys and judicial leaders have called for more Black , Latino , Asian , South Asian and Muslim judges on the bench to truly reflect the diversity of the borough . \u201c The courts where people of color are the predominant users , it 's so critical that there be a diverse bench , \u201d Supreme Court , Criminal Term Administrative Judge Joseph Zayas said earlier this month . \u201c It 's not disputable . People need to see themselves reflected on the bench . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"New York","span":[59,66],"token_span":[6,7],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"Where the Finding takes place."},{"text":"the New York State court system","span":[173,203],"token_span":[24,29],"role":"Authority","label":"Authority","role_definition":"The Authority (which may be the jury, judge, magistrate or court) decides on the Finding."},{"text":"people of color and other underrepresented populations","span":[926,979],"token_span":[146,152],"role":"Defendant","label":"Defendant","role_definition":"The person about whom the Authority passes a judgment or Finding."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Authority with the power to make decisions hands down a Finding over a question presented in a formal or informal Case.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":["Verdict"]},{"instance_id":"EN-7384-395-frame-Lending","frame":"Lending","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"On Friday 9 December 2011 , Fitzpatrick was arrested a second time by Garda\u00ed , allegedly as part of an investigation into \" Financial Irregularities at a Financial Institution \" .

The 64-year- old had been questioned previously during a three - and - a- half year probe by detectives from the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation attached to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement ( ODCE ) into alleged financial irregularities at the failed bank . The bankrupt former businessman , with an address at Camaderry , Whitshed Road , Greystones , Co Wicklow , stepped down in December 2008 . Anglo was subsequently nationalised and re-branded the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation ( IBRC ) with its collapse costing Irish taxpayers about \u20ac 30 bn . The dapper former banker had been arrested at Dublin Airport in the early hours of today by arrangement \u2013 and indicated that he understood why \u2013 before he was taken to the Bridewell Garda Station in the city -centre . There , at 8.08 AM , he made \u201c no comment \u201d when he was charged with 16 counts contrary to Section 60 of the Companies Act . The charges allege that before it was nationalised , he permitted the bank to \u201c give unlawful financial assistance \u201d to 16 named individuals for the purpose of or in connection with a purchase by the same people of shares in the then Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Plc . It is claimed the alleged unlawful financial help to buy shares was given between July 10 and July 17 , 2008 to 15 people \u2013 which include the so-called \u201c Maple Ten \u201d group of Irish Investors and several members of Sean Quinn 's family \u2013 and from July 17 until July 30 , of the same year , to Patricia Quinn , the wife of now bankrupt quarry tycoon Sean . Among the names on the charges is Sean Quinn Junior , who was jailed last week by the High Court for contempt of court for hiding \u20ac 500 m of property assets from Anglo , now called the IBRC . Also included in the names of people who allegedly got financial assistance to buy shares in the bank are : Colette Marie Quinn , Aoife Quinn , Ciara Quinn , Brenda Quinn , property developer Patrick McKillen , Seamus Ross , Brian O'Farrell , John McCabe , Gerard Maguire , Patrick Kearney , Gerard Gannon , Gerard Conlon , Sean Reilly and Joseph O'Reilly . State solicitor Jane Farrell told Judge Cormac Dunne at Dublin District Court that the DPP has directed that Mr Fitzpatrick is to face trial on indictment in relation to all the charges . His charges are duplicates of those brought earlier this week against two other former senior executives from the bank , Willie McAteer and Patrick Whelan \u2013 and like them he will face a trial before a judge and jury at Dublin Circuit Court . Looking tanned and dressed in a dark blazer , blue shirt , pink tie and beige trousers , the ex-banker remained seated and silent with his hands on his lap as he looked at the judge who was taking down notes detailing his arrest . He spoke once saying \u201c thank you \u201d after the judge agreed to release him on bail pending the preparation of the book of evidence . His sister Joyce O'Connor stood bail in the sum of \u20ac 10,000 . Once the independent surety was approved , he was let out and ordered to appear again on October 8 next . Mr Fitzpatrick walked from court with a garda escort straight into a media scrum and was surrounded by photographers and camera crews . He was then ushered into a waiting taxi which whisked him away from the courthouse . It had been a busy morning for the ex- Anglo chairman ; he had been arrested at 5.37 am by arrangement at Dublin Airport and from there he was taken to the Bridewell Garda Station . After being charged there , he emerged from the back of the station at 9.12 am with his head looking downwards and a dark coat draped over both his hands . He was the last of three prisoners loaded on a Garda van ; seconds later it pulled out and brought him on the short drive to the Criminal Courts of Justice Complex at Parkgate Street for his hearing . At 11.11 am , at Dublin District Court , the 17th case was called . Sean Fitzpatrick walked in a doorway from the holding cells into courtroom number one where the public gallery was jam - packed with lawyers , gardai , about 20 journalists and dozens of legally aided unemployed defendants \u2013 some who faced drugs , shoplifting , assault and public order charges . Detective Sergeant Brian Mahon of the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation , who has been seconded to the ODCE , told Judge Dunne that the former banker replied \u201c I do \u201d when he was asked if her understood why he had been arrested . He was later charged with the 16 offences at 8.08 am . \u201c I cautioned him , after each charge his reply was ' no comment ' , \u201d said Det - Sgt Mahon . Defence solicitor Michael Staines put it to Det - Sgt Mahon that : \u201c Once he became aware gardai were seeking to arrest him , he contacted you through his solicitor and arranged to meet you at the airport . \u201d The fraud squad detective agreed that was the case and that throughout Mr Fitzpatrick 's travels abroad he has let gardai know where he was at all times . There was no objection to bail but the officer said that he wanted a \u20ac 10,000 independent surety to be set . Granting bail , Judge Dunne ordered Mr Fitzpatrick to sign on every Wednesday at Irishtown Garda station in Dublin , reside at his current address and give gardai 48 hours notice if he intends to change address or leave the country . The judge stipulated that the signing - on condition would be suspended during periods when Mr Fitzpatrick is out of the jurisdiction . Mr Fitzpatrick put on his spectacles and got into the box once not to give evidence but to sign his bail bond and then thanked the judge quietly . His prosecution comes after former Anglo Irish Bank finance director Willie McAteer and the bank 's former Bank managing director for Ireland , Patrick Whelan were charged with committing the same offences . On Monday each man was released on conditional bail of \u20ac 1,000 with independent surety of \u20ac 10,000 and both are to appear again at the district court on October 8 next when they are to be served with books of evidence and returned for trial . Irish NECKS stretched and muffled whispers filled courtroom number one as a smartly dressed ex-banker was brought up from a holding cell . Irish IT is expected to take three years to complete the criminal trials of people charged arising from a three and a half year investigation by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement ( ODCE ) into the 2008 collapse of the former Anglo Irish Bank , the High Court heard .

Dragon Quest III , a.k.a. Dragon Warrior III The earlier Dragon Quest games usually had a section where players were left to their own ends . This one had the most substantial example . Developed by Enix Designed by Yuuji Horii Platform : Famicom , NES Length : Very long Of Note : Until this game , and unlike the series inspiration Wizardry , the Dragon Quest games gave the player pre-made characters ( DQII ) , or at least those with randomized stats ( DQ ) . This was the first game to use a Wizardry - like system of letting the player actually create his teammates in a simple creation process , giving them names and classes and even letting him swap them in and out of his party at will . The result was a game with greater longevity than many Japanese console RPGs . Players can play with a party with the basic Soldier , Pilgrim and Wizard , or experiment with other unusual configurations like three Merchants or Jesters . The Game : Up until Dragon Quest III , the venerable series did have some non-linear aspects . Most of the original game is not really blocked in any way other than by being infested with monsters that can instantly kill an unprepared player . The second and third games have a substantial portion of them taken up in a search for important items scattered throughout their worlds . One interesting thing that separates these Dragon Quest games from many others is the role bridges play in them . Bridges tend to signify a major change in the difficulty of monsters the player encounters . If the player is still struggling with the monsters he 's fighting and sees a bridge , he 'll know not to traipse across it . There are exceptions to this rule , and sometimes monsters improve upon crossing invisible boundaries , but the use of some element of the scenery to indicate to the player that difficulty is going up is an idea that far more RPGs could stand to borrow . While most games use \" hard \" barriers to prevent player access to later areas , Dragon Quest is more likely to use \" soft \" barriers , where the player can go where he wants , maybe after an early section that 's more linear , but it might be unwise to do so because of the strength of the monsters . In an action game player skill can make up for undue numeric difficulty , but in a turn - based combat RPG the numbers and flags that define a monster 's abilities are the challenge , and there 's only so much the player can do to get around them . If you think about it , this poses unique problems when designing a non-linear RPG . To a player with 40 maximum hit points , going from an area where the monsters do 12 hit points of damage to an area where they do 20 is an almost unbearable increase in danger . If the quest path is mostly straight and one - way , then the monster spawn zones can be placed to match . But if the game is n't linear , then the designer has no idea where the player will be going next . The player might stray into areas intended for far hardier characters than he 's had the chance to build , and could get wiped out quickly , causing frustration . I think some frustration is n't necessarily bad in a game , but no one wants to challenge the gods unprepared . But on the other hand , if all the areas have monsters that are a good challenge for characters from the moment they are able to enter them , then growth will be rapid at first and soon the player will cruse through the rest of the game . The Dragon Quest games , to my eyes , solve the problem by taking advantage of an interesting aspect of RPG character growth , the fact that the effective rate of character growth actually decelerates over time . Take 1st and 2nd edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons level growth as an example . Back in those days , a character 's starting hit points were determined by the role of a single die . Upon reaching each additional level , players got to roll another die and add that to their total . The result was , at first level the player 's hit points could be as low as one , but with each additional level gained the law of averages caused HP to trend towards average , making them more generally survivable against foes of equal level . However , the amount of hit points gained with each level remains constant , even though the player is accumulating more and more of them . A first level mage in 2nd Edition AD&D had an average of 2.5 hit points . Gaining an additional level approximately doubles that figure . But a tenth level mage has about 25 hit points , and gaining level 11 still adds on just 2.5 more . The gain relative to what he already has becomes less and less as the character grows . More recent versions of D&D even out the randomness a bit more by giving characters maximum hit points at first level , and JRPGs like Dragon Quest work around this by giving characters some extra HP at the start , by subtly increasing growth rate at higher levels , and sometimes by even starting players at higher levels , but the overall principle still applies . As the player 's party gains levels , they may grow linearly , or even in a steadily accelerating rate , but the effective benefit from those levels decreases . Dragon Quest games never start the player , from first level , in a wholly non-linear part of the game ; that bit only kicks in once he 's gotten some levels under his belt . The result is , that large area with monsters all of about the same level , if made just a little harder than usual , can suffice to provide good challenge for quite some time . A level 21 player may struggle a bit when facing level 26 monsters , but he wo n't be wiped out as a level 1 player would be fighting level 6 foes . Design Lessons : The non-linear sections of the early Dragon Quest games ( IV does not apply ! ) allow the player some freedom in his exploration , but have to be carefully handled to continue to give the player a sense of danger . But it is n't all that bad if the player 's party gets a little strong compared to the opposition during the tail end of these sections . If an RPG couples monster difficulty too closely to PC advancement , then the player never gets the feeling that his wards are really improving . The worst games in this regard are those that multiply by scaling values to directly tie monster difficulty to player level . Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy VIII are two notable games that do this . Oblivion does it too . If monsters are always slightly stronger than the player , then what on Alefgard / Ivalice / Tamriel are experience levels for ? Links : Wikipedia GameFAQs 14 . Ufouria , a.k.a. Hebereke It 's like Metroid meets Hello Kitty , true , but it 's actually rather a cool little game . Developed by Sunsoft . Directed by \" Chow - Mu-Sow \" and Yoshinori Homma Designed by \" Ucchi \" Platform : Famicom , NES ( European , Australian ) Length : Short Of Note : This is a rather quirky open world game that , despite being the subject of an infamous Nintendo Power spread , never made it to the United States . The reasons are possibly related to Sunsoft 's continued disappointment over Blaster Master . It 's actually fairly rare in any territory , and is regarded as a collector 's item . By the way , if you decide to hunt this game up and play it , you should probably be made aware of the primary means of attack . Early in the game , before weapon items have been found , the only way to harm enemies is to jump on them with the down direction held on the control pad . If you jump on them Mario style you 'll just get hurt , but holding down causes the characters to present their feet in order to give the monster a good stomp . Once killed , the enemy usually leaves behind a weird blue face that can be used as a weapon against other monsters . The Game : The game 's map is found early , but is more like the one from Goonies II than Super Metroid , showing the general location of the areas and sometimes it shows the location of objects , but not exits or any detail , and other things only if special detectors are found . This is another game that starts the player out with only very basic maneuvers and makes him find 90 % of the abilities he can eventually have . In this case , some of those abilities come in the form of alternate characters he can control . Unlike Legacy of the Wizard ( see below ) , the player can switch between these guys at any time , which is kind of a weird decision from a design standpoint . Only one character walk on ice and float on water , yet another can sink in water , one can climb walls ( once the appropriate item is found ) , one can destroy bombable walls ( again , with the right item ) ... and another has floaty jumps that let him cover long distances . There is really no good reason all of these abilities ca n't be given to one character , especially since they otherwise have similar abilities and share the same damage meter . But on the other hand , a lot of the game 's charm comes from its animations , and there 'd be a lot less of that to see if the player only had one guy to play . As far as game structure , there are some rather fiendish secret routes in this one , like doors found on platforms surrounded on all sides by air , and which must be sort of lucked onto from above . There 's another place where the ghost character has to jump from cloud to cloud to make it to an important area , but there 's a gap between two clouds that looks too far to jump . It is too far , but if the player tries it , a cloud shoots up from below , just as the player passes it . While the game 's character graphics show an undeniable Sanrio influence , the backgrounds seem a lot more detailed than they have to be . Have a look at the water for example , those animated waves look a lot more realistic than they have any right being in a game like this . Design Lessons : One thing about Ufouria that could possibly be regarded as a negative in how it takes after Metroid is its health system . Both games start the player with a pitiful amount of health , far less than maximum , and when starting a new life they go back to that minimal energy level . In Ufouria the player can eventually get up to 250 health , but every time a life begins , he 's back to 10 . At least in Metroid enemies drop health rather frequently ! Maybe one in eight kills in Ufouria drop a health ball , and those are only worth 2 energy each ! The only realistic way to refill health is to find Medicine or Water of Life somewhere in the game , which refill 50 and all health respectively , but each can only be found once per life , and neither can the player carry more than one of either at a time . While I think we can all agree that this is going too far , there is something to be said for the spirit it adds to a game . It means that the player ca n't ever just bludgeon his way through any areas . Any time he 's going somewhere to fight a boss , even if he 's going through the areas at the very start of the game , he ca n't just rush through and take the hits . Whether the damage taken at any point leading up to a boss , or facing the boss himself , it counts the same . The player must pay attention if he 's going to survive , and classic gamers tend to appreciate that .

Correspondence Address : In 1896 , Joseph Babinski , a French neurologist , first described the best known neurologic eponym ' the Babinski sign ' . This sign is characterised by dorsiflexion of the big toe and recruitment of the extensor hallucis longus muscle , on stimulating the sole of the foot . He has emphasised from the outset , the intimate relationship between this sign and the shortening movement in other leg muscles , which form the flexion synergy of the lower limb . The Babinski sign is not a new reflex , rather it is released as a result of breakdown of the harmonious integration of the flexion and extension components of the normal defence reflex mechanism , due to pyramidal tract dysfunction . A pathological Babinski sign should be clearly distinguished from upgoing toes that may not always be a part of the flexion synergy . This article reviews the Babinski sign in detail , focusing on the historical perspectives , role of pyramidal tract dysfunction and art of elicitation and interpretation . The significance of assessing this phenomenon in the entire leg , and the clinical clues that will help to dispel the myths regarding the Babinski sign , have been emphasised . It was on February 22 , 1896 , that Joseph Francois Felix Babinski published his first report on ' reflexe cutane plantaire ' [ cutaneous plantar reflex ] which became the sign that bears his name : ' the Babinski sign ' . [ 1 ] However unknown to Babinski , several painters like Bortticelli , Raphael , Leonardo da Vinci had previously demonstrated this phenomenon in their paintings . [ 2 ] Later , Babinski asserted that if others had described the abnormal reflex before him , they found it fortuitously and did not realize its clinical implication ; while he discovered it by a combination of chance , careful observation and intuition . [ 3 ] Babinski first differentiated between a normal and pathologic plantar response . [ 4 ] Sketch of the Man Joseph Babinski was born in Paris and died at the age of 75 in 1932 [ Figure . 1 ] . Of reticent disposition , he wrote in a very sombre and serious tone , but his gaze , clear and calm , was penetrating and scrutinizing . [ 5 ] He was a devout bachelor and had two passions in his life i.e. work and his brother Henri . His objective was always to find clinical signs that permitted the authentification of the organic nature of the syndrome ; and specify the localisation of the lesion responsible for the same . Babinski 's ambition to establish a department of neurosurgery at the Hospital de la Pitie in Paris , where he did most of his work , was realised shortly after his death . [ 6 ] The Babinski sign This eponym refers to the dorsiflexion of the great toe with or without fanning of the other toes and withdrawal of the leg , on plantar stimulation in patients with pyramidal tract dysfunction . The characteristic response is dorsiflexion of the great toe by recruitment of extensor hallucis longus ( EHL ) muscle . In most mammals the limbs are automatically retracted on painful stimulation as a defence reflex , which is more pronounced in hind limbs . Sherrington called it , the flexion reflex synergy , because activation of all muscles effected shortening of the limb ; the toe extensors forming part of this shortening synergy . Confusion has arisen from the application of the term extensor plantar response to a movement which forms part of a flexion synergy of the lower limbs . The toe ' extensors ' although named extensors by anatomists , are infact flexors in a physiological sense because their action is to shorten the limb and contract reflexly along with other flexor muscles . The Babinski sign may be a normal occurrence in the 1st year of life , due to a brisker flexion synergy , the toes being a part of it . As the nervous system matures and the pyramidal tract gains more control over spinal motor neurons , the flexion synergy becomes less brisk and toe ' extensors ' are no longer a part of it . The toe then often goes down , instead of up , as a result of a segmental reflex involving the small foot muscles and the overlying skin . This is considered to be normal in adults and is termed - flexor plantar response . With lesions of the pyramidal system , structural or functional , this segmental downward response of the toes disappears , the flexion synergy may become disinhibited and the EHL muscle is again recruited into the flexion reflex of the leg producing the sign of ' Babinski ' . [ 7 ] The muscles taking part in a fully developed response include extensor hallucis longus , tibialis anterior , extensor digitorum longus , hamstring group of muscles and tensor faciae latae . The characteristic response is dorsiflexion ( extension ) of the [ big toe ] , which precedes all other movements . It is followed by fanning out and extension of the other toes , dorsiflexion of the ankle and flexion of the hip and knee joint . This response represents ' positive ' Babinski sign . There is no such thing as a ' negative ' Babinski sign . The role of pyramidal tract There seems to be a close association between occurrence of the Babinski sign and impairment of voluntary foot movement . A Babinski sign can appear only if the intraspinal pathways of the flexion reflex synergy are operative , however , severe the motor deficit in the foot . The function of the pyramidal tract may not only be disturbed by structural lesions of myelin sheaths , axons , or both , but also by nonneurological conditions [ Table I ] . The motor neurons of the leg muscles are laminated into separate columns within the anterior horn of the cord , each of which supply proximal or distal muscles , flexor or extensor muscles . In addition , there are important pyramidal tract projections to the intermediate ( interneuronal ) zone . This divergence of pyramidal tract projections allows the following two explanations for the Babinski sign . The Babinski sign might be released by dysfunction of pyramidal tract fibres that project on interneuronal zone , at least on those interneurons that subserve the flexion reflex synergy , of which the Babinski sign is a part . As these interneurons are necessarily interconnected across the segments of the lumbosacral spinal cord , a Babinski sign would always be Types of Babinski sign a) Minimal Babinski sign : Contraction of hamstring muscles and tensor faciae latae . b) True Babinski sign : Includes all the components of the fully developed extensor plantar reflex . c) Pseudo Babinski sign : One may encounter this type of response in sensitive individuals , plantar hyperaesthesia , and choreo-athetosis due to hyperkinesis . True Babinski can be clinically distinguished from the false Babinski by the contraction of hamstring muscles in the former , and failure to inhibit the extensor response by pressure over the base of the great toe . d) Exaggerated Babinski sign : It can either be in the form of ' flexor spasm ' or ' extensor spasm ' , depending upon the muscles i.e. whether flexors or extensors , have excess of tone . Flexor spasms occur in spinal cord disease , bilateral upper motor neuron lesion at a supraspinal level , multiple sclerosis and subacute combined degeneration of the cord , while ' extensor spasm ' occurs in patients with corticospinal tract lesion when the posterior column function is normal . e) Inversion of plantar reflex : If the short flexors of the toe are paralysed or flexor tendons are severed accidentally , an extensor response may be obtained . f) Tonic Babinski reflex : Characterised by slow prolonged contraction of extensors of toe , seen in frontal lobe lesions and extrapyramidal involvement . g) Crossed extensor response / bilateral Babinski sign : Unilateral stimulation produces bilateral Babinski in patients with bilateral cerebral disease and spinal cord disease . h) Spontaneous Babinski : In infants and children following manipulation of the foot , and in patients with extensive pyramidal tract diseases , passive extension of the knee or passive flexion of the hip and the knee , may produce a positive Babinski sign . The art of elicitation The reflexogenic area for the plantar reflex is the first sacral ( S1 ) dermatome with the receptor nerve endings being located in the skin . The afferent nerve is the tibial nerve , the spinal cord segments involved in the reflex arc being 4th and 5th lumbar and 1st and 2nd sacral . Position All the leg muscles should be visible and in a relaxed state . This can be achieved by positioning the patient in a way that the knee is slightly flexed and the thigh is externally rotated . The patient should be warned that the sole is going to be scratched and ask him to try to let his limb remain as floppy as possible . The toes should not be touched at all . Stimulation It is the site of stimulation , the intensity of stimulation , and even the object used for stimulation that has received by far the most attention . Any part of the leg can be stimulated , but the best technique is to stimulate the lateral plantar surface and the transverse arch in a single movement upto the middle metatarsophalangeal joint with a firm applicator lasting 5 to 6 seconds . [ 9 ] Difficulties are bound to arise in certain clinical situations which makes elicitation and interpretation of plantar response inconclusive . It is imperative that one realises these problems and be aware of their solutions in order to arrive at an appropriate clinical conclusion [ Table II ] . Alternate methods The late 19th and early 20th century was abound with disclaimers associated with founders of new reflex movements of the great toe . These movements are known by the term ' Babinski like responses ' . These responses can be elicited by the following techniques , each with its own eponym . By stroking the lateral malleolus ( Chaddock 's sign ) ; squeezing the calf muscle ( Gordon 's sign ) ; applying pressure along the shin of tibia ( Oppenheim sign ) ; pressing the 4th toe downwards and then releasing it with a snap ( Gonda 's sign ) ; vigorous adduction of the little toe followed by its sudden release ( Stransky sign ) ; squeezing the Achilles tendon ( Schaefer 's sign ) , flexion of the toes , on quick percussion of the tips of the patients toes with the finger tip ( Rossolimo 's sign ) ; flexion of the four outer toes induced by tapping the dorsum of the foot in the region of cuboid bone ( Mendal Bechtrew sign ) ; giving multiple pinpricks on dorsolateral surface of the foot ( Bing 's sign ) ; forceful passive plantar flexion of the ankle ( Moniz sign ) ; pressing over the dorsal aspect of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the great toe ( Throckmortan sign ) ; application of forceful pressure over anterior tibial region ( Strumpell sign ) ; scratching the dorsum of the foot along the inner side of the extensor tendon of the great toe ( Cornell sign ) ; plantar flexion and fanning of the toes on tapping the mid plantar region of the foot or base of the heel . Interpretation Incorporation of videotape and electromyography should be welcomed in the interpretation of plantar response . [ 10 ] The following criteria that have emerged from the comparison of clinical data with electromyographic results may be applied for interpreting a pathological Babinski sign . [ 11 ] a) Upward movement of the great toe is pathological only if caused by contraction of the EHL muscle . b) Contraction of the EHL muscle is pathological only if it is occurring synchronously with reflex activity in other flexor muscles . c) A Babinski sign does not necessarily imply that the concurrent activity of the other flexor muscles should be very brisk and vice versa . d) The true Babinski sign is reproducible , unlike voluntary withdrawal of the toes . Fallacies An extensor response may be present when there is no damage to the pyramidal tract . A possible explanation being the excitation of the distal motor neurons and inhibition of the impulses via flexor reflex afferent nerve fibres can be dissociated because they are mediated by different neurons , however closely linked . On the contrary , cases with proven damage to the pyramidal system have had normal plantar response . We should understand that corticospinal fibres not only originate in different parts of the cortex , but also have different terminations . Babinski sign can be expected only when ' leg fibres ' of the pyramidal tract are involved . Plantar areflexia can be noted in cases with loss of sensation of sole due to lesion of the first sacral cutaneous distribution . The same can be observed in paralysis of extensors or long flexors of great toe . In spinal shock , cessation of tonic discharge of spinal neurons by excitatory impulses in descending pathways may explain its non existence . Drugs like parenteral physostigmine in physiological doses may also abolish a plantar response . Despite the continuing controversy and observer bias , clinical utility of Babinski sign remains unchallenged . The role of pyramidal system in the pathophysiology of this sign is quite clear . Pyramidal tract dysfunction releases the flexion reflex synergy , of which contraction of the extensor hallucis longus muscle forms an integral part . The most important and vital question in interpreting the plantar response is not , whether the great toe goes up or not , but is whether an upgoing toe is pathological or not . For an appropriate answer the method of observation is much more important than the method of elicitation . Moreover , videotaping and electromyography could improve the clinical interpretation and help in settling the argument especially if it is an unexpected finding .","annotations":[{"text":"the calf muscle","span":[9927,9941],"token_span":[1760,1762],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The Entity being manipulated often occurs as the direct object of verbs:"}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"The words in this frame describe the manipulation of an Entity by an Agent.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":["Aiming","Ingestion"]},{"instance_id":"EN-2614-369-frame-Manufacturing","frame":"Manufacturing","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"Background Regarding the decision to release a remix version of the band 's debut album , Horn of Plenty ( 2004 ) , drummer Christopher Bear stated , \" The remixes for Horn of Plenty started because Kanine was going to re-release the album with better distribution but need some sort of \" bonus \" to make it happen .","annotations":[{"text":"Horn of Plenty ( 2004 )","span":[90,112],"token_span":[16,21],"role":"Product","label":"Product","role_definition":"The Product is produced by the Producer."},{"text":"Kanine","span":[199,204],"token_span":[37,37],"role":"Producer","label":"Producer","role_definition":"The person or company that produces the Product."}],"trigger":{"text":"re-release","start_char":219,"end_char":228,"start_token":41,"end_token":41,"frame":"Manufacturing"}},"source":{"text":"Chin up , cheer up : interview with Chris Bear of Grizzly Bear It sweeps over you like a summer wave , ebbing and cresting .

How do you explain the sadness , hope , power , vulnerability , delicacy rooted in it like gold ore ? Eventually , if you 're wise , you just give up . You give in the music , which says it all and much more eloquently . Or better yet , you can get drummer and sometimes - vocalist Chris Bear to do the talking . So slip on your headphones , fall in love and check out my interview with Bear : NL : Clearly , Yellow House is very different from Horn of Plenty . What are the big changes in play ? CB : The biggest change is that we actually became a band . Chris T. , Daniel , and I basically came into Grizzly Bear after Horn of Plenty was already finished . I helped Ed tie up some loose ends with Horn of Plenty , but that record was pretty much all him . Getting together the band for the live show changed things quite a bit , in terms of dynamics and instrumentation used . The songs were quite simple and open ended so it left a lot of room for interpretation , which was great because it allowed us to get a band sound happening and working a very reactionary level . Then Yellow House changed even more because we were working with new songs and reacting in different ways . A lot of the songs are composed by Daniel and the way that he writes brings out another side of how the band interacts . In general , having four people with different ideas and strengths has changed our sound the most . NL : You seem to enjoy self - producing in houses versus the studio route . You even go so far as to celebrate that fact with your new album title . What 's the advantage of recording in a house and doing production yourselves ? CB : I think the biggest advantage is just flexibility ... being able to work at any time of the day and not be dependent on studio hours . A lot of the stuff we 'd end up recording was really late at night after voices had really warmed up or after properly loosening up at our religious cocktail hour . Also , self - producing makes it a little more comfortable to try things out and toy with different sounds for a long time . After the initial basic tracking month , a lot of things were added individually by everyone and a lot of those sounds were very time intensive . I could n't imagine doing some of those things with everyone around or feeling like you 're on the clock at a studio . NL : Why the remix CD for Horn of Plenty ? Can we expect something similar for Yellow House ? Are you planning on doing any more remixes for other artists ? CB : The remixes for HOP started because Kanine was going to rerelease the album with better distribution but need some sort of \" bonus \" to make it happen . It was kind of Ed 's pet project . He basically just emailed a lot of people and luckily most of them were down to do it . Everyone was very gracious for participating . I do n't think the same will happen for Yellow House ... at least to level that it did for HOP , not every song , but there are some in the works . Chris T. and I did a remix for Of Montreal , and that was really fun . I 'd be interested in doing some more . It is a fun way to think about music . NL : Did any of the Horn of Plenty remixes affect your sound either live or recorded ? CB : Hmm .... I do n't think we 've necessarily changed our songs as a result of any of the remixes . But Final Fantasy did some strings on Yellow House as a result of the relationship we developed through the remix project . NL : A lot of major blogs have really gotten behind the new album and you yourselves have a pretty great blog promoting music you like . How much effect do you think music blogs have on getting the word out ? CB : Blogs and the Internet in general are incredibly effective in terms of getting your music out there . It 's kind of scary how quickly some bands come out of nowhere and blow up , primarily from gathering buzz on the Internet . But I 'm very happy with the response and that people are excited about the music we make . NL : Yellow House has lately supplanted Kid A as my go -to album for night driving . What activities do you suggest pairing your music to ? CB : Oh wow ... Replacing Kid A is pretty epic -- that is a pretty great night drive album . I guess Yellow House works as a nighttime album . For some reason , I sort of associate it with chips , salsa and cocktails , late afternoon ... but that has very little to do with the music . That was just ritual during the first month we started the record . NL : Speaking of activities , I read about a laser light show you did in Seattle ? What was that like ? CB : Man ... that was totally amazing . Probably one of the coolest places we 've ever played . I just wish we could have watched the whole show ... but it was hard to look up at the ceiling the whole time . Everyone said the laser technician did a great job working with the music . NL : Horn of Plenty seemed very much like a breakup album , a heartbreak album . Does Yellow House have any similar overarching motivations ? CB : I do n't think so ... Personally , I feel like we were all just learning to play and interact with each other . NL : If Chris T. could cut anyone 's hair , who would he pick ? CB : He said Andy Warhol .... he 's always had pretty awesome hair . NL : What is your favorite trend or development in music as of late ? CB : Screwed and chopped shit . NL : I 've never seen you in concert before , but I 'll be there on Sept. 29th at The Independent . What can I expect from the Grizzly Bear live experience ? CB : Well , it is very different from the first album . Any songs we play from Horn of Plenty will sound totally different ... much more dynamic and fleshed out . A lot of the things from Yellow House are have changed in the live show too ... we just worked out a live version of \" Little Brother \" that is more stone groove / classic rock song . NL : Is there a tangible difference between American audiences and international ones ? Where would you most like to play that you have n't played yet ? CB : I think international audiences are more curious perhaps . People are more likely to come up , introduce themselves , and ask questions or just talk about what they thought of the music . Also , more people want autographs internationally which is funny to me . I 'd really love to play in Brazil and Australia some day . NL : Rave about three artists or albums from 2006 everyone should check out . CB : Dirty Projectors - I know he has been around for a while , but I discovered his music in 2006 . I liked what I had heard before , but then we played with him in Canada and I was sold . His live show was incredible . I love how ambitious his music is , yet at the same time it is totally palatable and poppy . His choice of instruments , arrangements , voice , melodies .... all totally incredible and inspirational . [ Ed. note -- Dirty Projectors are opening for Grizzly Bear at the Bowery Ballroom on September 26th . A good chance to catch them both . ] Wyrd Visions - I had never heard them until the first show of a Canadian tour we did with them and Final Fantasy . Colin [ Bergh ] has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard ... pure , delicate and unaffected . It 's kind of like Chet Baker if he made dark , nordic folky music . Danava - I think their music is finally going to be properly released by Kemado soon . These dudes from Portland are so serious . I 'm not really that much of a metalhead , but they are amazing . Kind of Black Sabbath / T. Rex but more acid metal like Hawkwind or something . I got to see them live and it was so great . One of the loudest shows i've ever seen , but I could n't bring myself to put earplugs in .

In a motion filed with the Supreme Court , the Center for International Law ( Centerlaw ) urged the Supreme Court to order the Office of the Solicitor General ( OSG ) , through Solicitor General Jose Calida , to provide them copies of documents related to the government 's crackdown on illegal drugs . CenterLaw filed a petition in 2017 with the high court seeking the issuance of a writ of amparo to protect the residents of 26 barangays in San Andres Bukid , Manila City against the government 's war on drugs . The Free Legal Assistance Group ( FLAG ) also filed a petition with the high court then asking the magistrates to declare as unconstitutional the Philippine National Police ' \u201c Oplan Double Barrel , \u201d which it said allows the police to \u201c neutralize \u201d suspected drug pushers instead of arresting and prosecuting them . A three - day oral argument was conducted and eventually , Calida was ordered to submit within 60 days the following : - Names , addresses , gender of those killed - Place , date and time of drug operations - Names of PNP team leader and team members who participated in the operation the pre-operation plan - Post operation report - Whether search warrants or warrants of arrests were issued - Names of representatives of media , NGOs and barangay officials present during the police operations For those listed under \u201c death under investigation , \u201d the high court asked the submission of the following : - Names , addresses , gender , ages of those killed - Date , time and place of the killing - Scene Of the Crime Operatives ( SOCO ) team leader and members who investigated the killing - Investigation reports - Charges have been filed against the suspects if there are any The high court also asked government lawyers to submit the records of all buy - bust operations conducted in San Andres Bukid , the subject of one of the two petitions , as well as the pre-operations and post-operations plans . Parties to the case according to the high court should be provided a copy as the details required do not compromise national security contrary to Calida 's arguments . The information and the documents also do not involve rebellion , invasion , terrorism , espionage , infringement of our sovereignty or sovereign rights by foreign powers , or any military , diplomatic or state secret . READ : SC orders go v't : Submit reports on drug war killings Calida filed an appeal but was rejected by the Supreme Court in April last year . The following month , the OSG submitted some of the required details and documents and sought two more months to fully comply . But in a September 2018 motion , Calida again demurred on the release of thousands of documents , saying that they contain \u201c very sensitive information with law enforcement and national security implications . \u201d He also said that the petitioners \u2014 CenterLaw and FLAG \u2014 are only entitled to documents related to the killings stated in their petitions , but not to other documents related to the other killings . Centerlaw , in its recent pleading , said the continued refusal of the OSG is in violation of the Rules of Court that requires pleadings and papers to be served on the parties affected . They added that denying them a copy of the documents is a violation of their right to due process as well as President Rodrigo Duterte 's Executive Order No. 2 , s. 2016 , that provides a legal presumption in favor of access to information , public records , and official record . They said a denial of their request will be a first in the history of the Court \u201c where evidence duly submitted to it and forming part of its determination of the pending case will be intentionally withheld from the opposing parties . \u201d / ee READ : SolGen wo n't give drug war records to SC Subscribe to our daily newsletter Subscribe to INQUIRER PLUS to get access to The Philippine Daily Inquirer & other 70 + titles , share up to 5 gadgets , listen to the news , download as early as 4 am & share articles on social media .

Syedna Dawood Bin Ajabshah ( R.A. ) 975-999 A.H. : Syedna was molested by Muzaffarshah in Ahmedabad . He looted mumenins and tyranissed them in every way . Due to his tyranny Syedna went to kapadwanj . Muzzafarshah was then defeated by Akbar . So he fled from Ahmedabad to Kapadwanj . There he was welcomed by syedna 's representatives Sh. Kazikhan and Khoj bin malak . Syedna did not think of avenging the cruelties of Muzzafarshah in latter 's plight . Later syedna invited Muzaffershah and his troops to his home and latter repented for his misdeeds . After appointing Mirjahan as his deputy Akbar returned to lahore . But mirjahan also molested mumenins for not consuming drugs ( Ganja and Bhang ) . He was also a tyrant and was instigated by Mohammed bin Taher Nehrwala . In Baroda also Akbar 's deputy Moh. khan troubled mumenins much . Salahuddin of baroda killed Syedi Moosanji Tajsaheb on backbitings of foes . They were trying to arrest Syedna . Thereafter Syedna came to Cambay ( Khambhat ) . There Syedna was presented Shawls by the deputy of Akbar , khan Azam . He instructed his representatives to respect Syedna . Syedna 's spirituality attracted every one including Kings and rich people of the city of Cambay . Syedna Dawood Bin Qutubshah ( RA ) 999-1021A. H. : Syedna Dawood bin Qutubshah ( RA ) also passed the difficult period with the rulers . In his time Shahmurad the prince of Akbar came to Ahmedabad as Governor . Representatives of Suleman went to him and bribed him . They claimed Rs. 16 lakhs of rupees from Syedna . This caused the arrest of learned and virtous persons Miya Shaikh Adam and Miya Ali Mohammed for forty days . At that time Sadiq Mohammed the vazir of the emperor helped Syedna in many ways . When Shah Murad came to know about about the reality , he ordered to give up charges of arrest . After some days Shah murad released the pious persons with all their due repsects . Suleman refused to accept Syedna as a Dai . However a big file of letters was revealed in which suleman had accepted Syedna as Dai . On the basis of this file the documents were prepared to support Syedna . These documents were signed by Vazir Sadiq Muhammed , Qazi jan Muhammed Sakaki , Amir Kabir , Shah Abu Turab and others . When turk of vazir came to know about the artocities of Suleman , he arrested suleman in the fort of zamamar and asked him to pay a bail of Rs.80,000 . Suleman did not pay and escaped to India . Syed Qasim again arrested Maula Ali Mohammed and Maula Shaikh Adam . When Begum of Shah Murad in Bharuch knew the matter she immediately ordered the release of Maula shaikh Ali Mohammed and Maula Shaikh Adam . She ordered the arrest of Suleman and Ibrahim . Suleman and Ibrahim reached lahore after their release and backbited Ahdi Kamal Khan , one of the darbaris of Akbar . This caused the arrest of six pious persons including Maula Ali Mohammed and Maula Shaikh Adam . After arresting them Kamal Khan came to Ahmedabad to arrest Syedna . He troubled the mumenins of Ahmedabad a lot . He looted the Mohallas of mumenins . In lahore six pious persons were under the tyranny of Osman , brother - in - law of Kamal Khan . When vazir fathulla khachki knew about the arrest , he immediately ordered to release them . After tyrannising in Ahmedabad kamal khan returned to Lahore with all looted property . Due to tyranny 27,000 mumenins of Ahmedabad scattered and resided in remote parts . When the emperor was informed of tyranny and loot , he ordered Aamir kabir raja ramdas to arrest him before entering lahore . He was then arrested and presented in Darbar . Saiyedi Shaikh Adam was also presented with him in the Darbar . After hearing the sufferings mumenins had from Kamalkhan the emperor ordered rigorous imprisonment for kamalkhan . In 1005 A.H. Syedna Dawood Bin Qutubshah , having been summoned by emperor Akbar to appear at the court , he besought maula shaikh Adam , Maula Ali Mohammed , Maula Mamuji and Maulana Khanji . through Hakim Ali. Maula Shaikh Adam replied that \" Though Syedna was in seclusion since four years but they should try their best to convey him the bounties of emperor \" . The emperor granted khilat to four pious persons and a shawl to Syedna . When Syedna reached Lahore , the emperor was in Kashmir . In emperor 's absence Hakim Ali received Syedna in Lahore and escorted him to the court of Kashmir in a state silver palanquin . The emperor received him with great respect . Syedna was given a high seat in the darbar . According to his habit Syedna recited Quran - Sharif daily in the darbar of emperor . The emperor was so influenced by the spirituality of Syedna that he would gaze at him for hours . Syedna stayed in kashmir as a respected guest of emperor . All nobles especially Abul Fazal , Hakim Ali and Khan Azam gave due respect to syedna . Syedna came to Lahore from Kashmir and thereafter he returned to Ahmedabad under the protection of the emperor with Royal Farman , ordering the officials at Ahmedabad to show him every attention and to receive him wherever he went with respect on account of his great learning , virtue and piety . The emperor granted the following farman in syedna 's honour . This farman is written by vazir Abdul Fazal in golden letters . Emperor Akbar 's farman : Allaho-akbar . This glorious farman is issued graciously to satisfy the wishes of sardar of Dawoodi Bohras after considering and calling him to our darbar so that the deputies of Gujarat especially authorities of Ahmedabad and Sidhpur and areas in connection to them , not obstruct them in their ways and let them come to us according to their will . And ( the auhorities ) should not object them and his followers especially in their religious traditions , systems and taxes and about prohibited things and they should return their properties which are sealed , afer removing the seals giving them back . Not to restrict them from any business or occupation they are willing . They should give facilities to them and authorities should not be covetous for any thing . They should return all the properties which are seized because in near future their case is to be taken under consideration . Karories , Jagirdars and all responsible Mutasaddirs of Gujarat are required to extend all facilities to the mentioned pious persons while passing through their territories . If he wants any guide then provide him with it for safety against robbery and all dangers of the way so that they may reach to their safe place . To respect them must be considered a duty . 1st Rabiul - Awwal 1005 A.D. Capitol Lahore . Along with this farman Syedna was presented with valuable khilas and a horse . The farman was renewed by Jahangir in 1099 A.H. After these events contacts with Hakim of Ahmedabad harmonised . But soon Shadman came to Ahmedabad as new Hakim . He was not good with Syedna . Thereafter Syedna left Ahmedabad . When Jahangir knew about it , he removed him and Shaikh farid came to Ahmedabad . Syedna already had good relations with Shaikh farid . Shaikh farid earnestly requested syedna to return to Ahmedabad . Thereafter Syedna returned to Ahmedabad and was respected by high authorities throughout rest of his life . Syedna Abdul Taiyab Zakiuddin ( R.A ) 1030 - 1041 A.H. : During the reign of Syedna Abdul Taiyed Zakiuddin , son of Syedna Dawood bin Qutubshah , Ali bin Ibrahim turned astray . He went to Jahangir 's darbar and complained that he was excommunicated by syedna and was very much molested by his enemies creating great disturbance in Ahmedabad and preferring several vexation complaints against him at the court of Jahangir . The ministers of the darbar opined that reconcillations should be brought between Syedna and his enemies ( Ali bin Ibrahim ) . Syedna was invited by the emperor to his court , where he stayed for some period and was treated with great honour andrespect . Ali bin Ibrahim begged pardon of syedna through emperor 's recommendation . Syedna pardoned Ali bin Ibrahim for his deeds . Syedna Qasim Khan Bin Feerkhan 1042-1054 A.H. : Syedna was grandson of Syedi Hasan peer shahid who had solved the difficulty of sultan peeram shah about an Aayat of Quran . During this period there were no disastorous events but the period was not completely quiet . The jealous groups were unsatisfied by the civilised approach of Akbar and Jahangir but they were compelled to obey the directions of these emperors . The explosion of these jealousy took place in the reign of Syedna Qutub khan Qutbuddin , son of Syedna Dawood bin Qutubshah to whom Akbar and Jahangir had granted glorious farmans . Syedna Qutbuddin Shahid 1054-1056 A.H. : During the reign of Syedna Qutbuddin Shahid Aurangzeb came to Ahmedabad . Abdul Gavi a staunch Sunni backbited Aurangzeb and caused the arrest of Syedna . Gavi argued that Syedna was Rafzi ( one who do not obey Rasulullah 's Sunnah ) and therefore his blood is legal . Though shahbeg the kutuwal was not tyrant but was bound to follow the orders of Gavi . He carried away six big carriages of books to see whether there was anything to prove Rafzi . He imprisoned Syedna Qutbuddin Shahid , his sucessor Syedna Fir Khan Shujauddin and two other mumenins . Syedna suffered a rigourous prison for about a month . He was then invited to Aurangzeb 's darbar for clarification . Syedna declared that they are the true followers of Rasullullah and his sunnah . All present darbaris were greatly impressed by Syedna 's speech . Abdul Gavi a staunch sunni was not ready to release a pious shia . He prepared a false mehdara blaming syedna as Rafzi . Qazi refused to attest the mehdara without witness . Abdul Gavi persuaded two innocent children from Syedna 's family and presented before Qazi as witness . Qazi signed the mehdara unwillingly . The document for Syedna 's execution was prepared . On the 27th of Jamadil - Ukhra in 1056 A.H. Syedna was slained by the tyrants . His corpse were not given to mumenin to bury . But by a miracle they were able to carry it under the sentry . After this martyrdom there was a open slaughter of mumenins on streets of Ahmedabad . Tyrant Auangzeb ordered to expell the momenins , the followers of Syedna from city . This was the second plight after the plight of tyranny of kamalkhan . A glorious mausoleum is erected over his tomb by Syedna Taher Saifuddin Saheb in Ahmedabad . Syedna Feer Khan Shujauddin 1056 - 1065 A.H. : He was kept in captivity by the bigoted prince Aurangzeb and was taken by him to Aurangabad after being removed by emperor shahjahan from Gujarat to the Deccan on account of his cruel oppression . Thereafter in Lahore Syedna was placed in stable , which on the following night happened to catch fire and was totally destroyed except the dungeon , where in Syedna passed the night and prayed to Almighty and was found quite safe in the morning . All people held that the conflagration was the consequence of the curse the prince had brought upon himself by keeping his holiness in captivity . By an imperial order Aurangzeb was compelled to set Syedna at liberty and grant him a safe and honourable return to Ahmedabad . He reached Ahmedabad after two years of Shahdat in themonth of Ramazan . Gheratkhan was then Hakim of Ahmedabad . Again Gherat Khan was backbited . He arrested Syedna and demanded Rs. 3 lakhs . Syedna was again imprisoned and was released after the 6 months . In 1066 A.H. Shahmurad came to Ahmedabad and arrested Syedna . Thus after Shahdat of Maulana Qutbuddin Shahid R.A. , Syedna Shujauddin suffered much for the sake of the divine mission of the khidmat of Imamuz -zaman . On one side Syedna was suffering and on the other Hakims were compelling mumenins to Shave their beards , to intoxicate and to use bangles and ornaments made of ivory . One may remind the circumstances during and after shahdat of Imam Hussain ( S.A. ) in Karbala after Rasulullah ( S.A. ) Syedna Abdul Taiyeb Zakiuddin ( R.A. ) 1085 - 1110 A.H. : On request of Mumenins Syedna arrived in Ahmedabad . He was again persecuted by the deputies of Aurangzeb acting in collusion with his enemies . Kar Talib khan , who was then Hakim tried to arrest Syedna coveting wealth . But Syedna secretly went away to Jamnagar . In Jamnagar Jam Tamanjee gave refugee to Syedna accepting the imprisonment of his two sons laka and bhaba . During the same period Maulana Najam Khan , Maulana Abdul Vahid , Maulana Hassan Khan , Maulana Tayeb Khan and many other pious persons were led in captivity to the court of Aurangzeb at Aurangabad . They were released after undergoing severe hardships .","annotations":[{"text":"Syedna","span":[4944,4949],"token_span":[905,905],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The Theme is the entity that changes location.

Astronomers have known for years that Mars possessed polar ice caps , but early attempts at chemical analysis suggested only that the northern cap could be composed of water ice , and the southern cap was thought to be carbon dioxide ice . Recent space missions then suggested that the southern ice cap , existing all year round , could be a mixture of water and carbon dioxide . But only with Mars Express have scientists been able to confirm directly for the first time that water ice is present at the south pole too . Mars Express made observations with its OMEGA instrument to measure the amounts of sunlight and heat reflected from the Martian polar region . When planetary scientists analysed the data , it clearly showed that , as well as carbon dioxide ice , water ice was present too . The results showed that hundreds of square kilometres of ' permafrost ' surround the south pole . Permafrost is water ice , mixed into the soil of Mars , and frozen to the hardness of solid rock by the low Martian temperatures . This is the reason why water ice has been hidden from detection until now - because the soil with which it is mixed cannot reflect light easily and so it appears dark . However , OMEGA looked at the surface with infrared eyes and , being sensitive to heat , clearly picked up the signature of water ice . The discovery hints that perhaps there are much larger quantities of water ice all over Mars than previously thought . Using this data , planetary scientists now know that the south polar region of Mars can be split into three separate parts . Part one is the bright polar cap itself , a mixture of 85 % highly reflective carbon dioxide ice and 15 % water ice . The second part comprises steep slopes known as ' scarps ' , made almost entirely of water ice , that fall away from the polar cap to the surrounding plains . The third part was unexpected and encompasses the vast permafrost fields that stretch for tens of kilometres away from the scarps . The OMEGA observations were made between 18 January and 11 February this year , when it was late summer for the Martian southern hemisphere and temperatures would be at their highest . Even so , that is probably only \u2013 130 degrees Celsius and the ice that Mars Express has observed is a permanent feature of this location . During the winter months , scientists expect that carbon dioxide from the atmosphere will freeze onto the poles , making them much larger and covering some of the water ice from view . Mars Express and OMEGA will now continue looking for water ice and minerals across the surface of the planet . In May , another Mars Express instrument , the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding ( MARSIS ) , will begin collecting data , looking for water underground . It will be particularly exciting when MARSIS looks at the south pole because , once planetary scientists know how deep the ice reaches , they will be able to calculate exactly how much water there is . Knowing this is very important to understand how Mars evolved and if it ever harboured life .","annotations":[{"text":"the south polar region of Mars","span":[1680,1709],"token_span":[311,316],"role":"Area","label":"Area","role_definition":"This role identifies the general Area in which motion takes place when the motion is understood to be irregular or not to consist of a single, linear path."},{"text":"the south polar region of Mars","span":[1680,1709],"token_span":[311,316],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where motion specified by Source, Path or Goal occurs."},{"text":"steep slopes known as ' scarps '","span":[1896,1927],"token_span":[354,360],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The Theme is the entity that changes location."},{"text":"from the polar cap","span":[1982,1999],"token_span":[372,375],"role":"Path","label":"Path","role_definition":"Path refers to (a part of) the ground over which the Theme travels or to a landmark past which the Theme travels."},{"text":"from the polar cap","span":[1982,1999],"token_span":[372,375],"role":"Source","label":"Source","role_definition":"The Source is the location the Theme occupies before the Motion occurs."},{"text":"to the surrounding plains","span":[2001,2025],"token_span":[376,379],"role":"Goal","label":"Goal","role_definition":"The Goal is the location the Theme ends up in (often unintentionally)."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"In this frame a Theme moves in a certain Direction which is often determined by gravity or other natural, physical forces.","frame_ancestors":["Motion","Event"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-1496-561-frame-Objective_influence","frame":"Objective_influence","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"On 16 November 2009 IBS-STL UK announced that due to \" a succession of financial problems , in particular the failed implementation of a new SAP computer system in October 2008 , the effects of which were exacerbated by the economic downturn \" a decision had been taken to \" exit the business \" at which point a buyer was sought .

Treatment of the youths known as the Scottsboro Boys - nine in all - helped spark the US Civil Rights movement . The boys were convicted by all - white juries . Eight were sentenced to death but none was ever executed . Five of the boys ' convictions were overturned , and a sixth was pardoned in 1976 . The decision by an Alabama parole board is the last chapter in a case that came to symbolise racial injustice in America 's deep south , says the BBC 's Jane O'Brien . \" While we could not take back what happened to the Scottsboro Boys 80 years ago , we found a way to make it right moving forward , \" said Alabama Governor Robert Bentley . \" The Scottsboro Boys have finally received justice . \" In March 1931 , during the Great Depression , the boys were travelling by train through northern Alabama among a group of hobos , both black and white . A fight broke out and the train was stopped near the town of Scottsboro . Nine black teenagers ranging in age from 13 - 19 were arrested . \" The deputy sheriff realised two of the white hobos were in fact women , \" historian Dan Carter told the BBC in October . \" The young women worried they might be accused of prostitution , so they accused the black boys of having raped them . \" I think anyone today who studied the evidence would conclude no rapes occurred . \" ' Great day for freedom ' Charles Weems , Andy Wright and Haywood Patterson were pardoned on Thursday by the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles ( ABPP ) . Convictions against Olen Montgomery , Ozie Powell , Willie Roberson , Eugene Williams and Roy Wright were overturned and charges dropped in 1937 . Clarence Norris received a pardon from Alabama Governor George Wallace in 1976 . Norris , the last surviving Scottsboro Boy , died in 1989 . Civil rights groups ' efforts to fight their convictions and to win new trials sparked civil rights protests and led to two landmark US Supreme Court rulings . The US high court overturned convictions for some of them in 1932 on the grounds that the teenagers were denied competent legal counsel , and again in 1935 because African Americans were not allowed to serve as jurors during the trials . The Alabama state legislature passed a law earlier this year allowing the parole board to grant the Scottsboro Boys posthumous pardons . \" Today , we were able to undo a black eye that has been held over Alabama for many years , \" ABPP assistant executive director Eddie Cook said following the board 's unanimous decision .

But piracy , particularly in the Caribbean , was at one time a very real and dangerous problem . Men with names such as Blackbeard , Calico Jack , and Black Bart pillaged and plundered ships and seaport towns , offering violent retribution to those who resisted and seizing fortunes at will . Viewers get to know the real characters , fight the battles they fought , watch nations rise up to stop them , and separate fact from fiction in the world premiere TRUE CARIBBEAN PIRATES on Sunday , July 9th , 2006 at 8 pm /7 c on The History Channel . After Christopher Columbus landed in the West Indies in 1492 , Spain and its powerful navy established a dominating presence in the region . Vast riches in gold and silver were mined in the New Worldwealth that soon drew the attention of England , France , and Holland . The Caribbean would become a free - for- all as these competing nations advocated \" privateering , \" basically the use of freelancing private sailors to fight battles , disrupt trade , and harass the Spanishall in an effort to establish a presence in the Caribbean without having to pay for a real navy there . The temptation of Spanish treasure stretched the thin line between privateer and pirate to a breaking point . One of the most famous privateers to cross into piracy is Sir Henry Morgan . Tapped by the British Governor of Jamaica to command more than 1,500 buccaneers , he responded by becoming one of the first true great pirates , leading daring attacks and conquests of Spanish colonies at Portobello and Panama and gaining a reputation for brutal acts such as hanging men by their genitals to get them to give up their possessions . The cycle of privateers and quasi-legal pirates continued for decades , until an extraordinary event changed everything in the Caribbean . Peace . Suddenly , tens of thousands of privateers and sailors were out of a job , and thus began the age of the outlaw pirates . TRUE CARIBBEAN PIRATES follows the lineage of maritime crime from Morgan to Calico Jack , and even on to female pirates such as Anne Bonny and Mary Read , who were far more sensational , and every bit as dangerous , as their male counterparts . Using the historians input , dramatization , animation , expert interviews , and archival imagery , and filmed in historic locations , TRUE CARIBBEAN PIRATES is the true story of piracy 's Golden Age . | | Highlights of TRUE CARIBBEAN PIRATES include : - Tale after tale of pirate lore that brings to life their unique realitya brazen flouting of almost every societal rule , disrespect for governmental authority , and unmatched thirst for adventure and brutality , all motivated by a true desire to be free and live their way , and only their way . - Understanding the pirates true motives and methodology for plying their trade , and dispelling time - honored myths such as those of treasure maps and buried booty . - The pirates unique ability to intimidate their targets into surrender , practiced uniquely by Blackbeard , who would tuck burning lengths of rope ( called \" slow match \" ) beneath his hat to create a cloud of smoke that observers swear made him look like Satan himself . - Blackbeards blockade and hostage crisis at Charlestowne , South Carolina , which sent ripples of pirate fear through the colonies and helped to galvanize support to take the pirates down , once and for all . - The establishment of all - pirate playground at Nassau , Bahamas , the city which became the home to seafaring outlaws after theyd been cast out of other areas . - The emergence of the unique and legendary Black Bart Roberts , the last of the great pirates and an anomaly in his own world refusing to drink alcohol and conducting religious services aboard his vessel , and then hanging an Island Governor from the yardarm of his own ship . - The brutal exploits of female pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read , and their promiscuous liaisons aboard the ship captained by Calico Jack Rackham . - Executive Producer for The History Channel is Carl H.

Even now when one looks at the walls and buildings of the modern village it is hard not to feel some resentment when realising that parts of them were once components of something far more magnificent and so much diminished as a result . Situated within the Southern Inner Circle of the the henge is Avebury Chapel ...... Built during the 17th Century it is interesting to note that the religious superstitions of the medieval period must have dissipated considerably as the builders felt no qualms about using demolished megaliths in its construction . Richard Colt Hoare 's vision of how the henge originally appeared ( after William Stukeley ) A concrete plinth marks the location of a destroyed stone Although efforts to safeguard the monument started to be made in the 1870s it did n't become totally protected until Alexander Keiller became the owner of the site in the 1930s . Stones were broken up by heating with a fire and pouring water over them . Stukeley made a drawing of one such event . And this stupendous fabric , which for some thousands of years , had brav'd the continual assaults of weather , and by the nature of it , when left to itself , like the pyramids of Egypt , would have lasted as long as the globe , hath fallen a sacrifice to the wretched ignorance and avarice of a little village unluckily plac'd within it . William Stukeley William Stukeley produced a detailed plan of the henge on which he gives details showing the destruction dates of individual stones . This is a fascinating document to any serious student of Avebury 's history . It is divided it into 6 overlapping images . Each image is about 300 k so some patience is required on a slow connection . north west north centre north east south west south centre south east WILLIAM STUKELEY'S 1724 PLAN OF THE HENGE Richard Colt Hoare 's assessment of the surviving stones in 1815 reveals that the destruction continued unabated after William Stukeley had completed his survey . It was n't only the stones of the henge , avenues and Sanctuary that fell victim to the desires of the local inhabitants . The demise of other megaliths in the area are mentioned by Stukeley in his book . An example of a substantial feature which has now vanished is mentioned in the extract shown below .... It seems likely that many others have disappeared which were n't brought to the attention of Stukeley and a true picture of what once existed in the Avebury area will never be recovered with any certainty . from Abury - a Temple of the British Druids ( Chapter 9.page 46 . ) from William Stukeley 's \" Abury - a Temple of the British Druids \" ( Chapter 3.page 15 . ) Stone no .4 of the Henge as it was found in its medieval burial pit The burning pit where stone no . 17 of the Henge was destroyed To-day we treasure our heritage , especially in the British Isles where we are blessed with such an abundance of historical sites which reveal the life - styles and achievements of our ancestors . Anything that threatens them in any way is usually resisted with great force as we now are much more enlightened and appreciative of our past . Sadly no such sentiments prevailed at Avebury until relatively recent years and over several centuries the megaliths were subjected to considerable abuse . The first decimation of the monuments is believed to have begun during the medieval period when stone burying commenced . This has long been interpreted as an attempt by religious zealots to eradicate the stones from the landscape though this is now often disputed as the burying seems to have continued through the following centuries when land clearance may have been a more likely motive . The burying of these stones , however , was to prove quite benign compared to the fate that many others were to suffer later . The real brutal assault on the fabric of Avebury appears to have begun in the late 17th Century when the local inhabitants found ways of breaking up the stones so they could be used as building material . Now it seems almost impossible to believe that anyone could have such scant regard for such an incredible symbol of man 's achievement especially when such an abundance of unused stones still lay scattered around the surrounding downland . William Stukeley , who had to witness much of this destruction , knew many of the culprits , the most infamous of all being Tom Robinson a housing speculator . It is Stukeley 's chronicles and illustrations that are so valuable to -day in giving us an accurate record of what he found at Avebury . One can only imagine the depths of despair he must have felt at seeing the objects of his study being destroyed .

Adjoining the henge the two stone avenues were decimated to the point that the one leading to Beckhampton has vanished almost completely . Stukeley 's records were seen as the only good evidence of its presence until recent excavations confirmed its existence .

Most of the offshore bank accounts in which the money ends up are located in Asia or Africa , where it can be harder for the US to gain the assistance of local authorities . The FBI has seen similarities between different CEO fraud schemes but it is not clear if there is one dominant global ring . \u201c We 're putting more resource to it . We 're trying to find those patterns , \u201d Mr Barnacle said . The FBI advises companies to be more guarded with their information even if it means taking additional steps that are not cost-effective , such as making a phone call to the executive to confirm the transfer . The crime has hit very large companies and small ones . Most recently , there have been new reports in the US of criminals targeting real estate firms to steal closing fees on housing sales . Some companies have been asked by imposters to email employee wage and tax statements . Last year police from Italy , Spain and other European countries arrested more than 60 members of an alleged criminal group , including several Nigerians , for their role in an email fraud scheme that affected hundreds of individuals and tens of companies . Still , few cases have been made , reflecting the challenges of combating international cyber crimes . Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2016 . You may share using our article tools .

Basically , he wanted it to be the best thing his band has ever done . At last month 's HFStival in Baltimore , Grohl pointed to Led Zeppelin 's epic Physical Graffiti as the main inspiration for Honor , pointing to the album 's \" wide dynamic \" of music and emotion ( see \" Foo Fighter Dave Grohl Says Physical Graffiti Was Model For New LP \" ) . And \" emotion \" is certainly in no short supply on Honor , especially on the first single , \" The Best of You . \" When MTV News caught up with Grohl during last weekend 's \" 24 Hours of Foo , \" which found his band taking over MTV2 programming for an entire day , he was plenty tired \u2014 so tired that he took a nap immediately following our interview . Still , he had more than enough energy to talk about the Foos ' anthemic first single . \" ' Best of You ' is a song of resistance . It 's about the refusal to be taken advantage of by something that 's bigger than you , or someone you 're in love with . It 's the fight in the face of adversity , \" Grohl said . \" I did n't really think of an interesting melody ; I just wanted to scream the whole way through . And the first few times we rehearsed it , I thought , ' There 's no way I 'll be able to play this live . There 's blood in my throat . ' But now it 's great , it 's a release . When you go out and sing words from the heart , you scream twice as hard . \" There 's definitely a whole lot of screaming on \" Best of You , \" and the band needed a video that would match all that emotional outpouring . They got exactly that from director Mark Pellington , who rose to prominence more than a dozen years ago with his moody video for Pearl Jam 's \" Jeremy \" ( see \" Foo Fighters Get Serious With Director Of Pearl Jam 's ' Jeremy ' \" ) . In fact , it was Pellington himself who contacted the Foo Fighters about working on the video , feeling an attachment to the song that stemmed from the loss of his wife in 2004 . \" His wife had just died like nine or 10 months ago , and he had a real emotional attachment to the song , \" drummer Taylor Hawkins explained . \" At first he said that he could n't even do it , because it hit him so hard . And with anything you do , you want all the people working for you to be passionate , whether it 's the guy coming up with the lighting rig , the sound guy or the guy coming up with your video . And he really showed the most passion , whereas all the other treatments we had read were sort of , like , ' OK , this treatment had probably gone to Limp Bizkit before us , and they passed on it , so it was just revised for us . ' \" Though \" Best of You \" anchors the album 's heavy disc , there 's a whole other disc full of somber , acoustic tracks ( see \" Foo Fighters Album Preview : Grohl Gets Grand On In Your Honor \" ) . But just because the songs are quieter , that does n't mean they do n't pack the same emotional wallop of their hard - rock counterparts . In fact , it 's pretty fair to say Honor is the darkest , moodiest album the band has ever made . Which , Grohl said , was definitely intentional . \" When you 're writing songs that have a sort of anthemic quality , you ca n't really go lighthearted and sing about bullsh --. You have to dig into a deeper place to find the words , \" Grohl said . \" On this record , the whole band \u2014 not just me \u2014 showed ourselves what we 're capable of doing . We 've created this whole new territory .

Scott said he spent more than two decades donning the green-furred , yellow - tailed Polkaroo costume at promotional appearances , but his relationship with TVO has soured after he received a cease - and - desist notice from the publicly funded TV station Tuesday . In a signed letter , a lawyer wrote that TVO failed to find an \u201c amicable resolution \u201d with Scott over what the broadcaster contends to be an \u201c unauthorized use \u201d of its mascot , which the station claims could pose \u201c a very real threat of tarnishing Polkaroo 's reputation . \u201d WATCH : Toronto celebrates the legalization of marijuana The letter demands confirmation from Scott that he will cease and desist his activity by Friday afternoon . \u201c Polkaroo is an established and trusted trademarked TVOkids mascot that is appreciated across generations , \u201d TVO said in a statement to The Canadian Press . \u201c While we can understand the nostalgia , TVO does not endorse this parody of Polkaroo , or the fact that it is being associated with an activity that is neither legal for children nor recommended for use by children .

While Polkaroo guided kids on psychedelic journeys of imagination , he said Tokaroo teaches adolescents about responsible drug use through irreverent humour .

The remains of the bath house of the fort , established in AD 130 , are among the tallest Roman structures surviving in northern Britain : the walls stand almost 4 metres ( 13 feet ) high . Domestic use of the building in the Middle Ages led to the substantial preservation of the site . The site lay in Muncaster Castle Park in the post-medieval period , and was described as ' the ancient dwelling place of the Penningtons ' by John Denton in 1610 . Excavations in the late nineteenth century and survey work in the 1980s indicated that the bath house was a substantial structure extending beyond the present field boundary , as well as to either side of the existing structures . At least two rooms contained under-floor hypocausts ( heating systems ) . The walls are of regularly coursed sandstone bonded with mortar and rendered internally with pink cement . One of the doorways has a worn threshold and a broad groove to receive a timber doorframe . There are also the remains of windows . The bath house was for use both by Roman soldiers and for civilians who lived in the settlement outside the fort , which extended over much of the present field . The building offered facilities for exercise and sport , as well as for swimming , bathing and socialising . It is now in the care of English Heritage . | | More information : ( SD 0882 9592 ) Walls Castle ( NAT ) ( Ruins of ) ( 1 ) | ( SD 0882 9592 ) Walls Castle ( NAT ) ROMAN BUILDING ( R ) ( remains of ) ( 2 ) The history of research into the bath house is summarised by Collingwood in 1928 who described it as the best preserved Roman building in thE north of England ( 3 ) and by Birley in 1958 ( 4 ) . The first known literary reference is about 1610 ( 5 ) when it is described as an old castle of the Pennington family . It was first considered to be Roman in 1876 ( 6 ) , and this was confirmed by excavation in 1881 when it was thought to be a villa ( 7 ) . These excavations demonstrated that the building had originally extended a considerable distance eastwards ; coins and pottery from the site date from the 2nd to the 4th century AD . The building seems to have been recognised as a bath house in about 1919 ( 8 ) . A deailed survey and fabric analysis was carried out in May 1983 on behalf of the Department of the Environment prior to its consolidation and placement under guardianship . ( 9 ) Under guardianship . ( 10 ) The bath house was surveyed at 1:1000 scale in 1998 by RCHME as a part of the survey of the Roman fort ; the plan and report are held in NMRC Swindon . It is unchanged since the analysis of 1883 except that tree cover has been removed from its immediate vicinity and the remains have been fenced . ( 11 ) An English Heritage Property . ( 12 ) Lies within the Registered Park and Garden of Muncaster Castle . On the east side of Walls Drive , c 1.5 km south - west of the Castle , is the site of the Roman fort of Glannaventa ( scheduled ancient monument ) , which includes a bath house which is said to be the best- preserved military bath house in the country ( Pevsner 1967 ) .

Other confederates of this association include Marcia Lucas ( Mrs George Lucas ) , Virginia Zanuck ( Mrs Daryl Zanuck ) and Irene Selznick ( Mrs David O'Selznick ) \u2013 women whose partners peaked artistically when wed to them . This phenomenon is n't limited to first wives , or even wives \u2013 there are plenty of unsung collaborators in filmmaking who never get the credit they deserve ( for instance , Sam Wasson 's recent book on the making of Chinatown only recently shone some much - needed light on Edward Taylor 's extensive contributions to Robert Towne 's career ) . But there is something particularly poignant about the notion of someone owing a great deal of their success to their spouse , then betraying that spouse , emotionally , sexually and professionally \u2026 and paying for it , at least on a creative level . Such was the case of J. Lee Thompson and Joan Henry . Most film buffs would know Thompson , the British writer - producer - director whose credits include The Guns of Navarone , the 1962 Cape Fear and some of Charles Bronson 's worst movies . Henry is less well - remembered today , although at one stage her fame ( or , rather notoriety ) outstripped Thompson's . She was born in 1914 in Belgravia , London . Henry had a classy lineage \u2013 she was descended from two British Prime Ministers ( John Russell and Robert Peel ) , and her mother 's cousin was the philosopher Bertrand Russell . It was n't an easy life , though \u2013 her father deserted the family when Joan was young , causing her mother to have a breakdown ; Joan and her twin sister were brought up by her grandparents in Ireland , and that sister died when Joan was 21 , causing much anguish to the surviving sibling . Joan was a debutante , making her \u201c debut \u201d in 1932 , and she married an army officer in 1938 . They had one daughter but World War Two put the marriage under such strain that they eventually broke up . Henry started writing romance novels to bring in some money and developed a gambling habit which resulted in her passing a forged cheque ; she claimed it was n't her fault but the police did n't believe her , nor did the jury assigned to her case : in 1951 , Joan Henry was sentenced to twelve months in prison . She wound up serving eight , most of it at the legendary Holloway Prison , with the rest at Askham Grange Open Prison , a newer , more reformist institution . Former debutantes - cum-romance - novelists - cum - prison - inmates were not common at the time \u2013 it was suggested Henry write a memoir about her experiences , which she did . The result , Who Lie in Gaol , became a bestseller and media sensation on its publication in 1952 , drawing attention to the treatment of female prisoners in Britain . The book was read by director J. Lee Thompson , who wanted to adapt it into a movie . Thompson was born the same year as Henry . He had been something of a child prodigy , claiming to have written forty plays by the time he was 18 , the year he married his first wife . One of those forty plays , Double Error , had a short run on the West End in 1935 , which helped Thompson break into the British film industry as a writer and dialogue director . He rewrote Double Error as Murder Without Crime which had success on the stage in London and Broadway in the 1940s . After war service , Thompson returned to writing but when he sold the film rights to Murder without Crime , he decided to direct it as well . The film was released in 1950 and Thompson established himself as a solid helmer of B pictures such as The Yellow Balloon and For Better or For Worse . He was ambitious to do something more , and was impressed by Who Lie in Gaol . Thompson 's backers at Associated British agreed to finance a film version , which became The Weak and the Wicked ( 1954 ) , starring Glynis Johns as ( basically ) Joan Henry , and co-starring Diana Dors and John Gregson . The movie is a first - rate women - in- prison melodrama : powerful , realistic , and not without humour ; Diana Dors , up until then more famous for being famous than her acting , was a revelation , and it was Thompson 's best directing work to date . The movie was a big hit at the box office and put Thompson in the \u201c A \u201d leagues : the Rank Organisation offered him As Long as They 're Happy , and Associated British gave him a big budget for An Alligator Named Daisy ( Diana Dors was in both , incidentally ) . Thompson wanted to make a story about a man on death row . Henry suggested they do it about a woman , so that she could draw on her personal experience ; she wound up writing a novel called Yield to the Night ( 1954 ) , about a woman who is executed for committing murder . Thompson succeeded in setting up the film version at Associated British ; Henry co-wrote the script , Thompson directed , and Dors starred . The result was a masterpiece , a stunningly good drama , where Dors plays a character who never asks for sympathy but gets it anyway : she 's guilty of the crime , is n't friendly to her family or death penalty protestors , still loves the louse who drove her to murder . The movie is full of little touches that speak volumes for Henry 's personal experience in prison \u2013 the routine of changing guards , the conversations , the way the seconds drag on by , the visiting officials , the small privileges , the overwhelming pressure of the longing for a reprieve \u2013 and the final moments are devastating : it 's one of the best British movies of the decade . Lazy critics claimed the film was inspired by the case of Ruth Ellis , who turned out to be the last woman hung in Britain ( she was played by Miranda Richardson in the 1985 film Dance with a Stranger ) ; the novel was actually published a year before Ellis committed her murder . Overlooking this fact served to downplay the skill of Henry 's contribution to Yield to the Night \u2013 her story did have parallels with Ellis ' case , but that was due more to Henry 's own insight , which predicted the future with such accuracy . Joan Henry had provided the material for Thompson 's two best movies to date \u2013 smart , passionate , tense , beautifully done . The two clearly had rapport on a personal level as well : Thompson left his wife of twenty years and two children to be with Henry , who he married in 1958 . It was not the first time a director had fallen in love with his screenwriter ; it may have been the first time one did so after reading that screenwriter 's memoir about being in prison , which he turned into a movie . The next few years were the golden period of Thompson 's career \u2013 he went on to make The Good Companions ( 1957 ) , a jolly musical ; Woman in a Dressing Gown ( 1957 ) , a tough drama about adultery , from a script by Ted Willis ; Ice Cold in Alex ( 1958 ) , a brilliant war suspense tale ; North West Frontier ( 1959 ) , an exciting Imperial adventure movie starring Kenneth More , shot in India ; Tiger Bay ( 1959 ) , a thriller that introduced Hayley Mills to the screen ; No Trees in the Street ( 1959 ) , a social realist melodrama , again from a script by Willis ; and I Aim at the Stars ( 1960 ) , a biopic of Werner Van Braun . Then he received a call from producer Carl Foreman to replace director Alexander Mackendrick on The Guns of Navarone ( 1961 ) , an expensive all - star action movie based on a novel by Alistair Maclean . Thompson 's work at such short notice impressed star Gregory Peck , who hired the Englishman to direct Cape Fear ( 1962 ) . It was an incredible run : few filmmakers had a hot streak like J. Lee Thompson from 1956 to 1962 . All the movies were well - reviewed ( on the whole ) ; Robert Mitchum gave one of the all - time iconic performances in Cape Fear ; ditto Hayley Mills in Tiger Bay , Yvonne Mitchell in Woman , and John Mills and Sylvia Syms in Alex . Commercially , things were even better : Cape Fear , Tiger Bay , Northwest Frontier , Woman and Alex were all solid hits , and Navarone a box-office phenomenon . J. Lee Thompson had become one of the most in - demand directors in the world . The success seems to have come at a domestic cost . By 1962 , the director was being seen in the company of actor Susan Hampshire , and Thompson was telling the press he was unable to make up his mind between Hampshire and Henry ( seriously , he told the press this ) . Later that year , it was reported that he had broken it off with both women and was dating actor Shirley Ann Field . Thompson would eventually divorce Henry and marry a third time in the late 1960s . Coincidence or not , the overall quality of J. Lee Thompson 's films declined sharply after things ended with Joan Henry . He made two bloated epics with Yul Brynner ( Taras Bulba and Kings of the Sun ) , two bloated comedies with Shirley Maclaine ( What a Way to Go , John Goldfarb Please Come Home ) , two patchy thrillers ( Return from the Ashes , Eye of the Devil ) , two bloated reunions with Gregory Peck ( Mackenna 's Gold , The Chairman ) , two attempts at returning to more intimate dramas ( Before Winter Comes , Country Dance ) , two solid sequels to The Planet of the Apes ( Conquest of the Planet of the Apes , Battle for the Planet of the Apes ) , two TV movies ( A Great American Tragedy , Widow ) , and a musical ( Huckleberry Finn ) . There were some excellent moments in all these movies \u2013 I 'm a particular fan of Eye of the Devil and the Apes films \u2013 but his overall average had dropped . He certainly never reached the heights of Navarone , Yield to the Night , Cape Fear , or Tiger Bay . Thompson at least found his commercial niche again in the mid 1970s as a director of Charles Bronson vehicles , starting with St Ives in 1976 . The two men would make eight more movies together , of decreasing ambition : The White Buffalo , Capo Blanco , 10 to Midnight , The Evil That Men Do , Murphy 's Law , Death Wish 4 , Messenger of Death , and Kinjite : Forbidden Subjects . Amidst this run , Thompson also tried his hand at a Europudding war movie ( The Passage ) , a fake biopic ( The Greek Tycoon ) , a slasher ( Happy Birthday to Me ) , two comedy adventures with stars not used to making them ( King Solomon 's Mines with Richard Chamberlain , Firewalker with Chuck Norris ) , and Rock Hudson 's last theatrical feature ( The Ambassador ) . Most of his later films were financed by Cannon Pictures . Thompson was aware of his artistic decline . In 1992 , he said \u201c I have certain regrets now . I would rather have stuck to making films like Yield to the Night which had some integrity and importance . But the British film industry caved in . I suppose I sort of sold out . \u201d In 2000 , two years before his death , he warned young directors , \u201c Do n't make a film for the sake of making it . Make it only if you really believe in it . Then success will eventually come to you . \u201d He rarely mentioned Joan Henry in interviews . Joan Henry 's subsequent career was n't as well publicised as Thompson 's , but she still kept active . She wrote the screenplay for Passionate Summer ( 1958 ) , a film for the Rank Organisation starring Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers that had little impact . She wrote for the stage with Look on Tempests ( 1960 ) , the first play dealing explicitly with the subject of homosexuality to be passed by the Lord Chamberlain ( possibly because the gay characters are discussed , not seen on stage \u2013 which might be why the play was not a hit ) . She wrote some TV plays , Rough Justice and Person to Person , but neither had had the impact of her first two novels . She died in 2001 , one year before Thompson . How influential was Joan Henry to J. Lee Thompson 's career ? It 's easy to gauge in the case of The Weak and the Wicked and Yield to the Night : neither would have existed without her . It gets harder for the other movies made during their marriage : she 's not credited on any of them . But one can look at patterns . The female roles during his 1956 - 62 period were incredibly strong \u2013 giving career - high roles to actors like Glynis Johns , Diana Dors , Yvonne Mitchell , Hayley Mills , Polly Bergen , Barrie Chase and Sylvia Syms . After Thompson 's marriage to Henry ended , the quality of female parts in his movies dropped away . He continued to be interested in young actresses \u2013 at different times he put Samantha Eggar , Shirley Ann Field and Talitha Pol under personal contract \u2013 but none of them had the opportunities of his ' 56 - 62 posse ( Pol , one of the most stunning actors of the sixties , which is saying something , later married John Paul Getty , quit acting and died of a heroin overdose ) . An interesting contrast is Thompson 's treatment of rape in Cape Fear ( Henry period ) and The Passage ( non - Henry ) . The former is a terrifying examination of that crime , with a particularly memorable subplot involving the impact of assault on a victim played by Barrie Chase ( giving a superb performance ) ; in the latter , the rape of a woman ( Kay Lenz ) at the hands of an SS Officer ( Malcolm McDowell ) is treated in an exploitative , camp way ( McDowell wears underpants with a swastika on them , Lenz is shown topless in a shower ) \u2026 it seems like a movie directed by an entirely different person . Thompson never had the same run of strong scripts that he did from ' 56 - 62 either . \u201c I freely admit I 've done some pretty bad stuff , \u201d he said in 1969 . \u201c It 's entirely my own fault . The trouble was I accepted some dismal scripts . I was n't tough enough \u2026 Writing is the fundamental thing . \u201d He tried to get out of action , making risky films like Before Winter Comes ( a tale of post - war refugees ) , Country Dance ( incest ) , A Great American Tragedy ( middle aged unemployment ) , Widow ( about a widow ) , and The White Buffalo ( Charles Bronson as Captain Ahab out west ) \u2013 but he could n't get there . What happened ? My theory : if you were a director married to a talented writer , it makes sense that you would get her to look at scripts , ask her opinion about things . If you cheated on that wife with starlets , it makes sense that that option may no longer be available . In his memoir One Man Tango , Anthony Quinn says that when Thompson started work on The Guns of Navarone the director refused to read a script and \u201c his direction consisted of one arbitrary decision after another : Gregory Peck would smoke a pipe ; I would grab a knife and look menacing ; David Niven would tinker with dynamite \u2026 Thompson had a tossed - off piece of business for each of us . \u201d Was this tossed off ? Or were they suggestions from Henry to make sure the lead characters in an ensemble piece were all distinct and easily identifiable ? Because there is a notable lack of similar bits of business in something like The Passage , where it is hard to tell the characters apart . Quinn went on to write that on Navarone Thompson \u201c Never read a scene until he had to shoot it and approached each shot on a whim . And yet the cumulative effect was astonishing . Lee Thompson made a marvelous picture but how ? Perhaps his inventiveness lay in defying convention , in rejecting the accepted methods of motion picture making and establishing his own . Perhaps it was in his very formlessness that he found the one form he could sustain , and nurture , the one form that could , in turn , sustain and nurture him . Perhaps he was just a lucky Englishman who pulled a good picture out of his ass . \u201d Or perhaps he had a wife at home giving him script advice which he could pass off on set as his own wisdom . Maybe Henry 's input was limited . But maybe it was n't . My own take is that Henry 's relationship with Thompson was analogous to Harrison Ford 's with the screenwriter Melissa Mathison ( she wrote ET , among others ) . The latter duo were married from 1983 to 2004 , Ford 's peak years of stardom , where he seemed to go from hit to hit ( a few stumbles , absolutely but the average was high ) . You would consistently read interviews with directors from this time who would comment on Ford giving \u201c excellent notes on the script \u201d . From the early 2000s onward , his record becomes a lot more patchy . Now , there could be plenty of reasons for this ( and my definition of \u201c patchy \u201d may be different from yours ) \u2013 but I would argue a contributing factor might just possibly be the fact that Melissa Mathison was n't giving him script advice anymore . And the same could be true for Joan Henry and J. Lee Thompson . The one Latin phrase I remember from my law days is \u201c Res ipsa loquitur \u201d which means \u201c the thing itself speaks \u201d . It 's used in negligence cases and means you can infer negligence from the nature of an accident or injury in the absence of direct evidence on how any defendant behaved . Look at the films J. Lee Thompson made when he was with Joan Henry . Then look at the ones he did without her . I believe , it 's a case of Res ipsa loquitur \u2013 the thing itself speaks . He was never as good without her .","annotations":[{"text":"in prison","span":[5532,5540],"token_span":[1072,1073],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"Where the Event takes place."},{"text":"the seconds","span":[5605,5615],"token_span":[1086,1087],"role":"Event","label":"Event","role_definition":"Name of the Event which is continuing."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Event continues at a certain Place through Time.","frame_ancestors":[],"frame_descendants":["Activity_ongoing","Retaining","Sleep"]},{"instance_id":"EN-0054-499-frame-Process_end","frame":"Process_end","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"The ruthless Bennett era was finally over .

Bennett , a former boxer and ex - Navy sailor , quickly established himself as the auto tycoon 's right - hand man after joining Ford Motor Co. in 1916 . Until his ouster in 1945 by Ford 's grandson , Henry II , Bennett carried out Henry Ford 's orders , often using violence . Other than Henry Ford 's wife , Clara , Bennett was perhaps the person closest to the auto pioneer during the final decades of Ford 's life . Bennett lorded over Ford 's notorious Service Department , a force of up to 8,000 . They monitored Ford employees , intimidated union organizers , delivered punishments and guarded Ford and his family . \" Harry Bennett did whatever he was told , \" said Ford historian and University of Michigan professor David Lewis . \" So he did a good deal of Henry Ford 's dirty work . \" Most notably , that dirty work included fighting the burgeoning power of the United Auto Workers union . Henry Ford hated labor unions and wanted them defeated . Bennett assumed that charge , culminating in the Battle of the Overpass in 1937 . Bennett would stay at Ford another eight years , but his employment depended on Henry Ford 's patronage . After the founder moved to the sidelines , the Ford family sent Bennett packing . Where it began According to various published reports and Bennett himself , a street fight was his pathway to corporate America after the Navy in 1916 . By most accounts , Bennett came to the aid of a friend engaged in a brawl with a New York customs officer . A Hearst newspaper columnist saw him and introduced him to Henry Ford . After asking Bennett , 24 , whether he could shoot , Ford offered him a job . Over the next 29 years , Bennett 's chores included covering up Henry Ford 's dalliances , firing executives and harassing jurors in a defamation lawsuit against Henry Ford in 1927 . He took over the Service Department at the Rouge plant in 1921 . By 1927 , Bennett was among the top six men at Ford Motor , according to historian Lewis . \" I got things done , \" said Bennett in 1973 . \" That 's why Mr. Ford liked me . \" Lewis described Bennett as \" a substitute son \" for Henry Ford . Ford admired Bennett 's rougher qualities and hoped they would brush off on his son , Edsel . By the mid-1930s , much of Bennett 's malevolence was directed at the UAW . \" Henry Ford received most of the national attention and criticism , but it was Harry Bennett who was often the driving force behind Ford 's attempt to stymie the union movement , \" wrote Ford 's great - grandson and current Ford Motor CEO Bill Ford in his 1979 senior thesis at Princeton University . In 1933 , Bennett 's men defeated union drives at plants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania . But a bigger clash was to come on May 26 , 1937 . When UAW organizers gathered to distribute leaflets on an overpass at the Rouge plant , Bennett set out to quash them . In front of photographers and reporters , Bennett 's thugs beat the union activists , including Walter Reuther . Photos of the organizers bloodied in the Battle of the Overpass were printed in newspapers across the USA . It would be four more years before a wildcat strike and Henry Ford 's capitulation forced Harry Bennett to sign a deal with the UAW . But Bennett had a final confrontation to come . Farewell After Edsel Ford died in May 1943 , Henry Ford wanted to make Bennett president of Ford Motor . But Clara Ford and Edsel 's widow , Eleanor , would n't hear of it . Instead , Bennett joined the board of directors in June 1943 and conspired with Henry Ford to draft a codicil to Ford 's will . It effectively gave Bennett control of Ford Motor after Henry Ford 's death , to the exclusion of Ford 's grandsons . When the eldest grandson , Henry II , discovered the codicil , his confidant John Bugas confronted Bennett , who burned the document . The Ford women again stepped up and convinced Henry Ford to hand control to Henry II . The reins were passed in September 1945 . On September 21 , 1945 , Henry Ford II fired the family rival . Bennett was out . The era of the Whiz Kids , the group of savvy young executives hired by Henry Ford II , had begun .","annotations":[{"text":"Bennett 's chores","span":[1799,1815],"token_span":[342,344],"role":"Process","label":"Process","role_definition":"Name of the event which occurs."},{"text":"On September 21 , 1945","span":[4080,4101],"token_span":[781,785],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the event ends."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"A Process comes to an end.","frame_ancestors":["Event"],"frame_descendants":["Activity_finish","Finish_game","Finish_competition"]},{"instance_id":"EN-3076-316-frame-Process_start","frame":"Process_start","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"In January 2008 , the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation launched a \" counter- terrorism \" operation in Ingushetia after receiving information that insurgents had been preparing a series of attacks .

Georgian , Russian and South Ossetian forces were all involved . There were also clashes in Abkhazia , and Russian attacks on other parts of Georgia . The separatist administrations in South Ossetia and Abkhazia have been trying to gain formal independence since breaking away in the early 1990s . Russia has now recognised them as independent - a move condemned by Western nations . Tensions in both regions began to escalate after Mikheil Saakashvili was elected Georgian president in 2004 , on a promise to re-unite the country . The conflicts had remained largely frozen , despite occasional flare - ups , before August 2008 . What triggered the crisis ? A series of clashes between Georgian and South Ossetian forces in the summer of 2008 prompted Georgia to launch an aerial bombardment and ground attack on South Ossetia on 7 August . Georgian forces controlled the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali , for part of the following day . Russia , meanwhile , poured thousands of troops into South Ossetia , and launched bombing raids both over the province and on targets in the rest of Georgia . There have been unverified reports of war crimes on both sides . Did the Russian forces enter South Ossetia before or after the Georgian attack ? This is unclear . Georgia says it began its assault after learning that a large convoy of Russian armour was coming through the Roki tunnel , from North Ossetia into South Ossetia . Russia says it acted to defend Russian citizens in South Ossetia , and its own peacekeepers stationed in the breakaway region . How did the conflict develop ? Russian forces occupied parts of Georgia adjoining South Ossetia , including the town of Gori , a strategic town on the main road linking eastern and western Georgia . They also moved from bases in Abkhazia into parts of western Georgia , and the Russian fleet went into action against the Georgian navy . Abkhaz forces recaptured the Kodori Gorge - a region of Abkhazia taken by Georgian troops in 2006 . Who are the main casualties ? Large numbers of civilians were driven out of their homes in South Ossetia . Many South Ossetians crossed over to the Russian republic of North Ossetia . Residents of Georgian villages in South Ossetia , and the town of Gori , also fled . The heavy fighting left the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali , largely in ruins . Why is Russia involved ? More than half of South Ossetia 's 70,000 citizens are said to have taken up Moscow 's offer of Russian citizenship . Russia says its actions were designed to protect those citizens . Russia also had peacekeepers based in South Ossetia . Some of these were killed in the Georgian attack on 7 August . Until recently , Russia said it respected Georgia 's territorial integrity , and only wanted to look out for Russian citizens . But , following Georgia 's military action , Russia recognised the independence of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia on 26 August . The US and France were swift to condemn Russia 's move , calling it \" regrettable , \" while the the UK categorically rejected it . Nato said the declaration violated numerous UN Security Council resolutions that Russia itself had endorsed . Russia has also signed friendship treaties with the breakaway regions , formalising diplomatic ties and pledging military assistance . Does Georgia have links to Nato ? President Saakashvili has made membership of Nato one of his main goals - and Nato agreed in April 2008 that Georgia would become a member of the alliance at some unspecified date in the future . The country has had a close relationship with the United States - sending troops to join the US - led coalition in Iraq . The US has helped to train and arm the Georgian military . It also helped Georgian troops return from Iraq after the Russian incursion into South Ossetia . What is the status of South Ossetia ? South Ossetia has run its own affairs since fighting for independence from Georgia in 1991 - 92 , in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union . Like the other breakaway region , Abkhazia , it declared its independence - but so far only Russia and Nicaragua have recognised them . Why do Ossetians want to break away ? The Ossetians are a distinct ethnic group originally from the Russian plains just south of the Don river . In the 13th Century , they were pushed southwards by Mongol invasions into the Caucasus mountains , settling along the border with Georgia . South Ossetians want to join up with their ethnic brethren in North Ossetia , which is an autonomous republic within the Russian Federation . Ethnic Georgians are a minority in South Ossetia , accounting for less than one - third of the population . But Georgia rejects even the name South Ossetia , preferring to call it by the ancient name of Samachablo , or Tskhinvali , after its main city . Are tensions over energy supplies a factor in the conflict ? A Western-sponsored pipeline has been pumping Caspian oil from Azerbaijan through Georgia to Turkey 's Mediterranean coast . The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan ( BTC ) pipeline can deliver up to 1.2 million barrels per day ( b/d ) of oil to Western markets . But the flow has been suspended since an explosion on part of the line in eastern Turkey in August . The Georgia conflict has delayed a resumption of deliveries . A smaller oil export pipeline runs from Azerbaijan to Georgia 's Black Sea port of Supsa . There are plans for another pipeline to take natural gas from Azerbaijan and Central Asia , via Turkey to Austria . The EU and US are anxious to diversify their energy sources , to avoid being too dependent on supplies transiting through Russia . Moscow already controls an oil export pipeline running from the Caspian to the Black Sea via the North Caucasus . Russian troops did not try to seize the BTC pipeline - and Moscow did not highlight energy as an issue in the conflict . But fears of instability in the Caucasus have made Western leaders and investors reassess their reliance on the region 's energy sources . How has the international community responded to the conflict ? The US has expressed solidarity and backing for Georgia , calling Russia 's actions \" an illegitimate , unilateral attempt to change the country 's borders by force \" . On a trip to Georgia , US Vice - President Dick Cheney said Russia 's actions had cast \" grave doubt \" on the country 's reliability as a partner within the international system . Georgia 's European neighbours have been somewhat more divided over how to react to the crisis at their heart . At an emergency summit in Brussels , some member states pushed for sanctions against Russia , seeking to isolate the country . In the end , the EU condemned Russia 's actions , called for it to meet the terms of the French -brokered ceasefire and suspended talks on a new partnership agreement with the bloc . The US has pledged to provide a $ 1 bn ( \u00a3 564 m ) aid package for reconstruction , resettlement and humanitarian needs . The IMF too has agreed in principle to give Georgia a $ 750 m ( \u00a3 422 m ) loan to help repair the conflict 's damage . What are EU observers doing in Georgia ? The European Union has sent more than 200 observers to Georgia , in line with a 12 August ceasefire deal brokered by French President Nicolas Sarkozy . Their operation began on 1 October and their mission 's initial duration is one year . The unarmed observers , from 22 EU countries , are working in close co-ordination with the United Nations and the European security body , the OSCE . One of their key tasks was to monitor the Russian troop withdrawal from \" security zones \" established by Russia around South Ossetia and Abkhazia . Russia completed its troop pull - out as promised by 10 October , but it plans to keep nearly 8,000 troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia . Russia has refused to let the monitors enter the two breakaway regions . The EU observers have the task of ensuring that the situation stabilises in the conflict zone , that human rights are not violated there and that internally displaced people can return home . Their liaison work is aimed at confidence - building and an easing of tensions . How does the conflict mark a change in Russia 's relations with the world ? Russian intervention in Georgia has been followed by an explicit shift in the country 's foreign policy , laid out by the president . Mr Medvedev has pledged to continue to defend the lives and dignity of its citizens , wherever they are located . He said that while Russia does not seek isolation , and desires friendly relations with Europe and the US , it cannot accept a world order that places a single state - even the US - as sole global decision - maker . Russia , he said , seeks to maintain privileged interests in its spheres of influence - including those bordering the country .","annotations":[{"text":"Fighting","span":[4,11],"token_span":[2,2],"role":"Event","label":"Event","role_definition":"Name of the Event which occurs."},{"text":"in Georgia 's breakaway region of South Ossetia","span":[13,59],"token_span":[3,10],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"Where the Event takes place."},{"text":"in August","span":[61,69],"token_span":[11,12],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the Event occurs."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Event begins at a certain Time and Place.","frame_ancestors":["Event"],"frame_descendants":["Activity_start","Come_into_effect"]},{"instance_id":"EN-5048-444-frame-Process_stop","frame":"Process_stop","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"Los Angeles Times , 5 Dec. 1958 : A9 .

There is no state more beautiful than Hawaii and there are no people friendlier . When I was 17 years old , my family spent a summer in Hawaii and it was one of the most wonderful experiences of my life . I ca n't swim to save my life and I have a morbid fear of drowning but , when I was in Hawaii , I happily walked into the ocean . Not far into the ocean , of course . But still , everyone in my family was amazed . Of course , eventually I saw a jelly fish floating towards me and I screamed and ran back to the beach . ( After reaching the safety of the beach , I realized that the jelly fish was actually just seaweed but still , it was scary -looking ! ) Hawaii is just the type of state that makes you appreciate life and take risks . For instance , consider the two main characters in Roger Corman 's 1958 film , She Gods of Shark Reef . Chris ( Bill Cord ) and Lee ( Don Durant ) are brothers who live in Hawaii . Chris has blonde hair and a good attitude towards life . Lee has dark hair and a criminal nature . Chris loves the ocean . Lee loves to run guns . After Lee kills two men , he stows away on Chris 's boat . When the boat then hits a storm , Chris and Lee wash up on the shores of an isolated beach . It 's a beautiful island but all Lee can think about is how he can make money off of his current predicament . Bad Lee , bad ! Anyway , it turns out that the island is inhabited by an all - female village of pearl divers . Everyone is excited by the arrival of two handsome , shirtless men . Everyone except for Queen Pua ( Jeanne Gerson ) , who does n't trust either one of them and who does n't appear to want anyone in the world to be happy . She 's especially upset when Chris interrupts a plan to sacrifice a villager to the shark gods of the sea . Chris not only rescues but also falls in love with Mahia ( Lisa Montell ) . While Chris is busy falling in love , Lee is trying to figure out a way to escape from the island before a rescue boat arrives . Lee , after all , is a wanted criminal and the last thing that he wants is to go from being shipwrecked to imprisoned . Lee comes up with a plan for himself , his brother , and Mahia to escape the island . However , Lee being Lee , he just ca n't overcome his greedy nature . As quickly becomes obvious , Karma is not only a bitch but it 's a shark as well . She Gods of Shark Reef was directed by Roger Corman . Though the film 's low budget is obvious in every frame , Corman wisely decided to concentrate on the island 's beauty as opposed to the movie 's somewhat haphazard story . This is one of those films where the action stops for nearly five minutes so that Corman can film a hula dancer . But you know what ? That 's okay ! The beauty of Hawaii and the surrounding ocean carry the film . You do n't watch for the plot . Instead , you watch for the blue water and the green grass and the vibrant skies . This is a film that you watch for the island scenery and the sharks . Both of them are quite nice .","annotations":[{"text":"She Gods of Shark Reef","span":[836,857],"token_span":[177,181],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"Where the event takes place."},{"text":"the action","span":[2615,2624],"token_span":[553,554],"role":"Process","label":"Process","role_definition":"The Process which is halting."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"A Process stops at a certain Time and Place.","frame_ancestors":["Event"],"frame_descendants":["Activity_stop","Halt"]},{"instance_id":"EN-0880-600-frame-Proliferating_in_number","frame":"Proliferating_in_number","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"Following the biopsy , a pathological examination is performed on the portion of excised breast tissue .

The pathologist sends your doctor a report that gives a diagnosis for each sample taken . Information in this report will be used to help manage your care . The questions and answers that follow are meant to help you understand medical language you might find in the pathology report from a breast biopsy , such as a needle biopsy or an excision biopsy . In a needle biopsy , a needle is used to remove a sample of an abnormal area . An excision biopsy removes the entire abnormal area , often with some of the surrounding normal tissue . An excision biopsy is much like a type of breast - conserving surgery called a lumpectomy . What is carcinoma ? This is a term used to describe a cancer that begins in the lining layer ( epithelial cells ) of organs like the breast . Nearly all breast cancers are carcinomas . What is in - situ carcinoma ( or carcinoma in situ ) of the breast ? This term is used for the earliest stage of breast cancer , when it is confined to the layer of cells where it began . The normal breast is made of tiny tubes ( ducts ) that end in a group of sacs ( lobules ) . Cancer starts in the cells lining the ducts or lobules , when a normal cell becomes a carcinoma cell . As long as the carcinoma cells are still confined to the breast ducts or lobules , and do not break out and grow into surrounding tissue , it is considered in - situ carcinoma ( also known as carcinoma in situ , or CIS ) . Once the carcinoma cells have grown and broken out of the ducts or lobules , it is called invasive or infiltrating carcinoma . In an invasive carcinoma , the tumor cells can spread ( metastasize ) to other parts of your body . What does it mean if my in - situ carcinoma is called ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) , intraductal carcinoma , or in - situ carcinoma with duct and lobular features ? There are 2 main types of in - situ carcinoma of the breast : ductal carcinoma in - situ ( DCIS ) and lobular carcinoma in situ ( LCIS ) . Intraductal carcinoma is another name for ductal carcinoma in - situ . LCIS is discussed on a different page . Sometimes DCIS and LCIS are both found in the same biopsy . In - situ carcinoma with duct and lobular features means that the in - situ carcinoma looks like DCIS in some ways and LCIS in some ways ( when looked at under the microscope ) , and so the pathologist ca n't call it one or the other . If DCIS is left untreated , it can go on to become an invasive cancer , so it is often called a pre-cancer . Still , we do n't really understand it well . We do n't think that all DCIS would go on to become invasive cancer , but we ca n't tell which DCIS would be safe to leave untreated . Treatment is aimed at getting rid of all the DCIS , usually by surgery . In some cases , radiation ( radiotherapy ) or hormone therapy ( like tamoxifen ) is given after surgery to lower the chance that it will come back later ( recur ) or that invasive carcinoma will occur . What does it mean if my report mentions E-cadherin ? E-cadherin is a test that the pathologist might use to help determine if the carcinoma in situ is ductal or lobular . If your report does not mention E-cadherin , it means that this test was not needed to make the distinction . What does it mean if my report describes my ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) as being cribriform , micropapillary , apocrine , comedo , with comedonecrosis , papillary , or solid ? These terms are used to describe certain ways that the DCIS looks under the microscope . Some of these are linked to a higher chance that the DCIS may come back after treatment , so finding them may change your treatment . Your doctor should discuss this with you . What does it mean if my ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) is described as being low grade , intermediate grade , or high grade ; or nuclear grade 1 , nuclear grade 2 , or nuclear grade 3 ; or low mitotic rate , intermediate mitotic rate , or high mitotic rate ? These are all different ways of describing how the DCIS looks under the microscope : - DCIS that is high grade , is nuclear grade 3 , or has a high mitotic rate is more likely to come back ( recur ) after it is removed with surgery . - DCIS that is low grade , is nuclear grade 1 , or has a low mitotic rate is less likely to come back after surgery . - DCIS that is intermediate grade , is nuclear grade 2 , or has an intermediate mitotic rate falls in between these two . Patients with higher grade DCIS may need additional treatment . What is the significance of the reported size of the ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) ? If the entire tumor or area of DCIS is removed ( such as in an excisional biopsy or breast - conserving surgery ) , the pathologist will say how big the DCIS is by measuring how long it is across ( in greatest dimension ) , either by looking at it under the microscope or by gross examination ( just looking at it with the naked eye ) of the tissue taken out at surgery . Another way to measure DCIS is to note the number of microscopic slides that contain DCIS . For example , the report may say that DCIS was found in 3 slides . On needle biopsy , measurements of the area of DCIS are not often reported because this type of biopsy only samples a part of the tumor . Later , when the entire area of DCIS is removed ( with surgery ) , an accurate measurement can be done . The larger the area of DCIS , the more likely it is to come back ( recur ) after surgery . Doctors use information about the size of the DCIS when recommending further treatments . What does it mean if my report mentions Paget disease ? Paget disease ( also called Paget 's disease , Paget disease of the nipple , or Paget disease of the breast ) is when cells resembling the cells of ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) are found in the skin of the nipple and the nearby skin ( the areola ) . Paget disease of the nipple is usually associated with DCIS or invasive carcinoma ( cancer ) in the underlying breast tissue . If Paget disease is found on needle or punch biopsy , more tissue in that area usually needs to be removed with the goal of entirely removing the area of Paget disease . Talk to your doctor about the best treatment for you . What does it mean if my report mentions special tests such as high molecular weight cytokeratin ( HMWCK ) , CK903 , CK5 / 6 , p63 , muscle specific actin , smooth muscle myosin heavy chain , calponin , or keratin ? These are special tests that the pathologist sometimes uses to help make the diagnosis of DCIS . Not all cases need these tests . Whether your report does or does not mention these tests has no bearing on the accuracy of your diagnosis . What does it mean if my report on ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) mentions estrogen receptor ( ER ) or progesterone receptor ( PR ) ? ER and PR are special tests that the pathologist does that are important in predicting response of the DCIS to hormone therapy ( like tamoxifen ) . Testing for ER is done for most cases of DCIS , but testing for PR is not typically needed . Results for ER and PR are reported separately and can be reported in different ways : - Negative , weakly positive , positive - Percent positive - Percent positive with something saying whether the staining is weak , moderate , or strong Ask your doctor how these results will affect your treatment . What if my report on ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) mentions margins or ink ? When the entire area of DCIS is removed , the outside surface ( edges or margins ) of the specimen is coated with ink , sometimes even with different colors of ink on different sides of the specimen . The pathologist looks at slides of the DCIS under the microscope to see how close the DCIS cells get to the ink ( the edges or margins of the specimen ) . If DCIS is touching the ink ( called positive margins ) , it can mean that some DCIS cells were left behind , and more surgery or other treatments may be needed . Sometimes , though , the surgeon has already removed more tissue ( at surgery ) to help make sure that this is n't needed . If your pathology report shows DCIS with positive margins , your doctor will talk to you about what treatment is best . What does it mean if my report also mentions atypical ductal hyperplasia ( ADH ) or atypical lobular hyperplasia ( ALH ) ? These findings are less serious than DCIS , and you should talk with your doctor about what these findings may mean to your care . What does it mean if my report also uses any of the following terms : usual ductal hyperplasia , adenosis , sclerosing adenosis , radial scar , complex sclerosing lesion , papillomatosis , papilloma , apocrine metaplasia , cysts , columnar cell change , collagenous spherulosis , duct ectasia , fibrocystic changes , flat epithelial atypia , or columnar alteration with prominent apical snouts and secretions ( CAPSS ) ? All of these are terms for benign ( non - cancerous changes ) that the pathologist might see under the microscope . They are not important when seen on a biopsy where there is DCIS . What does it mean if my report mentions microcalcifications or calcifications ? Microcalcifications or calcifications are calcium deposits that can be found in both non- cancerous and cancerous breast lesions . They can be seen both on mammograms and under the microscope . Because certain calcifications are found in areas containing cancer , their presence on a mammogram may lead to a biopsy of the area . Then , when the biopsy is done , the pathologist looks at the tissue removed to be sure that it contains calcifications . If the calcifications are there , the treating physician knows that the biopsy sampled the correct area ( the abnormal area with calcifications that was seen on the mammogram ) . What does it mean if my doctor asks for a special molecular ( genomic ) test , such as Oncotype DX\u00ae , to be done on my specimen ? Molecular tests may help predict the chances of DCIS coming back ( recurring ) in the breast , but not all cases need these tests . The results should be discussed with your doctor . The results do not affect your diagnosis , although they might affect your treatment .

The Wales international was jailed in April 2012 for raping a woman . He was released from prison in October after serving half of a five - year sentence and the owner of the League One club , Simon Corney , had said on Wednesday that a deal for the 26- year - old striker was \" 80 % likely \" . But after days of intense speculation Oldham have called off the move . Greater Manchester 's chief constable Sir Peter Fahy said his force would be launching an investigation into threats to the club 's staff and their families . \" It is totally unacceptable , \" Sir Peter told BBC Radio 5 live . \" We will be contacting Oldham Athletic to make sure that it 's investigated . \" Jim McMahon , the leader of Oldham Council , urged \" all sides of the debate to show restraint and calm \" . \" In recent days we 've seen an horrendous ' trial by social media ' with intimidation , abuse and harassment on a scale that has cast a terrible shadow , \" said McMahon . \" The whole episode has divided the town and public opinion and there are no winners in all this - not least the reputation of our club and town . \" More than 60,000 people signed a petition calling on Oldham not to sign former Sheffield United player Evans , while a number of campaigners and politicians voiced opposition to the move . Club sponsors were told on Wednesday to prepare for confirmation of the Evans deal after days of negotiations . That prompted Verlin Rainwater Solutions to end its association with the club immediately , while a second backer , ZenOffice , revealed it would sever ties if Evans signed . It is the second time a club has abandoned attempts to sign Evans . His former club Sheffield United ended their interest following another public outcry , with more than 160,000 people signing an online petition against his return . Evans continues to protest his innocence , and an investigation into his conviction by the Criminal Cases Review Commission is under way . Earlier on Thursday , Harry Redknapp , manager of Premier League side QPR , had told reporters Evans should be given a second chance . He added : \" Once you 've done your time you 've done your time , and somewhere along the line you 've got to come out and make a go of your life . \" So it 's a very difficult situation at the moment with the lad who is a footballer and wants to play football . \" He ca n't just not be allowed to carry on with his life . \"","annotations":[{"text":"Ched Evans","span":[131,140],"token_span":[21,22],"role":"Perpetrator","label":"Perpetrator","role_definition":"This is the person who forces another person to have sexual intercourse with him or her against the other person's will."},{"text":"April 2012","span":[557,566],"token_span":[102,103],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time when the event occurs."},{"text":"raping a woman","span":[572,585],"token_span":[105,107],"role":"Event","label":"Event","role_definition":"The rape of a Victim by the Perpetrator."},{"text":"a woman","span":[579,585],"token_span":[106,107],"role":"Victim","label":"Victim","role_definition":"This is the person who is forced to engage in sexual intercourse against his or her will."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"The words in this frame describe situations in which the Perpetrator has sexual intercourse with the Victim forcibly (or by threatening the use of force) and without his or her consent.

Last week , the region 's prospects appeared in the doldrums and there was little chance of a reversal of fortunes soon . Take a step back though and there is hope to be had . EU membership talks involving Montenegro and Serbia , the two frontrunners , have been stuck for almost a year , with the last negotiating chapters opened in December 2018 . EU leaders could not agree at the October summit to open accession talks with Albania and North Macedonia and the latter 's prime minister , Zoran Zaev , then called a snap election for the spring . But fast - forward a few days , and things suddenly look up . Three countries \u2013 Serbia , North Macedonia and Albania \u2013 have agreed a mini-Schengen , with free flow of people , goods and services . And Bosnia -Herzegovina , one of the worst - performing countries in the region \u2013 announced its intention to join this week . That would create a common market of more than 15 million people and the initiative could hardly be ignored by the EU . \u201c Anything that stabilises the region , deepens the cooperation , will be getting support from my government and from the EU , \u201d said an EU diplomat whose country is quite cautious about enlargement . Serbia , the biggest of the six Western Balkan hopefuls , is preparing to sign a free - trade deal with the Russia-dominated Eurasian Economic Union [ hint , hint , Brussels ] . But at the same time , it is trying to attract a \u20ac 1.4 billion investment from Volkswagen . As for Zaev , what looked like a desperate , emotional protest of a man let down by the EU , could well have been a well - calculated gamble that may pay dividends in the end , rather than bring back nationalists to power . Here is why . North Macedonia is all but certain to join NATO in December or January . The alliance has already publicly reassured the country its accession would go ahead . So chalk one up for Zaev . France , the staunchest opponent of enlargement , holds municipal elections on 15 March . After that , there will be much less need to play up its resistance to \u201c quick enlargement \u201d for domestic audiences and Emmanuel Macron could be easier to sway . The European Council meets on 26 - 27 March and enlargement will be on the agenda again , before a major EU - Western Balkan summit planned in Zagreb in May . Seeing , on the one hand , that the Western Balkan countries are finally stepping up cooperation and readying an EU - like single market of their own , and , on the other , hardline nationalists in North Macedonia waiting to oust Zaev , the decision should be positive . \u201c Given the potential for the political situation in North Macedonia to deteriorate , the European Council should not wait until May 2020 to find another opportunity to open accession talks , \u201d Green MEP Tineke Strik , a shadow rapporteur on North Macedonia , told the European Parliament 's plenary on Thursday ( 24 October ) . Incidentally , Lonely Planet has just named North Macedonia the third - best place to visit in 2020 , calling it a \u201c little - known gem \u201d . As for the other five countries , the Zagreb summit should open the EU door a wee bit wider , or at least give them a clearer road - map and perspective . But then again , things could also take a nastier turn in the Balkans . The participation of Kosovo \u2013 Serbia 's former province whose independence Belgrade does not recognise \u2013 in the ' mini - Schengen ' is bound to come up and could even derail the process . Or not . Just go back and read the beginning . The Roundup French President Emmanuel Macron finally revealed his substitute pick for France 's vacant European Commissioner slot on Thursday , naming former economy minister Thierry Breton . And the UK might have to do the same , as Commission President - elect Ursula von der Leyen made clear that a Brexit extension will mean that the UK will have to nominate a member of the new EU executive .

Gas power plants in Spain are running below 25 % capacity , according to an investigation published in the Spanish media on Wednesday , sparking calls from environmentalists to stop funding the country 's \u201c oversized \u201d gas infrastructure . Tighter environmental regulation and fierce competition from renewable energies are increasingly making coal - fired power operate at a loss . According to a British think tank , coal - fired power plants are losing billions every year but energy companies say this is nonsense .

As more details of his predatory activities came to light , several leading universities and respected figures were struggling to contain the backlash . It saw one prominent laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the firing line with its director apologising and pledging to return the money paid by Epstein . Another Harvard academic has apologised for meeting with Epstein after the billionaire 's Florida conviction on child prostitution charges . More scientists are likely to find themselves under the microscope over the next few weeks as critics demand to know how much Epstein 's beneficiaries knew of his activities , including his interest in eugenics and plans to \u201c improve \u201d the human race by impregnating 20 women at a time . Scientists faced a dilemma , said Kathleen Hall Jamieson , professor of communication and the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania . \u201c Scientists need funding for important work and many forms of it are underfunded . \u201d \u201c If the funding is for legitimate scientific work , there is nothing wrong with accepting support from a billionaire . \u201d \" However it would have been wrong for scientists to accept his funding if they were aware that he was planning a eugenics experiment that might draw legitimacy from his association with them . Epstein reportedly had plans to do things which were highly problematic , such as creating generations of himself . \u201d And if scientists were aware that Epstein was engaged in criminal forms of exploitation , \" they were legally and ethically required to report him . \" Epstein was a generous benefactor to scientific institutions for many years , in particular , Harvard . Despite never having completed a college degree , Epstein prided himself on his association with the university , even being pictured wearing a Harvard sweatshirt . The vehicle for many of the donations was the Jeffrey Epstein Vl Foundation , which was established in 2000 with the mission to \u201c support cutting edge science and science education around the world \u201d . According to the Foundation 's website , its donations included a $ 35 million gift in 2003 to establish the Programme for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard . Other sources suggest the figure was a more modest $ 6.5 million . He wined and dined some of the world 's most eminent scientists , including Stephen Hawking and George Church , a geneticist at Harvard . Prof. Church has issued a public apology for meeting Epstein when he completed his 13 - month sentence after pleading guilty to charges of soliciting and procuring a person under 18 for prostitution . In an interview with STAT , a health and science website , he admitted that he had shown poor judgement . \u201c There should have been more conversations about , should we be doing this , should we be helping this guy ? There was just a lot of nerd tunnel vision . \u201d The controversy has caused considerable damage to the reputation of the Media Lab at MIT whose achievements include developing robotic prosthetics capable of imitating the human gait has been badly hit by the scandal . The donations received by MIT were modest compared with Harvard . One estimate suggests that the figure was \u201c in excess of $ 200,000 \u201d . Joi Ito , its director , issued a public apology admitting he had both allowed the Lab to accept money and allowed Epstein to invest in his personal fund for tech start - up companies . \u201c I was never involved in , never heard him talk about , and never saw any evidence of the horrific acts that he was accused of , \u201d he wrote . \u201c That said , I take full responsibility for my error in judgment . I am deeply sorry to the survivors , to the Media Lab , and to the MIT community for bringing such a person into our network . \u201d He has promised to return the money as well as raising an equivalent amount which he will direct towards supporting the victims of trafficking . The group was also deserted other figures including Ethan Zuckerman , director of the lab 's Center for Civic Media , who severed his connections with the institution , even though he had no dealings with Epstein himself . \u201c My logic was simple , \u201d he wrote . \u201c The work my group does focuses on social justice and on the inclusion of marginalised individuals and points of view . It 's hard to do that work with a straight face in a place that violated its own values so clearly in working with Epstein and in disguising that relationship . \u201d Nathan Matias , a visiting scholar , also ended his association with the lab on Thursday night . The Telegraph approached both MIT and Harvard for comment .","annotations":[{"text":"Leading American scientists","span":[0,26],"token_span":[0,2],"role":"Recipient","label":"Recipient","role_definition":"The person who acts to come into possession of the Theme."},{"text":"Harvard academic","span":[481,496],"token_span":[76,77],"role":"Recipient","label":"Recipient","role_definition":"The person who acts to come into possession of the Theme."},{"text":"to scientific institutions","span":[1784,1809],"token_span":[299,301],"role":"Recipient","label":"Recipient","role_definition":"The person who acts to come into possession of the Theme."},{"text":"Harvard","span":[1844,1850],"token_span":[309,309],"role":"Recipient","label":"Recipient","role_definition":"The person who acts to come into possession of the Theme."},{"text":"the Media Lab at MIT","span":[3116,3135],"token_span":[536,540],"role":"Recipient","label":"Recipient","role_definition":"The person who acts to come into possession of the Theme."},{"text":"money","span":[55,59],"token_span":[7,7],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The entity that changes possession, beginning in the possession of the Donor and ending up with the Recipient."},{"text":"Jeffrey Epstein","span":[66,80],"token_span":[9,10],"role":"Donor","label":"Donor","role_definition":"The person who gives the Theme to the Recipient."},{"text":"the Jeffrey Epstein Vl Foundation","span":[2061,2093],"token_span":[345,349],"role":"Donor","label":"Donor","role_definition":"The person who gives the Theme to the Recipient."},{"text":"for many years","span":[1811,1824],"token_span":[302,304],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the Recipient comes into possession of the Theme."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"A Recipient comes into possession of the Theme as a result of the joint action of the Donor and the Recipient.","frame_ancestors":["Getting","Event"],"frame_descendants":["Borrowing"]},{"instance_id":"EN-2805-140-frame-Rejuvenation","frame":"Rejuvenation","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"TBM # 1 was disassembled and removed from the University of Washington station .

That means that TBM # 1 will have dug four of the six tunnel segments from the Maple Leaf Portal to University of Washington Station , which roughly equates to 4.5 miles of tunneling ( the corridor itself is 3.5 miles ) . TBM # 1 is the same tunnel boring machine that made the first lap from University District Station to University of Washington , reaching the station on March 30th . Its companion tunnel boring machine was unfortunately damaged in December while digging from Roosevelt Station to University District Station , leading to the TBM to shut down completely for more than a month for in - tunnel repairs . The shutdown left TBM # 2 an agonizing 650 feet from the University District station box . But by late March , TBM # 2 made it to the University District itself . Sound Transit 's contractor then assessed whether to relaunch the TBM or swap it out . JCM determined that the best solution was to remove TBM # 2 and instead transport TBM # 1 to University District Station , and then reassemble and refurbish it for relaunch . If TBM # 1 's last lap is anything to go by , transit enthusiasts can expect approximately 84 days of digging before the TBM reaches University of Washington Station .

We can have fun disabling this annoyance once and for all . In this article I 'll show you how to use your your Linux PC to disable virtual CD- ROM drive with built in software on Huawei and ZTE GSM modem devices . Disclamer : In this article you are going to send direct AT commands to your modem hardware and if you try real hard you can mess your hardware to the point where you will be unable to use it to connect to Internet . I 've tested following procedure with my Huawei E220 and ZTE MF100 devices but it should work for all Huawei and ZTE hardware . I know that you will probably proceed because that 's what every Linux geek ( my self included ) would do in your place but you 've been warned . So let 's cut to the chase . In this article I 'm using Ubuntu Linux 10.04 but the logic is the same for any Linux distribution . We will use minicom to communicate with our modem so let 's install it first ; sudo apt - get install minicom Now lets configure minicom for our modem device and select \" Serial port setup \" from the \" Configuration \" menu : sudo minicom -s For \" Serial Device \" you will select / dev/tty USB0 if you have Huawei E220 device or / dev/tty USB2 if you have ZTE MF100 modem device . If you have some other modem device for the \" tty USBX \" part take a look at the \" Connection information \" window from your Network Manager when you have established Internet connection . That will give you serial device location for your hardware . Here are the screen shots for my Huawei E220 : After you 've finished just select \" Save setup as dfl \" option and \" Exit from Minicom \" what will bring you back to terminal . Now you should be able to communicate directly with your modem using AT commands . Keep in mind that Network Manager locks your modem device as soon as you establish Internet connection using this device . It stays locked even after you disconnect so to be on the safe side now is the time to right click to your Network Manager and uncheck \" Enable Mobile Broadband \" or even \" Enable Networking \" option to release your device for use with minicom . Now run minicom using : sudo minicom If everything is correct you will be presented with the following screen : Huawei modem devices Now comes the most important part , AT commands to disable virtual CD- ROM drive .

No one , however , would consider Judy Greer 's character in Barry Munday \u2014 which suggests Knocked Up re-imagined as Sundance fodder \u2014 to be a dream girl . Playing an angry geek perpetually on the verge of exploding into sour rage , Greer is more like a nightmare with legs . She 's an aggressive nerd , carrying a surplus of inchoate anger with nowhere to release it . Handsome actor Patrick Wilson dons a scruffy goatee and a hideous clothing to play a loser whose life revolves around picking up women in sad little bars for one - night stands . Wilson leads a shallow life unencumbered by meaning until he makes out with the wrong stranger and ends up on the receiving end of a vicious beatdown that costs him his testicles . Shortly after his unfortunate accident , Wilson receives news that he 's impregnated Greer , though he has no memory of sleeping with her . Seeking purpose in a rudderless existence , Wilson throws himself into future fatherhood . At its core , Barry Munday asks an intriguing question : What does a man controlled by the dictates of an insatiable sex drive do when facing a sexless future ? Rather than grapple truthfully with that grim existential dilemma , writer - director Chris D'Arienzo , adapting Frank Turner Hollon 's novel , gives his film over to random wackiness ( like a support group for men with bizarre sexual abnormalities ) , distracting stunt casting , and Napoleon Dynamite - style production design . D'Arienzo goes overboard with campy watercolors , wood paneling , and egregious tackiness ; the sets function as a hermetic kitsch museum . In a bold turn , Greer makes no effort to render her character likeable . It 's an uncompromising performance , betrayed by a screenplay whose idea of a redemptive character arc entails having its leads wear progressively nicer clothes to convey their growing maturity . Like Knocked Up , Barry Munday is a coming - of - age story about an overgrown adolescent who becomes a man by fathering a child , but this sluggishly paced quirkfest is awfully sophomoric for a film all about giving up the facile thrills of youth for the responsibilities of adulthood .","annotations":[{"text":"with that grim existential dilemma","span":[1374,1407],"token_span":[249,253],"role":"Old","label":"Old","role_definition":"The entity that formerly occupied the position."},{"text":"Chris D'Arienzo","span":[1429,1443],"token_span":[258,259],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The conscious entity, generally a person, that performs actions resulting in the New entity occupying the position."},{"text":"random wackiness ( like a support group for men with bizarre sexual abnormalities ) , distracting stunt casting , and Napoleon Dynamite - style production design","span":[1510,1670],"token_span":[273,298],"role":"New","label":"New","role_definition":"The New entity is the person or thing that the Agent sets to fill a Role."},{"text":"Barry Munday","span":[2103,2114],"token_span":[373,374],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies where the Agent installs the New entity."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Agent changes the filler of a Role by placing a New filler in the position after the Old filler ceases to occupy the position.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-4426-363-frame-Rescuing","frame":"Rescuing","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"Famed English opera soprano Greta Williams , who was a passenger on the Stella , was hailed as a heroine for comforting the ship 's frightened survivors as they awaited their rescuers .","annotations":[{"text":"Greta Williams","span":[28,41],"token_span":[4,5],"role":"Patient","label":"Patient","role_definition":"The living being who is rescued by the Agent."},{"text":"the ship 's frightened survivors","span":[120,151],"token_span":[22,26],"role":"Patient","label":"Patient","role_definition":"The living being who is rescued by the Agent."},{"text":"Stella","span":[72,77],"token_span":[13,13],"role":"Harmful_situation","label":"Harmful_situation","role_definition":"An event that occurs which could result in injury or harm to the Patient or Asset."}],"trigger":{"text":"rescuers","start_char":175,"end_char":182,"start_token":31,"end_token":31,"frame":"Rescuing"}},"source":{"text":"' Twas in the month of March and in the year of 1899 , Which will be remembered for a very long time ; The wreck of the steamer \u201c Stella \u201d that was wrecked on the Casquet Rocks , By losing her bearings in a fog , and received some terrible shocks . The \u201c Stella \u201d was bound for the Channel Islands on a holiday trip , And a number of passengers were resolved not to let the chance slip ; And the hearts of the passengers felt light and gay , As the \u201c Stella \u201d steamed out of the London Docks without delay . The vessel left London at a quarter - past eleven , With a full passenger list and a favourable wind from heaven ; And all went well until late in the afternoon , When all at once a mist arose , alas ! too soon . And as the Channel Islands were approached a fog set in , Then the passengers began to be afraid and made a chattering din ; And about half - past three o'clock the fog settled down , Which caused Captain Reeks and the passengers with fear to frown . And brave Captain Reeks felt rather nervous and discontent , Because to him it soon became quite evident ; And from his long experience he plainly did see That the fog was increasing in great density . Still the \u201c Stella \u201d sailed on at a very rapid rate , And , oh , heaven ! rushed headlong on to her fate , And passed o'er the jagged rocks without delay , And her side was ripped open : Oh ! horror and dismay ! Then all the passengers felt the terrible shock , As the \u201c Stella \u201d stuck fast upon the first ledge of rock ; And they rushed to the deck in wild alarm , While some of them cried : \u201c Oh ! God protect us from harm . \u201d Then men clasped wives and daughters , and friends shook hands , And unmoved Captain Reeks upon the bridge stands ; And he shouted , \u201c Get out the boats without delay ! \u201d Then the sailors and officers began to work without dismay . Again Captain Reeks cried in a manly clear voice , \u201c Let the women and children be our first choice ! \u201d Then the boats were loaded in a speedy way , And with brave seamen to navigate them that felt no dismay . Then the \u201c Stella \u201d began rapidly for to settle down , And Captain Reeks gave his last order without a frown , Shouting , \u201c Men , for yourselves , you 'll better look out ! \u201d Which they did , needing no second bidding , without fear or doubt . Then the male passengers rushed to the boats in wild despair , While the cries of the women and children rent the air ; Oh , heaven ! such a scene ! ' twas enough to make one weep , To see mothers trying to save their children that were fast asleep . Brave Captain Reeks stood on the bridge till the ship went down , With his eyes uplifted towards heaven , and on his face no frown ; And some of the passengers jumped from the ship into the sea , And tried hard to save their lives right manfully . But the sufferings of the survivors are pitiful to hear , And I think all Christian people for them will drop a tear , Because the rowers of the boata were exhausted with damp and cold ; And the heroine of the wreck was Miss Greta Williams , be it told . She remained in as open boat with her fellow - passengers and crew , And sang \u201c O rest in the Lord , and He will come to our rescue \u201d ; And for fourteen hours they were rowing on the mighty deep , And when each man was done with his turn he fell asleep . And about six o'clock in the morning a man shrieked out , \u201c There 's a sailing boat coming towards us without any doubt \u201d ; And before the sailing boat could get near , a steamer hove in sight , Which proved to be the steamer \u201c Lynx , \u201d to their delight . And they were conveyed to Guernsey without delay , Poor souls , with their hearts in a state of joy and dismay ; But alas ! more than eighty persons have been lost in the briny deep , But I hope their souls are now in heaven in safe keep . Disaster in the Channel Passenger Steamer Wrecked Great Loss of Life It is with the deepest regret that we announce that a terrible disaster has overtaken the London and South -Western Railway Company 's passenger steamer Stella , engaged in the Southampton and Channel Islands service . During a dense fog on Thursday afternoon she ran on the Casquets , and foundered in 12 or 15 minutes . The exact loss of life is not yet known , but it is feared that the list of victims of this calamity may reach a hundred . The Stella was one of three steel twin-screw steamers built for the London and South - Western Company by Messrs . J. and G. Thomson ( Limited ) , of Glasgow , and delivered in 1890 , the companion ships being the Lydia and the Frederica . The design of all three was substantially the same , the gross register of each being 1,059 tons , and the principal dimensions as follows :- Length , 250.0 ft . ; breadth , 35.1 ft . ; depth , 14.8 ft . All were lighted throughout by electricity , and complied with the Board of Trade requirements as to life - saving appliances . In each case triple expansion engines were fitted , the average speed attained in service being 18 knots , and the three steamers have been extremely popular , the masters and officers being men who have had long acquaintance with the navigation of the English Channel . Although the precise number cannot at present be stated \u2014 owing to the fact that it is not the practice to book the names of passengers on such short services \u2014 it is believed that the Stella was carrying about 140 persons to the Channel Islands , the journey being the first daylight trip of the season . Captain Reeks , a skilled and trusted seaman , was in charge , and the crew numbered 40 all told . The steamer left Southampton at 11:45 on Thursday morning , no fewer than 110 of the passengers having travelled from Waterloo the same morning by special train . Fog was encountered in the Channel , and it increased to such an extent that , although the fog-horn attached to the lighthouse on the Casquets could be heard , the rocks were invisible . Speed was not , however reduced . The Casquets , well known to all travellers to the Channel Islands , form an isolated group of rocks which rise abruptly from the water , and constitute the mariner 's last warning mark on the journey from Guernsey to England , being situate about eight miles W. of Alderney and 23 miles N.E. of Guernsey . The highest point of the group is surmounted by a powerful flashing light visible in favourable weather 15 miles . At four o'clock in the afternoon , when it was supposed by the navigating officer that the Casquets were about eight miles to the east , the Casquets suddenly loomed out of the darkness , and immediately afterwards the Stella struck the rock amidships . No panic ensued , but the master saw that the steamer had run upon one of the sharp ridges of the shoal , and was fast sinking . He ordered the five lifeboats which hung suspended from the davits and the two Berthon collapsible boats secured on the shade deck to be got ready and launched with all possible speed . The instruction was promptly obeyed by the crew , but the Berthon boats took a little longer to get out than the others . Women and children were first put into the boats , Mr. Wade , the chief officer , seeing that the captain 's orders were carried out , the male passengers and crew following , Captain Reeks remaining all the time at his post on the bridge . The sea was calm , but there was , as usual , a big swirl on the rocks . It was impossible for all on board to leave the vessel before she slipped off the rock , and sank stern foremost in deep water , her boilers at the same moment exploding with terrific force . One of the survivors , who got away in the dinghy , states that from the moment of striking to the disappearance of the Stella barely ten minutes had elapsed , and none of the survivors puts the time at more than 15 minutes . The suction produced by the sinking ship was very great , and the crew of the dinghy momentarily feared that their craft would be engulfed . Five of the boats were soon lost to sight in the fog , but the sixth , filled with ladies , was taken in tow by the dinghy , the occupants of which used the oars in turn . They rowed on all night until most of them dropped asleep from exhaustion . A second boat , which was in charge of the chief officer , capsized , and almost all its occupants were drowned . A few , however , were picked up by the other boats , which were then laden to the water 's edge . Between five and six o'clock yesterday morning the Great Western Railway Company 's steamer , Lynx , on her journey from Weymouth to Guernsey , came upon the scene , and rendered assistance . She stopped and picked up two boat-loads of passengers , 35 in all , and conveyed them to Guernsey . Owing to the fog the incoming Great Western boat from Weymouth , due at St. Heliers , Jersey , at 8 o'clock on Thursday evening , did not arrive at that port until 1 o'clock yesterday morning . She , however , had heard nothing of the , disaster . The Dora , another South - Western packet , arrived at Jersey direct from Southampton about noon yesterday and reported having passed two other boats which had contained 35 passengers and nine of the crew . In addition to the South - Western Company 's steamer Honfleur , various Alderney boats received orders to proceed to the neighbourhood of the wreck . The South - Western Railway Company 's new steamer Vera , which left Southampton on Thursday at midnight , arrived at Guernsey at 9 o'clock yesterday morning with 40 more survivors , including 20 ladies , whom she had picked up near the scene of the wreck . In addition to those landed at Guernsey , some of the rescued were taken on to Jersey by other vessels , but it is calculated that not many more than 100 have been saved out of double that number on board . The disaster created the greatest excitement and consternation in the Channel Islands and in Southampton . Many Guernsey families have lost one or more of their members , and the South - Western Railway offices were yesterday besieged by anxious relatives and friends of those aboard the illfated steamer . Flags were at half - mast in St. Peter Port . The Honfleur last night returned to Guernsey from a search at the scene of the -wreck . The captain stated that the Stella must have sunk in 13 fathoms . He says he signalled the Casquets lighthouse \u2014 \u201d Have you seen or heard of a vessel wrecked ? \u201d and the reply came \u201c Yesterday afternoon heard steamer . \u201d The captain replied : \u2014 \u201c I shall stay about and see if I can pick up anything from wreck . \u201d The captain then made a complete circle of the Casquets , picking up several life belts , and two boats containing ladies ' wearing apparel , handbags , money , jewelry , opera glasses and case , the latter having been used for baling purposes . Mr. Spencer , the Guernsey manager of the South -Western Company , telegraphed early yesterday morning to Alderney requesting a boat to be sent to search for any survivors . This boat afterwards returned with nothing to report . Some very pathetic incidents are reported in connexion with the wreck . A lady . who had ; come over from Southampton with her husband and child to visit her father states that she and the child were pressed into a boat by the husband , who refused her entreaty to be allowed to stay with him , begging her to go for the sake of the children . He remained behind and . perished . The bereaved woman expresses her surprise and admiration at the calmness an courage displayed by every one on board . She noticed a lady friend of hers gathering up luggage and a little boy arranging his toys . These both perished immediately afterwards . Another lady has lost her husband and her only child , the husband having pressed her into a full boat , just missing it himself . Among the missing is a sister of one of the most popular clergymen on the island .

The problem , heretofore , with sunflower seeds was the difficulty of dehulling them at home , and the lack of a device for expressing oil from the seeds . About six months ago , we decided to change all that . The job was to find out who makes a sunflower seed dehuller or to devise one if none were manufactured . And to either locate a home - scale oilseed press or devise one . No mean task . Our researches took us from North Dakota -- hub of commercial sunflower activity in the nation -- to a search of the files in the U.S. Patent Office , with stops in between . We turned up a lot of big machinery , discovered how difficult it is to buy really pure , unrefined vegetable oils , but found no small - scale equipment to dehull sunflowers or press out their oil . The key to success , however , was on our desk the whole time . In spring 1977 , August Kormier had submitted a free - lance article describing how he used a Corona grain mill to dehull his sunflower seeds , and his vacuum cleaner exhaust hose to blow the hulls off the kernels . A second separation floated off the remaining hulls , leaving a clean product . We 'd tried it , but because some kernels were cracked and the process involved drying , we had n't been satisfied . Now we felt the best approach was to begin again with what we learned from Mr. Kormier and refine it . The key to success , however , was on our desk the whole time .

A second separation floated off the remaining hulls , leaving a clean product . We 'd tried it , but because some kernels were cracked and the process involved drying , we had n't been satisfied . Now we felt the best approach was to begin again with what we learned from Mr. Kormier and refine it . A pound of oilseed produced just under three ounces of oil . Staff Editor Diana Branch and Home Workplace Editor Jim Eldon worked with a number of hand - and electric- powered grain mills . While the Corona did a passable job , they got the best results with the C.S. Bell # 60 hand mill and the Marathon Uni Mill , which is motor-driven . \" I could n't believe my eyes the first time I tried the Marathon , \" Diana says . \" I opened the stones to 1/8th inch , and out came a bin full of whole kernels and hulls split right at the seams . What a thrill that was ! \" She found that by starting at the widest setting , and gradually narrowing the opening , almost every seed was dehulled . The stones crack the hulls open , then rub them to encourage the seed away from the fibrous lining . The Bell hand mill worked almost as well . \" As long as the stones open at least as wide as the widest unhulled seed , any mill will work , \" she says . Because the seed slips through the mill on its flat side , grading is an important step to take before dehulling . We made three sizing boxes . The first is 1/4-inch hardware cloth [ wire screen ] . The second is two layers of 1/4-inch cloth , moved slightly apart to narrow the opening in one direction , and the third is two layers of screen adjusted to make a still- smaller opening . Since the smallest unhulled seeds are about the size of the largest hulled kernels , the grading step prevents these undersized seeds from passing through unhulled . Processed together at a closer setting , the smallest seeds hulled out . A hardware cloth grader sizes the kernels for better hulling . Two layers of cloth , spaced slightly apart , narrow the hole for a second grading . The more grading , the better the hulling . Jim Eldon 's workshop is littered with strange - looking pieces of apparatus . They represent initial attempts to build a workable winnowing box , using Kormier 's vacuum exhaust idea for a source of air . Jim , Fred Matlack and Diana finally made a box with a Plexiglas front , through which they could observe what was happening . They cut a hole in the back of the box with a sliding cover to regulate the air pressure , and fiddled with various arrangements of baffles . The result was a stream of hulls exiting through one hole while the kernels fell to the bottom of the box . Now they were ready to try a five - pound sample of unhulled sunflower seeds to see how much they could recover . The five pounds were graded and dehulled , then winnowed . We got about one hull for every ten kernels in the final , winnowed product . These are easily picked out . They usually contain kernels still held behind the fibrous strings of the hull . Their weight prevents them from blowing out with the empty hulls . We found that bug -eaten seeds do blow away with the chaff , which was a bonus for cleanliness of the final product . Toss the hulls to the birds , who will find broken seeds among them . Starting with 80 ounces of unhulled seed , we ended up with 41 - 1/4 ounces of edible whole seeds , 1.8 ounces of damaged seeds suitable for animal feed , and 36.6 ounces of hulls . It took us about an hour . Not bad . Sunflower seeds store perfectly in the hulls , but they deteriorate more rapidly when shelled out . The grain mill dehuller and winnowing box give the gardener a way to have the freshest possible seeds for eating at all times of the year . With the construction of one more piece of equipment -- the oil press -- he can have absolutely fresh , unrefined , polyunsaturated sunflower oil for salads , mayonnaise and cooking . Most light , refined vegetable oils have been extracted using hexane , a form of naphtha . The oil is then heated to boil off the hexane . Lye is dumped into it . It 's washed with steam , then heated to remove odors and taste before being laced with preservatives and stabilizers . It may feel oily in the mouth , but you might as well taste air . No so with fresh - made sunflower oil -- it 's deliciously yet subtly nutty in flavor , adding unsurpassed flavor to salads .

No so with fresh - made sunflower oil -- it 's deliciously yet subtly nutty in flavor , adding unsurpassed flavor to salads . A little heat and the oil pours out of the pistonlike cylinder , then to be strained with a paint filter . There 's good reason to believe that sunflower oil may become the # 1 vegetable oil in the U.S. in a few years . It 's already # 1 in health - conscious Europe . Corn oil has already caught on here for health reasons , and sunflower oil is so much better . Sunflower oil 's 70 percent polyunsaturate is just under safflower , with corn oil bringing up the rear with 55 percent . And sunflowers yield 40 percent oil , soybeans only 20 percent . Our oil press is relatively simple , but it must be welded together . Check the construction directions for details . The press consists of a welded tubular frame which accepts a three - ton hydraulic jack . You may already have one . If not , it can be purchased at most auto and hardware stores for about $ 16 . A metal canister with holes drilled in its sides and one end welded shut holds the mashed sunflower seeds . A piston is inserted in the canister and then inverted and slipped over a pedestal on the frame . The jack is set in place , and the pressure gradually increased over half an hour . The oil drips from the sides of the canister into a tray -- the bottom of a plastic jug slipped over the pedestal works fine -- which empties the oil into a cup . You can filter the oil with a coffee filter to remove pieces of seed and other fine particles that would burn if the oil were used for cooking . If it 's for salads or mayonnaise , there 's no need to filter it . We first tried using \" confectionary \" sunflower seeds for oil . These are the regular eating kernels we 're used to seeing . They give less than half as much oil as the oilseed types of sunflower . Although you can use confectionary types such as MAMMOTH RUS - SIAN for oil , do n't expect to get more than an ounce and a half from a pound of seed . Oilseed produces three or more ounces of oil from a pound of seed and is well worth planting along with confectionary - type seeds . Oilseed has another big advantage -- to prepare it , you can put the whole , unhulled seed into a blender and whiz it until it forms a fine meal , while confectionary seeds must be dehulled first . The entire sequence of grading , dehulling and winnowing is avoided with oilseed . We first tried using \" confectionary \" sunflower seeds for oil .

The entire sequence of grading , dehulling and winnowing is avoided with oilseed . Two kinds of sunflower seeds -- oilseeds on the left , confectionary on the right . Oil types produce about a tenth of a pound of seed per head in commercial production . Gardeners , with their better soil and care , invariably do better than that . Our conservative estimate is that 1,280 plants will be enough for three gallons of oil . Spaced one foot apart in rows two feet apart , 1,280 oilseed plants will take a space 40 - by - 56 feet , or 80 - by - 28 if you want a more rectangular patch to face south . We worked in pound batches , since the canister just holds one pound of mash . After blending , we heated it to 170 degrees F. ( 77 deg C ) by placing it in a 300 - degree F. ( 149 deg C ) oven and stirring it every five minutes for 20 minutes . Heating gets the oil flowing and doubles the yield of oil . In case you 're wondering , \" cold - pressed \" oils sold commercially are also heated , and some are subjected to the entire chemical process . The term has no firm meaning within the industry , according to the literature we 've surveyed . Heating does not change the structure of fats . It will not turn polyunsaturated fats into saturated fats . In fact , Dr. Donald R. Germann in his book , \" The Anti-Cancer Diet \" , says that \" ... an unsaturated fat must be heated to high temperatures -- above 425 degrees F. or 200 degrees C. -- at least 8 or 10 times before any shift toward saturation occurs ... \" Dean C. Fletcher , Ph.D. , of the American Medical Association Department of Foods and Nutrition in Chicago , says , \" It 's true that either high temperature or repeated heating does change the nature of some of the unsaturated oil molecules . ( But ) the flavor of the oil changes as these chemical changes occur , spoiling its taste . This effect is probably more profound than any of the physiological changes the altered oil might produce within the body . \" From 500 gm. of heated mash , we pressed 89 gm . of oil , 89 percent of the entire amount available and twice as much as we could press from unheated oil ! The decision is up to you whether or not to heat the mash , but that extra 50 percent seems like an awful lot , especially when the whole technique is so labor intensive . The oil should be stored in the refrigerator , and it 's probably best to use it within a month , since it has no preservatives . Mayonnaise made with such fresh oils should be kept refrigerated and used within two weeks . The leftover cake , still containing 50 percent of its oil , is a nutritious addition to your dishes , and makes excellent feed for animals or winter birds . Store the pressed cake in the freezer . We 're talking then about a sunflower patch with two kinds of plants -- confectionary such as MAMMOTH RUSSIAN and oilseed such as PEREDOVIK . The oilseed plants should be grown 12 inches apart in rows two feet apart . Four average confectionary heads yield about a pound of unhulled seed . You 'll need about 35 pounds of unhulled seed , or 140 plants - worth , to yield 20 pounds of hulled kernels , about what a family of four will use in a year . That many plants can be grown in an area 26 - by - 10 feet . That 's 260 square feet . Put that together with the 2,240 square feet for the oilseed sunflowers , and you need a patch about 2,500 square feet -- 25 100 - foot rows -- to keep yourself supplied year - round with super nutrition and unsurpassable taste . The winnowing machine operates on the age - old principle of blowing the chaff away from the heavy grain with a controlled current of air . The unit uses a household or shop- type vacuum cleaner for its air supply . A vacuum cleaner was used as a power source because it can supply a large volume of air over an extended period of time , and most homes and farms have a vacuum cleaner . A cloth bag has been attached to the chaff chute to catch the chaff as it is separated from the seed . The bag allows the hulls to be collected and greatly reduces the amount of waste material normally blown into the air by conventional systems . The unit has been constructed in such a way that the cloth bag and cleaner box can be placed inside the seed box , making a compact package for storage . Tools Required 1 . Table Saw 2 .

The press was designed so that homesteaders can produce sunflower oil from their own seeds . The oil can be pressed as is or heated to 170 degrees F. , which doubles oil yield . Both methods require the seed to be ground to fine powder . If you are pressing the oil seed variety , a meat grinder or electric blender will do an excellent job of grinding the seed . The confectionary type of seed will require the seed to be hulled and winnowed before it is ground . A food mill with the stones set at the coarse setting can be used to accomplish this step . The ground kernels are placed in the cylinder with the piston closing the bottom portion of the cylinder . The cylinder is mounted in the press frame and a three - ton hydraulic jack is used to supply the pressure . Because of the great pressures created by the hydraulic jack , it is important that the frame be properly constructed and firmly mounted to the work surface before the pressing operation begins .

The solution , whose simplicity has stunned mathematicians , is already leading to advances in other combinatorics problems . Invented in 1974 , Set has a simple goal : to find special triples called \u201c sets \u201d within a deck of 81 cards . Each card displays a different design with four attributes \u2014 color ( which can be red , purple or green ) , shape ( oval , diamond or squiggle ) , shading ( solid , striped or outlined ) and number ( one , two or three copies of the shape ) . In typical play , 12 cards are placed face - up and the players search for a set : three cards whose designs , for each attribute , are either all the same or all different . Occasionally , there 's no set to be found among the 12 cards , so the players add three more cards . Even less frequently , there 's still no set to be found among the 15 cards . How big , one might wonder , is the largest collection of cards that contains no set ? The answer is 20 \u2014 proved in 1971 by the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Pellegrino . But for mathematicians , this answer was just the beginning . After all , there 's nothing special about having designs with only four attributes \u2014 that choice simply creates a manageable deck size . It 's easy to imagine cards with more attributes ( for instance , they could have additional images , or even play different sounds or have scratch - and - sniff smells ) . For every whole number n , there 's a version of Set with n attributes and 3n different cards . For each such version , we can consider collections of cards that contain no set \u2014 what mathematicians confusingly call \u201c cap sets \u201d \u2014 and ask how large they can be . Mathematicians have calculated the maximal size of cap sets for games with up to six attributes , but we 'll probably never know the exact size of the largest cap set for a game with 100 or 200 attributes , said Jordan Ellenberg , a mathematician at the University of Wisconsin , Madison \u2014 there are so many different collections of cards to consider that the computations are too mammoth ever to be carried out . Yet mathematicians can still try to figure out an upper bound on how big a cap set can be \u2014 a number of cards guaranteed to hold at least one set . This question is one of the simplest problems in the mathematical field called Ramsey theory , which studies how large a collection of objects can grow before patterns emerge . \u201c The cap set problem we think of as a model problem for all these other questions in Ramsey theory , \u201d said Terence Tao , a mathematician at the University of California , Los Angeles , and a winner of the Fields Medal , one of mathematics ' highest honors . \u201c It was always believed that progress would come there first , and then once we 'd sorted that out we would be able to make progress elsewhere . \u201d Yet until now , this progress has been slow . Mathematicians established in papers published in 1995 and 2012 that cap sets must be smaller than about 1/n the size of the full deck . Many mathematicians wondered , however , whether the true bound on cap set size might be much smaller than that . They were right to wonder . The new papers posted online this month showed that relative to the size of the deck , cap set size shrinks exponentially as n gets larger . In a game with 200 attributes , for instance , the previous best result limited cap set size to at most about 0.5 percent of the deck ; the new bound shows that cap sets are smaller than 0.0000043 percent of the deck . The previous results were \u201c already considered to be quite a big breakthrough , but this completely smashes the bounds that they achieved , \u201d said Timothy Gowers , a mathematician and Fields medalist at the University of Cambridge . There 's still room to improve the bound on cap sets , but in the near term , at least , any further progress is likely to be incremental , Gowers said . \u201c In a certain sense this completely finishes the problem . \u201d Game , Set , Match To find an upper bound on the size of cap sets , mathematicians translate the game into geometry . For the traditional Set game , each card can be encoded as a point with four coordinates , where each coordinate can take one of three values ( traditionally written as 0 , 1 and 2 ) . For instance , the card with two striped red ovals might correspond to the point ( 0 , 2 , 1 , 0 ) , where the 0 in the first spot tells us that the design is red , the 2 in the second spot tells us that the shape is oval , and so on . There are similar encodings for versions of Set with n attributes , in which the points have n coordinates instead of four . The rules of the Set game translate neatly into the geometry of the resulting n-dimensional space : Every line in the space contains exactly three points , and three points form a set precisely when they lie on the same line . A cap set , therefore , is a collection of points that contains no complete lines . Previous approaches to getting an upper bound on cap set size used a technique called Fourier analysis , which views the collection of points in a cap set as a combination of waves and looks for the directions in which the collection oscillates . \u201c The conventional wisdom was that this was the way to go , \u201d Tao said . Now , however , mathematicians have solved the cap set problem using an entirely different method \u2014 and in only a few pages of fairly elementary mathematics . \u201c One of the delightful aspects of the whole story to me is that I could just sit down , and in half an hour I had understood the proof , \u201d Gowers said . The proof uses the \u201c polynomial method , \u201d an innovation that , despite its simplicity , only rose to prominence on the mathematical scene about a decade ago . The approach produces \u201c beautiful short proofs , \u201d Tao said . It 's \u201c sort of magical . \u201d A polynomial is a mathematical expression built out of numbers and variables raised to powers \u2014 for instance , x2 + y2 or 3xy z3 + 2 . Given any collection of numbers , it 's possible to create a polynomial that evaluates to zero at all those numbers \u2014 for example , if you pick the numbers 2 and 3 , you can build the expression ( x \u2013 2 ) ( x \u2013 3 ) ; this multiplies out to the polynomial x2 \u2013 5 x + 6 , which equals zero if x = 2 or x = 3 . Something similar can be done to create polynomials that evaluate to zero at a collection of points \u2014 for instance , the points corresponding to Set cards . At first glance , this does n't seem like a very deep fact . Yet somehow , these polynomials often seem to contain information that is n't readily visible from the set of points . Mathematicians do n't fully understand , Ellenberg said , just why this approach works so well , and which types of problems it can be useful for . Until a few weeks ago , he added , he considered cap set \u201c an example of a problem where the polynomial method really has no purchase . \u201d That changed on May 5 , when three mathematicians \u2014 Ernie Croot of the Georgia Institute of Technology , Vsevolod Lev of the University of Haifa , Oranim , in Israel , and P\u00e9ter P\u00e1l Pach of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in Hungary \u2014 posted a paper online showing how to use the polynomial method to solve a closely related problem , in which each Set attribute can have four different options instead of three . For technical reasons , this problem is more tractable than the original Set problem . In this game variant , for any collection of cards with no set , Croot , Lev and Pach considered which additional cards could be laid down on the table to complete a set . They then built a polynomial that evaluates to zero on these completion cards , and figured out an ingeniously simple way to split the polynomial into pieces with smaller exponents , which led to a bound on the size of collections with no sets . It was a \u201c very inventive move , \u201d Ellenberg said . \u201c It 's always incredibly cool when there 's something truly new and it 's easy . \u201d The paper soon set off a cascade of what Ellenberg called \u201c math at Internet speed . \u201d Within 10 days , Ellenberg and Dion Gijswijt , a mathematician at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands , had each independently posted papers showing how to modify the argument to polish off the original cap set problem in just three pages . Yesterday , they posted a joint paper combining their results . The trick , Ellenberg said , is to realize that there are many different polynomials that evaluate to zero on a given set of points , and that choosing just the right one gets \u201c a little bit more juice out of the method . \u201d A cap set , the new proofs establish , can be at most ( 2.756/3 ) n as large as the whole deck . Mathematicians are now scrambling to figure out the implications of the new proof . Already , a paper has been posted online showing that the proof rules out one of the approaches mathematicians were using to try to create more efficient matrix multiplication algorithms . And on May 17 , Gil Kalai , of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , wrote an \u201c emergency \u201d blog post pointing out that the cap set result can be used to prove the \u201c Erd\u0151s - Szemer\u00e9di sunflower conjecture , \u201d which concerns sets that overlap in a sunflower pattern . \u201c I think a lot of people will be thinking , ' What can I do with this ? ' \u201d Gowers said . Croot , Lev and Pach 's approach , he wrote in a blog post , is \u201c a major new technique to add to the toolbox . \u201d The fact that the cap set problem finally yielded to such a simple technique is humbling , Ellenberg said . \u201c It makes you wonder what else is actually easy . \u201d This article was reprinted on Wired.com .","annotations":[{"text":"Ernie Croot","span":[7065,7075],"token_span":[1404,1405],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent finds the solution or explanation to the outstanding mystery or Problem."},{"text":"the Georgia Institute of Technology","span":[7080,7114],"token_span":[1407,1411],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role indicates the location at which the Problem is resolved."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Agent resolves an outstanding Problem by finding its solution, explanation, answer, etc.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-0364-9-frame-Response","frame":"Response","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"Reaction to officiating The officiating in Super Bowl XL was met with criticism from members of the media soon after the game .

Yep , the officiating stunk Sunday . Bill Leavy , former cop and firefighter , must have done a better job directing traffic and putting out whatever gameday fires were started by overzealous moms and dads during his days refereeing games in the San Jose PAL . But good luck finding anyone or anything that did n't stink in and around Super Bowl XL . Mike Holmgren stunk . Ben Roethlisberger stunk . Jerramy Stevens stunk . Mick Jagger stunk . The commercials stunk . So it stood to reason that the officiating crew would spend a largely forgettable evening in Detroit making that overturned Troy Polamalu interception in Indianapolis look like the call of the century . Zebras are human , after all . Sometimes they can watch a college basketball coach with a heart condition collapse face - first onto the court , be taken off on a stretcher while wearing an oxygen mask , and still assess Houston 's Tom Penders a technical foul . For , what , not having a better defibrillator implanted in his chest ? These are imperfect creatures , their live - action flaws measured against a zillion slow-motion truths . Fact is , officials , umps and refs are affected by the same variables that would affect you and your next - door neighbor if you were asked to spend a national holiday serving as on - site judge and jury before 68,206 spectators and 90.7 million of their closest friends watching from home . To wit : Ford Field might as well have been Heinz Field . Dan Rooney never saw so many Steelers fans in his five previous Super Bowls , and we all know what a home crowd can do to a mere mortal armed with a whistle and flag . It can turn him into Bob Waggoner , back judge , reaching awfully late into his pocket to wipe out a 7 - 0 Seahawks lead on a ticky - tack foul that should never get called in a high - stakes game . Was Waggoner influenced by the protesting Chris Hope ? By that raging yellow sea of Terrible Towels ? \" I 'm not in a position to comment at this time , unfortunately , \" Waggoner said Monday by phone . Only a fool would suggest that Waggoner , a Pittsburgh native , was scoring one for the home team . He was doing the best he could under pressure that ca n't be simulated by the three - hour psychological exam he passed to earn his NFL stripes . The pressure gets to the best of 'em . Holmgren lost track of the downs in his previous Super Bowl appearance , and ordered his defensive unit to let the Broncos score a late touchdown ( in order to get back the ball ) when he should 've ordered it to make a stand . This time around , Holmgren did a terrific job running out the clock at the close of the first and second halves despite the fact he was trailing at the time . How could a championship - caliber coach like Holmgren decline to kick a field goal in the game 's final seconds when his only chance amounted to a three - pointer , a recovered onside kick , a touchdown and a two -point conversion ? Good question , just like this one : How could the head of a Super Bowl crew tell the world that Matt Hasselbeck was guilty of an illegal block after he tackled the Steeler who had just intercepted his pass ? Like Holmgren , Leavy makes mistakes . Leavy and his crew made some big ones Sunday , all at Seattle 's expense . The lame holding call on Sean Locklear that negated a huge ( and rare ) Stevens catch might 've prevented Holmgren from becoming the first coach to win Super Bowls for different franchises . Then again , Holmgren might 've prevented Holmgren from becoming the first coach to win Super Bowls for different franchises , with an assist from Stevens , whose grip proved to be as loose as his lips . Leavy could 've helped matters earlier by overturning Roethlisberger 's non-touchdown . But once ABC showed that Leavy likes overturning calls as much as Polamalu likes trips to the barbershop , you knew the referee was n't really examining the replay anymore . He was actually studying a hidden - camera view of The Rolling Stones ' green room , looking for evidence of illegal motion . It 's time for Jagger to ride off on Jerome Bettis ' Bus , and for Madison Avenue to come up with something better than the ad showing a woman on an airline , landing in a stranger 's lap . ( Note to ad execs : If viewers recall the commercial but not the product the commercial promotes , try again . ) So in the end , the sideshows were as lousy as the players , coaches and refs , as lousy as the officiating has been throughout the playoffs .

Mr. Goodhart asked the Secretary of State for War how many soldiers are now serving sentences of imprisonment or detention in the military detention centre at Shepton Mallet ; and how many of these men will be released from the Army at the end of their sentence . \u00a7 Mr. Soames One hundred and fortyone , all of whom have been or will be discharged from the Army . \u00a7 Mr. Goodhart As all these men will be of no further use to the Army in any way , will my right hon . Friend the Secretary of State consider making strenuous efforts to close this prison and see that all prisoners who are sentenced to be dishonourably discharged in future serve their sentences in civilian prisons ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames There is a Question on the Order Paper on that specific point . \u00a7 4 . Mr. Goodhart asked the Secretary of State for War how many officers and non-commissioned officers are employed on the permanent staff at the military detention centre , Shepton Mallet . \u00a7 14 . Mr. Simmons asked the Secretary of State for War from what sources the Shepton Mallet military prison is staffed ; what are the qualifications of the staff ; and to what extent they are subject to inspection by independent outside bodies . \u00a7 Mr. Soames Apart from those employed in administration , the permanent staff consists of six officers , together with 47 warrant officers and N.C.O.s of the Military Provost Staff Corps and seven N.C.O.s of the Royal Air Force . Members of the Corps are all volunteers from other arms of the Service . They are selected for qualities of authority and leadership ; and they have to succeed at an intensive course of training . Inspection is undertaken by military authorities , and there are visits by members of the Prison Commission whose help and advice we welcome . \u00a7 Mr. Goodhart Is my right hon . Friend aware that I recently visited this prison and met many of the staff who are doing a very difficult job in very depressing surround ings ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames I am indeed aware that my hon . Friend visited the prison and I am most grateful to him for the report that he wrote upon his visit . I am glad to hear his confirmation of how he thinks the prison is run . \u00a7 Mr. Simmons Would the Minister assert that the staff of this prison are not strong - arm men , because the photographs in the Press of some of them were not exactly reassuring ? Has the right hon . Gentleman said in his reply that the usual visits which are made to civilian prisons by the prison visitors are also made to Shepton Mallet ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames The staff of the prison are certainly not strong - arm men in the sense in which the hon . Member refers , but they are also not weak - arm men . \u00a7 Mr. Strachey Would not the Minister agree that there is a great deal of evidence \u2014 probably through no fault of the staff there \u2014 that the conditions in the prison are an anachronism , to say the least of it ? Is the right hon . Gentleman not going to tell us what his longer - term policy is , whether it is to abolish this prison physically altogether , and , if so , whether we are to have another military prison or are to rely entirely on civilian prisons ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames There are a number of Questions on the Order Paper , and that is one of them . \u00a7 10 . Mr. Nabarro asked the Secretary of State for War whether he will make a statement upon the prison break by thirteen soldiers at Shepton Mallet , Samerset ; what modernisation has been carried out to this prison since it was built in Napoleonic times ; whether he is aware that the prison buildings were condemned for use as a civil prison nearly forty years ago ; what steps he has taken to establish the causes of the prison break referred to and the legitimacy of grievances expressed by the prisoners and others ; and what further steps he now proposes to take in the matter . \u00a7 Mr. Soames The prison at Shepton Mallet was leased to the Army by the 370 Home Office in 1939 . Since it came into our hands we have improved the heating , lighting , water and drainage systems . Various other works services have also been carried out . The causes of the recent outbreak were at once investigated and a board of inquiry was set up . I can make no statement about the results of our inquiries or about the court - martial for mutiny until the findings have been confirmed and the time allowed for appeal has expired . \u00a7 Mr. Nabarro Without condoning in any way the mutinous conduct of this soldiery at Shepton Mallet , may I ask my right hon . Friend if he would not agree that it is quite reprehensible that these buildings , which were condemned forty years ago for use as a civil prison , should now be kept in use as a military prison ? Will he take early steps to endeavour to destroy this glasshouse and remove the prisoners to more amenable and humane surroundings ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames This is a very old prison . We took it over on lease from the Home Office in 1939 . We have made certain improvements to bring it into line with modern standards . There is nothing that could be done short of razing it to the ground and building it again as a modern prison , but a lot of prisons , unfortunately , are very old . The lease runs out in 1960 and we shall have to find other accommodation when we hand Shepton Mallet back to the Home Office . Shortly after that , we shall have to find other accommodation for the prisoners . \u00a7 Mr. Emrys Hughes Is it not true that , in addition to improvements , the place has recently been white - washed ? Is the Minister going to do it again ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames It is kept as clean as possible . \u00a7 Mr. Strachey Would not the Secretary of State agree that there are two questions here ? One is on the subject of the sentences , and surely we may hope that before confirmation there will be some reduction in the sentences . Secondly , there are the conditions in the prison . There has been a great deal of evidence furnished in the public Press that they are profoundly unsatisfactory . Cannot the Minister give some assurance that in one way or another , either by the use of 371 civil prisons or by building another military prison , the use of this prison will be discontinued ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames The right hon . Member has raised two points . One is that of using civil prisons . At the moment we send all prisoners with terms of more than two years imprisonment to Home Office civil prisons , but , owing to the overcrowding of those prisons , the Home Office cannot take prisoners who are going to be discharged from the Army and are serving less than two years . Shepton Mallet is the only place available to us . The lease is running out and the premises will be handed back to the Home Office . In the meantime , we shall have to find other accommodation . \u00a7 Lieut . - Commander Maydon Is my right hon . Friend aware that those who live in the district and know about the running of these detention barracks recognise that the present commandant and his staff have done a great deal to improve the conditions and discipline in this prison in the face of most difficult material conditions in an old building ? Is it common practice in detention barracks to allow the prisoners to watch television provided out of staff amenity funds ? \u00a7 Mr. G. Brown That is too severe a punishment . \u00a7 Mr. Soames I am grateful to my hon . and gallant Friend for the first part of his supplementary question , with which I entirely agree . I am afraid I should need notice before answering the second part . \u00a7 Mrs. Braddock When the Minister is inquiring into the whole of this matter , will he make inquiries as to whether any complaints were made by the men before and whether there was any question that letters of complaint were stopped from being sent out by the men concerned ? If that had been attended to , this difficulty might not have arisen , as people would have had an opportunity of knowing what happened inside . \u00a7 Mr. Soames There has been a full board of inquiry , but I shall , of course , take note of what the hon . Lady has said . \u00a7 12 and 13 . Mr. Simmons asked the Secretary of State for War ( 1 ) what changes have been made in the structure , amenities , discipline , and routine at the Shepton Mallet prison since it was taken over as a military prison ; 372 ( 2 ) in what way the amenities , discipline and routine applying to Shepton Mallet military prison differ from those applying at other military detention centres . \u00a7 18 . Mr. Emrys Hughes asked the Secretary of State for War if he is aware that the military prison at Shepton Mallet is run purely as a punishment establishment for soldiers , that many of the soldiers sent there have ceased to be of use to Her Majesty 's Forces , and that the routine of the prison is not up to the standard demanded by civil prisons ; and if he will order an inquiry . \u00a7 19 . Mr. Chetwynd asked the Secretary of State for War why soldiers who are dismissed from the Army and sentenced to imprisonment serve their sentences in a military rather than a civil prison . \u00a7 Mr. Soames In the United Kingdom there is one military prison , at Shepton Mallet , and one Corrective Training Centre at Colchester . Convicted soldiers who are to stay in the Army undergo detention at Colchester where the routine and training are designed to prepare them for return to their units . Soldiers who are to be discharged , including all those sentenced to terms of up to two years ' imprisonment , go to Shepton Mallet where they learn civilian trades and live in conditions very similar to those of a civil prison . Terms of imprisonment over two years are served in civil prisons , but by keeping Shepton Mallet in being we avoid adding the whole burden of military offenders to the responsibilities of the Prison Commission . During recent years , increasing emphasis has been placed on the process of rehabilitation for a return to civil life . A scheme was introduced in 1955 whereby prisoners earn small sums of money for the work they do . Professional instructors are employed for trade training , and welfare officers co-operate with the labour exchanges in finding work for the men discharged . I dealt with the subject of improvements to accommodation in reply to an earlier Question . \u00a7 Mr. Simmons Is it not true that until recently the prison was used by the United States Army ? Are any of the American practices still carried out at present , or has it reverted to the British Army because , as I understand , some of the practices are un - British in their application ? 373 Does not the Minister think that the demeanour of the staff and the conditions of the prison itself were contributory factors to the trouble there , and should not something be done before these men are severely punished by taking into consideration the horrible , intolerable and rotten conditions under which they were housed in the Shepton Mallet hellhole ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames I certainly could not comment now on what the hon . Gentleman thinks may or may not have been contributory factors in a matter which is still sub judice . \u00a7 Mr. Hughes Can the Minister say if he has ever seen this place himself ? Is he aware that the Church of Scotland chaplain , who acted as chaplain for three years , has recently said that this place was a blot on the Army and a blot on the conscience of this country , that the conditions are so bad that prisoners are prepared to commit other crimes and get additional sentences in order to be sent to another prison , that the food is abominable , and that all human dignity is destroyed in this prison within a very short time ? Is the right hon . Gentleman prepared to say that this chaplain , who is a very respected member of the Church of Scotland , is not telling the truth ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames It is not a question of telling the truth . He was giving his own impression . I am not denying that this is a very old prison , which , from the point of view of the buildings , leaves a great deal to he desired . Where rations are concerned , the men draw prison rations , the same as those drawn in civil prisons . \u00a7 Mr. Chetwynd Can the Minister say at which stage a man becomes a civilian \u2014 at the beginning of his sentence or at the end ? Can he also say if there have been any requests from any of the prisoners to be transferred to local prisons so that they may have visits from their relatives ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames The discharge happens at some time during the course of their imprisonment , but military law provides that , even after a man has been discharged , he still remains under military law during the period of his sentence . As to applications for transfers to other prisons , I could not answer that without notice . \u00a7 Mr. Strachey Since it is not denied that this prison is quite unsuitable and out - of - date , what is the objection to announcing that a new prison will be built or acquired , which is surely what we want ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames I have told the right hon . Gentleman that by the early 1960s we shall have to leave this prison . We have given an assurance to the Home Office , but there is a shortage of prison accommodation throughout the whole country . \u00a7 Mr. G. Brown Is there no \" stately home \" that might be acquired in the meantime ? \u00a7 20 . Mrs. Cullen asked the Secretary of State for War the total weekly cost of running the military detention prison at Shepton Mallet ; and the cost per head , per week , of keeping a prisoner there . \u00a7 Mr. Soames The approximate figures are \u00a3 2,300 and \u00a3 11 respectively . \u00a7 Mrs. Cullen Does not the Secretary of State agree that this money could have been better spent in many ways ? If we take various reports , including the report of the minister from Argyll , do they not indicate that it is time that this place was closed down and demolished ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames The hon . Lady says that the money could have been spent in better ways , but we must have a prison .","annotations":[{"text":"sentenced to be dishonourably discharged in future","span":[593,642],"token_span":[117,123],"role":"Reason","label":"Reason","role_definition":"Typically, there is a constituent expressing the Reason for the Agent's judgment.

So trowels flew after the British government \u2014 heeding environmental concerns \u2014 announced plans to gradually eliminate peat from all gardening products , setting off an intense battle over how to prioritize two of this country 's defining passions : indulging the yard and protecting the planet . A blog about energy and the environment . Andrew Testa for The New York Times While many gardeners regard the partially decomposed plant matter known as peat as an almost magical elixir , environmentalists say using it is problematic because it is scraped off the tops of centuries - old bogs , which are vital ecosystems that also serve as natural stores of carbon , just like rain forests . The celebrity gardener Bob Flowerdew was shocked by the violent reaction when he said he would defy the government and continue to use peat to nurture finicky plants like azaleas . \u201c The hate mail was quite frightening \u2014 in some circles I 've become an outcast , \u201d said Mr. Flowerdew , a longtime panelist on the BBC 's \u201c Gardeners ' Question Time \u201d radio program , and a favorite speaker at women 's clubs . The debate between the gardening industry and environmentalists grew so acerbic that the government appointed an emergency peat task force after the phaseout plan was announced last year , which delivered a first report this summer . \u201c What I 've done is to try to unblock an impasse \u2014 to find a sensible midpoint where everyone agrees , \u201d said Alan Knight , the task force chairman and an expert in sustainability . \u201c We needed a road map of how to get to zero peat . \u201d But some gardeners and gardening companies say they simply cannot do without peat , a spongy natural concoction of water , air and acidity , for nurturing certain seeds and plants . \u201c If you love your garden , you really ca n't just abstain , \u201d said Mr. Flowerdew , surrounded in his greenhouse by bags of peat-free alternatives he has tried . Behind this uniquely British drama is a serious global environmental issue , one largely ignored in the United States and most of Europe , where bagged soils with a high percentage of peat are widely used in potting and sprinkled willy - nilly on gardens and parks as compost or to condition soil . Peat use is already beginning to decrease in Britain , where horticulture is a billion - dollar business and companies are creating reduced - peat soils in response to the government 's call . But greater awareness is needed , experts say . \u201c People walk over peat lands , but they 're not aware of how important they are from a climate - change point of view , \u201d said Ian Crosher , a scientist with Natural England , which advises the government on the environment , and supports a ban . \u201c Peat bogs have far greater capacity to store CO2 than rain forests . Peat bogs are England 's rain forests . \u201d Disrupting a peat bog releases some of the emissions it holds . Bogs are also a precious natural habitat in Britain , favored by hikers and some threatened birds . Many British bogs are seriously degraded because they have been drained to take out gardening material or to make way for development . And because even a healthy bog adds less than half an inch in a century , they are not renewable from a practical standpoint . While gardening companies refer to \u201c harvesting \u201d peat , with the implication that it will return next year , environmental opponents refer to the process as \u201c mining . \u201d \u201c It 's a bit like coal , \u201d Mr. Crosher said . At current rates of removal , Dr. Knight said , Britain could run out of peat in just a few decades . He added that horticultural businesses should adjust to new concerns about global warming , as others have . \u201c There 's not a single sector that is n't facing massive changes . Think of Richard Branson , who has to change the fuel in his planes because of carbon emissions , \u201d Dr. Knight said , referring to the British airline magnate . \u201c There are a lot of people who have far bigger challenges . \u201d In England , peat is obtained partly from domestic bogs but mainly from Ireland , where it is still burned to heat some rural homes , as it has been for centuries . Canada supplies most of the peat sold in the United States . Gardening companies contend that peat is so abundant globally that they can harvest it sustainably , although they are working to develop alternatives . It is far easier to take peat from bogs than to manufacture compost from other decaying material like timber industry waste , and peat is much lighter and less expensive to ship . The government timetable calls for an end to peat use in British public parks and gardens by 2015 , in backyard gardening by 2020 and in commercial plant growing by 2030 . The British National Trust has already stopped using peat on its lands , as have many gardening experts who support the ban . Most gardening companies are producing reduced - peat and peat-free alternative soils , although most customers do not yet ask for them , said Andy Bailey , the horticulture manager at Blooms of Bressingham , a retail gardening center near here . Brenda Chase , who was buying a pair of orchids at Blooms on a rainy Monday , said she would continue to use peat as long as it was available . One of Britain 's largest home improvement and gardening chains , B&Q , drew the ire of environmentalists this year for introducing a topsoil containing 37 percent peat , even though it has supported the planned phaseout . The company declined to comment . Acknowledging that current peat -free products vary widely in quality , the government is developing new industry standards to encourage more gardeners to switch . Although Mr. Flowerdew acknowledged that most hobbyists would do fine without peat , he maintained that it was irreplaceable for cultivating certain hard - to - grow plants and for getting seeds to sprout . Rather than ban peat , he suggested , its trade should be regulated and taxed to make sure it is used judiciously . He worried that a ban could cause the British horticulture industry to lose out to growers in the Netherlands or Italy who would continue to use peat because it works so well . And if peat is no longer legal in Britain , he said , \u201c I'll be buying on the black market , going up to a farmer and saying , ' Psst , can you sell me some ?

Despite the sinuous , seductive theme , the interpretation is volcanic , from Moutin 's aggressive introductory solo to Reid 's crackling bursts and both euphorically building sax solos . Writing credits are split evenly between the two leaders , with Mahanthappa employing his trademark blend of rhythmic complexity and South Indian harmonic inspirations . Green 's tunes are , perhaps necessarily , closer to the jazz mainstream : ' Rainer and Theresia ' is a melancholy waltz with a noir tinge , while ' Lamenting ' is an aching ballad dominated by a starkly romantic Moran solo . ' Little Girl Ill Miss You ' , on which Mahanthappa is absent , contains the disc 's most singable melody , a standard that never was . \u201d \u2013 Shaun Brady , JazzTimes \u201c Born 36 years apart , the saxophonists Mr. Mahanthappa and the elder Mr. Green , an educator as well as a player , come from different corners of improvised jazz . They found their way to each other circuitously , and it seems as if they were meant to put a band together , sharing their rapid , searching , wide - interval saxophone language . \u201d \u2013 Ben Ratliff , The New York Times Fall Arts Preview \u201c \u2026 a rigorous , contemporary statement . \u201d \u2013 Peter Margasak , Chicago Reader Apex is a blazing collaboration between alto saxophonists Rudresh Mahanthappa and Bunky Green that puts on display a fifty - year continuum of state - of - the - art saxophone playing . Featuring the all - star band of Jason Moran on piano , Fran\u00e7ois Moutin on bass and switching off on drums , the dynamic Damion Reid and the legendary Jack DeJohnette , Apex shines a much -deserved spotlight on Bunky Green , a hugely influential but under-recognized original in jazz . As Mahanthappa tells it , \u201c I first heard about Bunky from the late great saxophone teacher Joe Viola when I was a student at Berklee in the early 90s . Joe heard me warming up once and recommended that I check Bunky out as he thought that my approach was on track to being something similar to his . He loaned me Bunky 's record Places We 've Never Been ( Vanguard ) which totally knocked me out ! \u201d Mahanthappa sought Green out and sent him a tape of his playing to which Green responded by providing some encouraging feedback , leading to a long friendship . Still , the two never got a chance to play together until 2008 during a jam session at the Jazz Baltica Festival . Inspired by that performance , Mahanthappa featured Green in his appearance at the 2009 Made In Chicago Festival . Soon thereafter , Rudresh made plans to record with Bunky , enlisting his regular bassist Fran\u00e7ois Moutin and the dynamic young drummer Damion Reid . Jason Moran , who had played on Green 's CD Another Place ( Label Bleu ) , also quickly signed on . The lineup was set when Mahanthappa told Jack DeJohnette in whose band Rudresh plays about the recording . DeJohnette , who had been a huge fan of Bunky 's from back when he was a young drummer coming up in Chicago , also clamored to play on the session . One can immediately see why Mahanthappa was drawn to Green 's playing : The two share a similar biting tone , harmonic sophistication , a well - articulated rapid fire attack , and a certain rhythmic elasticity . Perhaps whats most amazing about Green is that such modern playing is coming from a 75 year old . The album features originals by both Mahanthappa and Green specifically created for this collaboration . The compositions highlight a collective vision of using traditional forms as a launching point for contemporary improvisation and interaction at its highest level . On Apex , Bunky Green and Rudresh Mahanthappa look back over the last fifty years of jazz saxophone playing and together chart its course into the future .","annotations":[{"text":"Rudresh Mahanthappa","span":[2340,2358],"token_span":[448,449],"role":"Cognizer_agent","label":"Cognizer_agent","role_definition":"The person who attempts to find the Sought_entity."},{"text":"Bunky Green","span":[2364,2374],"token_span":[451,452],"role":"Sought_entity","label":"Sought_entity","role_definition":"This is the entity that the Ground may contain.

Sensitive intelligence information shows that the Chinese Embassy on Connecticut Avenue NW here was used for planning contributions to the DNC , the sources said . Some information was obtained through electronic eavesdropping conducted by federal agencies . The information gives the Justice Department inquiry what is known as a foreign counterintelligence component , elevating the seriousness of the fund - raising controversy , according to some officials . The sources declined to provide details about the scope of the evidence relating to the alleged efforts by the Chinese representatives . They also declined to specify what foreign contributions might have been involved , but they said the new evidence now being scrutinized in the inquiry is serious . A Chinese Embassy spokesman denied yesterday that his government had anything to do with improper efforts to influence the administration . \" We have done nothing of that sort , \" the spokesman said . White House press secretary Michael McCurry said yesterday that \" to the best of my knowledge , no one here had any knowledge of \" the allegations concerning the Chinese . He said the White House would have no further comment . The evidence relating to the Chinese government led Justice Department lawyers and FBI executives to increase the number of FBI special agents working on a special investigative task force from a handful to 25 , including several specialists in foreign counterintelligence investigations , sources said . Laura Ingersoll , a Justice Department attorney assigned a leading role on the fund - raising task force , has security clearances to investigate a variety of sensitive intelligence matters , officials said . The new dimension to the fund - raising investigation could result in Attorney General Janet Reno eventually recommending that the matter be turned over to an independent counsel , according to one well - placed source . Reno so far has declined requests for an independent counsel , saying that the Justice Department task force can conduct a full and independent inquiry and that there is no specific and credible allegation of wrongdoing against any of the senior executive branch officials covered by the Independent Counsel Act . Such a finding would have to be made by the Justice Department task force before Reno could recommend appointment of an independent counsel . Washington and Beijing have been at odds over human rights and trade issues , but the Clinton White House has been seeking recently to improve relations . Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright is traveling to Beijing later this month , and President Clinton announced in his State of the Union message that he also would visit . He has extended an invitation to Chinese President Jiang Zemin to come to Washington . The Chinese effort to win influence with the Clinton administration can be traced to 1993 , one source said . During the Reagan and Bush administrations , the Chinese government felt comfortable dealing with Washington . During the 1992 presidential campaign , authorities in Beijing spoke openly about wanting Bush to win reelection because he was an \" old friend \" of China . Clinton had criticized the Bush administration during the campaign for \" coddling \" Beijing and giving China most-favored - nation trade status after the 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square . After Clinton defeated Bush , Chinese officials were uncertain about how to deal with the new administration , officials said , even though as president , Clinton essentially adopted the Bush policy toward Beijing . The Chinese Foreign Ministry has long urged the leadership in Beijing to increase its lobbying efforts in Washington , arguing that China has lagged behind Taiwan and Israel in trying to influence U.S. policy . Some investigators suspected a Chinese connection to the current fund - raising scandal because several DNC contributors and major fund - raisers had ties to Beijing . Last February , Charles Yah Lin Trie , a fund - raiser for the Democratic National Committee , used his influence with party officials to bring Wang Jun , head of a weapons trading company owned by the Chinese military , to a White House coffee with Clinton . Wang also heads a prominent , state - owned investment conglomerate . Clinton has since said he should not have met with Wang , and $ 640,000 in checks that Trie delivered to president 's legal defense fund has been returned because of questions about the source of the funds . Another reason investigators suspected a Chinese connection was the role of John Huang , a former Commerce Department official and DNC fund - raiser now at the center of the campaign controversy . An American citizen born in China and raised in Taiwan , Huang has said he now has no friends or relatives in China . But Huang is a former executive of the Lippo Group , a highly profitable Indonesian conglomerate owned by the Riady family , who are ethnic Chinese . Lippo has extensive interests in China , including approval to build a power plant in Fujian Province , Huang 's place of birth . In 1993 , Lippo sold 50 percent of its holdings in one of its banks , Hong Kong Chinese Bank where Huang was a vice president in the mid-1980s to a corporation run by the Chinese government . Huang was not the only Lippo executive to get a job with the Clinton administration . In December 1994 , U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor named Lippo 's president of securities , Charles De Queljoe , to the Investment and Services Advisory Committee . Huang had sought jobs at the State Department and the National Security Council staff for De Queljoe , a big Democratic giver , in an early 1993 letter to the White House . Last month , Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon ( R-N.Y. ) , chairman of the House Rules Committee , asked FBI Director Louis J. Freeh to investigate Huang and the Lippo Group , with an eye to \" potential economic espionage against the United States by a foreign corporation having direct ties to the People 's Republic of China . \" Solomon said then that he was concerned about Huang 's access to intelligence information and dozens of calls Huang made from Commerce to the Lippo Group . He also asked Freeh to investigate apparent discrepancies in the birth date listed on Huang 's visa application forms and his government employment forms . Huang was employed at Lippo for nine years before he joined the Commerce Department as deputy assistant secretary for international economic policy . His severance package from Lippo totaled $ 788,750 . Huang was given a top-secret clearance at Commerce after what Republicans have called a lax background investigation . Despite Huang 's extensive ties to Lippo , the background investigation was limited to his activities in the United States because he had lived here for more than five years . Commerce officials now say they wish a foreign background check had been done , even though it was not required . In preparation for his job at Commerce , Huang received an interim security clearance while he was still working at Lippo . But Commerce Department officials said that did not entitle him to see any classified information , and they maintain he saw none . Because of a bureaucratic error , the officials said , Huang retained his top-secret clearance after he left the Commerce Department to become a DNC vice chairman in December 1995 . During his 18 months at Commerce , Huang was scheduled to attend 37 intelligence briefings , including briefings on China , and saw more than two dozen intelligence reports . From his Commerce Department office , Huang made more than 70 phone calls to a Lippo-controlled bank in Los Angeles . The calls are now being scrutinized by the Justice Department task force . Huang 's message slips from the Commerce Department also show a call from one Chinese Embassy official in February 1995 and three calls from the embassy 's commercial minister in June and August of that year . According to Huang 's Commerce Department desk calendar entries , obtained by The Washington Post , he had three meetings scheduled with Chinese government officials . He was slated to go on a U.S. government - sponsored trip to China in June 1995 that was canceled . He attended a policy breakfast at the Chinese Embassy in October 1995 and a dinner there the same month , his calendar shows . One of the many unexplained records from Huang 's files shows an unusual travel pattern in the fall of 1995 . His expense account records show he left his Commerce Department office to visit the Indonesian Embassy on Massachusetts Avenue NW on Oct. 11 , claiming a $ 5 reimbursement for taxicab fare .

We 're not done yet ! Your opinion can help us make it better . After the ruling Social Democrats hit the news with inner-party fighting , the conservative Christian Democrat Union follows suit with its own wrangle over a reform plan put forth by the party 's Herzog Commission . Looking for the right dosage to cure Germany 's sickly health system . Last week the subject was inner-party fighting in Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der 's Social Democrat Party over reforms the German leader has been pushing for as part of his comprehensive \" Agenda 2010 \" package , which seeks to streamline the country 's behemoth social system in order to revive the sluggish economy . This week , the SPD wrangling , although still of interest considering the question of the party 's ability to secure a parliamentary majority in key October votes , is taking a backseat to the opposition 's own internal dispute over its reform proposals . The conservative Christian Democrat Union and its smaller Bavarian sister party , the Christian Social Union , have been busy drawing up their answer to Schr\u00f6der 's reform platform , one they claim will be socially just and economically viable . And just as the SPD assigned the task of drafting new proposals to several extra-parliamentarian committees , the CDU gave the job to CDU member and former German President Roman Herzog . On Monday evening , party leaders approved the Herzog Commission 's package of reform proposals which recommend , among other things , decoupling health and nursing care premiums from people 's earnings and levying a lump monthly sum across the board instead . CDU party leader Angela Merkel embraced the plans , calling them a \" paradigm shift \" and said they presented a \" most important switch for Christian Democratic politics . \" A violation of party principles ? But not everyone in the party is enthralled with the Herzog plan , and as is the case in the SPD with Agenda 2010 , several members are balking at what they consider a violation of the CDU 's core social values . Both high - ranking party members and CDU rank and file have criticized the proposals for placing the boss and the janitor on the same level and making both pay the same lump sum of \u20ac 264 for health insurance plus another \u20ac 60 to cover nursing care costs . CDU deputy leader Norbert Bl\u00fcm , a former labor minister under Chancellor Helmut Kohl , said the plan was socially unbalanced and would hurt common people while letting the more affluent off the hook . Bl\u00fcm warned on Monday that the Herzog proposals would turn the party into a neo-liberal party unattractive to most German voters . But Merkel quickly retorted : \" Whoever claims that the proposals are socially unbalanced and in stark contrast to core Christian Democrat values will be asked to come up with whatever they think may be better . I have n't seen any reasonable alternatives as yet . \" Stealing from the poor ? Another staunch critic of the reform plans , the head of the CDU employees ' association , Hermann - Josef Arentz , has already announced he 'll fight the Herzog suggestions tooth and nail , secure in the knowledge that he has much of the party behind him . \" The bottom line of these proposals is that people with low incomes will face a bigger burden as they will have to pay the same premiums as those with higher incomes , \" Arentz explained on Tuesday at the start of CDU regional conferences focused on gearing up support for the reforms . \" The Herzog Committee itself reckons that about \u20ac 40 billion in tax refunds will be needed to compensate the not-so- well - off in order to be able to call the scheme socially balanced . That 's about 20 percent of all taxes the state has at its disposal , \" Arentz said explaining his doubts about the feasibility of the reforms . Making matters even worse for the CDU leadership , it 's CSU sister party has also come out strongly against the Herzog plan . CSU : plan ' unjust ' On Wednesday Edmund Stoiber , Bavarian premier and last year 's chancellor candidate for the Union block , criticized the plans as \" unjust . \" Although he said the CSU was generally willing to compromise with the CDU on the much-needed structural reforms , he was insistent that the parties \" remain by their central philosophy , that people with higher incomes should pay more than those with lower incomes . \" He also criticized the Herzog proposal to raise the retirement age to 67 . On Nov. 17 , Stoiber will present his party 's plans for reforming Germany 's pension system . The split between the two conservative parties comes just two weeks after Stoiber and the CSU reached an all - time record high in state parliamentary elections . Many analysts believe that the willingness of the CSU to take a separate stance to the larger CDU has been strengthened by the surge in popularity in Bavaria . But when questioned about the difference in opinion between CDU and CSU , Stoiber replied , matter of factly : \" In the end we 'll find an agreement . That 's the way it 's always been . \" German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der has a party discipline problem . A handful of left-wing Social Democrats could scuttle key welfare and economic reforms , upon which he has staked his political future ( Sept. 29 , 2003 ) .","annotations":[{"text":"On Monday evening","span":[1402,1418],"token_span":[245,247],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time when the separation occurs."},{"text":"the Herzog Commission 's package of reform proposals","span":[1445,1496],"token_span":[252,259],"role":"Cause","label":"Cause","role_definition":"The Cause is the non-agent that brings about the separation."},{"text":"health and nursing care premiums","span":[1548,1579],"token_span":[268,272],"role":"Part_1","label":"Part_1","role_definition":"Part-1 is the first of two Parts mentioned.

Ken Richardson , 61 , showed no emotion as Judge Peter Baker QC sentenced him . Richardson , of Douglas , Isle of Man , presented \" a sorry figure in the dock \" , said the judge , but he exercised great influence on the club and \" used money to set in train serious crime \" . Richardson was convicted of conspiracy to commit arson after a two - week trial in January . Sheffield Crown Court was told that the wealthy businessman offered pounds 10,000 to a former SAS soldier to start the fire in 1995 at the club 's Belle Vue ground , causing damage put at pounds 100,000 . The prosecution said Richardson 's intention was to try to force Rovers to move to a new stadium . The plan failed when Alan Kristiansen , who was hired to start the fire , left his mobile phone at the scene and was quickly traced and arrested . Gilbert Gray QC , Richardson 's barrister , said the five weeks his client had spent in jail since conviction had seriously affected his mental and physical health . He said : \" He is a mere shadow of his former self . \" Mr Gray said Richardson wanted the best for Doncaster Rovers . \" Was this a greedy man seeking to make a huge killing out of insurance ? The answer is no , \" he said . \" What it could have achieved was a move for the club . \" In 1984 Richardson was given a nine- month suspended sentence and fined pounds 20,000 for his part in a racing scandal known as the Flockton Grey affair . At an earlier hearing Kristiansen , 41 , of Newcastle , pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit arson . He was jailed yesterday for 12 months . Two other men who helped him to start the fire - Ian Hay , 54 , from Gateshead , and Alan Cracknall , 32 of Ryton , Newcastle - pleaded guilty to arson . Both were sentenced to nine months , suspended for two years . The judge said he was considering ordering Richardson to pay costs of pounds 75,000 .

Centred around the usual Woolworths and Big W stores , Brickworks Marketplace will not shock first time visitors with too many unexpected revelations . If you 're already familiar with shopping malls such as Castle Plaza then you will quickly grasp the concept of Brickworks Marketplace . However there are still some pleasant surprises . The Entrance to Brickworks Marketplace This huge new redevelopment of the former Brickworks Markets had a turbulent and tumultuous conception . The mum and dad traders who had occupied the Brickworks Markets for decades were unsurprisingly unhappy when the West Torrens Council gave them the boot . As they were all small traders , most had pinned their hopes for a sound financial future on their shops . Sadly the former traders at the Brickworks were misguided in their hopes , and they are probably all collecting our tax dollars for their troubles . Woolworths wanted their land . The West Torrens Council wanted more money . And even many customers of the old Brickworks Markets thought that it was time - worn and lacking in interesting product , so the quirky markets were despatched to the dustbin of history . The Original Brickworks Markets before Demolition The new Brickworks Marketplace opened on June 25 2015 , to some fanfare . All the usual politicans were there including Treasurer \" Turbo \" Tom Koutsantonis who suddenly developed a startled rabbit - in- the - headlight look when asked about the future of the former traders . He was happier to spruik the 600 new jobs , 45 new shops , and 700 car parks . If figures are your forte you might want to know that this new shopping mall has a catchment area with an average age of 38 years , average household size 2.2 people , around $ 35 k pa income , and 37 % are couples with no kids . ( Source : Brickworks Marketplace advertisement ) . Pedestrian Walkways Through the Car park So what can you expect at the Brickworks Marketplace ? If the first couple of days are any guide then be prepared to wait for a park . Of course it 's probably opening fever , and the locals will no doubt be happy when that 's subsided . A pleasant surprise were the dedicated walkways and pedestrian crossings in the car park , making it easier to push your trolley of takings back home . Brick Lane Playground for Kids Work was still in progress at Brick Lane , the northern end of Brickworks Marketplace adjacent to the heritage listed brickworks when I visited . It seems that there will be something to connect the two , but it was n't clear what . At the western end of Brick Lane a soft floored playground was popular with a tribe of toddlers while their parents played with mobile phones . Zambrero Mexican Food on Brick Lane Nearby the latest addition to Zambrero 's Mexican franchise ( with a humanitarian face ) was doing a roaring trade with plenty of punters enjoying the opportunity for alfresco dining . Zambrero offers tacos , burritos and nachos , but I have n't tried their food yet . Food Choices at the North End of the Shopping Mall Heading south into the Brickworks Marketplace shopping mall uncovered a few surprises - if you come hungry you will have plenty of food choices . Reade Book is a combination bookstore and cafe that was already busy . The Cicheti Italian food bar was not yet open , but Joy of India , Dumpling Dumpling were already open and Iiced had gelati with all the colours of the rainbow . There were plenty of the usual suspects you 'll find in most modern shopping malls . A Smokemart , the ubiquitous Specsavers , engravers and keycutters , Flight Centre , Zamels and EB Games jostled for your attention with Vodafone and Optus . Rockmans Clothing and Moda Alterations were new to me though . Take Away Food Choices Include Tokyo Sushi and Yiros Central At the north end of Brickworks Marketplace is where the crowds were at lunchtime . More food choices abounded and most tables were taken with what looked like locals in work clothes . If you could n't find something to your taste here , then you are fussy . Tokyo Sushi , Yiros Central , and Zeea 's Eatery for Italian food were all doing a roaring trade . Another shop , probably Three Little Cafe was still being fitted out . Yiros Central in the Shopping Mall The new Brickworks Marketplace at Torrensville will fill the bill for an area lacking in shopping facilities close by . I thought the food choices were somewhat more inspired than average , but others may disagree . At the end of a day it will be successful , and does n't the end justifies the means ? See the Brickworks Marketplace website for a complete list of shops , although descriptions are sparse as yet . Of course there 's a Facebook page too . If you feel a bit parched after traversing the Brickworks Marketplace car park you will be pleased to know that a Dan Murphy 's liquor store awaits you in Torrensville too .","annotations":[{"text":"Brickworks Marketplace","span":[177,198],"token_span":[29,30],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"A spatial setting larger than the Ground in which the Shopping event occurs."},{"text":"opened on June 25 2015","span":[1362,1383],"token_span":[225,229],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the shopping occurs."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"A Shopper looks for Goods in order to purchase them.","frame_ancestors":["Seeking","Seeking_to_achieve","Work","Attempt","Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-2823-115-frame-Sign_agreement","frame":"Sign_agreement","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"McDonald failed to make the final roster as a rookie , and was waived on September 5 , 2009 , before re-signing to the practice squad the following day where he remained all season .

A culture of power abuse and impunity within the military came under the spotlight last month when a Thai soldier went on a shooting rampage killing 29 people , triggered by a dispute over a housing deal involving his superior officer . The report outlined other abuses including incidents where commanders forced conscripts to jump into septic tanks or to eat \" like dogs \" , using their mouths and not their hands . It also described sexual humiliation where conscripts were forced by superiors to hold one another 's penises . \" Abuses of new conscripts in the Thai military have long been an open secret . What our research shows is that such maltreatment is not the exception but the rule , and deliberately hushed within the military , \" said Clare Algar , Amnesty International 's senior director for research , advocacy and policy . A military spokesman said he had not reviewed the Amnesty report but that past abuses had been addressed . \" We are taking the issue of abuses seriously and any commander implicated will be transferred , face disciplinary action and criminal charges too , \" Defence Ministry spokesman Lieutenant General Kongcheep Tantrawanit said . \" In the past two to three years there have been very few cases , so some of the cases people talk about are maybe old information . \" Military service is compulsory in Thailand and each year , thousands of men over 21 take part in a recruitment lottery . Speaking to Reuters on the condition of anonymity , a 24- year - old former conscript described a punishment he once got after his drill sergeant caught him smoking . \" He made me crawl through a dirty ditch then later forced me into a ... position where I have to put my head and feet on the ground while raising my bottom up with hands behind my back , \" he said . \" Then the sergeant told 10 other conscript to hit me hard with broom sticks , \" he said . About half of the 350,000 - strong Royal Thai Armed Forces is made up of conscripts . While traditionally treated with deference , the military has faced criticism since seizing power in 2014 , the 12th successful coup since 1932 .

Lindop Jim Rance Balblair Productions UK English crime thriller Review by Mark Cunliffe \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 I 'm not quite sure what I 've just watched , I was too preoccupied with being reminded how much of a funny looking fella Jimmy Hanley was ; he had a massive wide head that just tapered away to a tiny little chin did n't he ? And it all looked so weird on his broad body ... Away from Hanley 's funny looks , The Black Rider consists of motorbike clubs , investigative journalism and atomic weaponry being smuggled into sleepy coastal village under the auspice of some old folklore about a sinister satanic figure that haunts the area . Essentially its the kind of hoary old yarn that would keep readers of 50s and 60s comic strips and Boys Own annuals enthralled . In fact , as a child stalking jumble sales in the 80s for back issues I was just as enthralled myself ! Oh and Leslie Dwyer is shown to have just as much contempt for snotty nosed kids here as he had twenty - six years later in Hi-de - Hi Review by Paul D I 'll freely admit that my passion for this movie is beyond all reason , much like Jimmy Hanley 's oddly posh accent seen here and only here , there 's no accounting for it . Previous review : boxd.it/8PqPX Review by loureviews In the USA , Marlon Brando was asking ' whaddya got ' in biker leathers - while in the UK the rather staid looking Jimmy Hanley was our kind of rebel . The ' evil mission ' of the tagline is a misnomer as this film has little tension and certainly none of the Brando sex appeal which made the motorcycle lifestyle attractive . Review by Melody You know it 's a very British biker movie when they do n't even dismount for the egg-and - spoon race . Review by Paul D While America had the likes of The Wild One and Easy Rider and Electraglide in Blue and Australia had Stone and Mad Max , over here in Britain we had The Black Rider . Yes indeed , the story of a ' young ' newspaper reporter who saves up his money to buy a motorbike so he can fulfil his lifelong ambition to , err , do reliability trials . OK , so it 's does n't have the scenes of bikes tearing off down highways the disappear off into the horizon , but this is Britain . Instead we have to make do with trundling slowly around over bits of heathland , skilfully negotiating gorse bushes .

Graphic mobile phone images sent to the newspaper by migrants held inside the detention centres show dozens of emaciated men crippled by the Arabian heat lying shirtless in tightly packed rows in small rooms with barred windows . One photo shows what appears to be a corpse swathed in a purple and white blanket in their midst . They say it is the body of a migrant who had died of heatstroke and that others are barely getting enough food and water to survive . Another image , too graphic to publish , shows a young African man hanged from a window grate in an internal tiled wall . The adolescent killed himself after losing hope , say his friends , many of whom have been held in detention since April . The migrants , several displaying scars on their backs , claim they are beaten by guards who hurl racial abuse at them . \u201c It 's hell in here . We are treated like animals and beaten every day , \u201d said Abebe , an Ethiopian who has been held at one of the centres for more than four months . \u201c If I see that there is no escape , I will take my own life . Others have already , \u201d he added via an intermediary who was able to communicate on a smuggled phone . \u201c My only crime is leaving my country in search of a better life . But they beat us with whips and electric cords as if we were murderers . \u201d The images and testimony have sparked outrage among human rights activists , and have particular resonance in light of the global Black Lives Matter protests . \" Photos emerging from detention centres in southern Saudi Arabia show that authorities there are subjecting Horn of Africa migrants to squalid , crowded , and dehumanising conditions with no regard for their safety or dignity , \u201d said Adam Coogle , deputy director of Human Rights Watch in the Middle East , after being shown the images by The Sunday Telegraph . \u201c The squalid detention centres in southern Saudi Arabia fall well short of international standards . For a wealthy country like Saudi Arabia , there 's no excuse for holding migrants in such deplorable conditions , \" Mr Coogle added . Oil-rich Saudi Arabia has long exploited migrant labour from Africa and Asia . In June 2019 , an estimated 6.6 m foreign workers made up about 20 per cent of the Gulf nation 's population , most occupying low paid and often physically arduous jobs . The migrants work mainly in construction and manual domestic roles that Saudi nationals prefer not to do themselves . Many are from South Asia , but a large contingent come from the Horn of Africa , which lies across the Red Sea . The detention centres identified by The Sunday Telegraph house mainly Ethiopian men and there are said to be others packed with women . Over the last decade , tens of thousands of young Ethiopians have made their way to the Gulf state , often aided by Saudi recruitment agents and people traffickers , in a bid to escape poverty back home . They have been trapped partly as a result of the pandemic but also by the ' Saudization ' of the kingdom 's workforce , a policy introduced by Muhamad Bin Salman , the Crown Prince who took power three years ago . The testimonies gathered by The Sunday Telegraph directly from migrants on encrypted channels about the conditions they now find themselves in are harrowing . \u201c Plenty of inmates are suicidal or suffering from mental illnesses as a result of living this for five months , \u201d said one . \u201c The guards mock us , they say ' your government does n't care , what are we supposed to do with you ? \u201d \u201c A young boy , about sixteen , managed to hang himself last month . The guards just throw the bodies out back as if it was trash , \u201d said another . When the pandemic struck in March , the Saudi government in the capital Riyadh feared the migrants , who are often housed in overcrowded conditions , would act as vectors for the virus . Almost 3,000 Ethiopians were deported by the Saudi security services back to Ethiopia in the first ten days of April and a leaked UN memo said a further 200,000 were to follow . A moratorium was then placed on the deportations after international pressure was brought to bear on Riyadh . The Sunday Telegraph has found many of the migrants who were slated for deportation five months ago have been left to rot in disease- ridden detention centres . \u201c We have been left to die here , \u201d said one , who said he has been locked in a room the size of a school classroom and not been outside since March . \u201c Covid19 ? Who knows ? , he added , \u201c There are a lot of diseases here . Everyone is sick here ; everyone has something . \u201d The images smuggled out show many of those held are plagued by disfiguring skin infections . They claim they have received no medical treatment . \u201c We eat a tiny piece of bread in the day and rice in the evening . There 's almost no water , and the toilets are overflowing . It spills over to where we eat . The smell , we grow accustomed to . But there 's over a hundred of us in a room , and the heat is killing us , \u201d said another young Ethiopian man . A short video clip smuggled out shows several rooms covered with filth from an overflowing squat toilet . One Ethiopian man can be heard shouting out : \u201c The toilets are clogged . We tried unblocking them , but we 're unable to . So we live in this filth , we sleep in it too . \u201d \u201c To [ the Saudis ] or even to Abiy , it 's like we 're ants . When we die , it 's as if an ant died , no one cares or pays attention , \u201d the man added , referring to Ethiopia 's Nobel Peace Prize - winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed . Saudi Arabia is deeply stratified by race and cast . African migrants enjoy few legal rights and many complain of exploitation , sexual and racial abuse from employers . New laws further limiting the rights and employment prospects of foreign labourers were introduced in 2013 and crackdowns have continued under the rule of the young Crown Prince Muhamad Bin Salman , who took power in 2017 . The Sunday Telegraph was able to geolocate two of the centres . One is in Al Shumaisi , near the holy city of Mecca and one is in Jazan , a port town near Yemen . There are believed to be others housing thousands of Ethiopians . Migrants in each of the centres said there were hundreds of them in each room . Satellite imagery shows there are several buildings at both centres , meaning there may be far more migrants in each centre who are uncontactable . Several of the migrants said they had been rounded up from their homes in various Saudi Arabian cities before being placed in the camps . Others are African refugees from war-torn Yemen . Earlier this month , Human Rights Watch reported that Houthi forces used Covid - 19 as a pretext to expel thousands of Ethiopian migrants into neighbouring Saudi Arabia . Testimonies gathered by the NGO say that the Houthis killed dozens of Ethiopians and forced others at gunpoint over the Saudi border . Saudi border guards then fired on the fleeing migrants , killing dozens more . \u201c Saudi Arabia , a wealthy country , has long held undocumented migrants including many from the Horn of Africa in conditions that are so crowded , unsanitary , and appalling that migrants often emerge traumatised or sick , \u201d said Mr Coogle . \u201c It 's fair to question whether Saudi authorities are purposefully allowing these detention conditions to exist in order to punish migrants , \u201d he added . The Sunday Telegraph approached the Saudi Arabian embassy in London for comment but had not received any at the time of going to press . A representative of the Ethiopian government in the Middle East was also unsuccessfully approached for comment . * Migrants ' names have been changed to protect their identity Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security","annotations":[{"text":"hundreds if not thousands of African migrants","span":[69,113],"token_span":[13,19],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The entity whose State is specified and/or evaluated."},{"text":"heinous","span":[125,131],"token_span":[22,22],"role":"State","label":"State","role_definition":"A relation in which the Entity participates or a property that the Entity possesses."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Entity is in a specified State.","frame_ancestors":["State"],"frame_descendants":["Predicament"]},{"instance_id":"EN-3132-631-frame-Suasion","frame":"Suasion","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"See also H.AMDT.652 , THOMAS .

By a 210 to 210 tie vote that GOP leaders prolonged for 23 tumultuous minutes while they corralled dissident members , the House rejected a proposed change to the USA Patriot Act that would have barred the Justice Department from searching bookstore and library records . White House officials , citing the nearly three - year - old law 's importance as an anti-terrorism tool , warned that an attempt to weaken it would be vetoed . But the victory came only after GOP tactics infuriated Democrats and a number of Republicans . The vote , scheduled to last 15 minutes , dragged on for 38 minutes despite outraged shouts and a unified chant of \" shame , shame , shame \" from Democrats across the aisle . The showdown was the latest in a series of bipartisan challenges this week on the House floor to administration positions on trade sanctions against Cuba , budget cuts in a major loan program of the Small Business Administration , and funding for programs promoting democracy abroad . Last month , the House approved a natural resources bill that slashed many of the Bush administration 's initiatives in land conservation and the environment . Last week , Senate negotiators , defying the White House , insisted on pushing for a six- year transportation bill costing $ 318 billion -- $ 62 billion above the administration ceiling . With President Bush 's approval rating slipping as a result of setbacks in the Iraq war , lawmakers in both parties appear emboldened to defy the White House and the House GOP leadership . \" The Republican leadership is out of control , \" said Rep. Martin T. Meehan ( D- Mass . ) . \" Today 's vote on the Freedom to Read Protection Act is just the latest example of a growing trend towards abusive , closed - fist partisanship on the part of Republican House leadership . \" Rep.

Butch Otter ( R- Idaho ) , a conservative and an advocate of the defeated provision , told reporters after the vote : \" You win some , and some get stolen . \" At one point the electronic tally board above the visitors ' gallery showed the proposal passing , 219 to 201 . But as the Republican whip organization went to work to get defectors to switch , the number of those voting for passage dropped steadily . The final count recorded 18 Republicans joining 191 Democrats and Rep. Bernard Sanders ( Vt. ) , the House 's lone Independent and the chief author of the amendment to limit some powers of the Patriot Act . Sanders called the proceedings \" an outrage \" and \" an insult to democracy . \" The House has voted in the past to block portions of the Patriot Act , but Congress has never managed to alter any part of it . The law was quickly passed in the weeks after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . It gave the government strong powers and leeway to conduct investigations and detain suspects . Supporters of the Sanders proposal argued that fighting terrorism did not justify encroachments on basic liberties that are implicit in the broad authority the act gives to law enforcement agencies charged with hunting terrorists . Addressing the House before the vote , Sanders said : \" All of us want to support the law enforcement officials going after terrorists , but we can defeat terrorism without allowing the government to get a secret order from a secret court without any showing of any evidence that the person whose reading records are sought is engaged in any kind of illegal conduct . \" His amendment had the support of groups that include the American Booksellers Association , the American Library Association and the PEN American Center , representing writers . Supporters of the Patriot Act say authorities need to track potential al Qaeda members who communicate using Internet facilities in public libraries . Under the current law , authorities need a special court order to require libraries and other venues to provide records on the sale or borrowing of books and on Internet sites used . Rep. Frank R. Wolf ( R- Va. ) , who chairs the subcommittee that drafted the underlying spending legislation before the House yesterday , said , \" I believe the Patriot Act has helped \" safeguard the safety of Americans . Other Republicans said there were few examples of the act being used to invade the privacy of library users . Yesterday 's battle was over an amendment to a $ 39.8 billion bill financing the departments of Commerce , Justice and State for next year , which passed 397 to 18 . The Senate has not taken up its version of the spending measure . The floor fight was reminiscent of November 's vote on a Medicare prescription drug program , when GOP House leaders kept the vote going for nearly three hours while they persuaded reluctant members to support passage of the bill . \u00a9 2004 The Washington Post Company","annotations":[{"text":"Friday , July 9 , 2004","span":[174,195],"token_span":[29,34],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the Speaker suades the Addressee."},{"text":"GOP leaders","span":[427,437],"token_span":[76,77],"role":"Speaker","label":"Speaker","role_definition":"The person who intends through the use of language to get another person to act."},{"text":"dissident members","span":[496,512],"token_span":[86,87],"role":"Addressee","label":"Addressee","role_definition":"The person that the Speaker seeks to influence to act."},{"text":"rejected a proposed change to the USA Patriot Act that would have barred the Justice Department from searching bookstore and library records","span":[526,665],"token_span":[91,112],"role":"Content","label":"Content","role_definition":"The wish for action on the Addressee's part that the Speaker expresses."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"A Speaker succeeds in getting an Addressee to believe or plan to execute the Content the Speaker has in mind.","frame_ancestors":["Eventive_cognizer_affecting","Eventive_affecting","Event","Telling","Statement"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-2679-180-frame-Submitting_documents","frame":"Submitting_documents","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"The Detailed Project Report for project in Kasaragod district was submitted with a length of 128 km through the district in January 2018 .","annotations":[{"text":"The Detailed Project Report","span":[0,26],"token_span":[0,3],"role":"Documents","label":"Documents","role_definition":"The artifacts containing content, typically in the form of text and images, that the Submittor gives to the Authority."},{"text":"in Kasaragod district","span":[40,60],"token_span":[6,8],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place where the Submittor gives the Documents to the Authority."},{"text":"in January 2018","span":[121,135],"token_span":[20,22],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time period during which the Submittor gives the Documents to the Authority."}],"trigger":{"text":"submitted","start_char":66,"end_char":74,"start_token":10,"end_token":10,"frame":"Submitting_documents"}},"source":{"text":"The hill highway project here is well poised to pick up momentum shortly with the local authorities submitting an ' investigation ' report to the State Public Works Department ( PWD ) as a precursor to obtaining technical sanction for the 128.44 - km stretch passing through the district .

That night , in Salt Lake City , curlers Rhona Martin , Debbie Knox , Janice Rankin and Fiona MacDonald became Britain 's first gold medal winners at a Winter Olympics for 18 years . The unlikely triumph of four ordinary Scottish women in a sport most English people had never heard of was a sensation . They were feted as \" housewife superstars \" . Flag - waving crowds gathered at Heathrow to welcome them home , they were awarded MBEs and summoned on to Richard and Judy 's sofa . \" You have captured the imagination of the whole of the UK , \" wrote Tony Blair in a congratulatory fax . There was talk of a Hollywood movie . But when the celebrations died down and the invitations dried up , these four athletes , the first Scots to win gold at a winter games since 1936 , attracted less welcome attention . The fifth member of their team , the substitute Margaret Morton , told the Scottish Sun she felt excluded and said : \" I do n't particularly respect them for their personalities , but of course I respect them for what they achieved . \" There were news reports of Rhona Martin , the team 's \" skip \" , splitting from her husband and being forced to sell her family home . By then , Martin \u2013 despite all those predictions of sponsorship deals \u2013 was a single mother living on benefits . The breakdown of MacDonald 's marriage to a fellow curling star was reported too ; it was \" the curse of the curlers \" . So , eight years on , have those gold medals turned out to be a curse or a blessing ? Martin is now 43 and the coach of Scotland 's junior curling team as well as being part of UK Sport 's elite coaching programme . With her mop of blond hair , she still looks as fit as ever . The only member of the gold - medal - winning team to play on in the 2006 Winter Olympics , she will be commentating on curling for the BBC at the Vancouver Games this year ; her protege , Eve Muirhead , is the 19- year - old skip of the women 's team . Known for her passion and enthusiastic communication \u2013 curlers emit what sound like high - pitched yelps to instruct their teammates how vigorously to scrub the ice with their brushes \u2013 Martin says she will struggle to sit calmly during the curling . \" It 'll be good fun but I 'm bad enough when I 'm coaching so I do n't know , \" she says . Listening to the former skip on TV \" will be so funny , \" says Rankin , who lives in Elgin and is the full - time mother of four young children . Martin \" gets very excited when she 's watching curling \" , says Knox , who lives with her family near Edinburgh and , just as she did eight years ago , works for Standard Life . \" She knows what she 's talking about . She 'll be fab , \" says MacDonald , who is now a business manager for Macrae & Dick car dealers in Inverness . Despite living hundreds of miles apart in Scotland , the four curlers are still in touch . Knox coaches with Martin in her spare time , and the pair were planning to meet Rankin for dinner shortly before this year 's games . \" Unfortunately I have n't seen Fiona in ages , \" says Rankin . \" We do send Christmas cards and put a bit of chat in but we 're just all so busy . \" The team were orginally assembled by Martin , and played together for years before entering the 2002 Winter Olympics as underdogs . Canada , for whom curling is a national sport backed by serious funds , was expected to win . To make matters worse , Martin was seriously ill , and Britain struggled at first . They scraped through two playoffs to reach the semi-finals . Then they found their momentum , dispatching Canada and finally Switzerland , winning the tightest of games with Martin 's last shot . They were overwhelmed when they found themselves surrounded by 30,000 people at the medal plaza in Salt Lake City . \" We thought , what have we done ? \" says Martin . \" We stood on the podium and we were used to being Scotland 's team with our own national anthem . All of a sudden God Save the Queen came on and we were thinking , ' Uh - oh ' . That 's when it hit me . \" The quartet were oblivious to the frenzy back home . \" After we won the final I phoned one of my friends and said , ' We won ! Did you watch it ? ' \" says Rankin . \" And she said , ' Did we watch it ? The whole flipping country watched it ! ' \" But it was still a surprise when they entered Heathrow to find crash barriers keeping back flag - waving fans . \" We were thinking , ' Blimey , there are a lot of people here . Who are they here to see ? ' \" says Rankin . They were , says Knox , naive , and that made the next phase of their lives all the more bizarre and thrilling . \" We went on Lorraine Kelly 's show and we got taken out with a personal shopper who picked us clothes to wear \u2013 it was ' from curlers to dressed - up ladies ' . \" The highlight for Rankin , a keen tennis player , was being invited into the royal box at Wimbledon , where the crowd gave them a round of applause . Martin still sounds astonished by the memory . \" It was just surreal . \" When they collected their MBEs from the Queen , the women and their families were put up at Claridge 's . \" Three years later one of my daughters said , ' When are we going to stay in that hotel with that man in a lift again ? ' \" recalls Knox . In a sense , they became the Susan Boyles of their day : celebrated but also slightly belittled by some of the media coverage . They were athletes who had mastered a fiendishly challenging sport while holding down ordinary jobs , yet the talk was of housewives with brooms ; did they feel patronised ? \" No , because we 'd had it for years , \" says Martin . Locally , there was a lot of recognition and affection . \" I still have customers who recognise me . That 's quite nice after eight years , \" says MacDonald . Of course , talk of life - changing amounts of money and a Hollywood film came to nothing . \" We were getting excited about who could play us , reeling off names like Julia Roberts , \" says Knox . \" That was silly . We thought then , how on earth are they going to make a film out of curling ? \" Martin did some promotional work with B&Q and was given a car for a year and that was it . \" We played Canada in the semis and they were so gutted we beat them , \" says Martin . \" They said afterwards we 'd cost them millions . To them , money was a huge part of winning but to us it was never , ever a thought . \" In Canada , teams play for thousands of dollars , says Martin . \" We play and win a lasagne dish . \" Knox would rather have her gold medal than lots of money though . \" There are still people who say we should 've made fortunes out of it but it just never came about , \" she says . \" We knew the hype about it would n't last that long . \" Their lingering fame was enough , however , for journalists to sniff out negative stories . Nowadays , none of the four are in contact with Morton . \" It is hard when the media goes through your personal life because you 're not used to that at all , \" says Martin , who is still single but has her own home again with her 17- year - old daughter and 14- year - old son . The team 's youngest member , MacDonald , who is now 35 , was the first to retire from curling , just three months after their triumph . While Martin and Knox coach , and Rankin is enjoying playing local games after four years away from the sport , MacDonald has not curled again , apart from a couple of charity games . Did she quit because she was uncomfortable with being a celebrity ? \" It was n't about that at all . I 'm a 100 % or nothing person . I knew I 'd won my gold medal and it was time to put my efforts into something else , \" she says . \" I 'm glad I quit while I was ahead . \" MacDonald has another partner now but she and her son will be cheering on her ex , Ewan , at the Olympics this time around . His British team are current world champions . \" I would n't miss it for the world , \" she says . \" I know how important it is to the men 's team and I really hope Ewan can fulfil his dreams this time . It 's important for him and for his little boy as well because his dad has been away quite a lot in recent years . \" The four are phlegmatic about the fact that while curling is reasonably well funded at an elite level , ordinary curling clubs across Scotland have continued to close in recent years . \" There were more people wanting to curl afterwards and they ran ' come and try ' sessions . That generated quite a lot of interest but the clubs were going to go under anyway , \" says Knox . \" Just because we won the Olympic medal does n't necessarily mean the whole country is going to take up curling . \" So did winning Olympic gold change their lives at all ? \" I 'm not sure it changed my life but it definitely made me a stronger and better person , \" says MacDonald .","annotations":[{"text":"Rhona Martin","span":[196,207],"token_span":[39,40],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The living organism which requires the Support to survive."},{"text":"on benefits","span":[1436,1446],"token_span":[277,278],"role":"Support","label":"Support","role_definition":"The resource that the Entity relies on to survive through a situation."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Entity survives a situation with some Support, which tends to be far below the accustomed or standard level expected.","frame_ancestors":["Dead_or_alive","State"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-1078-1230-frame-Suicide_attack","frame":"Suicide_attack","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"There were two attacks that represented new developments in terms of political violence inside Israel in this period .

Elizabeth Truss , the early years minister , has proposed that childminders , currently restricted to looking after three children per staff member from the ages of one to five inclusive , should in future be permitted to look after four children . They would also be allowed to look after two children under one year of age , instead of the current one . Truss will seek to allay parents ' fears of their children being neglected by overpressed staff , pointing out that the relaxation she proposes still leaves more restrictive ratios than Denmark , France and Germany \u2013 three countries often cited as providing high - quality care for pre-school children . The minister will quote experts claiming that in Britain more qualifications are needed to look after animals than toddlers . She is also proposing that nurseries be allowed to relax their ratios when qualified staff are present , increasing from four to six two -year - old children per staff member . In the case of one-year -olds , the permitted staff - to - child ratios would rise from the current one - to - three to one - to - four . The ratios would rise further if a fully - qualified teacher is present . She will also relax how these rules are interpreted . \" One of the problems that parents have is not just the exorbitant cost , it is the availability [ of childcare ] . I personally have struggled to find a nursery place for love or money , and many parents say that , \" Truss said on Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday morning . By raising care ratios , Truss said , popular operations would be able to expand by economies of scale , which would make childcare more widely available . Reforms , she said , would also mean better paid and better qualified staff . \" The pay level of staff at the moment \u2013 nursery workers are getting \u00a3 6.60 an hour \u2013 it 's barely more than the minimum wage . I do not think that is an acceptable wage rate for what should be a professional job . \" What I want to see [ in nursery care ] is something that is much more a continuum of the education system . \" The Department for Education ( DfE ) said the proposals were dependent on staff possessing higher qualifications , including C-grade GCSE maths and English . The DfE said : \" England 's relatively tight ratios have two main effects : higher costs for parents and lower pay for staff . In turn , low pay drags down the quality of the workforce . In other countries providers can use the extra income they get from taking on more children to reduce fees for parents and pay staff more , but this is not possible in England . \" The proposed flexibility has been labelled \" unacceptable and a recipe for disaster \" by the Pre-School Learning Alliance , the largest representative organisation of early years providers . Labour has also attacked the proposals . The shadow education secretary , Stephen Twigg , said : \" Experts are warning this could threaten child safety and wo n't reduce costs . Parents will be worried . \" Truss is also to propose that \" one - stop shop \" child agencies be given more freedom to help home - based childminders . Truss will tell the Policy Exchange thinktank : \" We have seen a decrease in the number of childminders over recent years . This is , in part , because childminders have to be business owners . Some people want a simpler way to enter the profession and parents want to be assured of quality . So we are setting up ' one - stop shops ' called childminder agencies to do the practicalities and to give parents some reassurance over quality . \" She added she would introduce graduate - level early years teachers trained specifically to teach young children .

Plans are taking shape for lavish celebrations \u2013 including a host of TV and radio documentaries and books , and even a float at the Notting Hill carnival \u2013 of an anniversary that many hope will bring belated recognition to one of England 's greatest but most overlooked creations . Eight hundred years ago next year , on 15 June 1215 , on the banks of the Thames in Runnymede , an embattled King John met the English barons , who had backed his failed war against the French and were seeking to limit his powers . The weakened monarch had little choice but to witness the sealing of what some say is the world 's most important document , one that , symbolically at least , established a new relationship between the king and his subjects . Thus the original Magna Carta , 3,500 words in Latin on a calfskin parchment , came into being , its enduring relevance confirmed in the many legal cases in which it is cited today . But while lawyers worship Magna Carta for laying the foundations for modern democracy , the defence of personal liberty and the protection of freedoms around the world , Britain largely ignores it . The 750th anniversary passed in 1965 with little fanfare . Plans for the 700th anniversary were abandoned due to the first world war . An appeal to the government for a national holiday next year , backed by many MPs , was rejected . History as an academic discipline has also often been reluctant to pay homage . The 1214 battle of Bouvines , the decisive battle after which England was forced to concede it had lost most of its lands in France , a pivotal moment in the weakening of John 's position , has been described as \u201c the most important battle in history that nobody has ever heard of \u201d . And until recently Magna Carta was only on the periphery of the history syllabus . Even David Cameron , when asked on a US chat show , was unable to say what Magna Carta means in English ( answer : \u201c Great Charter \u201d ) . Runnymede also appears underwhelmed by its place in history . The only memorial to Magna Carta within the National Trust park that incorporates the meadow , bisected by a busy road , is a small , domed shelter built in 1957 by the American Bar Association . Two signs explain how the Pilgrim Fathers took a copy of Magna Carta with them , which helped Americans to frame their constitution , and how the document was used by Nancy Astor to promote universal suffrage , and by William Wilberforce and Abraham Lincoln to press for the abolition of slavery . The absence of a more fitting British memorial is surprising . Apparently the National Trust feared that putting Runnymede on the cultural map would cause traffic problems . \u201c I've been wondering why that is [ the absence of a visitor centre ] for 20 years , \u201d said Sir Robert Worcester , chairman of the Magna Carta 800th Committee who can trace his family back to the Pilgrim Fathers . He describes Magna Carta as \u201c England 's greatest export \u201d , and reels off the key tenets it has bequeathed to the world \u2013 \u201c due process of law ; no one is above the law ; justice delayed is justice denied ; no taxation without representation ; the English Church shall be free \u201d . Worcester and his fellow enthusiasts hope 2015 will be the year Magna Carta gets the anniversary it deserves . Tens of millions of national lottery pounds are being poured into key Magna Carta sites across England . Websites have been constructed ; commemorative gold coins and stamps are to be issued ; a peal of bells will ring from churches ; a series of lectures around the world , starting with one by Neil MacGregor , director of the British Museum , will emphasise the document 's enduring importance ; the British Library will host the largest exhibition in its history ; special songs and poems will be performed ; Magna Carta will even get its own display at the Notting Hill carnival . The creation of a visitor centre near Runnymede could also become a reality . Worcester talks optimistically of signing a deal with Royal Holloway University , which is a couple of miles away . However , capturing public interest remains a challenge . \u201c Unlike other artefacts which may be a bit more sexy , it 's a piece of parchment with some rather unintelligible words written on it in Latin , \u201d acknowledged Sandra Matthews - Marsh , chief executive of Visit Kent , the body that promotes tourism in the county keen to put itself on the newly launched Magna Carta tourist map . \u201c But the exhibition designers and curators we 've appointed are really excited about the job . Their task is to bring the thing to life , not only to tell the story of why it was so important but what its relevance is today . \u201d It is a task in need of fulfilment . Last Thursday a British Asian family , father , mother , grandmother and three daughters , walked across the meadow at Runnymede and stood in front of the American Bar Association 's memorial . \u201c What do you mean , ' Is that all there is ? ' , \u201d the mother hissed in response to a mumbled observation from one of her daughters . For several minutes the family examined the signs and took selfies . Then they made their way back to the nearby car park and its National Trust tearoom . The US - built memorial stood unobserved in the autumn sunshine . Across the meadow came the roar of traffic , its drivers oblivious to the fact they were speeding past history . Magna Carta ? So what was that all about ? I 've heard of it . Some Latin document written long ago . Did n't David Cameron talk about it on a chat show once ? Yes . He was forced to admit he did not know what Magna Carta was in English . Idiot . So what does it mean ? Great Charter . Sounds impressive . Indeed . Originally issued in 1215 , it was the first document forced on to a king of England by his subjects as they sought to protect their privileges and limit his powers . The first ? Yes , it was annulled by the pope nine weeks later . It was redrafted in 1216 , 1217 and 1225 . It was confirmed as English law in 1297 , but most parts have been repealed . Most parts ? Clause 1 , securing the freedom of the English church ; Clause 9 , guaranteeing the \u201c ancient liberties \u201d of the City of London ; and Clause 29 , the right to due process , are still in force . Due process . Sounds like an 80s pop band . It was the clause that laid the foundations for the individual freedoms we enjoy today . Remind me again what it says . \u201c No Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned , or be disseised of his Freehold , or Liberties , or free Customs , or be outlawed , or exiled , or any other wise destroyed ; nor will We not pass upon him , nor condemn him , but by lawful judgment of his Peers , or by the Law of the land . We will sell to no man , we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right . \u201d So we have Magna Carta to thank for cutting our monarchs down to size ? At the time it had little effect on curtailing monarchical powers , but it carried great symbolism . It gave succour to those opposing the king during the English civil war and helped lead to the rule of constitutional law throughout the English -speaking world .","annotations":[{"text":"2015","span":[3320,3323],"token_span":[618,618],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies when the support occurs."},{"text":"the British Library","span":[3788,3806],"token_span":[702,704],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the support occurs."},{"text":"Magna Carta","span":[3902,3912],"token_span":[722,723],"role":"Supported","label":"Supported","role_definition":"The Supported is given strength through the assistance of the Supporter."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"A Supporter assists to strengthen the Supported by lending itself in material aid (or abstract assistance in the case of metaphorical uses).","frame_ancestors":["Assistance","Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":[]},{"instance_id":"EN-1212-127-frame-Surrendering_possession","frame":"Surrendering_possession","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"Rolls - Royce has been accused numerous times of corrupt practices and bribery .

It was n't the only odd question he has heard over the years about his brothers , who are joined at the torso . There are others : \" Y' all born that way ? Y'all brothers ? \" \" It 's fascinating , \" he said with a laugh . Ronnie and Donnie Galyon have been turning heads and surprising people since they were born Oct. 28 , 1951 , in Beavercreek , Ohio , with Donnie emerging headfirst and Ronnie coming out feet-first . They were healthy babies , weighing 11 pounds , 11.5 ounces , but the doctors kept them in the hospital for two years , in part to figure out if there was a safe way to separate them . When they told their parents they could not guarantee that both boys would survive the operation , the parents refused to allow it . That was the right decision , say Ronnie and Donnie , as they sat facing each other in the bed / chair they share . Donnie held up a gold crucifix he wears on a chain around his neck . \" The good Lord made us . Let our savior do it , \" Ronnie said . \" No surgeon 's knives , \" Donnie said .

Their brother Jim opened up scrapbooks assembled over the years by their mother , showing the nine children of Eileen and Wesley Galyon growing up in the farming community of Beavercreek , Ohio , near Dayton . Their dad , handy with tools , crafted chairs and other devices to accommodate the twins ' unusual needs . They are joined at the waist , sharing one set of lower digestive organs and rectum , but they have separate hearts , stomachs and two sets of arms and legs . Ronnie and Donnie were 11 when Jim , the youngest , was born , and they shared a special bond with their baby brother . CONJOINED TWINS \u2022 Conjoined twins occur once in every 200,000 live births . \u2022 The survival rate is between 5 and 25 percent . \u2022 70 percent of all conjoined twins born alive are girls \u2022 They are genetically identical . The developing embryo starts to split into identical twins during the first few weeks after conception , but stops before the process is complete . SOURCE \u2013 University of Maryland Medical Center \" When he was a little boy he sat there where we 're joined at , \" Ronnie said , patting the band of cartilage that links him and Donnie mid-torso .

They traveled most of the year , and the money they earned supported the family . \" That was the only income . They were the breadwinners , \" said Jim . He and his wife , Mary , have looked after Ronnie and Donnie since they retired in 1991 . Four years ago , the twins moved into Jim and Mary 's home . \" That 's kind of giving it back right now . I do n't do it because of that , but I feel that way , \" Jim said . \" They paid for us all growing up . \" \" It was fun , \" Ronnie said . \" You do what you got to do . \" The closeness the three brothers share is lightened with bantering and teasing . Jim quoted their family doctor calling Ronnie and Donnie \" a national treasure . \" But then he added , \" He does n't have to live with them , \" and his brothers laughed . When Donnie and Ronnie reached school age , their parents sent them to school , but they were n't allowed to attend . Officials said they were too distracting to the other students . \" It was a different era , \" Jim said . Performing in carnivals , Ronnie and Donnie found another community in the workers who ran food booths and the sideshow performers . Their friends included Johan the Viking giant ; Little Pete , who was 16 inches tall and billed as the smallest man in the world ; and Margaret Pellegrini , an actress who performed as a munchkin in \" The Wizard of Oz . \" In free time between fairs , their dad organized baseball games . \" When we were on the road , it was all like one big family , \" Ronnie said .

He attended Edinburgh University where he studied philosophy , graduating with honors in 1891 . In order to join his brother who emigrated to Canada , Neilson crossed the Atlantic and began teaching in Upper Canada College in Toronto which was a boarding school for young boys . Deciding that he would prefer to be a scholar than a school master , Neilson went on to Harvard Graduate School in Cambridge , MA where he received his Ph.D. in English in 1898 . Upon receiving his Ph.D. , Neilson accepted a position as an Associate in English Literature at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr , PA . Neilson taught at many other fine institutions before settling into the work of an administrator . Harvard , Radcliffe , the Sorbonne , Columbia , Barnard , and the University of California all made use of Neilson 's talents at one time or another . It was during his years as a professor that Neilson distinguished himself as the sort of scholar that an academic institution would wish to guide it . Before coming to Smith , Neilson made a name for himself both as a professor devoted to his students ' learning ( he was the only instructor of Helen Keller 's who learned the manual sign language she used for communication ) but also as a writer and an editor . Among his writings were Essentials of Poetry ( 1912 ) and The Facts about Shakespeare ( 1913 ) . He also was the editor of Milton 's Minor Poems ( 1899 ) and Shakespeare 's Complete Works ( 1906 ) . In 1917 , Neilson was offered the Presidency of Smith College . He accepted on the conditions that he would not be obligated to raise money , and that a president 's house would be built , with which the trustees complied . When Neilson arrived at Smith in 1917 perhaps one of the best assets that Neilson brought to Smith was his quick wit that endeared him to student , staff , faculty , and alumnae alike . At Neilson 's final commencement in 1939 Cynthia Walsh recalled one particular instance : The seniors will especially recall that on May Day when they went to serenade him , his new collie puppy began to bark , not realizing what sweet voices were vying with the birds so early in the morning . When the president stepped out he said , \u201c My dog thinks you 're sheep , \u201d and the volleys of laughter which greeted this remark quite drowned out the rest : \u201d - but I think you 're lambs ! \u201d Neilson 's accomplishments at Smith were many . When Neilson noticed that a majority of Smith students lived off campus he set about the task of purchasing and building new residences so that all Smith students would live on campus . After building the Great Quadrangle , purchasing Chapin House , Talbot House , Sessions House , and many others his goal was completed . During Neilson 's 22 - year term as president , the campus also saw the additions of Sage Music Hall , Scott Gymnasium , Tryon Art Gallery , the Alumnae House , the Infirmary , and the President 's house . Neilson also established the Junior Year in France , Junior Year in Italy , and the Junior Year in Spain Programs . Special Honors , the Smith College Day School , and the School for Social Work were additions that Neilson made to the college . Never one to rest on his laurels , Neilson continued writing and editing while looking after the well being of 2,000 students . In 1920 he wrote History of English Literature and in 1922 he edited Roads to Knowledge . He also was the editor - in-chief of Webster 's New International Dictionary , 2nd edition , 1934 . William A. Neilson died on February 13 , 1946 .

The first Vicky Bliss novel , Borrower of the Night , was written in 1973 . Vicky was working at a small Midwestern College where she was an overworked and underpaid History teacher trying to fend off marriage proposals from Tony whose major redeeming quality was that he was taller than her . Tony arrogantly challenges Vicky to find a mysterious wooden sculpture that disappeared during the wars in the 1500s claiming he will prove that he is better than her at sleuthing and then she will certainly want to marry him . They head off to Rothenburg , Germany where the Schloss Drachenstein has been turned into a hotel . They are joined by very rich antiques collector George Nolan not a man known for his honesty . The three enter into competition to find the legendary wood carving by Riemenschneider . The castle is run by the cute little Irma Drachenstein . Every creepy old castle must have an odd relative and this one has not only Irma 's Aunt but also a rich old lady who is interested in the spirit world . The book introduces one of my favorite characters of all time , Dr. Anton Schmidt , who runs a museum in Munich . The book proceeds to throw everything you could ever want with a spooky castle as a setting . There is a heroine who is scared of something , s\u00e9ances , secret rooms , attacking suits of armor , and enough crosses and double crosses to keep you guessing as to who is on which side . It is a great start to the series . Street of Five Moons finds Vicky working for the delightful Dr. Schmidt in Munich . The roly - poly Herr Doktor Schmidt fashions himself as a great detective with Vicky as his Watson . When a dead man is found with no identification , a cryptic note with an address of 37 Street of Five Moons in Rome , and a forgery of a necklace with the original dating to Charlemagne 's time that is good enough to fool experts Schmidt decides that they need to solve the mystery . Actually Vicky needs to solve the mystery for Schmidt and away she goes to visit Rome . Vicky believes that the whole thing is a wild goose chase but decides to break into the antique store at 37 Street of Five Moons . There she runs into Caesar a Doberman watchdog that falls in love with her . She also finds evidence that there is a major swindle going on in the antiques world where brilliantly made fakes are taking the place of antique jewelry . Vicky meets the enigmatic Englishman Sir John Smythe the next day at the antique store and her life will never be the same . This book also has a great castle belonging to an Italian Count that is supposed to be haunted . It turns out that Sir John is the private secretary to the Count . Of course Vicky ends up at the castle and the book has all the proper elements to make it a perfect mystery . There are ghosts , a formidable grandmother , a mistress , a disturbed son , servants who are not what they seem , dungeons , and we ca n't forget an Italian Princess . It is good fun . In Silhouette in Scarlet Vicky is lured to Sweden by John Smythe . Vicky is irritated that Symthe has left her in the lurch before to pay hotel bills while he has snuck out to avoid being arrested . Vicky blows Smyth 's cover at the airport and proceeds to go off on her own . She meets Leif who tries to woo her at the same time getting information on Smythe while claiming to work for a Special Police Branch dealing with antiquities . She also meets the very creepy Max whose hobby is making silhouettes of people out of black paper . Vicky believes that John is up to something that deals with a fifth century chalice that was found in a farmer 's field in the late 1800s . The chalice was believed to come from the loot of Viking raiders . Vicky is contacted by rich elderly farmer named Gustav Jonsson who claims to be a distant relative of hers . It is no coincidence that he owns the farm where the chalice was found . Vicky suspects that the man is being hoodwinked and decides to go visit and talk to him in person . Naturally she meets John up there and they are surprised by a criminal gang the next day who want to dig up the farmer 's land in search of more treasure . The mystery makes good use of an island that is cut off and some very nasty villains . In Trojan Gold Vicky receives a mysterious package that contains a photograph of a woman wearing jewelry that was stolen by the Nazis and disappeared during the fall of Berlin . Other experts who are friends of Vicky 's have also received a picture but not exactly the same one . When Vicky starts investigating she discovers that the same friends who attended an archeological conference in a small town the previous year are back . Vicky 's photograph has come from the innkeeper of the inn where they stayed . The inn is now run by the man 's young widow . He had been struck down by a hit and run driver . Where there is illegal treasure of course there is John Smyth . Dr. Schmidt has decided to take a personal interest in the case and help solve the mystery . It is a rich mixture of people who are all hoping to find the treasure for their own museums , a young widow who is obviously frightened , a hot headed cousin of the widow , and a mastermind who could be just about anybody . Instead of a castle this time we get an abandoned church and a lonely graveyard . Being winter in the Alps around Christmas we also get avalanches . This mystery has a lot of red herrings and is a bit confusing at times but still is enjoyable in the end . Night Train to Memphis is the best book in the series . Vicky is asked by Interpol to infiltrate a luxury cruise in Egypt and look over the passengers and see if she can identify a criminal that they believe is about to pull off a big heist at the Egyptian Museum . Vicky is promised protection and that there will be no danger to her . She is shocked when she realizes that John is aboard the ship but not nearly as shocked as when she finds out that he has a brand new and very young bride . Of course the only crook Vicky recognizes is her former lover . Vicky 's fellow travelers include a very flaky mystery writer , Sweet and Bright and odd couple team where only Sweet talks , a charming multi-millionaire who is about to make a very large donation to Egyptian archeology , a very boring professor whose lectures are a cure for insomnia , her former flame and his wife and his mother , a ditzy widow looking for a new rich husband , and sweet little lady who has more in common with Vicky then she realizes . Of course Vicky 's boss Dr. Schmidt shows up to make life difficult as Vicky tries to keep him safe and he tries to insinuate himself in the case . Dr. Schmidt 's new passion is for Country and Western music . This book is treasure for people who love Country and Western music with its references and clues based on the music . Vicky finds new enemies as well as some old ones who are not in jail as she had thought . There are again crosses and double - crosses and people who are not what they seem . Schmidt has a rather large role in this book which is a delight as he is one of my favorite characters of all time . Elizabeth Peters did a final book to close the Vicky Bliss series called The Laughter of Dead Kings . It is probably my least favor of the books . I got the sense that she knew she had to wrap up some things . In her introduction she did mention that in this story she was kind of stuck because of the length of time between books . After talking things over with fellow writers she decided to put the story in the \u201c current now . \u201d In other words she got to play God with her universe and creations and Vicky is still in her early thirties and using modern technology . The story takes place again in Egypt about 6 months or so from the events of Night Train to Memphis . In the story someone has stolen the mummy of King Tutankhamun . All clues lead to Vicky 's lover John Smythe who now goes by his real name of Tregarth . John swears his innocence and he and Vicky proceed to try and find the real thief . They are joined along the way by people from others books . Schmidt again has a large and funny part . We also meet Suzy and Feisal who were in Night Train to Memphis and Jan Perlmutter from Trojan Gold . The story drags a bit but I urge you to make it through to the end . There is a bit there that had me laughing so hard the first time I read it . I do n't care if the story was a set up for Elizabeth Peter 's ending it is worth the ride . Rest is peace lovely lady we will miss your flair and your humor .

No one has lived here for nearly 60 years , and the public is banned from its 628 acres . Now , after spending $ 100,000 on a 15 - year plan for Nomans Land , federal officials want it to stay that way . The Fish & Wildlife Service has recommended that Nomans Land be protected as federal wilderness , meaning that if the public wants a glimpse of this National Wildlife Refuge , options could be limited to a virtual tour on the Web or a magnifying scope on the Vineyard . The island , used as an aerial bombing range from 1943 to 1996 , is pocked with unexploded munitions that make one of Southern New England 's last wild places a potentially deadly hazard . \u201c I think it 's important to have a few places that are completely prohibited from the public , '' said Stephanie Koch , a US Fish & Wildlife Service biologist , who walked the beach at Nomans Land recently in search of a piping plover nest . \u201c I know that 's a hard sell for a lot of people . '' It 's also a reality that four Navy sweeps of the island since 1997 have not altered . Although munitions have been found , defused , and removed from the surface , an undetermined amount of bombs lie underground and undetected . \u201c The result could be catastrophic , '' Koch said of public access to Nomans Land . But this nightmare for human visitors is a blessing for its avian guests . Due to its undisturbed nature and shortage of predators , Nomans Land is an important stop on the Atlantic Flyway for songbirds migrating south as far as South America . Northern harriers , oystercatchers , roseate terns , catbirds , double - crested cormorants , and even piping plovers are a few of the many species that the Fish & Wildlife Service monitors in roughly six visits to the island each year . A few stone walls remain from homes and farms that once dotted the island , and a small family cemetery lies perilously close to an eroding 20 - foot cliff on the northern shore . Otherwise , Nomans Land is a deserted place . \u201c When I 'm out here , this feels as much like wilderness as any other place I 've been in New England , '' said Koch , as she savored a 360 - degree ocean view from the island 's 110 - foot summit . To that end , the Fish & Wildlife Service has recommended that Nomans Land be protected , which would preserve its natural , minimally managed solitude . Another option , which the service has offered but not recommended , would maintain the current oversight , which provides slightly more on - site management than for wilderness . A third possible option , among other changes , would expand federal management of Nomans , possibly clear additional trails , and develop a partnership with the Wampanoag tribe on Martha 's Vineyard that would allow limited access for cultural and ceremonial uses . Bettina Washington , historic preservation officer for the Aquinnah - based tribe , said an expanded Wampanoag connection with the island would be welcome . \u201c Our wish is , once again , at least to go over and pay our respects , '' said Washington , who has never visited Nomans Land . Wampanoag remains are believed to be buried on the island , which the tribe 's oral history says was created when Moshup , an ancestral giant , tossed a crab into the ocean . The origin of the island 's name is shrouded in mystery , but some evidence points to a reference to Tequenomans , an ancient Wampanoag sachem . Bartholomew Gosnold , an English explorer , sighted the island in 1602 , and more than three centuries of habitation followed until the Crane family sold Nomans Land to the Navy in 1952 . The island , nominally part of the Town of Chilmark , was transferred to the Department of the Interior in 1998 . The danger of buried munitions has led to fishing restrictions , as well as the ban on public access . Still , two unauthorized visitors walked the island after they anchored offshore . Roger Hoffman praised the beauty of the place . \u201c It 's a privilege to see it , '' Hoffman told Koch as they passed on an inland trail . That privilege , however , led to a $ 100 fine levied by a Fish & Wildlife Service officer . The 15 - year proposal for Nomans Land is among the plans required for National Wildlife Refuges across the country , Koch said , and will be finalized this fall before being submitted to the Northeast regional director of the Fish & Wildlife Service .

Directed with a pop-ish sensibility by Laurent Tirard ( Le Petit Nicolas ) , this effects - heavy , 3D-outfitted installment\u2013in which the mighty Gallic duo bring their magic and mustaches across the channel to save the Queen from Cesar 's army \u2013features a few decent gags and non-sequiturs amid an otherwise redundant storyline that begins to waver by the second act , and then just keeps on coming . With a purported budget of \u20ac 60 million ( $ 78 million ) and a cast of French film heavyweights including G\u00e9rard Depardieu , Catherine Deneuve and Dany Boon , Britannia should see big numbers in all Francophone territories , although they wo n't reach the heights of 2002 's Mission Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre , which remains both the best and highest domestic grosser of the bunch . The Bottom Line The mighty Gallic franchise dishes out a few solid laughs amid an overstretched , effects - laden adventure . Alongside Herg\u00e9's Tintin , writer / illustrator Ren\u00e9 Goscinny and artist Albert Uderzo 's Asterix series is undoubtedly the most beloved bande dessin\u00e9e in French history , with 300 - hundred - plus million copies of the 34 - book series sold in dozens of different languages , and three previous movies raking in a combined total of 30 - plus million local admissions . There 's even a national Asterix theme park , which , like its titular hero , has tried its best over the years to thwart an ongoing alien invasion ( in this case , by Mickey Mouse and the folks at Disneyland Paris ) . Based on Asterix in Britain and Asterix and the Normans , the scenario \u2014 co - written with Tirard regular Gr\u00e9goire Vigneron \u2014 takes a few cues from Alain Chabat 's Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre as it follows Asterix ( Edouard Baer , the third actor to take on the role after Clovis Cornillac and Christian Clavier ) and Obelix ( series stalwart Depardieu ) from their isolated enclave in Brittany to the heart of England circa 50 B.C. , where reigning Queen Cordelia ( Deneuve ) is hoping the two Gauls will rescue her nation from a siege by Julius Cesar ( Luchini ) and his army . Along the way , the Frenchies cross paths with an uptight Brit ( Guillaume Gallienne ) , his undersexed wife ( Charlotte Le Bon ) and their over - anal servant ( Val\u00e9rie Lemercier ) , resulting in lots of cultural clashes and commentaries on the age - old cross - Channel rivalry . Indeed , many \u2014 way too many \u2014 of the jokes here involve the various French cast members speaking their native language with ridiculous British accents ( an effect that will be lost on non- French speaking viewers ) , and while some such gags work initially , the film overstretches them across 110 minutes of action that , like the Romans surrounding Cordelia 's fort , winds up turning in circles . The bits involving a squad of invading Vikings ( the \u201c Normans \u201d ) are especially tedious and over - the -top , even if there are a few brief instances of cleverness , such as a scene where a Norman fighter ( Dany Boon ) is subjected to a Clockwork Orange - style lesson in English manners . Otherwise , Tirard and cinematographer Denis Rouden ( A Gang Story ) offer up lots of candy - colored set pieces \u2014 such as an ancient version of London called Londinium \u2014 and plenty of gorgeous landscapes in a continent - hopping co-production that shot in Hungary , Ireland and Malta . Visual effects by Mac Guff and supervisor Kevin Berger ( Days of Glory ) are tongue- in - cheek in the spirit of the original comics , adding panache to a movie that has a very hard time maintaining interest through the final standoff . Baer ( Chicken With Plums ) manages to dish out a few witty one - liners and tends to underplay things , while Depardieu is truly larger than life as the all - powerful Obelix , sporting a pair of XXXXL striped pants that he wears up to his neckline . But the real star here may be Vincent Lacoste ( Les Beaux Gosses ) , who winningly portrays a blas\u00e9 teenager completely indifferent to the ongoing antics \u2014 best reflecting how much this waning franchise needs a boost of young talent to stay fresh . Projection at the Paris screening caught was a bit on the dim side , while the 3D itself seemed both harmless and superfluous . Although Britannia officially opens October 17 , it premiered last week at the Dinard Film Festival and is currently being publicly previewed in theatres throughout France .

The basic aims were : to hide ( as much as possible ) variations in PC models and hardware from the OS and applications , and to make OS and application development easier ( because the BIOS services handled most of the hardware level interface ) . These BIOS services are still used ( especially during bootup ) , and are often named \" BIOS functions \" . In Real Mode , they can be easily accessed through software interrupts , using Assembly language . Contents To access a BIOS function , you generally set the AH CPU register ( or AX , or EAX ) to a particular value , and then do an INT opcode . The value in AH ( or AX , or EAX ) , combined with the particular interrupt number selected requests a specific BIOS function . ( Other CPU registers hold any \" arguments \" to the function , and often the return values from the function , also . ) It is simplest to create a listing of BIOS functions by specifying the interrupt number , and the value of AH ( or AX , or EAX ) that selects the function . It is also easiest to refer to particular BIOS functions this way in discussions . For example , INT 0 x13 , AH=0 is a BIOS function that resets hard disks or floppy disks . Note : the INT and AH values are always listed in hexadecimal notation . Accidentally using a decimal value in an INT opcode is a very common source of errors when using BIOS functions . To an extent , the BIOS functions are organized by interrupt number : The exhaustive list of BIOS functions is available from RBIL . Unfortunately , the PC industry has never been good about maintaining standards . So each PC manufacturer and each BIOS manufacturer randomly made up new BIOS functions . It is also possible to \" hook \" any of these interrupts , and insert extra functions that mimic BIOS functions . Early PC hardware and software manufacturers did this often . So there ended up being literally thousands of BIOS functions ( or mimics ) . The RBIL list is enormous , and is mostly filled with functions that only work when combined with some completely obsolete computer , BIOS , or piece of hardware or software . Unfortunately , RBIL does not clearly indicate which BIOS functions are \" generic \" ( in some sense ) . That is , the ones that are always available , and that everyone uses . Partially this is because the \" standard \" BIOS functions grew over time , so if you go back far enough in time you can usually find a computer that does not support almost any specific BIOS function . But there is definitely a set that is commonly used in most current OSes . ( see ATA using BIOS for more detail on these BIOS function calls ) ( see Detecting Memory ( x86 ) for more detail on these BIOS function calls ) Each BIOS function ( as described in RBIL ) has a specific set of \" result \" registers . Beyond those listed registers , the BIOS functions are supposed to perfectly preserve all the other register values . Early versions of Bochs ( below 2.3 ) had a small problem with this . The lower halves of all the 32bit extended registers ( ie. EBX , ECX ) were preserved properly , but the upper words of some of the registers got trashed . The BIOS functions themselves should never crash . On any error they will : Try to always test these error returns , because in many circumstances the BIOS functions might appear to be returning valid ( but very wrong ) data -- rather than an error code . Unfortunately , in Protected mode , almost all BIOS functions become unavailable , and trying to call them nonetheless will result in exceptions or unreliable responses ( because of the different way segment values are handled ) . Some newer services however ( such as SMBios , PCI , PnP , or VBE ) offer an interface that is compatible with 32 bit Protected Mode . If you must use Real Mode BIOS functions after the CPU has been switched into Protected Mode , then see Virtual 8086 Mode , or perhaps exit Protected Mode , and momentarily return to Real Mode . Both methods have serious problems , and therefore any calls to the BIOS should be done before any physical device is programmed by your code : The only device that 's mostly exempt from these problems is the Video BIOS , which is not generally bundled with your motherboard and therefore ca n't rely on BIOS services either . Most current OSes - commercial and hobbyist alike - use a v 8086 monitor or emulator to support graphics devices without a native driver so many BIOSes have been tested against such a set -up . Just like in Protected Mode , BIOS functions are unavailable in Long Mode too . Unfortunately there 's no Virtual 8086 Mode to come to the rescue . It is necessary to momentarily switch to Real Mode , or to emulate a CPU and interpret opcodes by software . All necessary information for the latter approach can be found in Intel and AMD documentation . Most of the useful information you get from the BIOS will come from calling BIOS functions . However , there is a small amount of additional information that can be acquired . Some of the BIOS detection / state result is stored in the BIOS Data Area . Additional information is kept in the CMOS chip .","annotations":[{"text":"the CPU","span":[3923,3929],"token_span":[749,750],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The concrete or abstract entity that undergoes a change."},{"text":"the CPU","span":[3923,3929],"token_span":[749,750],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location that the change takes place."},{"text":"Protected Mode","span":[4016,4029],"token_span":[767,768],"role":"Initial_category","label":"Initial_category","role_definition":"The category that the Entity belongs to before it undergoes the change."},{"text":"Real Mode","span":[4059,4067],"token_span":[774,775],"role":"Final_category","label":"Final_category","role_definition":"The type of Entity that results from the change."}],"trigger":null},"split":"test","frame_definition":"An Entity changes, either in its category membership, its situation, or in terms of the quality of an Attribute.","frame_ancestors":["Transition_to_state","Event"],"frame_descendants":["Improvement_or_decline","Nuclear_process","Undergo_transformation"]},{"instance_id":"EN-1222-294-frame-Undergo_transformation","frame":"Undergo_transformation","frame_gloss":"","report":{"text":"By mid-2005 , al-qaeda. net ran the only remaining node .

You 've received a subscription notice and are receiving this message now because you were a member of the cypherpunks@al-qaeda.net or cypherpunks@jfet.org mailing list before it went offline several ( ? ) weeks ago . First , my sincerest apologies for having failed to notice that messages were silently dropping . All the bounces were still dropping into my \" cypherpunks bounces \" mailbox , so from what I could tell all was running normally ( if perhaps at slightly low SNR ) . It turns out that some package upgrade , most likely a new version of perl , broke majordomo . ( And of course , could I have picked a worse time to break everything ? ) Well , that 's the bad news . The good news is that cypherpunks is now powered by Mailman , and should be a bit more reliable , easier to maintain , and less Rube-Goldbergian . ( I say this with all respect to my cpunk admin predecessors ; the CDR was a useful and interesting piece of software , but --- at least , in its most recent form --- it was certainly not a * pretty * piece of software . ) Nevertheless , since I have n't actually done much other than port the old majordomo list over to mailman , the Distributed Remailer functionality no longer obtains .

Human Rights Watch called on Congress to amend federal law that permits children under age 18 to work for hire in agriculture at far younger ages , for far longer hours , and in far more hazardous conditions than in any other industry . In its 99 - page report , \" Fields of Peril : Child Labor in US Agriculture , \" Human Rights Watch found that child farmworkers risked their safety , health , and education on commercial farms across the United States . For the report , Human Rights Watch interviewed 59 children under age 18 who had worked as farmworkers in 14 states in various regions of the United States . \" The United States is a developing country when it comes to child farmworkers , \" said Zama Coursen - Neff , author of the report and deputy director of the Children 's Rights Division at Human Rights Watch . \" Children who pick America 's food should at least have the same protections as those who serve it . \" Child farmworkers as young as 12 years old often work for hire for 10 or more hours a day , five to seven days a week , Human Rights Watch found . Some start working part-time at age 6 or 7 . Children , like many adult farmworkers , typically earn far less than minimum wage , and their pay is often further cut because employers underreport hours and force them to spend their own money on tools , gloves , and drinking water that their employers should provide by law . Agriculture is the most dangerous work open to children in the United States , according to the Centers for Disease Control 's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) . Children risk pesticide poisoning , serious injury , and heat illness . They suffer fatalities at more than four times the rate of children working in other jobs . Some work without even the most basic protective gear , including shoes or gloves . Many told Human Rights Watch that their employers did not provide drinking water , hand - washing facilities , or toilets . Girls and women in these jobs are exceptionally vulnerable to sexual abuse . As a result of their long working hours , children who do agricultural work drop out of school at four times the national rate . Human Rights Watch interviewed many children who had been held back in school one or more times and who said that no one in their families had graduated from high school . Human Rights Watch called on the US Congress to amend the law governing child labor - the Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) - to end discrimination against child farmworkers . In other occupations , the law prohibits the employment of children under age 14 , and limits children under 16 to three hours of work a day when school is in session . In agriculture , however , children can work on any farm at age 12 , and at any age on a small farm . Unlike for other jobs , the law sets no limit on how early in the morning , how late at night , or how many hours children can work in agriculture , as long as they do not work during school hours . In addition , the law allows 16 and 17- year - olds to work under hazardous conditions in agriculture ; in all other occupations the minimum age for hazardous work is 18 . \" The current child labor law was drafted in the 1930 's when many more children worked on family farms , but that era is long gone , \" Coursen - Neff said . \" It 's time the US updated its antiquated child labor laws to give children who work for hire in agriculture the same protections as all other working children . \" In September 2009 , Congresswoman Lucille Roybal - Allard of California introduced the Children 's Act for Responsible Employment ( HR 3564 ) in the House of Representatives . It has over 80 co-sponsors , and has been endorsed by over 80 organizations , including the AFL - CIO , American Federation of Teachers , NAACP , and United Farm Workers of America . No action has been taken on the bill , however . Even the currently weak laws are poorly enforced . Enforcement of child labor laws overall by the US Department of Labor declined dramatically between 2001 and 2009 . The US Department of Labor found only 36 cases of child labor violations in agriculture in 2009 , constituting only 4 percent of all child labor violations . Pesticide safety regulations of the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) make no special provisions for children . Lax enforcement is exacerbated by workers ' fears of reporting violations to authorities . Some 85 percent of crop workers in the United States are Hispanic . While many child farmworkers are US citizens , their parents may be undocumented or hold short - term agricultural visas , leaving the entire family in fear of deportation . Labor standards and their enforcement apply to all workers , irrespective of their immigration status . Human Rights Watch called on the US Department of Labor to substantially increase its efforts to identify and punish the illegal use of child labor . All states should set or raise the minimum age for agricultural work to at least 14 , Human Rights Watch said . Child labor on US farms also violates the United States 's international legal obligations under the Worst Forms of Child Labor Convention of the International Labor Organization ( ILO ) . In March the ILO Committee of Experts expressed serious concerns regarding the significant number of injuries and fatalities suffered by children in US agriculture , and the exemptions in US law that allow young children to work . The committee called on the United States to take immediate action to comply with its treaty obligations . On May 10 , 2010 , the United States will join over 80 other countries at a global child labor conference hosted by the Dutch government in The Hague . A goal of the conference is better enforcement of the Worst Forms of Child Labor Convention , with a focus on agriculture . \" The United States spends over $ 25 million a year - more than all other countries combined - to eliminate child labor abroad , yet is tolerating exploitative child labor in its own backyard , \" Coursen - Neff said . Voices of children , parents , and farmers : \" I really did n't have a childhood , and I do n't want [ my own children ] to go through what I did . You 're a kid only once . Once you get old you have to work . \" - 17- year - old boy who had been cutting Christmas trees , picking tomatoes , and working in other crops since age 12 in North Carolina \" [ When I was 12 ] they gave me my first knife .

Biker gangs have made the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally a violence - marred affair in the past . The rally , which draws about half a million people each August to the Black Hills in western South Dakota , has since gotten older , laid - back and more diverse . This year , gunshots about 75 miles away reminded attendees about the gangs . Authorities said two men affiliated with the Hells Angels shot and wounded five Outlaws Motorcycle Club members in Custer State Park earlier this week . Suzanne Church , who has ministered to biker gang members at Sturgis since 1997 , said she hopes there 's no more violence . \" We hate to see people die and go to hell , \" she said . The rally attracts bikers of all walks of life , who ride throughout the Black Hills , a patch of forest and valleys 100 miles long and 50 miles wide on South Dakota 's western edge . Sturgis , a town of about 7,000 , is on the northern edge of the Hills , while Custer State Park is in the south . Some Hells Angels members own land near Sturgis , so the gang has a presence at every rally , said Jim Bush , Sturgis police chief . Law enforcement officers knew that hundreds of Outlaws members planned to gather at a rented southern Hills campground , Bush said . The Outlaws are one of the nation 's four largest motorcycle gangs , along with the Hells Angels , Pagans and Bandidos . The Outlaws have chapters in 20 states , Europe , Canada and Australia . A posting on its Web site said law enforcement agencies were informed of the group 's plans to attend Sturgis . It said : \" We are not going there to makes any type of statement , or display of power . We are simply going there to enjoy the Sturgis venue , see the historical sights and spend time withour Brothers . \" Authorities have their own term for the gangs . \" We classify these organizations as crime syndicates , \" said Bernard Zapor , special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives field office in St. Paul , Minn . The last major violence involving motorcycle gangs during the Sturgis rally was in 1990 , when a Sons of Silence member shot an Outlaws gang member during a bar brawl in which two other Sons of Silence members were stabbed . \" They have not changed , \" Bush said of the major gangs . \" They 're as organized and involved in crime as they ever have been . \" It was one of only a few major rally - related incidents of violence , Bush said . The only other gang arrests have been three or four members picked up for unrelated crime , he said . \" They usually get along pretty good , \" Bush said . In Tuesday 's shooting , Chad John Wilson , 30 , of Lynnwood , Wash . , and John James Midmore , 32 , of Valparaiso , Ind. , face five counts of attempted first-degree murder . A judge set bond Thursday at $ 5 million each . One victim was still in critical condition at Rapid City Regional Hospital on Thursday . Another was in stable condition at a Sioux Falls hospital , said Sara Rabern of the South Dakota Attorney General 's office . On Main Street in Sturgis , a few people wearing Hells Angels vests and T-shirts were spotted at the 66th annual rally , which ends Sunday . The gang runs a vendor table that sells club pins , T-shirts , bumper stickers and other items . None of three men staffing the table wanted to discuss the shooting . A worker at a tattoo shop down the street that the gang runs also refused comment . Jim Vlahakis , state Division of Criminal Investigation director , said more than 300 Outlaws members representing 119 different chapters have been seen in the area , along with 80 to 100 Hells Angels members . Vlahakis said authorities plan to meet with the two gangs to \" try to head off any potential problems \" but had not done so as of Thursday . Officers were prepared to respond to gang violence , Bush said , adding that eventual retaliation is likely . \" It may not happen here , \" Bush said . \" It could happen a month from now \" somewhere else . ___ On the Net : Outlaws : http://www.outlawsmc.com/ Hells Angels : http://www.hells-angels.com/ Copyright 2006 The Associated Press .

I heard about it from Phil Jupitus ' twitterings . I 'd hastily followed him before I realised it was THE Phil Jupitus , dur ! The idea was brilliant - ish and was for everyone to get hold of and watch a really bad movie called The Happening ( trust me it is really bloody awful ) and after all hitting PLAY at 9 PM everyone would be free to use the \u201c # badmovieclub \u201d hashtag whilst twittering . The experience was hilarious . Some people had clicked play a few seconds early and were spoiling the film for the rest of us . I spent most of my time reading the comments rather than watching the film and giggling at the tweets which were automatically refreshed if you used Tweet Deck to automatically show anything ( see below ) . The actual experience of course could have been better , there were far too many people tweeting at once , it was almost impossible to keep up with the fire - hose flood of tweets , some of which were n't very good - such as the endless \u201c EXPOSITION ! \u201d heckling but despite all that I loved it . It was like going to see a film in a cinema where the audience are guaranteed to be rowdy , which for most films would be your worst nightmare but for some films , this approach is perfect . I know it 's as corny as bees but I felt like I was part of something , which for a medium which is becoming increasingly fragmentary as people simply do n't get together to watch anything . But the really important thing , for me , was that Graham has shown us with a simple experiment a perfect prototype for what video content such as films , football matches and even education could be . This is the future and it 's a future where the asynchronous , such as DVDs and YouTube videos and films you 've downloaded can be re-synchronized with the added goodness of the juice of real people . Imagine \u2026 what it would be like to watch a really bad film , only instead of having to use a different application the tweets appeared nicely overlaying the film - that 'd be sexy . Now imagine if you could limit the tweets to just people you follow , that would cut out a lot of noise . But it may cut out too much noise , so let 's maybe let through tweets from people outside our immediate circle of friends that have been thumbs - upped by their friends , this might just let the funny ones through . Or maybe , what if you received tweets at a certain rate , so that if your friends were n't commenting on the film then \u201c outsiders \u201d tweets would bleed through . Now imagine you were late to the party and were watching the film on Saturday , that need n't matter because you could still see the film with tweets because they have all been time - synch - ed with the film . So , not only will it feel like a synchronous experience , you can add to it in a way that the person hopelessly late to the party on Sunday can still enjoy ( and contribute to ) . Now imagine , that someone writes a search engine that searches for \u201c bees \u201d or \u201c cheese and crackers \u201d that simply assumes what people are tweeting about whilst watching a film ( no matter how you do it ) has something to do with what 's going on onscreen ( even if it 's just a piss - take ) . Then , we have a means of gathering really messy meta data about a film and become able to search it ( or link to it ) textually for the first time . There would be groups of film buffs collaboratively adding the dialogue to \u201c the classics \u201d just as people pitch in and help with mapping streets for the open source community in no time . Film courses would create a meta-layer where they offer their commentary on a film \u201c just look at the camera angles used here \u201d and you can watch it and here 's the good bit , even if you do n't have access to the movie but do have access to tools like BitTorrent . Imagine a group of comedians being assembled to \u201c watch and comment \u201d on a film . I 'd pay to be able to switch on the layer that made the film funnier . Imagine a pair of glasses that did that for a romantic film you really did n't want to watch , I do n't know many blokes who would n't pay for a pair of those \u2026 with earplugs . The next step this experiment needs to take is to create a software player that can play stuff from wherever ( YouTube , DVD , hard disk , stream ) and that hooks into twitter . It 's not hard to do and then you 'd be able to layer comments on a film , and then choose to filter those comments to just friends or just film buffs or even \u201c selected hilarious tweets \u201d from Graham himself . The important bit is that the movie industry do n't need to know about it , we do n't need their permission or copyright to share time - coded knob jokes and if people are watching the film in a cinema , playing a legal DVD or an illegal download does n't make any difference . All that matters is the people , the timing and the quality of the gag . So there , The Happening was awful , great fun and massively important - you should 've been there - it was the future of film \u2026 ish . Responses - Twitter , Growl , Boosh !

More than 10 years work has seen James Cook University Research Fellow Dr Mark Norman discover more than 150 new species of the eight - armed creature , 45 in Australian waters alone . Indeed the work of this detective of the deep has proved a big hit with international documentary makers . Two new nature films exploring his work are to air overseas within the next few months . Brisbane reporter John Taylor interviewed Dr Mark Norman about what it is he finds so fascinating about the octopus . JOHN TAYLOR : Next week marks the 30th anniversary of man setting foot on the moon . But while we can explore another celestial body , we still really do n't know what we 're sharing our own planet with . The work of James Cook University Marine Biologist , Dr Mark Norman , is proof of that . In over 10 years of researching octopuses , Dr Mark Norman and his team have found more than 150 species of octopuses around the world that no - one knew were there . In fact , he 's doubled the number of known octopuses . Forty - five of them were in Australian waters and what he 's found is startling . MARK NORMAN : It 's not like they 'd be easily missed . Some of them are 3 metre arm spans and 10 kilograms with , you know , suckers the size of golf balls and all that sort of stuff and it was just a case of not looking in the right places at the right time , I suppose . JOHN TAYLOR : He 's found most of these weird critters , as he calls them , in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans , and off Southern Australia . MARK NORMAN : They come in all sorts of shapes and sizes . We 've got pygmies that sit on your finger nail and are fully mature at under one gram . We 've got things with really long , spaghetti-like arms with 2 metre arm spans , like daddy long leg spiders that run around on sand and mud surfaces , and we 've got other ones that drop their arms like drop-tailed lizards , and some are hairy and look like little bushes walking around . I suppose the most amazing thing about octopuses is their capacity to change colour and to change shape , so we 've got ones that can go from dark chocolate brown and dead smooth to be a spiky , cream coloured seaweed to move on and then be a mottled coloured piece of coral . And probably the most exciting animal we 've seen in recent times is one we 've nicknamed the \" mimic octopus \" which is actually mimicking other poisonous animals so it 's impersonating sea snakes and some poisonous flounders and line fish . That 's where we 've been getting some of the interest from film crews . JOHN TAYLOR : Interest indeed . Dr Norman and his work have been the subject now of four international nature films , two of which are due to be released soon . But it is any wonder there 's such interest when the biggest octopus he 's found weighs up to 200 kilograms with an 8 metre arm span . MARK NORMAN : The octopus is probably the sneaky predators and that 's why not many people have had much experience with them . They tend to be either super camouflaged if they 're out during the day or the ones that come out at night just do it all under the cover of darkness . So , we 've been to lots of places where people say oh , I 've lived here 20 years and I 've never seen an octopus and we 'll do a drive under their local pier and see 20 in a dive . So , I think it 's ... their main issue is they have no armour , they have no spikes , they have no skeleton , so they 're basically a meal walking around , sort of a whole pile of meat walking around , so to stop them being eaten by any passing shark or fish they have to be really clever and sneaky and do complex behaviours or mimic things or camouflage or squirt ink or do all sorts of things . So , most people 's experience with octopus is a chewy bit on a pizza or something like that . When you watch these things wandering around in their natural environments , they 're kind of like watching martians wandering around . It 's just a spectacular behaviour . JOHN TAYLOR : Dr Norman says he 's learnt through his long experience there is no such thing as a stereo typical octopus , but one thing that he is increasingly finding puzzling is why the Australian fishing industry has n't cottoned on to the octopuses ' money making potential . MARK NORMAN : Small countries off West Africa export up to 50,000 tonnes of octopus a year , reaping them hundreds of millions of dollars worth of income each year . We export 72 tonnes of octopus a year and yet we 've got the greatest diversity and one of the highest number of octopuses in the world in Australian waters .

Background One Canadian volunteer 's story of training in minor landing craft operations during WW2 . Thousands of landing craft of many different types , broadly categorised as minor and major according to size , were deployed on D Day . To operate these flat bottomed craft , with their challenging sailing characteristics , required a well trained force of Navy personnel . Their primary task was to safely deliver hundreds of thousands of troops and their equipment onto unimproved landing beaches against entrenched enemy positions - a crucial prerequisite to the opening of the long awaited second front in the west . [ Photo ; Kendal Kidder 's war medals and the now inscribed stone he gathered from a Normandy beach nearly 40 years after his first visit . The medals are ( bottom left to right ) : The France and Germany Star ; The Africa Star ; The Italy Star ; The 1939 - 1945 Star ; The Victory Medal ; Canadian Volunteer Service Medal with clasp for Overseas Service and The Defence Medal . ] Kendal Kidder 's light hearted and often humerous account belies the reality of his experiences in North Africa , Sicily , Italy and Normandy . The stone he recovered from a Normandy beach is inscribed Arromanches , NORMANDY , 6 June 1944 , K Kidder , 8 10 1983 ( ? ) . His son , John Kidder recalled , \" Dad picked up the pebble from the beach at Arromanches when we travelled en famille to France in 1983 for my sister 's wedding . It was one of the very few times , perhaps the only time , that I ever saw him cry . \" Over 4,000 landing craft of many types and sizes were required for the invasion of Europe , which became known as D-Day . Every one had a unique role to play . Their design and operating techniques were constantly under review , as feedback from training exercises and operational experience was assimilated . A large training base for minor landing craft training was set up at Inveraray in the west of Scotland . It was named ' The No 1 Combined Training Centre ' , of which HMS Quebec was the naval component . The task was to train the expanding army invasion force with training in the latest amphibious landing techniques , including embarkation and disembarkation onto the landing beaches . The Navy and Royal Marine crews for the landing craft also needed training in seamanship and the operation of the various minor landing craft . There was an acute shortage of Royal Navy manpower for the latter , so Canada provided 60 officers and 300 men for training under the Combined Operations Command , a significant part of which was at Inveraray . The Canadian Navy insisted that the men be kept together as a Canadian unit ' attached Royal Navy ' and not posted individually among Royal Navy Combined Ops personnel . These men worked together throughout the war , forming strong bonds of friendship and loyalty , which continued in the post war years . This is the story of Kendall ' Happy ' Kidder 's training for war , taken from the testimony of his friends and shipmates , his letters to family members and the recollections of his wife Jill . Officer Training It was April 21 , 1941 , when Kendall became Probationary Sub Lieutenant Kidder in the Royal Canadian Navy Volunteer Reserve . His application had , however , not been plain sailing . A rather fussy Navy Recruitment Officer , on learning that Kendall was born in Mogollen , New Mexico , a small mining town where his father had been working at the time , gave him the address of the Air Force recruiting station with the encouraging information that \" they will take anybody . \" However , with a bit of perseverance , he was later assured that his name would be added to the Navy list of those with officer potential on completion of the appropriate form . [ Jake Warren ] [ Photo ; A team of Canadian sailors ( stokers ) taking part in a Tug -of - War game during the sports day of HMCS NIOBE , Greenock , Scotland . In the background are spectators and a PT instructor as the official . \u00a9 IWM ( A 17260 ) . ] Kendall was somewhat taken aback when the form he was given was for an able seaman . The authorities apparently regarded him as a mere landsman , without any seafaring background or experience . So , with a little bit of imagination , some vacation experience in surveying and prospecting up north was transformed into ' extensive experience with small craft in inland waters . ' It worked ! By the fall , Kendall attended the officer training establishment at Royal Roads on Vancouver Island . Recruitment had been stepped up a few gears to meet the demands of both the Canadian and British Navies . There were 125 officers in each intake with an average age of 22 . The training period of about 4 months included navigation , small boat handling , gunnery , seamanship etc . War seemed a long way off until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour on December 7th , 1941 . For a while , rumours abounded that the Japanese were invading the west coast of Canada , resulting in the issue of some .45 rifles ' to repel boarders . ' Hazardous Mission Around this time , Commander Grant called twenty of us into his office . We were all single ; the oldest was thirty . He told us that officers and men were needed for service overseas in what he described as a ' hazardous mission . ' Fourteen volunteers were required from among the officer cadets at Royal Roads . Anyone not interested , for whatever reason , would be excused without any blemish on his record . Two dropped out for family reasons . Slips containing the names of the remainder were placed in a hat and fourteen volunteers were chosen at random . As I understand it , a similar process was carried out at King 's College in Halifax , where another group of sub-lieutenants were taking their training . A total of twenty - eight officers were thus selected , including Kendall . [ Bill Sinclair ] By February 1942 , Kendall was in Halifax , Nova Scotia , awaiting passage to Scotland and an uncertain future .... We arrived here last Saturday night and reported on Sunday morning . I did quite a bit of shopping , bought a new pair of boots and had my old ones fixed , got a new strap for my watch , besides a hundred and one other things . Your Christmas parcel was here when I arrived and it was grand to have a second Christmas . The train ride from Montreal to here is anything but a pleasure and this miserable town is anything but an enticing goal . I have never seen filth to equal it . We have n't as yet been able to find a room or even get a chance to live in barracks , so we are living in a much too expensive hotel . We have n't any idea when we will be leaving but it ca n't come any too quickly to suit me . For the last three days we have been doing PT ( physical training ) for three hours every afternoon , at this point every muscle in my body is very sore and very stiff . My address here is : Nelson Barracks , Fleet Mail Office . [ Kendall Kidder in letter to parents . ] At Halifax , the officers and men from Royal Roads met their counterparts from ' Kings ' and were briefed on what lay ahead . The ' hazardous duty ' , for which the men had volunteered , was Combined Operations , whose primary mission was to plan and train for the invasion of Europe by amphibious landings . This scenario proved accurate when the nature of Kendall 's training became known . Churchill was the prime mover in setting up the Combined Operations Command to ensure the three services worked closely together as a unified force , where inter-service communication and cooperation would be strengthened and inter-service rivalry avoided , thus producing a much more effective invading force . Combined Operations The name could not be better , for although clad in blue and paid by the Senior Service , nearly all the work is with the Army . It is very difficult to tell where the Navy leaves off and the Army takes on . On approaching an opposed beach , the Navy and Army officers together have to decide whether it is advisable to land or not and each thinks of the other 's problems before coming to a decision . Our work entails not only landing Commando and Assault troops but also tanks , guns , heavy lorries , jeeps , ammunition , gas , water , and many supplies . So we deal with every branch of the Army . [ Ian Barclay . ] Training bases for ' minor ' landing craft were set up at Hayling Island on the south coast of England and at Inveraray in Scotland . The first Canadian flotillas joined the RN in January of 1942 . Kendall was posted to HMCS Niobe in Scotland on March 1 , 1942 . It was the main manning and pay depot for the Canadian Navy in the UK .... a gloomy brick building , which had been a mental hospital called the ' Smithston Poorhouse and Asylum ' , known locally as the ' loony bin ! ' [ Map ; The remote location of the No1 Combined Training Centre on Loch Fyne with the many landing beaches identified . ] Landing Craft Training There were many types of landing craft in use but Kendall would be involved with three . Landing Craft Infantry Large ( LCI L ) . Thirty of these boats were entrusted to 850 officers and crew of the RCN . They were 260 feet long with a 24 foot beam . They carried two officers , with a third during the Normandy landings , and a crew of 20 to 25 men . These ships could carry 250 fully armed soldiers , who , if necessary , could be bunked down in two shifts . [ Luke Williams . ] - Landing Craft Assault ( LCA ) . This craft was without a doubt the outstanding one of all assault craft . Extreme length about 41 feet , beam 10 feet 2 inches , draft of 1 foot aft and 9 inches forward . Its maximum carrying capacity was 35 fully equipped men , discharging them by means of a lowered ramp . The LCA at slow speeds was a most silent craft and capable of beaching without giving its position away due to noise . - Landing Craft Mechanised ( LCM ) . These craft were designed to be carried on larger ships and lowered into the sea near the destination . They were used to rush ashore equipment required by the initial assault troops . The carrying capacity 35 tons . - [ Photo ; troops going ashore in an early morning landing exercise on the shores of Loch Fyne . These landing craft was crewed by RNVR personnel attached to Combined Operations . ] The initial drafts from Canada arrived in Scotland and soon were shipped to Hayling Island east of Portsmouth for initial training in the smaller ' landing craft assault ' LCA 's , for about three weeks . Hayling Island had somewhat the same shape as Portsmouth , so , on occasions , lights in the fields were dimly lit to appear much like Portsmouth to the German bomber pilots . This ruse gave Portsmouth some relief from the daily bombing the civilians suffered . Did n't please the farmers of Hayling Island much to become the target . [ Bob Crothers . ] After this initial training , the Canadians were drafted to HMS Quebec near Inveraray on Loch Fyne in Scotland , the main Combined training establishment , where literally hundreds of thousands of Allied troops were trained . The Canadian sailors familiarised themselves with the various landing craft , while training the Army in safely embarking and disembarking onto ' hostile ' shores . This was undertaken mainly on the shores of Loch Fyne under realistic conditions , including simulated air attack by 516 Squadron . [ Photo opposite ; Hurricanes ' attacking ' a landing beach off Furnace on Loch Fyne . ] After HMS Northney on Hayling Island , we entrained for Scotland and took the MacBrayne 's paddle steamer for the tourist trip to HMS Quebec at Inveraray . There were time intervals between basic training and the more serious exercises leading up to major raids and invasions . Before these exercises , there was a pleasantly relaxed time at Quebec with light duties due to recurrent breakdowns and shortage of boats . The elastic discipline of Combined Ops kept the men together at Inveraray . We waited to learn rope tricks and cliff climbing , the threatened characteristics of Commando activity , but found they were not in our job description after all . So Quebec turned out to be a lot less demanding than we had expected . In fact quite the contrary . Time was on our hands . Some of us had tea with the Duke of Argyle , while others used ' Mill 's ' bombs to fish his salmon streams , climb his mountains and explore his deer park land . The light ' casualties ' among his sheep were suspect . Some of us had leave with all the pleasant , exciting , educating experiences of days in the British Isles . But then we were called together . For a while we had our own ships to carry our landing craft about . They were strange creations indeed . HMS Iris and HMS Daffodil were called Landing ships ( stern chutes ) . They could carry thirteen LCA ' s mounted on trolleys . The LCAs were picked up in the stern chute and hauled up onto the main deck and then , by a complicated switching system , made snug on three tracks on the covered deck . The main excitement was launching the craft by pushing them to the chute one by one and watching them race down the track and plunge into the sea , splashing up a great wall of water . Very spectacular but we could n't quite crowd out of our minds the possibility that the LCA 's would just keep on going down to Davy Jone 's locker , though it never happened to us . I dread to think what would have happened if we had to launch in rough weather .. . I believe this method of launching was later abandoned . Our LCA 's were then moored on the Ayrshire coast . We were housed in Jimmy the One huts and tents at HMS Dundonald . The pubs of the harbour were well used . Our camp was surrounded by a barbed wire fence ; some enterprising matelots found them penetrable ... Len Birkenes and others went back and forth through the fence to enjoy Scottish hospitality . The largest exercises were Schuyt 1 and Schuyt 2 manned by Combined Operations . The name picked was that of a class of agreeable small Dutch vessels carrying cargo about the peacetime European coast and waterways . A number had escaped the Nazis and now worked on the British coastline . In conception and organization , these exercises were planting the seed that matured on D-Day . The exercise troops were loaded from the mainland and great excitement was present , since the beaches would be attended by dignitaries including King George VI , Winston Churchill and our new chief , Lord Louis Mountbatten . They had assembled to witness the ' shape of things to come . ' [ A fellow officer . ] The training was perhaps less physically demanding than some officers were led to believe but there were still challenging moments when unfamiliar situations arose . The strange new world of landing craft , tides , currents , cold wind , rain and darkness beckoned those of us who were raw recruits , still getting used to the grub , currency and customs of a new land . In Scotland the heather looked lovely through the early morning mist and sun . We acquainted ourselves with further landing craft and their side effects - wetness , oil , hunger and tiredness . A strong bond was forged among this Combined Operations group of officers and ratings , which still exists today . Officers cried orders in the pitch dark as we trained . ' Keep closed up ! ' or ' Out kedge ! ' and just before hitting the beach , ' Down door ! ' and ' Up door !'. Seamen strained at the cranks on the windlass as the coxswains worked the helm and motors against unfamiliar tides and currents . We were green but learning fast . The seamen , good naturedly , accused the stokers of being seamen with their brains bashed in but those same stokers never let us down and it was sure good to have someone you could count on . No one wanted to be left stranded on the beach , nor were they . This was an unwritten law . [ Seaman Doug Harrison . ] The Canadian stokers are mentioned many times in the annals of Canadian Combined Ops , always with praise . Our craft were the various types of assault boats driven by Diesel and gasoline engines . The Canadian stokers ( mechanics ) were very adapted to this sort of work and received much praise from all those who came in contact with them . Our greatest difficulty was trying to keep them with us as , several senior officers of the Royal Navy thought they should have some of them . [ Ian Barclay . ] There were lighter moments too , as exampled by Kidder 's natural talent for being in the centre of any slightly ' dubious ' activity that was going on . One story , which spawned a number of variants , concerned a docking operation in front of Admiralty House in Inveraray . Kidder 's craft went aground and , without giving it a moment 's thought , he stripped off his clothes ( except cap ) and went overboard to lay a kedge anchor to winch the craft off the obstruction ... as Commodore Coltart and guests , newly returned from a church service , watched in amazement ! Ken was on the carpet next morning but beat the rap when a kindly Aussie pointed out that the buoy marking the shoal was of the wrong type . It was a middle ground buoy , indicating safe passage on either side . Later the story was embellished in the telling . This time the docking manoeuvre took place in front of the WRNS ( women 's navy service ) training establishment . Kidder ordered his men to strip off , jump into the waters below and free the craft ... all in full view of any WRNS ' lucky ' enough to have been watching . However a WRNS officer was not amused and she lodged a complaint about the exposure of her charges to what we would call today the ' full Monty ! ' End of Training May 1942 . I was so glad to get your letter dated April 9 saying that you had received my first letter . It is a relief to know that they actually do get across . I was beginning to think they were on a one way street , because I had received all of yours . I had n't numbered them but , starting with this one as one , I 'll keep track of all I write . We are through with our training now and are working with the army . Our job does n't require much brain work and I feel I could be learning a lot more if I was back in general service at sea but , if we are wanted here , I guess we must make the most of it . In all the time we have been here , over a month and a half , I have n't even had a chance to go to town and I am afraid we are all getting slightly bushed . For the last week or so , we have had a lot of fun exploring an old silver mine that is about a mile from camp . The mine is owned by the Duke of Argyll , who seems to own everything in these parts , the roads are even privately owned . Several went down to see him last Sunday . He is very interested in Canada , because his uncle , Lord Tweedsmuir was Governor - General . When he came back to the estate , Lord Tweedsmuir built a log cabin and planted a large number of silver maples . They are big trees now and the only ones I have seen since I have been over . I am so glad you are sending a parcel . The one thing we miss more than anything else is good Canadian chocolate but there is no need to try to send too much . English cigarettes are horrible and it is virtually impossible to get woollen clothing . We would all enjoy the occasional magazine , just to look at the food ads . [ Kendall Kidder . ] During wartime , the information servicemen could give in their letters home was very restricted . Kendall 's letters do not , for example , describe the nature of the training , precise locations or times . It was only in the post war period that his wartime experiences and his letters could be put into context . Kendall 's Crew They are just about as good a bunch of lads as you could ever hope for . Here are their names and jobs . - \" I'll kill de guy \" Kirkpatrick my stoker . He is an excellent cook and has made some wonderful stews ( from sheep rustled back in the hills ) . Besides being a good cook he is the best barber in the camp . - Tombstone Leavy . He is second cox 'n and one of the best workers in the crew . He catches sheep for the mess . His pet hobby is raising birds , crows , seagulls and pheasant . - Parrot Mitchell my first cox'n . He is from Calais Maine and knows the Rideouts ( Kidder family friends ) . - Lads from the west coast , Francis and Coverdale . They move and think at an amazing pace , like molasses in January . - \" H'ok \" Gallant a French Canadian from Prince Edward Island . One of the best workers and he has the ability to think for himself in a pinch , which is a big help . - The officer in charge . ( Kidder Himself ) . Landing Craft Types Landing Craft . By the time of the Normandy landings , the range of specialised landing craft had increased enormously , in keeping with technological advances and the changing conduct of warfare . The craft were ; LCA - Landing Craft Assault , LCF - Landing Craft Flak ( anti-aircraft use ) , LCG - Landing Craft Gun , LCGm Landing Craft Gun ( medium ) , LCI - Landing Craft Infantry , LCM - Landing Craft Mechanised , LCOCU - Landing Craft Obstacle Clearance Unit , LCP - Landing Craft Personnel , LCRU - Landing Craft Recovery Unit , LCV ( P ) - Landing Craft Vehicle & Personnel ( American equivalent of LCA ) , LCS - Landing Craft Support , LCT - Landing Craft Tank , LCT ( R ) - Landing Craft Tank ( Rocket ) , LSD - Landing Ship Dock , LSG - Landing Ship Gantry , LSI - Landing Ship Infantry , LSP - Landing Ship Personnel , LST - Landing Ship Tank and LVT - Landing Vehicle Tracked ( also known as amphibian ) . [ Photo ; Harry Trenholme and Kendall Kidder inspecting their troop on the deck of the MV Otranto ( ? ) . ] Kendall went on to be involved in the North Africa landings in Nov 1942 , Sicily in July 1943 , Italy in September 1943 and Normandy in June 1944 . In common with many service personnel , Kendall \" Happy \" Kidder 's war was a surreal mixture of periods of inactivity leading to boredom on occasions and with periods of intense activity and danger , where death and destruction were but a heartbeat away . By the end of June 1944 , the Canadian Combined Operations unit was disbanded although the ferrying service across the channel continued into July and August . On Sept 9 , 1944 , Kendall was granted leave and passage to Canada but returned to the UK in December on an entirely new assignment . A plaque is fixed to the door of a WW2 building at HMS Quebec ( opposite ) , which now serves as the caravan site reception office .
