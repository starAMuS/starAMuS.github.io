Biography Easthope 's paternal grandfather Thomas Easthope was a native of Bridgnorth , Shropshire , where the family had long been settled . He married Frances Asbury there in 1738 and with her had three sons , Thomas ( bap. 1748 ) , the father of this Member , Edward ( bap. 1751 ) and Francis Asbury ( bap. 1758 ) . He later moved to Tewkesbury , Gloucestershire , where his son Thomas became a barge master , and he evidently married for a second time . By his will , dated 14 Sept. 1781 , he devised property in the parish of St. Leonard , Bridgnorth to his son Francis , who was then abroad , and his leasehold inn , the Hole in the Wall , in the parish of St. Mary Magdalene , to Thomas . He was dead by early 1782.2 John Easthope , the third son of Thomas , was born at Tewkesbury in 1784 , but not baptized until 11 Sept. 1788 , along with his brother Edward and sister Ann . One of his two elder brothers , Francis Asbury and Thomas , apparently died comparatively young . 3 His father 's economic circumstances and date of death are unknown ; but Easthope was later described as a man of ' vulgar origin ' who had been ' the architect of his own fortune ' .4 He worked as a clerk in the banking house of Thomas and Timothy Cobb at Banbury , Oxfordshire , but subsequently went to London to try his fortune . Although he was listed among Bridgnorth freemen resident in London in 1812 , he first appeared in the directories as a stockbroker at 2 Hercules Court , Threadneedle Street in 1818.5 ( John Bentall , who shared the same address , had been there since at least 1811 . ) By 1820 , Easthope was in partnership with one Allen at 9 and 10 Exchange Buildings , Threadneedle Street , and by 1827 their firm had moved to 39 Lothbury . He engaged in a series of successful speculations and built up a useful though not spectacular fortune ; he was said to have done particularly well during the financial crisis of 1825 - 6 , which proved disastrous to many other commercial speculators . He was reckoned to be worth about \u00a3 150,000 by 1841.6 As soon as the death of the Whig sitting Member created a vacancy for the open and venal borough of St. Albans , 9 Dec. 1820 , Easthope , writing from Finchley , offered himself as 'a sincere and steady ' supporter of ' constitutional freedom ' . According to Lord Duncannon * , the opposition whip , he started ' at our instigation ' , though he was unknown to Tierney , the Whig leader in the Commons and uncle of the deceased Member . ( Easthope never joined Brooks 's . ) He attacked ' the present degraded and tottering administration ' and deplored their ' unmanly and persecuting proceedings against the queen ' , in which they had ' become the dupes of a wicked conspiracy ' . He promised to scrutinize public expenditure with ' the utmost jealousy ' and to campaign for ' the most rigid economy ' , and asserted that 'a temperate and constitutional reform of the Commons ... is indispensable ' . 7 The Whig Lord Spencer and his son Lord Althorp * , who had the remnants of an interest at St. Albans , and would in normal circumstances have given Easthope their blessing , remained neutral , out of deference to their long personal friendship with the father of Charles Ross * , one of his two ministerialist rivals . 8 Easthope finished third , but he polled respectably enough to suggest that he might succeed on a future occasion , and he indicated that he would try again . 9 Immediately afterwards he sought the support of Althorp in the event of his having the election declared void on account of the bribery of the winner , Sir Henry Wright Wilson , which he claimed he would have no difficulty in proving . Although Althorp was committed not to oppose Ross , he made a very half - hearted attempt to persuade Ross 's father to give Easthope a clear run at any by-election in return for his support for Ross at the election after that . When the Rosses refused to make way for him Easthope abandoned his intention of petitioning . 10 He continued to cultivate the borough , and in October 1825 , when he dated his address from Friern Barnet , he offered himself for the next general election , Ross , now seated elsewhere , having withdrawn his pretensions . Shortly before he conducted his canvass in December , he strenuously repudiated ' vague insinuations ' in the local press of impropriety in his financial dealings . 11 A contest was expected , but shortly before the election in June 1826 one of the contenders pulled out , leaving Easthope to come in unopposed with the ministerialist sitting Member . On the hustings , he adopted a far less strident tone than in 1821 . He expressed satisfaction at the ' present aspect of public affairs ' , particularly applauding Canning 's liberal foreign policy and Peel 's first attempts to lessen the severity of the penal code . He reiterated his desire for tax reductions , but suggested that in present circumstances it was ' impossible ' to achieve substantial cuts without damaging ' national credit or public honour ' . In general terms he observed : If the ministry act as they have hitherto done , I will come forward in their support ; but I shall watch over the interests and privileges of my country , and place myself in the ranks of their bitterest opponents when they offer a stab to the liberties of England . In his written address of thanks he declared his devotion to the Protestant religion , but admitted his support for ' extending to those who conscientiously differ from us , every manifestation of kindness and conciliation that is compatible with national security ' . The editor of the local Tory newspaper approved the ' moderate and manly ' line taken by Easthope , but cast doubt on the sincerity of his professions of friendliness to the Liverpool ministry . 12 Easthope 's conduct in the House justified this cynicism . He voted with opposition against the duke of Clarence 's grant , 16 Feb. , 2 Mar. , and was in the small minority on the army estimates , 20 Feb. 1827 . He voted for Catholic relief , 6 Mar . He divided for inquiry into Leicester corporation 's electoral activities , 15 Mar. , and for the production of information on the mutiny at Barrackpoor , 22 Mar. , and the Lisburn magistrates ' conduct over the Orange procession , 29 Mar . He was in the opposition minority for the postponement of the committee of supply the following day . He voted for inquiries into the Irish miscellaneous estimates and chancery delays , 5 Apr . He voted for the disfranchisement of Penryn , 28 May . He was in the majority for Althorp 's election expenses bill later that day , and , as a director of the recently established Canada Company , voted for the grant to improve water communications in that country , 12 June . He was not reported as speaking in debate in his first session , but in May and June 1827 he presented a number of petitions , some from Dissenting congregations in London , for repeal of the Test Acts . 13 Easthope presented more of the same , 15 , 18 , 19 , 25 Feb. 1828 , and voted for repeal the following day . He voted against the extension of the East Retford franchise to the neighbouring hundred , 21 Mar. , and for inquiry into chancery delays , 24 Apr . On behalf of the Canada Company , 27 Mar. , he responded to Waithman 's motion for inquiry into its dealings with government by saying that its directors had nothing to hide and were ' governed by a laudable spirit of liberality ' ; and he deplored Poulett Thomson 's ' wanton ' attack on the directors of the Hibernian Joint Stock Company , 24 Apr . He was in the minorities of 58 and 27 for further relaxation of the restrictions on the import of foreign corn , 22 , 29 Apr . On the 29th he supported the unsuccessful bid by the Members for Hertfordshire and his colleague Alderman Smith to allow the legislation for the erection of a new court house at St. Albans to be proceeded with despite an inadvertent failure to comply with standing orders . Easthope , who voted for Catholic relief , 12 May , was in the small minorities for more effective control over crown proceedings for the recovery of excise penalties , 1 May , a revision of civil list pensions , 10 June , and the Irish assessment of lessors bill , 12 June . He argued that allowing any ' evasions ' of the Scottish and Irish bank notes bill would render that irksome but essential measure nugatory , 16 June . Later that day he opposed Hume 's bid to force country bankers to supply quarterly returns of notes circulated . He divided for the usury laws amendment bill , 19 June , and voted against government on the cost of building works at Buckingham House , 23 June , the ordnance estimates , 4 July , and the silk duties , 14 July 1828 . Easthope presented and endorsed a petition from the Catholics of Heythrop , Oxfordshire , for redress of grievances , 6 Feb. , voted for emancipation , 6 , 30 Mar. , and presented favourable petitions from Protestant Dissenters , 13 , 16 Mar. 1829 . On 12 and 19 June 1829 he pressed ministers to intervene with the Spanish government to obtain satisfaction for British bondholders who had suffered financial losses . He was one of the 28 oppositionists who voted with the Wellington ministry against the amendment to the address , 4 Feb. 1830 ; but he divided for the transfer of East Retford 's seats to Birmingham , 11 Feb . , Lord Blandford 's parliamentary reform scheme , 18 Feb. , the enfranchisement of Birmingham , Leeds and Manchester , 23 Feb. , and investigation of the Newark petition accusing the duke of Newcastle of improper electoral interference , 1 Mar . He voted to get rid of the Bathurst and Dundas pensions , 26 Mar. , and for Jewish emancipation , 5 Apr. , 17 May . On 7 Apr. he presented the Hertfordshire petition complaining of distress and called for reductions in expenditure and the removal of all restrictions on commerce and trade : he subsequently voted for economies , 3 , 21 May , 7 , 14 June . He was one of O'Connell 's minority for reform of the Irish vestry laws , 27 Apr. , and voted against government on the Terciera incident the next day . He presented petitions from the Dissenters of Nether Chapel , Sheffield for abolition of the death penalty for forgery and action against suttee , 11 May ; he voted for the former , 24 May , 7 June . He voted for inquiry into the civil government of Canada , 25 May , and parliamentary reform , 28 May . He was shut out of the division on the sale of beer bill , 1 July . He was in the minorities of 11 for a reduction in judges ' salaries , 7 July , and 27 for Brougham 's condemnation of colonial slavery , 13 July 1830 . He offered again for St. Albans on the death of the king , but his initial canvass convinced him that he could not win the anticipated contest ; it was reported that he had lost support on account of his failure to ' attend to the local interests of the borough ' with sufficient zeal . He decided to cut his losses , but before making public his retirement notified Althorp , who would have supported him personally , to give him the chance to alert another opposition candidate to the opportunity . Althorp thought he had behaved ' very well by us ' . 14 At the general election of 1831 Easthope stood for Banbury , where the local reformers were up in arms against the patron Lord Bute , whose nominee was assaulted and driven out of town . He was returned after a token contest . 15 He voted for the second reading of the reintroduced reform bill , 6 July 1831 , and was a steady supporter of its details , though he was briefly made hors de combat by a broken collar bone sustained in a fall from his horse in August , 16 and was in the minority for the total disfranchisement of Aldborough , 14 Sept . He voted for the passage of the bill , 21 Sept. , and the motion of confidence in the Grey ministry , 10 Oct . He divided with them on the Dublin election controversy , 23 Aug . At about this time Greville noted Easthope 's connections with the French government as a broker in the London market . 17 He voted for the second reading of the revised reform bill , 17 Dec. 1831 , and again was a reliable supporter of its detailed provisions . He voted for the third reading , 22 Mar. , and the address calling on the king to appoint only ministers who would carry it unimpaired , 10 May , and against an amendment to the Scottish reform bill , 15 June . He sided with ministers on the Russian - Dutch loan , 26 Jan. , 12 , 16 , 20 July , and relations with Portugal , 9 Feb . ; but he voted in the minority against their temporizing amendment to Buxton 's call for the abolition of slavery , 24 May . On 22 May he agreed to postpone his motion for a disclosure of information on the circulation of Bank of England notes , to which ministers were opposed , to accommodate their proceedings on the proposed renewal of the Bank 's charter . They duly resisted and defeated it , 26 July 1832 , when Easthope explained that his object was to expose the incompetence of the Bank 's directors , its culpability for the panic of 1825 and its unfitness for a continuation of its ' exclusive privileges ' . By then it was known in Banbury that he did not intend to stand again at the next general election . 18 He unsuccessfully contested Southampton at the 1835 general election and Lewes at a by-election in April 1837 ; but he was successful at Leicester at the general election later that year and sat there for ten years . He was defeated at Tewkesbury in 1841 and Bridgnorth in 1847 . James Grant wrote in 1841 that while Easthope was an infrequent speaker in the House , ' not only is he listened to with attention , but he speaks with great ease , and usually with much effect ' , by virtue of ' the strong good sense ' which he purveyed and ' the lucidness with which he arranges his ideas and facts ' . His unpolished diction was a source of amusement to some . 19 In the summer of 1834 he was persuaded by government party managers to purchase the ailing Morning Chronicle . ( One of them rather churlishly described him as 'a liberal , honest and most active man , but not well backed in opinion or instruction ; and like all men of vulgar origin accessible to the praise of great men ' . ) He paid about \u00a3 16,500 for the paper and placed its columns at the disposal of ministers , though their relationship was not always harmonious . He was rewarded with a baronetcy by Lord Melbourne in 1841 . He disposed of his interest in the Chronicle in 1847.20 By 1838 Easthope 's firm was styled Easthope and Son ; the latter died in France in January 1849 , about two years after the business had moved to 38 Throgmorton Street . It had disappeared from the directories by 1857 . With his second wife , Easthope , for all his supposed vulgarity , was a generous and accomplished dinner host to the great and the good , both in London and Paris . 21 In the mid-1840s he acquired a residence at Fir Grove , Weybridge , Surrey ; and it was there that he died in December 1865.22 By his will , dated 18 Nov. 1863 , he left his wife 300 shares in the Cordova and Seville Railway , the Weybridge house and four labourers ' cottages there . He devised a freehold estate at Weybridge and Chertsey and the remaining 950 shares in the Spanish Railway Company to his grandson John Andrew Doyle , his residuary legatee . He directed that his London house in Great Cumberland Place be sold and the proceeds combined with his personal estate to honour a bond of \u00a3 10,000 due to his wife and daughter Louisa Doyle , and to furnish legacies amounting to \u00a3 3,000 .

Biography Easthope 's paternal grandfather Thomas Easthope was a native of Bridgnorth , Shropshire , where the family had long been settled . He married Frances Asbury there in 1738 and with her had three sons , Thomas ( bap. 1748 ) , the father of this Member , Edward ( bap. 1751 ) and Francis Asbury ( bap. 1758 ) . He later moved to Tewkesbury , Gloucestershire , where his son Thomas became a barge master , and he evidently married for a second time . By his will , dated 14 Sept. 1781 , he devised property in the parish of St. Leonard , Bridgnorth to his son Francis , who was then abroad , and his leasehold inn , the Hole in the Wall , in the parish of St. Mary Magdalene , to Thomas . He was dead by early 1782.2 John Easthope , the third son of Thomas , was born at Tewkesbury in 1784 , but not baptized until 11 Sept. 1788 , along with his brother Edward and sister Ann . One of his two elder brothers , Francis Asbury and Thomas , apparently died comparatively young . 3 His father 's economic circumstances and date of death are unknown ; but Easthope was later described as a man of ' vulgar origin ' who had been ' the architect of his own fortune ' .4 He worked as a clerk in the banking house of Thomas and Timothy Cobb at Banbury , Oxfordshire , but subsequently went to London to try his fortune . Although he was listed among Bridgnorth freemen resident in London in 1812 , he first appeared in the directories as a stockbroker at 2 Hercules Court , Threadneedle Street in 1818.5 ( John Bentall , who shared the same address , had been there since at least 1811 . ) By 1820 , Easthope was in partnership with one Allen at 9 and 10 Exchange Buildings , Threadneedle Street , and by 1827 their firm had moved to 39 Lothbury . He engaged in a series of successful speculations and built up a useful though not spectacular fortune ; he was said to have done particularly well during the financial crisis of 1825 - 6 , which proved disastrous to many other commercial speculators . He was reckoned to be worth about \u00a3 150,000 by 1841.6 As soon as the death of the Whig sitting Member created a vacancy for the open and venal borough of St. Albans , 9 Dec. 1820 , Easthope , writing from Finchley , offered himself as 'a sincere and steady ' supporter of ' constitutional freedom ' . According to Lord Duncannon * , the opposition whip , he started ' at our instigation ' , though he was unknown to Tierney , the Whig leader in the Commons and uncle of the deceased Member . ( Easthope never joined Brooks 's . ) He attacked ' the present degraded and tottering administration ' and deplored their ' unmanly and persecuting proceedings against the queen ' , in which they had ' become the dupes of a wicked conspiracy ' . He promised to scrutinize public expenditure with ' the utmost jealousy ' and to campaign for ' the most rigid economy ' , and asserted that 'a temperate and constitutional reform of the Commons ... is indispensable ' . 7 The Whig Lord Spencer and his son Lord Althorp * , who had the remnants of an interest at St. Albans , and would in normal circumstances have given Easthope their blessing , remained neutral , out of deference to their long personal friendship with the father of Charles Ross * , one of his two ministerialist rivals . 8 Easthope finished third , but he polled respectably enough to suggest that he might succeed on a future occasion , and he indicated that he would try again . 9 Immediately afterwards he sought the support of Althorp in the event of his having the election declared void on account of the bribery of the winner , Sir Henry Wright Wilson , which he claimed he would have no difficulty in proving . Although Althorp was committed not to oppose Ross , he made a very half - hearted attempt to persuade Ross 's father to give Easthope a clear run at any by-election in return for his support for Ross at the election after that . When the Rosses refused to make way for him Easthope abandoned his intention of petitioning . 10 He continued to cultivate the borough , and in October 1825 , when he dated his address from Friern Barnet , he offered himself for the next general election , Ross , now seated elsewhere , having withdrawn his pretensions . Shortly before he conducted his canvass in December , he strenuously repudiated ' vague insinuations ' in the local press of impropriety in his financial dealings . 11 A contest was expected , but shortly before the election in June 1826 one of the contenders pulled out , leaving Easthope to come in unopposed with the ministerialist sitting Member . On the hustings , he adopted a far less strident tone than in 1821 . He expressed satisfaction at the ' present aspect of public affairs ' , particularly applauding Canning 's liberal foreign policy and Peel 's first attempts to lessen the severity of the penal code . He reiterated his desire for tax reductions , but suggested that in present circumstances it was ' impossible ' to achieve substantial cuts without damaging ' national credit or public honour ' . In general terms he observed : If the ministry act as they have hitherto done , I will come forward in their support ; but I shall watch over the interests and privileges of my country , and place myself in the ranks of their bitterest opponents when they offer a stab to the liberties of England . In his written address of thanks he declared his devotion to the Protestant religion , but admitted his support for ' extending to those who conscientiously differ from us , every manifestation of kindness and conciliation that is compatible with national security ' . The editor of the local Tory newspaper approved the ' moderate and manly ' line taken by Easthope , but cast doubt on the sincerity of his professions of friendliness to the Liverpool ministry . 12 Easthope 's conduct in the House justified this cynicism . He voted with opposition against the duke of Clarence 's grant , 16 Feb. , 2 Mar. , and was in the small minority on the army estimates , 20 Feb. 1827 . He voted for Catholic relief , 6 Mar . He divided for inquiry into Leicester corporation 's electoral activities , 15 Mar. , and for the production of information on the mutiny at Barrackpoor , 22 Mar. , and the Lisburn magistrates ' conduct over the Orange procession , 29 Mar . He was in the opposition minority for the postponement of the committee of supply the following day . He voted for inquiries into the Irish miscellaneous estimates and chancery delays , 5 Apr . He voted for the disfranchisement of Penryn , 28 May . He was in the majority for Althorp 's election expenses bill later that day , and , as a director of the recently established Canada Company , voted for the grant to improve water communications in that country , 12 June . He was not reported as speaking in debate in his first session , but in May and June 1827 he presented a number of petitions , some from Dissenting congregations in London , for repeal of the Test Acts . 13 Easthope presented more of the same , 15 , 18 , 19 , 25 Feb. 1828 , and voted for repeal the following day . He voted against the extension of the East Retford franchise to the neighbouring hundred , 21 Mar. , and for inquiry into chancery delays , 24 Apr . On behalf of the Canada Company , 27 Mar. , he responded to Waithman 's motion for inquiry into its dealings with government by saying that its directors had nothing to hide and were ' governed by a laudable spirit of liberality ' ; and he deplored Poulett Thomson 's ' wanton ' attack on the directors of the Hibernian Joint Stock Company , 24 Apr . He was in the minorities of 58 and 27 for further relaxation of the restrictions on the import of foreign corn , 22 , 29 Apr . On the 29th he supported the unsuccessful bid by the Members for Hertfordshire and his colleague Alderman Smith to allow the legislation for the erection of a new court house at St. Albans to be proceeded with despite an inadvertent failure to comply with standing orders . Easthope , who voted for Catholic relief , 12 May , was in the small minorities for more effective control over crown proceedings for the recovery of excise penalties , 1 May , a revision of civil list pensions , 10 June , and the Irish assessment of lessors bill , 12 June . He argued that allowing any ' evasions ' of the Scottish and Irish bank notes bill would render that irksome but essential measure nugatory , 16 June . Later that day he opposed Hume 's bid to force country bankers to supply quarterly returns of notes circulated . He divided for the usury laws amendment bill , 19 June , and voted against government on the cost of building works at Buckingham House , 23 June , the ordnance estimates , 4 July , and the silk duties , 14 July 1828 . Easthope presented and endorsed a petition from the Catholics of Heythrop , Oxfordshire , for redress of grievances , 6 Feb. , voted for emancipation , 6 , 30 Mar. , and presented favourable petitions from Protestant Dissenters , 13 , 16 Mar. 1829 . On 12 and 19 June 1829 he pressed ministers to intervene with the Spanish government to obtain satisfaction for British bondholders who had suffered financial losses . He was one of the 28 oppositionists who voted with the Wellington ministry against the amendment to the address , 4 Feb. 1830 ; but he divided for the transfer of East Retford 's seats to Birmingham , 11 Feb . , Lord Blandford 's parliamentary reform scheme , 18 Feb. , the enfranchisement of Birmingham , Leeds and Manchester , 23 Feb. , and investigation of the Newark petition accusing the duke of Newcastle of improper electoral interference , 1 Mar . He voted to get rid of the Bathurst and Dundas pensions , 26 Mar. , and for Jewish emancipation , 5 Apr. , 17 May . On 7 Apr. he presented the Hertfordshire petition complaining of distress and called for reductions in expenditure and the removal of all restrictions on commerce and trade : he subsequently voted for economies , 3 , 21 May , 7 , 14 June . He was one of O'Connell 's minority for reform of the Irish vestry laws , 27 Apr. , and voted against government on the Terciera incident the next day . He presented petitions from the Dissenters of Nether Chapel , Sheffield for abolition of the death penalty for forgery and action against suttee , 11 May ; he voted for the former , 24 May , 7 June . He voted for inquiry into the civil government of Canada , 25 May , and parliamentary reform , 28 May . He was shut out of the division on the sale of beer bill , 1 July . He was in the minorities of 11 for a reduction in judges ' salaries , 7 July , and 27 for Brougham 's condemnation of colonial slavery , 13 July 1830 . He offered again for St. Albans on the death of the king , but his initial canvass convinced him that he could not win the anticipated contest ; it was reported that he had lost support on account of his failure to ' attend to the local interests of the borough ' with sufficient zeal . He decided to cut his losses , but before making public his retirement notified Althorp , who would have supported him personally , to give him the chance to alert another opposition candidate to the opportunity . Althorp thought he had behaved ' very well by us ' . 14 At the general election of 1831 Easthope stood for Banbury , where the local reformers were up in arms against the patron Lord Bute , whose nominee was assaulted and driven out of town . He was returned after a token contest . 15 He voted for the second reading of the reintroduced reform bill , 6 July 1831 , and was a steady supporter of its details , though he was briefly made hors de combat by a broken collar bone sustained in a fall from his horse in August , 16 and was in the minority for the total disfranchisement of Aldborough , 14 Sept . He voted for the passage of the bill , 21 Sept. , and the motion of confidence in the Grey ministry , 10 Oct . He divided with them on the Dublin election controversy , 23 Aug . At about this time Greville noted Easthope 's connections with the French government as a broker in the London market . 17 He voted for the second reading of the revised reform bill , 17 Dec. 1831 , and again was a reliable supporter of its detailed provisions . He voted for the third reading , 22 Mar. , and the address calling on the king to appoint only ministers who would carry it unimpaired , 10 May , and against an amendment to the Scottish reform bill , 15 June . He sided with ministers on the Russian - Dutch loan , 26 Jan. , 12 , 16 , 20 July , and relations with Portugal , 9 Feb . ; but he voted in the minority against their temporizing amendment to Buxton 's call for the abolition of slavery , 24 May . On 22 May he agreed to postpone his motion for a disclosure of information on the circulation of Bank of England notes , to which ministers were opposed , to accommodate their proceedings on the proposed renewal of the Bank 's charter . They duly resisted and defeated it , 26 July 1832 , when Easthope explained that his object was to expose the incompetence of the Bank 's directors , its culpability for the panic of 1825 and its unfitness for a continuation of its ' exclusive privileges ' . By then it was known in Banbury that he did not intend to stand again at the next general election . 18 He unsuccessfully contested Southampton at the 1835 general election and Lewes at a by-election in April 1837 ; but he was successful at Leicester at the general election later that year and sat there for ten years . He was defeated at Tewkesbury in 1841 and Bridgnorth in 1847 . James Grant wrote in 1841 that while Easthope was an infrequent speaker in the House , ' not only is he listened to with attention , but he speaks with great ease , and usually with much effect ' , by virtue of ' the strong good sense ' which he purveyed and ' the lucidness with which he arranges his ideas and facts ' . His unpolished diction was a source of amusement to some . 19 In the summer of 1834 he was persuaded by government party managers to purchase the ailing Morning Chronicle . ( One of them rather churlishly described him as 'a liberal , honest and most active man , but not well backed in opinion or instruction ; and like all men of vulgar origin accessible to the praise of great men ' . ) He paid about \u00a3 16,500 for the paper and placed its columns at the disposal of ministers , though their relationship was not always harmonious . He was rewarded with a baronetcy by Lord Melbourne in 1841 . He disposed of his interest in the Chronicle in 1847.20 By 1838 Easthope 's firm was styled Easthope and Son ; the latter died in France in January 1849 , about two years after the business had moved to 38 Throgmorton Street . It had disappeared from the directories by 1857 . With his second wife , Easthope , for all his supposed vulgarity , was a generous and accomplished dinner host to the great and the good , both in London and Paris . 21 In the mid-1840s he acquired a residence at Fir Grove , Weybridge , Surrey ; and it was there that he died in December 1865.22 By his will , dated 18 Nov. 1863 , he left his wife 300 shares in the Cordova and Seville Railway , the Weybridge house and four labourers ' cottages there . He devised a freehold estate at Weybridge and Chertsey and the remaining 950 shares in the Spanish Railway Company to his grandson John Andrew Doyle , his residuary legatee . He directed that his London house in Great Cumberland Place be sold and the proceeds combined with his personal estate to honour a bond of \u00a3 10,000 due to his wife and daughter Louisa Doyle , and to furnish legacies amounting to \u00a3 3,000 .

Duchess of Silesia , b. about 1174 , at the castle of Andechs ; d. at Trebnitz , 12 or 15 October , 1243 . She was one of eight children born to Berthold IV , Count of Andechs and Duke of Croatia and Dalmatia . Of her four brothers , two became bishops , Ekbert of Bamberg , and Berthold of Aquileia ; Otto succeeded his father as Duke of Dalmatia , and Heinrich became Margrave of Istria . Of her three sisters , Gertrude married Andrew II , King of Hungary , from which union sprang St. Elizabeth , Landgravine of Thuringia ; Mechtilde became Abbess of Kitzingen ; while Agnes was made the unlawful wife of Philip II of France in 1196 , on the repudiation of his lawful wife , Ingeborg , but was dismissed in 1200 , Innocent III having laid France under an interdict . Hedwig was educated at the monastery of Kitzingen , and , according to an old biography , at the age of twelve ( 1186 ) , was married to Henry I of Silesia ( b. 1168 ) , who in 1202 succeeded his father Boleslaw as Duke of Silesia . Henry 's mother was a German ; he himself had been educated in Germany ; and now through his wife he was brought into still closer relations with Germany . Henry I was an energetic prince , who greatly extended the boundaries of his duchy , established his authority on a firm basis , and rendered important services to civilization in the realm . For this purpose he encouraged to the utmost the spread of the more highly developed civilization existing in the German territories adjoining his to the west , so that Silesia became German in language and customs . Hedwig now took a prominent part in the beneficent administration of her husband . Her prudence , fortitude , and piety won for her great influence in the government of the land . In particular she gave her support to new monastic foundations and assisted those already in existence . It was chiefly through the monasteries that German civilization was spread in Silesia . Henry and Hedwig endowed munificently the Cistercian monastery of Leubus , the Premonstratensian monastery of St. Vincent , and the foundation of the Canons of St. Augustine at Breslau . The following monasteries were established : the Augustinian priory of Naumburg on the Bober ( 1217 ) , later transferred to Sagan , the Cistercian monastery of Heinrichau ( 1227 ) , and the priory of the Augustinian Canons at Kamenz ( 1210 ) . St. Hedwig brought the Dominicans to Bunzlau and Breslau , the Franciscans to Goldberg ( 1212 ) and later to Krossen . The Templars established a house at Klein -Oels . Henry was also the founder of the Hospital of the Holy Ghost at Breslau ( 1214 ) , and Hedwig tended with disinterested charity the leper women in the hospital at Neumarkt . At the instance of his saintly wife , the duke then founded at his own expense , and on ground donated by himself the convent of the Cistercian nuns at Trebnitz ( 1202 ) , and generously endowed it . This was the first house of religious women in Silesia . The first nuns came from Bamberg and took possession of their new monastery early in 1203 . The first abbess is said to have been Petrussa , succeeded by Bl. Gertrude , a daughter of Henry and Hedwig , who at an early age had been betrothed to Otto von Wittelsbach . After he murdered the German King Philip of Swabia ( 1208 ) , the betrothal was annulled and Gertrude entered the Abbey of Trebnitz ( before 1212 ) , where she later became abbess . For some years after her marriage , Hedwig resided chiefly at Breslau . She had seven children . A son , Boleslaw , and two daughters , Sophia and Agnes , died at an early age ; Henry succeeded to his father 's title ; Conrad died while still a young man , in consequence of a fall from his horse ( c. 1214 ) ; and Gertrude embraced the religious life . On Christmas Day , 1208 , another son of Hedwig 's was baptized , probably not identical with the above-mentioned Boleslaw , who had died before this time . On the suggestion of Hedwig , after the birth of this last child , she and her husband led a virgin life ( 1209 ) , and pronounced a vow of chastity before the Bishop of Breslau . Duke Henry took the tonsure and allowed his beard to grow , like the Cistercian lay brothers ( whence his sobriquet of \" the Bearded \" ) . From this time forward Hedwig spent much of her time at the Abbey of Trebnitz , where , on the death of her husband ( 1238 ) , she took up her permanent abode , that she might devote herself unreservedly to exercises of mortification and piety as well as to works of charity . She transferred to the abbey her inheritance of Schawoine . Hedwig had had many trials and tribulations . In the year 1227 her husband , with Duke Lesko of Sandomir , was treacherously set upon by Swantopolk , Duke of Pomerania , and severely wounded . Hedwig immediately hastened to Gonsawa , where the bloody deed had taken place , to care for her husband . Lesko had been killed , and war now broke out between Henry of Silesia and Conrad of Masovia over the possession of Cracow . Conrad was defeated , but succeeded in surprising Henry in a church attending Divine service and led him captive to Plock ( 1229 ) . Hedwig forthwith went to her husband 's assistance , and her very appearance made such an impression on Conrad of Masovia that he released the duke . Of Hedwig 's children , only Gertrude survived her ; Duke Henry II fell at Wahlstatt ( 1241 ) in a battle against the Tatars . After her husband 's death , Hedwig took the grey habit of the Cistercians , but was not received into the order as a religious , that she might retain the right to spend her revenues in charities . The duchess practised severe mortification , endured all trials with the greatest resignation , with self - denying charity cared for the sick and supported the poor ; in her interior life of prayer , she gave herself up to meditation on supernatural things . Her piety and gentleness won for her even during life the reputation of a saint . She was interred in the church attached to the monastery , and was canonized by Clement IV , 26 March , 1267 , and on 25 August of the same year her remains were raised to the honours of the altar . Her feast is celebrated 17 October ; she in honoured as the patroness of Silesia . With St. Hedwig as patroness , R. Spiske , later canon at Breslau , founded , in 1848 , a pious association of women and young girls , from which developed the congregation of the Sisters of St. Hedwig , established in 1859 , at Breslau , under the Rule of St. Augustine , and constitutions approved by the bishop . Their chief aim is the education of orphaned and abandoned children ; they also conduct schools for little girls and trade schools . Their activity extends chiefly over Germany and Austria , but they also have a house in Denmark . The sisters number about three hundred , with mother - house at Breslau .

However , the Israeli water company Mekerot is the main supplier of water to the camp . The socio-economic conditions in Aqabat Jabr are difficult . The refugees mainly work in the agricultural sector in the Jordan Valley , and in nearby Israeli settlements .

The floating LNG regasification facility , which is 116 miles off Louisiana 's coast in 298 feet of water , was commissioned in 2005 ( see Daily GPI , March 4 , 2005 ) . Gulf Gateway , which was reported to have cost around $ 70 million , was designed to deliver around 3 Bcf of regasified LNG from a ship into the pipeline grid via the Sea Robin and Blue Water subsea systems at a rate of about 500 MMcf / d. Gulf Gateway was delivering gas to the Gulf Coast region when Hurricane Ike struck in September 2008 , damaging the facility 's two separate offshore pipeline systems . The actual floating LNG facility was n't affected by the storm , but neither pipeline has been able to return to its prior level of service , officials said last week when they announced that the facility would be retired . \u201c Gulf Gateway has served us well , and was instrumental in confirming the viability of floating LNG regasification \u2014 turning an innovative concept into an accepted industry solution , \u201d said Excelerate CEO Rob Bryngelson . \u201c As Excelerate Energy looks to expand its operations and deliver flexible and efficient regasification solutions around the world , we are focused on markets with the greatest need . \u201c This focus , coupled with the surge in LNG importation capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast in recent years , has reduced the need for Gulf Gateway and confirmed that its retirement is the most financially prudent course of action for us . \u201d Gulf Gateway is to be decommissioned within 68 days of permit approval and \u201c will have little environmental impact , \u201d Excelerate said . The decommissioning plan , which includes removing the facility and related components , is being finalized in coordination with the U.S. Maritime Administration and other regulatory agencies . Excelerate purchased the proprietary Energy Bridge technology from El Paso Corp. in 2003 ( see Daily GPI , Dec. 18 , 2003 ) . When Gulf Gateway launched two years later , it was unable to accept conventional LNG vessels , so Excelerate commissioned 138,000 - cubic meter LNG vessels to allow deliveries directly into a special buoy that connected to existing offshore subsea pipelines . Gulf Gateway \u201c provided the means for establishing the technical and commercial viability \u201d of the Energy Bridge Regasification Vessels ( EBRV ) , which allow gas to be delivered directly into downstream markets , Excelerate noted . The successful launch led Excelerate in May 2005 to apply to build the Northeast Gateway Deepwater Port facility offshore Boston , which remains in service ( see Daily GPI , May 13 , 2005 ) . According to analysts with Pan EurAsian Enterprises Inc. , \u201c the initial ' hope ' for the Gulf Gateway facility was that it would receive about one cargo a week . The first cargo arrived , loaded in Malaysia , in March 2005 and was landed at a reported price of $ 7.06 / MMBtu . At that time the Henry Hub next - day price was around $ 7.17 . \u201d However , hopes for the offshore terminal were never realized , said Pan EurAsian in a note on Tuesday . The last use , according to its records , \u201c was in August 2007 after the arrival of six cargoes . \u201d In addition to the commissioning cargo from Malaysia , \u201c cargoes came from Trinidad , Nigeria and Qatar . \u201d Records indicate \u201c a total of 17.7 Bcf of natural gas was delivered into the U.S. pipeline system from Gulf Gateway . \u201d The Northeast Gateway facility , Pan EurAsian analysts noted , has received 11 cargoes since ramping up in May 2008 , which have delivered a total of 21.3 Bcf into the U.S. pipeline system . Excelerate said in the past seven years it has developed eight EBRVs , two Gateway offshore LNG import terminals and four dockside LNG import terminals . Pan EurAsian said Excelerate now either owns or has under long - term charter 10 LNG tankers , nine of which are equipped to work with the floating LNG system . Excelerate 's regasification systems have been \u201c slow to take hold in the market , \u201d noted Pan EurAsian analysts . Excelerate operates Teesside Gas Port LNG in the United Kingdom . Suez Energy North America in 2006 used the design to build its Neptune LNG facility offshore Boston ( see Daily GPI , April 5 , 2006 ) and considered it for its proposed Calypso LNG port offshore Port Everglades , FL ( see Daily GPI , Feb. 27 , 2009 ; Oct. 7 , 2005 ) . The Neptune facility \u201c has not seen much use either , \u201d said Pan EurAsian analysts . Excelerate in 2008 sold a 50 % stake in its LNG business to German utility RWE Group for an estimated $ 500 million ( see Daily GPI , June 3 , 2008 ) . And last year Excelerate said it was looking for a partner to market gas from the Gulf Gateway terminal ( see Daily GPI , April 12 , 2010 ) . Pan EurAsian analysts said \u201c the critical impediment \u201d to Excelerate 's business model has been that only specially built ships are able to use the system . The system and additional equipment \u201c adds significantly \u201d to the cost \u2026 and is only useful for specialized trade . \u201d Excelerate , they said , has no dedicated sources of LNG and has been limited in finding LNG cargoes . \u201c The collapse of U.S. natural gas prices as production from the shale formations grew did not help much , either , \u201d said Pan EurAsian analysts . \u201c The decision by Excelerate to abandon the Gulf Gateway facility and decommission it simply acknowledges reality . \u201d \u00c2\u00a9Copyright 2011 Intelligence Press Inc .

And last year Excelerate said it was looking for a partner to market gas from the Gulf Gateway terminal ( see Daily GPI , April 12 , 2010 ) . Pan EurAsian analysts said \u201c the critical impediment \u201d to Excelerate 's business model has been that only specially built ships are able to use the system . The system and additional equipment \u201c adds significantly \u201d to the cost \u2026 and is only useful for specialized trade . \u201d Excelerate , they said , has no dedicated sources of LNG and has been limited in finding LNG cargoes . \u201c The collapse of U.S. natural gas prices as production from the shale formations grew did not help much , either , \u201d said Pan EurAsian analysts . \u201c The decision by Excelerate to abandon the Gulf Gateway facility and decommission it simply acknowledges reality . \u201d \u00c2\u00a9Copyright 2011 Intelligence Press Inc .

The following is an account of the victory of King Jan Sobieski in 1683 . The 18th century was to see both Poland and the Ottoman empire suffer a relative decline in power in comparison with the newer formations of Prussia , Austria and Russia : by the end of the 18th century Poland had been gobbled up by these states , and Ottoman Turkey endured a protracted conflict over which European state was going to dominate its territories . The Victory which the King of Poland has obtained over the Infidels , is so great and so complete that past Ages can scarce parallel the fame ; and perhaps future Ages will never see any thing like it . All its Circumstances are as profitable to Christendom in general , and to the Empire in particular , as glorious to the Monarch . On one hand we see Vienna besieged by three hundred thousand Turks ; reduced to the last extremity ; its Outworks taken ; the Enemy fixed to the Body of the Place ; Masters of one Point of the Bastions , having frightful Mines under the Retrenchments of the besieged : We see an Emperor chased from his Capital ; retired to a corner of his Dominions ; all his country at the mercy of the Tartars , who have filled the Camp with an infinite number of unfortunate Slaves that had been forcibly carried away out of Austria . On the other hand we see the King of Poland , who goes out of his Kingdom , with part of his Army , and hastens to succor his Allies , who abandons what is dearest to him , to march against the enemies of the Christian Religion willing to act in Person on this occasion , as a true Buckler of Religion ; and will not spare his eldest son , the Prince of Poland , whom he carries with him , even in a tender age , to so dangerous an Expedition as this was . That which preceded the battle is no less surprising . The Empire assembles on all sides , the Elector 's of Saxony and Bavaria come in person to join their troops with the Imperialists under the command of the Duke of Lorraine . Thirty other Princes repair out of emulation , to one another , to the Army , which nevertheless , before they will enter upon Action , stay for the presence of the King of Poland , whose presence alone is worth an Army . They all march with this confidence . The King passes the Danube first , and leaves no troops on the other side to cover Moravia from the incursions that the malcontents under Count Teckley might make into the same , as the Duke of Lorraine had proposed ; because , says the King , he had wrote to that Hungarian Lord , that if he burnt one straw in the territories of his allies , or in his own , he would go and burn him and all his family in his house , so that this was enough to protect that country during the distance of the army . He leads them afterwards , through unfrequented defiles to the tops of the hills of Vienna , and in fight of the Turks , who drew out of their camp to put themselves in order , and even attacked the Imperialists by break of day on Sunday the twelfth of September , before the King of Poland had made an end of forming his order of battle , and extending his lines , in which his Majesty has mixed his hussars , and other Polish troops among those of the Empire . In the meantime , the Turks leave their trenches well provided with Janissaries , with a considerable body of at the posts and at the attacks , to hinder the besieged from sallying out ; hoping to continue the siege at the same time as the army should make head against the succors of the Christian princes ; and truly they had wherewithal to back this proud revolution ; having above 300,000 men , according to the King 's account , who found above 100,000 small tents in their camp , wherein apparently according to the manner of disposing their men , there were at least three men in each , and his Polish Majesty has reduced the common report of 300,000 tents which would infinitely augment the number of soldiers to that of 1,000,000 . The battle was fought on the twelfth , it lasted fourteen or fifteen hours ; the slaughter was horrible , and the loss of the Turks inestimable , for they left upon the field of battle , besides the dead and prisoners , all their cannon , equipage , tents and infinite riches that they had been six years gathering together throughout the whole Ottoman Empire . There was found in their camp above a million pounds of powder , bullets , balls , and other ammunition , without reckoning the powder that the slaves burnt by inadvertency in several places of the park of the artillery , the flame whereof made an emblem of the terrible day of judgment , with the earthquakes that will accompany it ; and that thick mass of clouds that will obscure the universe : a loss nevertheless which ought to be called a great misfortune , seeing tis above a million pounds more , as the King assures us in his letter , that he wrote himself to the Queen , from which all these particulars are extracted . The battle ended by the infantry of the trenches , and of the Isle of the Danube , where the Turks had a battery [ of artillery ] . The night was spent in slaughter , and the unhappy remnant of this army saved their lives by flight , having abandoned all to the victors ; even an infinite number of wagons , laden with ammunition , and some field pieces , that designed to have carried with them ; and which were found next day upon the road they had taken ; which makes us suspect that they 'll not be able to rally again , as neither having wherewithal to encamp themselves nor cannon to shoot with . So soon as the Grand Vizier knew the defeat of his first lines , he caused a red tent to be pitched at the head of his main body , where he resolved to die for the Ottoman Empire , but his last efforts were to no purpose ; and the wing of the Imperialists , which he attacked with all his might , was so opportunely succored by the presence of the king , who brought part of the troops of his left wing thither , that all fled before him . So soon as he perceived the red tent , knowing by it that the Vizier was there in person , he caused all his artillery to fire upon that pavilion , encouraging the activity of the gunners by considerable recompenses , promising them fifty crowns for each cannon - shot ; and these leveled their pieces so well , that they brought down the red tent of the Grand Vizier ; and the troop of Prince Alexander his second son , had the advantage to break through that body of cavalry , at the very place where the Vizier was , who was dismounted , and had much ado to save himself upon another horse ; having left , among the slain , his Kiayia , that is , his lieutenant general , and the second person of the army ; with abundance of considerable officers ; all the standards ; the marks of his dignity that are carried before him , or that are set up before his pavilions ; even the great standard of Mahomet , which the Sultan had put into his hands when he set out upon this expedition ; and which the king has sent to Rome by the Sieur Talenti , one of his secretaries , to be a testimony to the Pope , of this great victory . The King understood afterwards by deserters , who come every hour in troops to surrender themselves to him , as well as the renegades , that the Vizier , seeing the defeat of the army , called his sons to him , embraced them , bitterly bewailed their misfortune , and turned towards the Khan of the Tartars , and said \" And you , will not you succor me ? \" To whom the Tartar prince replied , that he knew the King of Poland by more than one proof , and that the Vizier would be very happy if he could save himself by flight , as having no other way for his security , and that he was going to show him the example . The Grand Vizier being thus abandoned , took the same way , and retired in disorder with only one horse ; that which he had in the battle , and was armed all over with steel , having fallen into the hands of the king with all the equipages of that Ottoman general ; who has left his Majesty heir to all his riches . In effect , his letters were dated from the tents of the Grand Vizier , the park whereof was as large extent as the city of Warsaw or that or Leopold ; enclosing his baths , fountains , canals , a garden , a king of menagerie or place for strange beasts and birds , with dogs , rabbits and parrots . There was found an ostrich of an admirable beauty , which had been taken from one of the Emperor 's country - houses , and whose head the vizier 's men cut off in their retreat , that it might not serve to adorn the King 's menagerie . This precaution would have been of greater use if they had taken it with respect to the Standard of Mahomet , and of that prodigious quantity of riches , bows , quivers , sabers set with rubies , and diamonds , precious movables and equipages of great value , that were left with the tents to the King of Poland ; which made that monarch say very pleasantly in his letter to his Queen , \" You will not tell me at my return , what the Tartarian women tell their husbands when they see them return from the army without booty , You are not a Man , seeing you return empty-handed , ' for doubtless he was the first in the battle , who returns laden with the spoils of the Enemy ; the Grand Vizier having made me his Universal Legatee . \" The booty that was taken in this action is infinite and inestimable : the field of battle was sowed with gold sabers , with pieces of stuff , and such a prodigious quantity of other things that the pillage which has already lasted three days will scarce be over in a whole week , although the besieged are come out of the town in great companies to partake of the booty with the victorious soldier ; both the one and the other being scarce able as yet to persuade themselves that this happy success is real , it is so extraordinary : insomuch that the whole army , which nevertheless has done its duty very courageously , ca n't forbear to attribute this great victory to the mighty God of Battles , who would make use of the hands of the King of Poland to overthrow the enemies of his name , for which let him be honored and glorified forever and ever !

The following is an account of the victory of King Jan Sobieski in 1683 . The 18th century was to see both Poland and the Ottoman empire suffer a relative decline in power in comparison with the newer formations of Prussia , Austria and Russia : by the end of the 18th century Poland had been gobbled up by these states , and Ottoman Turkey endured a protracted conflict over which European state was going to dominate its territories . The Victory which the King of Poland has obtained over the Infidels , is so great and so complete that past Ages can scarce parallel the fame ; and perhaps future Ages will never see any thing like it . All its Circumstances are as profitable to Christendom in general , and to the Empire in particular , as glorious to the Monarch . On one hand we see Vienna besieged by three hundred thousand Turks ; reduced to the last extremity ; its Outworks taken ; the Enemy fixed to the Body of the Place ; Masters of one Point of the Bastions , having frightful Mines under the Retrenchments of the besieged : We see an Emperor chased from his Capital ; retired to a corner of his Dominions ; all his country at the mercy of the Tartars , who have filled the Camp with an infinite number of unfortunate Slaves that had been forcibly carried away out of Austria . On the other hand we see the King of Poland , who goes out of his Kingdom , with part of his Army , and hastens to succor his Allies , who abandons what is dearest to him , to march against the enemies of the Christian Religion willing to act in Person on this occasion , as a true Buckler of Religion ; and will not spare his eldest son , the Prince of Poland , whom he carries with him , even in a tender age , to so dangerous an Expedition as this was . That which preceded the battle is no less surprising . The Empire assembles on all sides , the Elector 's of Saxony and Bavaria come in person to join their troops with the Imperialists under the command of the Duke of Lorraine . Thirty other Princes repair out of emulation , to one another , to the Army , which nevertheless , before they will enter upon Action , stay for the presence of the King of Poland , whose presence alone is worth an Army . They all march with this confidence . The King passes the Danube first , and leaves no troops on the other side to cover Moravia from the incursions that the malcontents under Count Teckley might make into the same , as the Duke of Lorraine had proposed ; because , says the King , he had wrote to that Hungarian Lord , that if he burnt one straw in the territories of his allies , or in his own , he would go and burn him and all his family in his house , so that this was enough to protect that country during the distance of the army . He leads them afterwards , through unfrequented defiles to the tops of the hills of Vienna , and in fight of the Turks , who drew out of their camp to put themselves in order , and even attacked the Imperialists by break of day on Sunday the twelfth of September , before the King of Poland had made an end of forming his order of battle , and extending his lines , in which his Majesty has mixed his hussars , and other Polish troops among those of the Empire . In the meantime , the Turks leave their trenches well provided with Janissaries , with a considerable body of at the posts and at the attacks , to hinder the besieged from sallying out ; hoping to continue the siege at the same time as the army should make head against the succors of the Christian princes ; and truly they had wherewithal to back this proud revolution ; having above 300,000 men , according to the King 's account , who found above 100,000 small tents in their camp , wherein apparently according to the manner of disposing their men , there were at least three men in each , and his Polish Majesty has reduced the common report of 300,000 tents which would infinitely augment the number of soldiers to that of 1,000,000 . The battle was fought on the twelfth , it lasted fourteen or fifteen hours ; the slaughter was horrible , and the loss of the Turks inestimable , for they left upon the field of battle , besides the dead and prisoners , all their cannon , equipage , tents and infinite riches that they had been six years gathering together throughout the whole Ottoman Empire . There was found in their camp above a million pounds of powder , bullets , balls , and other ammunition , without reckoning the powder that the slaves burnt by inadvertency in several places of the park of the artillery , the flame whereof made an emblem of the terrible day of judgment , with the earthquakes that will accompany it ; and that thick mass of clouds that will obscure the universe : a loss nevertheless which ought to be called a great misfortune , seeing tis above a million pounds more , as the King assures us in his letter , that he wrote himself to the Queen , from which all these particulars are extracted . The battle ended by the infantry of the trenches , and of the Isle of the Danube , where the Turks had a battery [ of artillery ] . The night was spent in slaughter , and the unhappy remnant of this army saved their lives by flight , having abandoned all to the victors ; even an infinite number of wagons , laden with ammunition , and some field pieces , that designed to have carried with them ; and which were found next day upon the road they had taken ; which makes us suspect that they 'll not be able to rally again , as neither having wherewithal to encamp themselves nor cannon to shoot with . So soon as the Grand Vizier knew the defeat of his first lines , he caused a red tent to be pitched at the head of his main body , where he resolved to die for the Ottoman Empire , but his last efforts were to no purpose ; and the wing of the Imperialists , which he attacked with all his might , was so opportunely succored by the presence of the king , who brought part of the troops of his left wing thither , that all fled before him .

Battery Duportail , a Endicott Period Coastal Defenses was built over half of the Citalel 's footings Battery Duportail constructed between 1898 and 1900 . Following the Endicott System construction practice , incorporating concrete batteries into existing fortifications utilizing the old brick fort for additional protection . The design improvement of guns used during the American Civil War proved that brick and mortar forts like Fort Morgan obsolete . For a period of time after the American Civil War , the United States coastal defenses fell into disrepair and neglect . Many of then foreign powers were building heavily armored warships , armed with advance and powerful guns . In 1885 President Grover Cleveland appointed a joint military and civilian board to investigate and make recommendations on the modernizations of harbors and coastal defenses in the United States . The Board of Fortifications was headed by Secretary of War , William Crowninshield Endicott . Endicott 's board recommended a 127 million dollar construction program that included new forts with breech - loading cannons , mortars , floating batteries , and submarine mines for 29 locations along the U.S. coast . Battery Duportail was one of six batteries built at Mobile Point during that large - scale modernization . Battery Duportail was named after the Continental Army 's Chief of Engineers , Louis L. Duportail . The two story reinforced concrete structure was armed with two 12 inch disappearing guns . The Battery was in service from 1901 until the deactivation of Fort Morgan Military Installation in 1924 . The guns at Battery Duportail remained in place until 1942 when they were removed for scrape . Photographed By Timothy Carr , June 19 , 2013 9. Location of the Fort 's Powder Magazines . Credits .

The fire forced the Confederates to dump approximately 60,000 pounds of cannon powder into the fort 's water cistern to prevent it from exploding . On the morning of August 23rd , as the citadel continued to burn , Fort Morgan 's garrison surrendered to Union forces . After the surrender , portions of the Citadel walls were used as a source of brick for repairs to the damage sustained during the siege . The remaining remnants of the structure were razed in the 1880 's and the debris used as a break water on the east end of Daulphin Island . Topics .

The design improvement of guns used during the American Civil War proved that brick and mortar forts like Fort Morgan obsolete . For a period of time after the American Civil War , the United States coastal defenses fell into disrepair and neglect . Many of then foreign powers were building heavily armored warships , armed with advance and powerful guns . In 1885 President Grover Cleveland appointed a joint military and civilian board to investigate and make recommendations on the modernizations of harbors and coastal defenses in the United States . The Board of Fortifications was headed by Secretary of War , William Crowninshield Endicott . Endicott 's board recommended a 127 million dollar construction program that included new forts with breech - loading cannons , mortars , floating batteries , and submarine mines for 29 locations along the U.S. coast . Battery Duportail was one of six batteries built at Mobile Point during that large - scale modernization . Battery Duportail was named after the Continental Army 's Chief of Engineers , Louis L. Duportail . The two story reinforced concrete structure was armed with two 12 inch disappearing guns . The Battery was in service from 1901 until the deactivation of Fort Morgan Military Installation in 1924 . The guns at Battery Duportail remained in place until 1942 when they were removed for scrape . Photographed By Timothy Carr , June 19 , 2013 9. Location of the Fort 's Powder Magazines . Credits .

Sounds like fun to me . - Your hosts are Bruce Beck , Jeff Blatnick and Don Wilson . They explain that there 's a $ 150,000 prize for the winner , and then show us the brackets , letting us know that Pat Smith 's out with some health problems , and Paul Varelans is replacing him . - We 've got three judges to score the bouts should they go the distance for the first time in UFC history , and I 'm thinking that 's down to draws happening in two of the first three Superfights . Time limits are twelve minutes in the quarters , eighteen in the semis , and a twenty - seven minute opening period in the finals , with three minutes overtime if needed . Quarter - Finals : Tank Abbott vs Steve Jennum First up we 've got Tank Abbott , UFC 6 runner - up , against Steve Jennum , UFC 3 champion . Big size difference here as Tank outweighs Jennum by like 80lbs . Tank opens with a big right hand , and then follows with a takedown . Jennum immediately goes to half - guard , but Tank quickly scoots him into the fence . Jennum gets full guard as Tank tries to stand to drop some bombs , but ca n't kick the bigger man away , and Tank goes back into the guard and ends up forcing Jennum 's head into the fence , bending his neck at a bad angle , and Jennum ends up tapping out there . Pretty much a squash for Tank as Jennum could n't deal with his size and power . Quarter - Finals : Dan Severn vs Paul Varelans Next up is UFC 5 champion Dan Severn , coming off his loss to Ken Shamrock in the UFC 6 Superfight , against Paul Varelans , the runner - up at UFC 7 and the famous victim of Marco Ruas 's leg kicks . Severn comes right out of the gate with a swift takedown to side mount , and ties Varelans up from the top using his own arms . Varelans just looks lost on his back , and Severn forces his forearm into the big man 's throat , and then locks on a head and arm choke , squeezing it down for the tapout . These quarter - finals are going quickly , so far the first two fights have taken just under three minutes I think . Severn basically schooled Varelans , putting him on the mat quickly and wasting no time in finishing him off . Quarter - Finals : Oleg Taktarov vs Dave Beneteau Interesting one here as UFC 6 champion Taktarov is the sambo expert , while Beneteau from what I remember was quite a decent wrestling - based fighter . Beneteau , for those who do n't recall him , was the runner - up to Dan Severn at UFC 5 . Oleg clinches as they get underway , but Beneteau muscles him off and breaks . They go right back to the clinch though , and Taktarov blocks a takedown and then rolls for a leglock , nice move there . He grabs the leg and manages to pull Beneteau off - balance and down to the mat , looking for an ankle lock . Beneteau clubs him with his free leg , but Taktarov tightens up what looks like an Achilles hold ( I 'm not great with leglocks ! ) and Beneteau taps out there . Another quick fight , with Taktarov showing some seriously nice skill to roll and get the ankle lock that easily . Quarter - Finals : Marco Ruas vs Keith Hackney The final match of the round then , and it 's pitting reigning UFC champion ( from UFC 7 ) Marco Ruas , against the ' Giant Killer ' from UFC 3 \u2013 and the guy who used groin strikes in UFC 4 \u2013 Keith Hackney . I love Ruas and Hackney is always fun from what I 've seen so this ought to be good . They circle tentatively to open , and Ruas lands a leg kick that Hackney quickly answers with one of his own . Ruas lands another as they continue to circle , neither one seemingly wanting to make the first big move . Finally Hackney misses a wild overhand right , and Ruas clinches and shoves him to the fence , before manoeuvring into a rear waistlock . Ruas pulls him down and gets both hooks in quickly , and then flattens him right out , landing some punches to the side of the head to soften him up , before hooking in the rear naked choke for the tapout . Four quarter - finals , four submissions ! Much more tentative fight than the previous three , but it was still quite entertaining , and Ruas just showed in the end that he was a more skilled guy overall and was able to finish Keith with little difficulty . - Kimo joins Jeff Blatnick to plug his upcoming Superfight with Ken Shamrock at UFC 8 , wearing shades and a white vest , and looking for all intents and purposes like a villain from a Van Damme movie . Does n't tell us much of note outside of he 's been training hard for the fight though . Semi- Finals : Tank Abbott vs Dan Severn Tank once compared this fight to \u201c being raped by Freddie Mercury \u201d , so we shall see whether his comparison is close I guess . No real size advantage for Tank here like in the first fight either , as Severn is a big guy himself . They get underway , and Tank sprawls to avoid an early shot , following up with a couple of left hands and a knee to the head . Severn shoves him into the fence though , and then overpowers Tank and pulls him down , putting Tank on all fours . Severn keeps him down , landing some punches and then some nice elbows to the back of the head , and knees to the body from a side position . Severn moves into a front facelock and lands some knees from there , and then moves back out to the side again for some more elbows . Tank just looks trapped in the position as Severn moves to take his back , and continues to land elbows and knees , adding some slaps in for good measure . Severn continues to land , but ca n't slap a choke on at all , as Tank is completely unable to escape . Things play out like this for a long period of the fight , with Severn continuing to land big knees and elbows to the back of the head , seemingly not hurting Tank too badly , but doing enough to keep him down in the same position . Finally with three minutes remaining of the eighteen , Tank manages to get to his feet , but Severn still has him in a rear waistlock , and he lands knees to the thighs until releasing a few seconds before the fight ends . No points or anything like that , back here the judges just wrote the winner on a card , and sure enough it 's a unanimous decision for Dan Severn . Was n't really a major beatdown or anything , but Severn stifled Abbott from the very beginning and definitely stayed active throughout , continuously dropping big elbows to the back of the head , as well as knees to the body and legs . Tank was just unable to get out from underneath the ' Beast ' , and while it made for a slow fight in parts , it was a complete domination on the part of Severn . Semi-Finals : Oleg Taktarov vs Marco Ruas On paper this sounds like a strong fight , but the fact that I 've never heard anyone mention it makes me think it 's not going to turn out so great . Pretty even going in I would say as neither guy appeared to expend that much energy in their quarter- final bout . They circle tentatively to open ala Ruas 's earlier fight , before Taktarov shoots in and Ruas avoids the takedown . Ruas lands some of his leg kicks , before Oleg bulls him into the fence in a clinch . Ruas gives him some of his trademark foot stomps , but Taktarov rolls for a leglock again . Ruas avoids and lands some blows from the top , bloodying Taktarov up as the Russian gets a butterfly guard in . Ruas works the body , but Taktarov uses the fence nicely to stand , and they break off . Couple more leg kicks from Ruas land , and then he avoids a takedown , but Taktarov decides to strike himself now , catching Ruas off - guard with two left hooks . Ruas grabs him , but Taktarov jumps for a guillotine and pulls guard . The choke looks tight , but Ruas stays calm and never looks in much danger , and after a minute or so John McCarthy decides to stand them up and separate them . Doctor checks Oleg 's cuts , and then we restart with nine minutes remaining . They circle around with very little happening , as Ruas continues to throw the odd leg kick , while Oleg looks to punch . Ruas avoids a takedown , but Taktarov continues to push the action albeit without doing that much , and goes to his back at one point only for Ruas to stand off . Ruas continues to back away as Oleg plays the aggressor , walking the Brazilian down as Ruas seems content to dance away and land the odd counter , and finally the fight comes to an end . Announcers think it could go either way , but they 're leaning to Taktarov due to the aggression , and sure enough the judges go that way too . Ruas was apparently pissed off after this as he felt he should 've won due to the damage he caused Taktarov with his strikes , but while I can see his point \u2013 Taktarov for all intents and purposes did no damage at all \u2013 he was very tentative while Oleg was the clear aggressor in both striking and grappling . Could 've gone either way I guess , but it was a really slow fight regardless . - Ken Shamrock joins Bruce Beck to discuss the upcoming Kimo fight , and he puts Kimo over as a tough guy . Ken explains that he likes the Superfight format , and he 's all for the advent of judges as he does n't like how a guy can defend throughout a fight and still come away with a draw . Ken sticks around to join us on commentary for the finals . Finals : Dan Severn vs Oleg Taktarov And just like that , with apparently just fifteen minutes of rest for Taktarov , it 's time for the finals . I 'd probably give Taktarov the advantage in terms of how much gas these two have used so far , but Severn 's clearly got the advantage in that he 's sustained no damage whatsoever thus far while Oleg took a few good shots from Ruas . This is , of course , a rematch from their fight at UFC 5 that saw Severn cut up Oleg 's face so badly that McCarthy called a stoppage due to blood loss . Fight is twenty - seven minutes with a three - minute overtime period if necessary . They begin , and Severn opens by throwing some slapping combinations , I 'm guessing to avoid breaking his hands at all . Oleg swings for him , but slips , and Severn grabs him , only for Oleg to roll through to a kneebar . It looks fully extended for a moment , but Severn manages to turn into it , so Taktarov goes for an Achilles lock instead . Severn rolls with the pressure again , and they roll all the way towards the fence , where Severn ends up on top in half - guard . He immediately opens up Taktarov 's cuts from the Ruas fight , using short strikes , and then goes to the headbutts , looking to cut up Oleg further . Severn avoids another leglock attempt to get into side mount momentarily , but Taktarov works back to half - guard , only to take some more headbutts . Severn gets back into side mount for more of the same , and then moves himself back into Taktarov 's guard , where the action slows down now . Oleg gets a reversal from the bottom and stands , but Severn pulls him right back down , and Oleg goes into the turtle position where he takes some knees . Oleg works back to his feet though , and Severn backs off and releases him , and McCarthy calls time to have the doctors check Oleg 's bloodied face . They clean him up and okay him to go again , and with fifteen minutes to go they restart . Taktarov looks to punch , as Severn slaps him again , and then Oleg drops for a kneebar once more . Severn blocks and ends up in the half - guard again , where he appears to try a head - and - arm choke unsuccessfully . This goes on for a few minutes before McCarthy calls the restart standing . Taktarov presses forward as Severn throws some punches , and then gets a takedown to guard , but the action slows up a lot now as both men look exhausted . Some headbutts land from Severn , and then the first period comes to an end . After a minute 's rest we go into overtime , and Oleg presses forward as they exchange some crude punches , with neither guy landing anything of note . Oleg drops to his back for some reason , but Severn stands off and catches him with a clean right , and then waits for him to come back up . Severn lands some more punches and begins to dance around like a boxer , avoiding one last attempt from Taktarov to drop for a leg , and then finally we come to an end . All three judges score the bout for Severn , unsurprisingly as he pretty much dominated outside of the very early leglock attempt . Your typical Severn-vs - good fighter match really , as Severn controlled and did damage with his ground and pound , but could n't find a way to finish things off outside of hoping for a doctor stoppage due to the cuts . Taktarov showed heart to stay in there for the full thirty minutes , but this was all Severn really . By winning this tournament and becoming the * Ultimate * Ultimate Fighting Champion , Severn not only won the $ 150,000 prize money , but also earned a shot at Ken Shamrock for UFC 9 , and the less we talk about that fight the better . - And we end on that note , very abruptly as per usual with some of these older shows . Final Thoughts \u2026. Ultimate Ultimate 95 is quite interesting for what it is , in that it was the first time a UFC tournament was filled with fighters who had proven themselves inside the Octagon for the most part , and were n't bringing in any obscure martial art or new fighting form or anything . On that note , it 's especially interesting that all four of the opening round fights were finished by submission . In terms of the actual fights though , there 's not that much good stuff here \u2013 obviously the skill level in all of them is a lot higher than some early UFC stuff , say , Anderson vs . Hess or something , but in a way that makes them less exciting because they 're more technical . Taktarov- Ruas , especially , is a slow - paced fight that gets dull pretty quickly . The show is probably worth a recommendation purely because it 's the first UFC with nothing but solid \u2013 great fighters , but do n't expect any barnburners from the fights . Coming Soon \u2026.

He seized power in the ensuing chaos following the 15 January 1966 military coup , serving as the Nigerian Head of States from the 16th of January 1966 until his assassination on the 29th of July 1966 by a group of mutinous Northern Nigerian soldiers who were led by Captain Theophilus Danjuma , Lieutenant Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida , and Major Murtala Mohammed were army soldiers who revolted against his government in what was popularly called the July Counter Coup . Early Life Thomas Umunnakwe Aguiyi-Ironsi was born into the family of Mazi ( Mr. ) Ezeugo Aguiyi on the 3rd of March 1924 , in Ibeku , Umuahia , located in the present - day Abia State , Nigeria . At the age of eight , he went to live with his older sister , Anyamma , who was married to Theophilius Johnson , a Sierra Leonean diplomat working in Umuahia . Aguiyi-Ironsi subsequently took the last name of his brother - in - law as his first name , in admiration of Mr. Johnson for the father - figure role he played in his life . Aguiyi- Ironsi had his primary and secondary school education in Umuahia and Kano , respectively . At the age of 18 , he joined the Nigeria Regiment against the wishes of his sister . Military career In 1942 , Aguiyi- Ironsi joined the Nigerian Regiment , as a private with the seventh battalion . He was promoted in 1946 to company sergeant major . Also in 1946 , Aguiyi- Ironsi was sent on an officer training course in Staff College , Camberley , England . On 12 June 1949 , after completion of his course at Camberley , he received a short - service commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal West African Frontier Force , with a subsequent retroactive promotion to lieutenant effective from the same date . Aguiyi-Ironsi was granted a regular commission on 16 May 1953 ( seniority from 8 October 1947 ) , and was promoted to captain with effect from the same date ( seniority from 8 October 1951 ) . Aguiyi- Ironsi was one of the officers who served as equerry for Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and Nigeria , at the time she visited Nigeria in 1956 , for which he was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order ( MVO ) . He was promoted to major on 8 October 1958 . In 1960 , Aguiyi- Ironsi was made commandant of the fifth battalion in Kano , Nigeria , with the rank of lieutenant colonel Later in 1960 , Aguiyi - Ironsi headed the Nigerian contingent force of the United Nations Operation in the Congo . From 1961-1962 , Aguiyi- Ironsi served as the military attach\u00e9 to the Nigeria High Commission in London United Kingdom . During this period he was promoted to the rank of brigadier . During his tenure as military attach\u00e9 he attended courses at the Imperial Defence college ( renamed Royal College of Defence Studies in 1961 ) , Seaford House , Belgrave Square . He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire , Military Division ( MBE ) in the 1962 New Year Honours list . In 1964 he was appointed as the commandant of the entire United Nations peace keeping force in the Congo . In 1965 , Aguiyi-Ironsi was promoted to the rank of major general . That same year Major General C.B. Welby - Everard handed over his position as the general officer Commanding , GOC of the entire Nigerian Army to Major General Johnson Thomas Umunnakwe Aguiyi - Ironsi ( making him the first Nigeria indigenous officer to head the entire Nigerian Army ) . In January 1966 , a group of army officers , led by Major Chukwuma Nzeogwu , overthrew the central and regional governments of Nigeria , killed the prime minister , and tried to take control of the government in a failed coup d'\u00e9tat . Nzeogwu was countered , captured and imprisoned by Major General Johnson Aguiyi - Ironsi . Aguiyi-Ironsi was named military head of state on 17 January 1966 , a position he held until 29 July 1966 , when a group of northern army officers revolted against the government , and killed Aguiyi-Ironsi . Fall of the First Republic Main article : 1966 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat On 14 January 1966 , Soldiers of mostly Igbo extraction led by Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu , an Igbo from Okpanam near Asaba , present day Delta state , eradicated the uppermost echelon of politicians from the Northern and Western provinces . This and other factors effectively led to the fall of the Republican Government . Though Aguiyi-Ironsi , an Igbo , was purportedly slated for assassination , he effectively took control of Lagos , the Federal Capital Territory . With President also an Igbo Nnamdi Azikiwe refusing to intervene and insure the continuity of civilian rule , Aguiyi- Ironsi effectively compelled the remaining members of Balewa 's Government to resign seeing that the government was in disarray , he then allowed the Senate president Nwafor Orizu , another Igbo who was serving as acting president in Azikiwe 's absence , to officially surrender power to him , thus ending the First Nigerian Republic . Head of state 194 days in office Aguiyi-Ironsi inherited a Nigeria deeply fractured by its ethnic and religious cleavages . The fact that none of the high - profile victims of the 1966 coup were of Igbo extraction , and also that the main beneficiaries of the coup were Igbo , led the Northern part of the country to believe that it was an Igbo conspiracy . Though Aguiyi-Ironsi tried to dispel this notion by courting the aggrieved ethnic groups through political appointments and patronage , his failure to punish the coup plotters and the promulgation of the now infamous \u201c Decree No. 34 \u2033 \u2014 which abrogated the country 's federal structure in exchange for a unitary one \u2014 crystallized this conspiracy theory . During his short regime Aguiyi-Ironsi promulgated a raft of decrees . Among them were the Constitution Suspension and Amendment Decree No.1 , which suspended most articles of the Constitution ( though he left intact those sections of the constitution that dealt with fundamental human rights , freedom of expression and conscience were left intact ) . The Circulation of Newspaper Decree No .2 which removed the restrictions on press freedom put in place by the preceding civilian administration . According to Ndayo Uko , the Decree no . 2 was to serve \u201c as a kind gesture to the press .. \u201d to safeguard himself when he went on later to promulgate the Defamatory and Offensive Decree No.44 of 1966 which made it an \u201c offense to display or pass on pictorial representation , sing songs , or play instruments the words of which are likely to provoke any section of the country . \u201d He also as per the proposals of a single man committee passed the controversial Unification Decree No. 34 aimed to unify Nigeria into a unitary state . Counter coup and assassination On 29 July 1966 Aguiyi - Ironsi spent the night at the Government House in Ibadan , as part of a nationwide tour . His host , Lieutenant Colonel Adekunle Fajuyi , Military Governor of Western Nigeria , alerted him to a possible mutiny within the army . Aguiyi-Ironsi desperately tried to contact his Army Chief of Staff , Yakubu Gowon , but he was unreachable . In the early hours of the morning , the Government House , Ibadan , was surrounded by soldiers led by Theophilus Danjuma . Danjuma arrested Aguiyi-Ironsi and questioned him about his alleged complicity in the coup , which saw the demise of the Sardauna of Sokoto , Ahmadu Bello . The circumstances leading to Aguiyi-Ironsi death still remain a subject of much controversy in Nigeria . His body and that of Fajuyi were later discovered in a nearby forest . Legend The swagger stick with a stuffed crocodile mascot carried by Aguiyi-Ironsi was called \u201c Charlie \u201d . Legend had it that the crocodile mascot made him invulnerable and that it was used to dodge or deflect bullets when he was on mission in the Congo . Despite the stories , the crocodile mascot probably had something to do with the fact that the name \u201c Aguiyi \u201d translates as \u201c crocodile \u201d in Igbo . Personal life Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi was married to his wife Victoria in 1953 . Aguiyi- Ironsi 's son , Thomas Aguiyi-Ironsi , was appointed to the position of Nigeria 's Defence Minister on 30 August 2006 \u2013 forty years after his father 's death .

Thomas Andrew Lumisden Strange entered Westminster School , London , in 1769 and Christ Church College at Oxford in 1774 , graduating from the latter institution with a ba ( 1778 ) and an ma ( 1782 ) . Admitted to Lincoln 's Inn in 1776 , he was called to the bar in November 1785 and four years later was appointed chief justice of Nova Scotia . Strange 's appointment might be explained by his mother 's friendship with Lord Mansfield , a former cabinet minister . The nomination came during a dispute between the Nova Scotia House of Assembly and the Council , in part involving charges of partiality against justices James Brenton * and Isaac Deschamps * of the Supreme Court who had presided in the absence of a chief justice . Strange 's main task on his arrival at Halifax in May 1790 was to conciliate the warring factions , which he found anxiously watching him . To that end he dined \u201c with every one who invited me , \u201d including Jonathan Sterns , a lawyer whose suspension by Deschamps had been an early event in the so-called judges ' affair . Strange reinstated Sterns and managed to establish friendly relations with Brenton and Deschamps , whom he found \u201c very amiable , deserving persons and of great assistance to me . \u201d His tact , the passage of time , and the diversion created by the war with France in 1793 resolved the crisis . For the most part , Strange 's judicial duties had little to do with the dispute between assembly and Council . Most Supreme Court cases in the 1790s concerned the recovery of debts , which were usually small sums , although one case in 1790 involved a debt of more than \u00a3 24,000 Halifax currency . Occasionally , however , cases with political overtones reached the court . In 1793 Solicitor General Richard John Uniacke * accused Francis Green* , son of a former treasurer of the colony , of libel in connection with an attempt by Uniacke and others to obtain some papers from Green . Strange found Green guilty and awarded Uniacke \u00a3 500 in damages Although careful not to overlook his primary mission in Nova Scotia , Strange apparently also found time to use his influence as chief justice to oppose slavery . His successor , Sampson Salter Blowers , claimed that in cases involving runaway slaves Strange required \u201c the fullest proof of the master 's claim \u201d and that since this was difficult to produce \u201c it was found generally very easy to succeed in favour of the Negro . \u201d Blowers , as attorney general , and Strange frequently discussed how to proceed in such matters , and Strange decided to move slowly rather than \u201c throw so much property as it is called into the air at once . \u201d From the beginning many people in the colony liked Strange . Governor John Parr* expressed regret that Strange had not arrived earlier , and declared that the chief justice could have saved him much trouble and anxiety . Parr 's successor , John Wentworth * , expressed satisfaction with Strange on numerous occasions . In 1793 , for example , Wentworth reported that sessions of the Supreme Court had not been held in several counties that year , but said it was \u201c notwithstanding the best diligence of our good Ch. Justice , who is indefatigable in his duty . \u201d When in 1794 Wentworth realized that Strange might be attracted to a post in another colony , he declared that it would be \u201c the greatest misfortune to this province and to myself . \u201d Bishop Charles Inglis * also spoke highly of Strange for his abilities as chief justice , his \u201c life of strict probity & virtue , \u201d and his contribution as a member of the board of governors to the development of King 's College . Strange apparently showed a much greater interest in the college than did some of his fellow governors . He visited it on several occasions , worked with Inglis on plans for new buildings , and gave \u00a3 100 towards a college library . He was far more concerned by the possible cost of the college than Inglis was , but he hoped that it would become \u201c the Centre of Learning to the King 's Transatlantic Dominions . \u201d Despite his evident popularity , Strange became unhappy in Nova Scotia . In 1794 he expressed dissatisfaction with Wentworth and \u201c the Habits of his Family , \u201d an apparent reference at least in part to Wentworth 's morals . He also alleged that Wentworth had not been open with him \u201c in his views of Government . \u201d That year Strange sought the chief justiceship of Upper Canada , and expressed a desire to embrace \u201c the first opportunity of quitting this place . \u201d In some measure , Strange wanted a move for financial reasons . His salary was to have been \u00a3 1,000 , with \u00a3 200 to come from fees . But he discovered that the fees \u201c consisted of small sums , to be received often from very indigent people , who could but ill afford to pay them , \u201d and he had found deriving any of his income from such a source disagreeable . From time to time Strange gave some of the \u00a3 200 fee money for a law library , and then contributed to a collection of books \u201c of a more popular Nature \u201d for the town . In 1795 Strange stopped seeking the appointment in Upper Canada and instead requested permission to tour the United States when the war with France ended . His desire to get away may have been strengthened by his feelings of loss after his close friend the Reverend Andrew Brown * departed for Scotland that year . On 25 July 1796 Strange himself left for England . Although he indicated that he was only going home for a visit , as he had in 1791 , he was apparently not believed . In 1797 he informed Wentworth of his intention to resign . A year later he went to Madras ( India ) as recorder and president of its court . He was knighted on 14 March 1798 , before his departure . In 1800 he became chief justice of the Madras supreme court , over which he presided until his return to England in 1817 . He also wrote Elements of Hindu law ( 2 v. , London , 1825 ) , for many years the definitive work on the subject . As chief justice in Nova Scotia , Strange 's achievement in keeping the peace and winning respect for the Supreme Court was no mean feat . Blowers 's observation that Strange was \u201c a most excellent theoretical lawyer , \u201d but had practised little and once made an error in a trespass case which he had had to point out , seems petty in view of the praise Strange received from many quarters .

Thomas Andrew Lumisden Strange entered Westminster School , London , in 1769 and Christ Church College at Oxford in 1774 , graduating from the latter institution with a ba ( 1778 ) and an ma ( 1782 ) . Admitted to Lincoln 's Inn in 1776 , he was called to the bar in November 1785 and four years later was appointed chief justice of Nova Scotia . Strange 's appointment might be explained by his mother 's friendship with Lord Mansfield , a former cabinet minister . The nomination came during a dispute between the Nova Scotia House of Assembly and the Council , in part involving charges of partiality against justices James Brenton * and Isaac Deschamps * of the Supreme Court who had presided in the absence of a chief justice . Strange 's main task on his arrival at Halifax in May 1790 was to conciliate the warring factions , which he found anxiously watching him . To that end he dined \u201c with every one who invited me , \u201d including Jonathan Sterns , a lawyer whose suspension by Deschamps had been an early event in the so-called judges ' affair . Strange reinstated Sterns and managed to establish friendly relations with Brenton and Deschamps , whom he found \u201c very amiable , deserving persons and of great assistance to me . \u201d His tact , the passage of time , and the diversion created by the war with France in 1793 resolved the crisis . For the most part , Strange 's judicial duties had little to do with the dispute between assembly and Council . Most Supreme Court cases in the 1790s concerned the recovery of debts , which were usually small sums , although one case in 1790 involved a debt of more than \u00a3 24,000 Halifax currency . Occasionally , however , cases with political overtones reached the court . In 1793 Solicitor General Richard John Uniacke * accused Francis Green* , son of a former treasurer of the colony , of libel in connection with an attempt by Uniacke and others to obtain some papers from Green . Strange found Green guilty and awarded Uniacke \u00a3 500 in damages Although careful not to overlook his primary mission in Nova Scotia , Strange apparently also found time to use his influence as chief justice to oppose slavery . His successor , Sampson Salter Blowers , claimed that in cases involving runaway slaves Strange required \u201c the fullest proof of the master 's claim \u201d and that since this was difficult to produce \u201c it was found generally very easy to succeed in favour of the Negro . \u201d Blowers , as attorney general , and Strange frequently discussed how to proceed in such matters , and Strange decided to move slowly rather than \u201c throw so much property as it is called into the air at once . \u201d From the beginning many people in the colony liked Strange . Governor John Parr* expressed regret that Strange had not arrived earlier , and declared that the chief justice could have saved him much trouble and anxiety . Parr 's successor , John Wentworth * , expressed satisfaction with Strange on numerous occasions . In 1793 , for example , Wentworth reported that sessions of the Supreme Court had not been held in several counties that year , but said it was \u201c notwithstanding the best diligence of our good Ch. Justice , who is indefatigable in his duty . \u201d When in 1794 Wentworth realized that Strange might be attracted to a post in another colony , he declared that it would be \u201c the greatest misfortune to this province and to myself . \u201d Bishop Charles Inglis * also spoke highly of Strange for his abilities as chief justice , his \u201c life of strict probity & virtue , \u201d and his contribution as a member of the board of governors to the development of King 's College .

Reviewed by Chris MaGee In the early hours of June 30th , 1966 Fumio Hashiguchi , a miso manufacturing plant owner in Shimizu , Shizuoka , his wife and two teenage children were brutally stabbed to death in their home . The killer stole approximately \u00a5 260,000 and then set Hashiguchi 's house , with the family 's corpses inside , on fire . The brutality of the murders shocked the people of Shimizu , as it did the people of Japan . Police immediately went to work to find the person behind these heinous acts , and in very short order they found him . On July 4th police arrested Iwao Hakamada , a 30 - year - old ex-boxer and employee of the miso plant . Pajamas with a small blood stain were found in Hakamada 's room in the miso plant 's company dormitory . After nearly three weeks in police custody Hakamada confessed to the murders and after trial was found guilty and sentenced to death . A tragic story , no doubt , but what makes the Hakamada Incident , as it 's known in japan , that much more tragic is that Hakamada is innocent of the crime , yet to this day he still sits on death row waiting for his sentence to be carried out . This fascinating and utterly frightening legal conundrum has now been brought to the screen by director Banmei Takahashi in the film \" Box : The Hakamada Case \" . The Hakamada Incident has stayed in the headlines and in the Japanese public consciousness for the past 45 years due to the efforts of one man , Norimichi Kumamoto . In 1966 Kumamoto acted as one of three presiding judges who ruled in Hakamada 's trial , and it was Kumamoto who was the lone dissenter amongst the three officials and the man who eventually challenged the court ruling . Takahashi , takes us into the center of this legal nightmare through the eyes of Kumamoto , as portrayed by Masato Hagiwara . Kumamoto comes to learn of Hakamada 's believed innocence after not only going over the 45 books of transcripts of Hakamada 's interrogations by police , but also refuting evidence brought forward by the prosecution . We 're shown through flashbacks how Hakamada ( Hirofumi Arai ) suffered through hours of grueling psychological and physical torture by police in order to force a confession from him . Kumamoto knows that Hakamada is innocent of murder , but even after Hakamada 's blood stained pajamas come up as a dead end the police and prosecutors come forward with a new set of blood stained clothes . This a year after the initial investigation ! Kumamoto does eveything he can , including running his own forensic experiments and eventually resigning as a court judge , in order to prove to the Japanese judicial system that Hakamada has been wrongfully convicted . He 's still working on this today . Takahashi , best known on these shores as the director of of the 2009 religious / historical epic \" Zen \" , starts his exploration of the Hakamada Incident with a very interesting true life fact - both Hakamada and Kumamoto were both born in 1936 , only a short time apart . \" Box \" begins in 1936 and then through a black and white montage sequence chronicles Kumamoto 's legal studies and Hakamada 's boxing career . At one point the two men share sit side by side on board a train bound for Tokyo , never suspecting how their two lives will one day be intertwined . It 's easy to see the route that Takahashi , who also wrote the screenplay for \" Box \" is taking . Had Kumamoto 's life taken a different turn he could have landed on death row while Hakamada sat in the judge 's chair . One short scene from the opening montage speaks more about the rest of the film than all the other real or imagined links between the film 's two protagonists though . Takahashi shows us Kumamoto and Hakamada in their respective boyhood school days being instructed by their teachers to black out any offending Imperial propaganda form their textbooks with a brush and black ink . In effect the Japanese school system was forcing what the entire nation of Japan would do in the coming decades - deliberately burying the truth of Japan 's war time past in order to create a new post - war identity for their country . It 's exactly what occurs in Hakamada 's trial two decades later - instead of seeking out the truth behind the murders police and prosecutors find Hakamada , an outsider in Shimizu and an easy scapegoat , and make this young man fit the crime . When it becomes obvious that if a bit of effort and proper examination of evidence will utterly destroy their case the police and the Japanese legal system ( barring Kumamoto ) decide to bury the truth . It 's much easier that way . No one has to admit the terrible legal and moral errors that they made in sending an innocent man to death row . We 've seen films like \" Box : The Hakamada Case \" before - \" Dead Man Walking \" , \" I Just Did n't Do It \" and \" Vacation \" all come to mind , and with legal underdog stories there 's always a danger that things can go the route of chest -thumping melodrama . Takahashi avoids this by bringing together a truly impressive cast who bring Kumamoto 's crusade for justice to the screen . Hirofumi Arai ( Blue Spring , Neibhbor No. 13 ) downplays Hakamada , giving his character first a feeling of shock and disbelief , then resignation and finally harrowing grief . Meanwhile Renji Ishibashi ( Audition ) does a star turn as bureaucratic menace Tatematsu , the police detective who leads the investigation ( and subsequent inquisition and torture ) of Hakamada . Without performances like these \" Box \" would n't have be the film it is - a drama whose complexity is reflected in its deceptively simple title . Is \" Box \" a reference to Hakamada 's earlier profession as a boxer ? Is it the \" Box \" that Hakamada is imprisoned in ? Or is it that fact that he 's an innocent man forced to fit the mould of a murderer ? It 's all of the above in this satisfying film .","annotations":[{"text":"Shimizu , Shizuoka","span":[267,284],"token_span":[46,48],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place indicates where the burying occurs."},{"text":"When it becomes obvious that if a bit of effort and proper examination of evidence will utterly destroy their case","span":[4533,4646],"token_span":[839,858],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"Time is when the burying occurs"},{"text":"the police and the Japanese legal system ( barring Kumamoto )","span":[4648,4708],"token_span":[859,869],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent intentionally buries the Theme."},{"text":"the truth","span":[4725,4733],"token_span":[873,874],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The Theme is the object that is buried."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"The documentary film contrasts the lives of Hakamada and Kumamoto , focusing on Hakamada 's interrogation and trial .

Takahashi shows us Kumamoto and Hakamada in their respective boyhood school days being instructed by their teachers to black out any offending Imperial propaganda form their textbooks with a brush and black ink . In effect the Japanese school system was forcing what the entire nation of Japan would do in the coming decades - deliberately burying the truth of Japan 's war time past in order to create a new post - war identity for their country . It 's exactly what occurs in Hakamada 's trial two decades later - instead of seeking out the truth behind the murders police and prosecutors find Hakamada , an outsider in Shimizu and an easy scapegoat , and make this young man fit the crime . When it becomes obvious that if a bit of effort and proper examination of evidence will utterly destroy their case the police and the Japanese legal system ( barring Kumamoto ) decide to bury the truth . It 's much easier that way . No one has to admit the terrible legal and moral errors that they made in sending an innocent man to death row . We 've seen films like \" Box : The Hakamada Case \" before - \" Dead Man Walking \" , \" I Just Did n't Do It \" and \" Vacation \" all come to mind , and with legal underdog stories there 's always a danger that things can go the route of chest -thumping melodrama . Takahashi avoids this by bringing together a truly impressive cast who bring Kumamoto 's crusade for justice to the screen . Hirofumi Arai ( Blue Spring , Neibhbor No. 13 ) downplays Hakamada , giving his character first a feeling of shock and disbelief , then resignation and finally harrowing grief . Meanwhile Renji Ishibashi ( Audition ) does a star turn as bureaucratic menace Tatematsu , the police detective who leads the investigation ( and subsequent inquisition and torture ) of Hakamada . Without performances like these \" Box \" would n't have be the film it is - a drama whose complexity is reflected in its deceptively simple title . Is \" Box \" a reference to Hakamada 's earlier profession as a boxer ? Is it the \" Box \" that Hakamada is imprisoned in ? Or is it that fact that he 's an innocent man forced to fit the mould of a murderer ? It 's all of the above in this satisfying film .","annotations":[{"text":"the police","span":[4648,4657],"token_span":[859,860],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent intentionally buries the Theme."},{"text":"the Japanese legal system","span":[4663,4687],"token_span":[862,865],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent intentionally buries the Theme."},{"text":"the truth","span":[4725,4733],"token_span":[873,874],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The Theme is the object that is buried."},{"text":"When it becomes obvious that if a bit of effort and proper examination of evidence will utterly destroy their case","span":[4533,4646],"token_span":[839,858],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"Time is when the burying occurs"},{"text":"Shimizu , Shizuoka","span":[267,284],"token_span":[46,48],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place indicates where the burying occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-2874-1503-frame-Burying","frame":"Burying","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Agent or Cause places a Theme under a surface (often the ground) into a Goal location.","frame_ancestors":["Placing","Transitive_action","Objective_influence","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"LGBT camps LGBT summer camps are safe spaces designed for LGBT youths to experience the supportive atmosphere they may lack at home .

His grandfather , previously a wealthy man with ample property , went bankrupt due to the cursed habit . He saw how his friends ' fathers ignored the education and the wellbeing of their families . These memories made a vivid impression on the boy , and go a long way in explaining why today , Bali 's governor is not a keen supporter of gambling of any form . Later , when Pastika became Bali's Chief of Police , he all but eliminated the vice because of the social problems and untold misery it caused . It was during his tenure as Papuan 's police chief that Pastika helped solve the first Bali Bomb \u2013 the terrorist atrocity in Bali in October 2002 \u2013 which made him widely known all over the world . On an island whose economy is based on tourism , Pastika 's background as chief negotiator in the 2002 and 2005 Bali bombings has stood his political career in good stead . Of humble origins , I Made Mangku Pastika was born the son of a teacher in the small village of Sanggalangit in Buleleng Regency of north Bali in 1951 . After the devastating eruption of Gunung Agung in 1963 , the family 's struggles were so difficult that his father decided to join the government transmigration program in Bengkulu , south Sumatra , where he accepted a job as a school principal . Since the house was barely enough to accommodate the family , the young boy would sometimes sleep on one of the chairs in his father 's classroom . Pastika held many different jobs \u2013 cutting grass , selling ice cream and flowers , working as a handyman for a Chinese family \u2013 but his diligence paid off by graduating from senior high school in Palembang . One day , by pure chance , the young man accompanied a friend who wanted to enrol in the Indonesian police academy . When he learned that enrolment in the school was free of charge , it occurred to him to take up law enforcement work . He graduated from the academy in 1974 , beginning his long career as a police officer . Pastika began to distinguish himself from the start . While serving in Jakarta 's Tanjung Priok Harbour , several Chinese -speaking smugglers were driving a large cargo truck filled with electrical appliances to a warehouse . Pastika , who could speak Chinese , ordered the drivers to stop , thereby foiling a major smuggling attempt . Knowledge and experience that he later gathered in the police mobile brigade , in the criminal investigation unit and in Indonesia 's narcotics agency propelled his career forward . Pastika won an appointment as Chief of Police of East Nusa Tenggara ( NTT ) in 1999 at the time when the province was filled with refugees from East Timor . After serving in NTT , he was appointed Chief of the Papua Police Department . His first assignment was to investigate the murder of Theys Eluay , a respected local Papuan spokesman , which resulted in the conviction and sentencing of four Kopassus soldiers . When an opportunity arose to apply for a position as the police chief of his native province of Bali , Pastika was unable to qualify for the position . At the time he was a two -star general , and the post was open only to a one - star general . However , the post 's requirements were changed so that a two -star general qualified . After retiring from law enforcement as a three star general , Pastika became the first democratically elected governor of the island in 2009 . Previously , members of the upper Brahmana , Ksatriya and Wesya castes had governed the province . Pastika , who does not come from a privileged background , was the island 's first governor hailing from the peasant Sudra caste . As governor , he has always tried to close the gap between the people 's expectations and the government 's actual delivery . While the public is becoming better informed and action-oriented , the bureaucracy is stuck in their rules and regulations . He prefers to lead not by decree but by example . Not the sort of bureaucrat who goes home at 2 pm , he 's at his desk from 7:30 am to 5 pm . He 's actually on the job one way or the other seven days a week , working to change the mindset of the bureaucracy , encouraging Bali 's thousands of civil servants to be more disciplined and public service oriented and to adopt modern practices . He 's especially keen on developing what he calls \u201c e-government , \u201d computerizing government departments . A Man of the People After five years in the powerful position of Governor , Pastika has gained reputation as a straight - talking leader , a man who represents the needs and aspirations of the common man . A deeply religious man in a nation dominated by Muslims , Pastika is a big believer in harmony , solidarity and tolerance between the different inter-religious and inter-ethnic social groups . So involved is he with a lot of the poor that he has dedicated himself to poverty eradication . He has initiated grass root level programs to make housing more affordable and has repaired and upgraded 6,000 homes owned by poor Balinese . The Governor is in a large part responsible for Bali becoming the first province in Indonesia to have universal health care . Through efficient budgeting practices , he found a way to finance health care coverage for Bali 's residents .

His grandfather , previously a wealthy man with ample property , went bankrupt due to the cursed habit . He saw how his friends ' fathers ignored the education and the wellbeing of their families . These memories made a vivid impression on the boy , and go a long way in explaining why today , Bali 's governor is not a keen supporter of gambling of any form . Later , when Pastika became Bali's Chief of Police , he all but eliminated the vice because of the social problems and untold misery it caused . It was during his tenure as Papuan 's police chief that Pastika helped solve the first Bali Bomb \u2013 the terrorist atrocity in Bali in October 2002 \u2013 which made him widely known all over the world . On an island whose economy is based on tourism , Pastika 's background as chief negotiator in the 2002 and 2005 Bali bombings has stood his political career in good stead . Of humble origins , I Made Mangku Pastika was born the son of a teacher in the small village of Sanggalangit in Buleleng Regency of north Bali in 1951 . After the devastating eruption of Gunung Agung in 1963 , the family 's struggles were so difficult that his father decided to join the government transmigration program in Bengkulu , south Sumatra , where he accepted a job as a school principal . Since the house was barely enough to accommodate the family , the young boy would sometimes sleep on one of the chairs in his father 's classroom . Pastika held many different jobs \u2013 cutting grass , selling ice cream and flowers , working as a handyman for a Chinese family \u2013 but his diligence paid off by graduating from senior high school in Palembang . One day , by pure chance , the young man accompanied a friend who wanted to enrol in the Indonesian police academy . When he learned that enrolment in the school was free of charge , it occurred to him to take up law enforcement work . He graduated from the academy in 1974 , beginning his long career as a police officer . Pastika began to distinguish himself from the start . While serving in Jakarta 's Tanjung Priok Harbour , several Chinese -speaking smugglers were driving a large cargo truck filled with electrical appliances to a warehouse . Pastika , who could speak Chinese , ordered the drivers to stop , thereby foiling a major smuggling attempt . Knowledge and experience that he later gathered in the police mobile brigade , in the criminal investigation unit and in Indonesia 's narcotics agency propelled his career forward . Pastika won an appointment as Chief of Police of East Nusa Tenggara ( NTT ) in 1999 at the time when the province was filled with refugees from East Timor . After serving in NTT , he was appointed Chief of the Papua Police Department . His first assignment was to investigate the murder of Theys Eluay , a respected local Papuan spokesman , which resulted in the conviction and sentencing of four Kopassus soldiers . When an opportunity arose to apply for a position as the police chief of his native province of Bali , Pastika was unable to qualify for the position . At the time he was a two -star general , and the post was open only to a one - star general . However , the post 's requirements were changed so that a two -star general qualified . After retiring from law enforcement as a three star general , Pastika became the first democratically elected governor of the island in 2009 . Previously , members of the upper Brahmana , Ksatriya and Wesya castes had governed the province . Pastika , who does not come from a privileged background , was the island 's first governor hailing from the peasant Sudra caste . As governor , he has always tried to close the gap between the people 's expectations and the government 's actual delivery . While the public is becoming better informed and action-oriented , the bureaucracy is stuck in their rules and regulations . He prefers to lead not by decree but by example . Not the sort of bureaucrat who goes home at 2 pm , he 's at his desk from 7:30 am to 5 pm . He 's actually on the job one way or the other seven days a week , working to change the mindset of the bureaucracy , encouraging Bali 's thousands of civil servants to be more disciplined and public service oriented and to adopt modern practices . He 's especially keen on developing what he calls \u201c e-government , \u201d computerizing government departments . A Man of the People After five years in the powerful position of Governor , Pastika has gained reputation as a straight - talking leader , a man who represents the needs and aspirations of the common man . A deeply religious man in a nation dominated by Muslims , Pastika is a big believer in harmony , solidarity and tolerance between the different inter-religious and inter-ethnic social groups . So involved is he with a lot of the poor that he has dedicated himself to poverty eradication . He has initiated grass root level programs to make housing more affordable and has repaired and upgraded 6,000 homes owned by poor Balinese . The Governor is in a large part responsible for Bali becoming the first province in Indonesia to have universal health care . Through efficient budgeting practices , he found a way to finance health care coverage for Bali 's residents . Prior to free heath care , maternal mortality rates for 2009 were 76 deaths per 100,000 births . In 2010 , under free health care , that figure dropped to 51 per 100,000 . Thousands of qualifying people have had eye cataracts removed so they can see clearly again , many for the first time . Pastika has also proven himself to be a friend of the environment . The banjar of Bali 's 1,473 traditional villages were recruited to protect the environment . There have been marked improvements on the disposal of Kuta 's copious amounts of rubbish brought in by the sea tides .

This funny , tender play has screwy poetry and penetrating wisdom , oddball humor , deadpan soap , operatic arias , fantasy , spirituality and a soaring sense of romance . Most of all , it has tremendous compassion . It 's about learning to live with our flaws and those of others by forgetting the futile quest to iron out the rough edges and instead embracing the mess . And even at its messiest , when the playwright 's whimsical flourishes threaten to upset the delicate balance , the play is folded all together with a lithe , light touch by Ruhl and director Bill Rauch , who staged the world premiere at Yale Rep in 2004 . A pumped up reputation can be tough on emerging artists . Robbed of the sense of discovery afforded by an untrumpeted talent , critics can respond harshly to even minor disappointment . Without ever having had a major New York production of her work , Ruhl has achieved considerable stature , with literary prizes , a recent MacArthur Foundation \u201c genius grant \u201d and well - received stagings at top regional theaters across the country . So it 's both a pleasure and a relief that the arrival of her most celebrated play in Lincoln Center Theater 's constantly surprising production makes it clear what all the fuss is about . It 's a bold move to open a play with an extended , untranslated dirty joke in Portuguese . But that 's how we first encounter Matilde ( Vanessa Aspillaga ) , standing on a bench in the middle of Christopher Acebo 's austere white - on - white set . It 's soon revealed this earthy , sexy , slightly zaftig woman is live - in housekeeper for busy doctor Lane ( Blair Brown ) . But there 's a problem : Matilde hates to clean . Still mourning the deaths of her parents ( the funniest people in their Brazilian village , her mother literally died laughing and her father committed suicide soon after ) , 27 - year - old Matilde just wants to write jokes . \u201c I 'm sorry , but I did not go to medical school to clean my own house , \u201d says anal - retentive Lane as the elements of her spotless living room roll onto the stage . Enter Lane 's sister , Virginia ( Jill Clayburgh ) . Sweet and pliable where Lane is brittle and closed off , she loves to clean . Creating order out of chaos is her thing . She seeks \u201c a task \u201d to distract her from thoughts of a life that went downhill at age 22 . Virginia makes a secret pact with Matilde to clean Lane 's house . The cozy arrangement is scuppered when Lane comes home early and discovers the switch . She seems as upset about the deception as she is about the newfound knowledge that her husband Charles ( John Dossett ) has fallen in love with one of his patients . While he 's handsome and successful , Ana ( Concetta Tomei ) is not the expected trophy babe ; she 's a 67 - year - old woman with breast cancer . When Charles performs her mastectomy like an orchestra conductor in a quasi-sexual , quasi-religious ceremony accompanied by heavenly music , it 's a scene of unsettling beauty and sadness . Also seeking neatness , Charles brings Ana by to meet his wife , hoping they might all be friends . Ruhl has an uncanny ability to anchor even the most flighty romantic cliches \u2014 love at first sight , finding a soulmate , going crazy with love \u2014 in reality .

This funny , tender play has screwy poetry and penetrating wisdom , oddball humor , deadpan soap , operatic arias , fantasy , spirituality and a soaring sense of romance . Most of all , it has tremendous compassion . It 's about learning to live with our flaws and those of others by forgetting the futile quest to iron out the rough edges and instead embracing the mess . And even at its messiest , when the playwright 's whimsical flourishes threaten to upset the delicate balance , the play is folded all together with a lithe , light touch by Ruhl and director Bill Rauch , who staged the world premiere at Yale Rep in 2004 . A pumped up reputation can be tough on emerging artists . Robbed of the sense of discovery afforded by an untrumpeted talent , critics can respond harshly to even minor disappointment . Without ever having had a major New York production of her work , Ruhl has achieved considerable stature , with literary prizes , a recent MacArthur Foundation \u201c genius grant \u201d and well - received stagings at top regional theaters across the country . So it 's both a pleasure and a relief that the arrival of her most celebrated play in Lincoln Center Theater 's constantly surprising production makes it clear what all the fuss is about . It 's a bold move to open a play with an extended , untranslated dirty joke in Portuguese . But that 's how we first encounter Matilde ( Vanessa Aspillaga ) , standing on a bench in the middle of Christopher Acebo 's austere white - on - white set . It 's soon revealed this earthy , sexy , slightly zaftig woman is live - in housekeeper for busy doctor Lane ( Blair Brown ) . But there 's a problem : Matilde hates to clean . Still mourning the deaths of her parents ( the funniest people in their Brazilian village , her mother literally died laughing and her father committed suicide soon after ) , 27 - year - old Matilde just wants to write jokes . \u201c I 'm sorry , but I did not go to medical school to clean my own house , \u201d says anal - retentive Lane as the elements of her spotless living room roll onto the stage . Enter Lane 's sister , Virginia ( Jill Clayburgh ) . Sweet and pliable where Lane is brittle and closed off , she loves to clean . Creating order out of chaos is her thing . She seeks \u201c a task \u201d to distract her from thoughts of a life that went downhill at age 22 . Virginia makes a secret pact with Matilde to clean Lane 's house . The cozy arrangement is scuppered when Lane comes home early and discovers the switch . She seems as upset about the deception as she is about the newfound knowledge that her husband Charles ( John Dossett ) has fallen in love with one of his patients . While he 's handsome and successful , Ana ( Concetta Tomei ) is not the expected trophy babe ; she 's a 67 - year - old woman with breast cancer . When Charles performs her mastectomy like an orchestra conductor in a quasi-sexual , quasi-religious ceremony accompanied by heavenly music , it 's a scene of unsettling beauty and sadness . Also seeking neatness , Charles brings Ana by to meet his wife , hoping they might all be friends . Ruhl has an uncanny ability to anchor even the most flighty romantic cliches \u2014 love at first sight , finding a soulmate , going crazy with love \u2014 in reality . Yet it 's her fearless steps into Latin-flavored magic realism that make the play so distinctive , even when it veers toward preciousness . \u201c This is how I imagine my parents , \u201d says Matilde at various times , conjuring an elegant couple ( also played by Dossett and Tomei ) dancing and laughing and loving . \u201c This is how I imagine my husband and his new wife , \u201d says Lane , summoning another image of passionate harmony , visible also to Matilde .

You are probably not alone , as of Jan. 1 , 2022 0:00 UTC on-premises Exchange servers seem to freezing transport of all emails \u2013 a date ca n't get converted . Here is a quick overview of what is going on . Advertising FIP - FS Scan Engine FIP -FS is probably the anti-malware virus scanner that has been on board since Exchange Server 2013 . This is supposed to scan the on-premises Exchange Server installation for malicious content . However , this anti-malware scan engine seems to cause problems more often . Back in October 2016 , Frank Z\u00c3\u00b6chling published the German blog post Exchange 2016 : FIPFS Event ID 6027 Filter Updates werden nicht runtergeladen , which pointed out numerous error possibilities when updating the signature files . ver\u00c3\u00b6ffentlicht , der auf zahlreiche Fehlerm\u00c3\u00b6glichkeiten beim Aktualisieren der Signaturdateien hinweist . And in early December 2021 , someone on serverfault.com posted the entry Exchange 2019 Antimalware engine updates download but do n't get applied . There , the FIP - FS MS Filtering Engine permanently generates entries in the Event Viewer because updates could not be installed . It has probably affected different Exchange versions and might be related to downloads of updates or virus signatures . There the error was probably corrected by Microsoft . FIP - FS error Ca n't Convert \" 2201010001 \" to long I was just alerted on Twitter by a follower to the following tweet , which briefly describes the problem , which has been occurring since January 1 , 2022 . Under Exchange , the Microsoft Scan Engine FIP -FS cannot be loaded . Instead , the error Ca n't Convert \" 2201010001 \" to long is reported . Seems that the new date is a challenge for Exchange . In follow - up tweets , another user reports with the name Joseph Roosen : Advertising Umm ya having issues with no mailflow because of this since that keeps crashing over and over since 0000 UTC . Dear we have a problem with hybrid since this service keeps crashing so basically mail is down . @MSFTExchange \u00c2 @ Microsoft\u00c2 @MSFT365 Status So it fits , the Exchange does n't let any mails through anymore . And via Facebook , someone pointed me to this tweet from Joseph Roosen , which puts it a bit in context : Just in time for the new year , the virus scanner on Exchange Server goes on strike and scares administrators . Since March 2021 , Microsoft has published the article The FIP - FS Scan Process failed initialization . Error : 0x80010105 AND Faulting application name : scanningprocess.exe , which refers to Exchange Server 2016 on Windows Server 2016 . There is the current entry from 1/1/2022 : The exchange server was stuck with this error : The FIP - FS \" Microsoft \" Scan Engine failed to load . PID : 39268 , Error Code : 0x80004005 . Error Description : Ca n't convert \" 2201010003 \" to long . / Event ID 5300 I have disabled filtering : Set-Malware Filtering Server exch - 19 - Bypass Filtering $ true and email is going agian \u2026 and I am looking for more info how to recover malware scanning service FYI happy new year exchnage So it seems that some ( all ? ) Exchange servers are affected . Workaround : Disable Anti Malware Agent The affected person from the above tweet has meanwhile posted a very simple solution via Twitter . He has deactivated the anti-malware agent on the Exchange server . For this purpose there is the script Disable-AntiMalwareScanning.ps1 . Then malware scans are no longer executed \u2013 but the mails can be sent and delivered again . Someone else who is affected by this New Year 's surprise . Addendum : Microsoft has now confimed the issue and is working on a fix \u2013 see\u00c2 Microsoft confirms Exchange Year 2022 problem that FIP - FS Scan Engine failed to load ( Jan. 1 , 2022 ) .

You are probably not alone , as of Jan. 1 , 2022 0:00 UTC on-premises Exchange servers seem to freezing transport of all emails \u2013 a date ca n't get converted . Here is a quick overview of what is going on . Advertising FIP - FS Scan Engine FIP -FS is probably the anti-malware virus scanner that has been on board since Exchange Server 2013 . This is supposed to scan the on-premises Exchange Server installation for malicious content . However , this anti-malware scan engine seems to cause problems more often . Back in October 2016 , Frank Z\u00c3\u00b6chling published the German blog post Exchange 2016 : FIPFS Event ID 6027 Filter Updates werden nicht runtergeladen , which pointed out numerous error possibilities when updating the signature files . ver\u00c3\u00b6ffentlicht , der auf zahlreiche Fehlerm\u00c3\u00b6glichkeiten beim Aktualisieren der Signaturdateien hinweist . And in early December 2021 , someone on serverfault.com posted the entry Exchange 2019 Antimalware engine updates download but do n't get applied . There , the FIP - FS MS Filtering Engine permanently generates entries in the Event Viewer because updates could not be installed . It has probably affected different Exchange versions and might be related to downloads of updates or virus signatures . There the error was probably corrected by Microsoft . FIP - FS error Ca n't Convert \" 2201010001 \" to long I was just alerted on Twitter by a follower to the following tweet , which briefly describes the problem , which has been occurring since January 1 , 2022 . Under Exchange , the Microsoft Scan Engine FIP -FS cannot be loaded . Instead , the error Ca n't Convert \" 2201010001 \" to long is reported . Seems that the new date is a challenge for Exchange . In follow - up tweets , another user reports with the name Joseph Roosen : Advertising Umm ya having issues with no mailflow because of this since that keeps crashing over and over since 0000 UTC . Dear we have a problem with hybrid since this service keeps crashing so basically mail is down . @MSFTExchange \u00c2 @ Microsoft\u00c2 @MSFT365 Status So it fits , the Exchange does n't let any mails through anymore . And via Facebook , someone pointed me to this tweet from Joseph Roosen , which puts it a bit in context : Just in time for the new year , the virus scanner on Exchange Server goes on strike and scares administrators . Since March 2021 , Microsoft has published the article The FIP - FS Scan Process failed initialization . Error : 0x80010105 AND Faulting application name : scanningprocess.exe , which refers to Exchange Server 2016 on Windows Server 2016 . There is the current entry from 1/1/2022 : The exchange server was stuck with this error : The FIP - FS \" Microsoft \" Scan Engine failed to load . PID : 39268 , Error Code : 0x80004005 . Error Description : Ca n't convert \" 2201010003 \" to long . / Event ID 5300 I have disabled filtering : Set-Malware Filtering Server exch - 19 - Bypass Filtering $ true and email is going agian \u2026 and I am looking for more info how to recover malware scanning service FYI happy new year exchnage So it seems that some ( all ? ) Exchange servers are affected . Workaround : Disable Anti Malware Agent The affected person from the above tweet has meanwhile posted a very simple solution via Twitter . He has deactivated the anti-malware agent on the Exchange server . For this purpose there is the script Disable-AntiMalwareScanning.ps1 . Then malware scans are no longer executed \u2013 but the mails can be sent and delivered again . Someone else who is affected by this New Year 's surprise . Addendum : Microsoft has now confimed the issue and is working on a fix \u2013 see\u00c2 Microsoft confirms Exchange Year 2022 problem that FIP - FS Scan Engine failed to load ( Jan. 1 , 2022 ) .

They are 4 - byte integers . Zero is an invalid value . The maximum for each is ( 2^31 ) - 1 in order to accommodate languages that have difficulty with unsigned 4 - byte values . Bit depth is a single - byte integer giving the number of bits per sample or per palette index ( not per pixel ) . Valid values are 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 , although not all values are allowed for all color types . Color type is a single - byte integer that describes the interpretation of the image data . Color type codes represent sums of the following values : 1 ( palette used ) , 2 ( color used ) , and 4 ( alpha channel used ) . Valid values are 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 . Bit depth restrictions for each color type are imposed to simplify implementations and to prohibit combinations that do not compress well . Decoders must support all legal combinations of bit depth and color type . The allowed combinations are : Color Allowed Interpretation Type Bit Depths 0 1,2,4,8,16 Each pixel is a grayscale sample . 2 8,16 Each pixel is an R ,G,B triple . 3 1,2,4,8 Each pixel is a palette index ; a PLTE chunk must appear . 4 8,16 Each pixel is a grayscale sample , followed by an alpha sample . 6 8,16 Each pixel is an R ,G,B triple , followed by an alpha sample . The sample depth is the same as the bit depth except in the case of color type 3 , in which the sample depth is always 8 bits . Compression method is a single - byte integer that indicates the method used to compress the image data . At present , only compression method 0 ( deflate / inflate compression with a 32 K sliding window ) is defined . All standard PNG images must be compressed with this scheme . The compression method field is provided for possible future expansion or proprietary variants . Decoders must check this byte and report an error if it holds an unrecognized code . See Deflate / Inflate Compression for details . Filter method is a single - byte integer that indicates the preprocessing method applied to the image data before compression . At present , only filter method 0 ( adaptive filtering with five basic filter types ) is defined . As with the compression method field , decoders must check this byte and report an error if it holds an unrecognized code . See Filter Algorithms for details . Interlace method is a single - byte integer that indicates the transmission order of the image data . Two values are currently defined : 0 ( no interlace ) or 1 ( Adam7 interlace ) . See Interlaced data order for details . Red : 1 byte ( 0 = black , 255 = red ) Green : 1 byte ( 0 = black , 255 = green ) Blue : 1 byte ( 0 = black , 255 = blue ) The number of entries is determined from the chunk length . A chunk length not divisible by 3 is an error . This chunk must appear for color type 3 , and can appear for color types 2 and 6 ; it must not appear for color types 0 and 4 . If this chunk does appear , it must precede the first IDAT chunk . There must not be more than one PLTE chunk . For color type 3 ( indexed color ) , the PLTE chunk is required . The first entry in PLTE is referenced by pixel value 0 , the second by pixel value 1 , etc . The number of palette entries must not exceed the range that can be represented in the image bit depth ( for example , 2^4 = 16 for a bit depth of 4 ) . It is permissible to have fewer entries than the bit depth would allow . In that case , any out - of - range pixel value found in the image data is an error . For color types 2 and 6 ( truecolor and truecolor with alpha ) , the PLTE chunk is optional . If present , it provides a suggested set of from 1 to 256 colors to which the truecolor image can be quantized if the viewer cannot display truecolor directly . If PLTE is not present , such a viewer will need to select colors on its own , but it is often preferable for this to be done once by the encoder . ( See Recommendations for Encoders : Suggested palettes . ) Note that the palette uses 8 bits ( 1 byte ) per sample regardless of the image bit depth specification . In particular , the palette is 8 bits deep even when it is a suggested quantization of a 16 - bit truecolor image . There is no requirement that the palette entries all be used by the image , nor that they all be different . To read the image data , reverse this process . There can be multiple IDAT chunks ; if so , they must appear consecutively with no other intervening chunks . The compressed datastream is then the concatenation of the contents of all the IDAT chunks . The encoder can divide the compressed datastream into IDAT chunks however it wishes . ( Multiple IDAT chunks are allowed so that encoders can work in a fixed amount of memory ; typically the chunk size will correspond to the encoder 's buffer size . ) It is important to emphasize that IDAT chunk boundaries have no semantic significance and can occur at any point in the compressed datastream . A PNG file in which each IDAT chunk contains only one data byte is legal , though remarkably wasteful of space . ( For that matter , zero-length IDAT chunks are legal , though even more wasteful . ) See Filter Algorithms and Deflate / Inflate Compression for details . The standard ancillary chunks are listed in alphabetical order . This is not necessarily the order in which they would appear in a file . For color type 3 ( indexed color ) , the bKGD chunk contains : Palette index : 1 byte The value is the palette index of the color to be used as background . For color types 0 and 4 ( grayscale , with or without alpha ) , bKGD contains : Gray : 2 bytes , range 0 .. ( 2^bitdepth ) - 1 ( For consistency , 2 bytes are used regardless of the image bit depth . ) The value is the gray level to be used as background . For color types 2 and 6 ( truecolor , with or without alpha ) , bKGD contains : Red : 2 bytes , range 0 .. ( 2^bitdepth ) -1 Green : 2 bytes , range 0 .. ( 2^bitdepth ) -1 Blue : 2 bytes , range 0 .. ( 2^bitdepth ) -1 ( For consistency , 2 bytes per sample are used regardless of the image bit depth . ) This is the RGB color to be used as background . When present , the bKGD chunk must precede the first IDAT chunk , and must follow the PLTE chunk , if any . See Recommendations for Decoders : Background color . The cHRM chunk contains : White Point x : 4 bytes White Point y : 4 bytes Red x : 4 bytes Red y : 4 bytes Green x : 4 bytes Green y : 4 bytes Blue x : 4 bytes Blue y : 4 bytes Each value is encoded as a 4 - byte unsigned integer , representing the x or y value times 100000 . For example , a value of 0.3127 would be stored as the integer 31270 . cHRM is allowed in all PNG files , although it is of little value for grayscale images . If the encoder does not know the chromaticity values , it should not write a cHRM chunk ; the absence of a cHRM chunk indicates that the image 's primary colors are device-dependent . If the cHRM chunk appears , it must precede the first IDAT chunk , and it must also precede the PLTE chunk if present . See Recommendations for Encoders : Encoder color handling , and Recommendations for Decoders : Decoder color handling . The gAMA chunk contains : Image gamma : 4 bytes The value is encoded as a 4 - byte unsigned integer , representing gamma times 100000 . For example , a gamma of 0.45 would be stored as the integer 45000 . If the encoder does not know the image 's gamma value , it should not write a g AMA chunk ; the absence of a g AMA chunk indicates that the gamma is unknown . If the gAMA chunk appears , it must precede the first IDAT chunk , and it must also precede the PLTE chunk if present . See Gamma correction , Recommendations for Encoders : Encoder gamma handling , and Recommendations for Decoders : Decoder gamma handling . The hIST chunk contains a series of 2 - byte ( 16 bit ) unsigned integers . There must be exactly one entry for each entry in the PLTE chunk . Each entry is proportional to the fraction of pixels in the image that have that palette index ; the exact scale factor is chosen by the encoder . Histogram entries are approximate , with the exception that a zero entry specifies that the corresponding palette entry is not used at all in the image . It is required that a histogram entry be nonzero if there are any pixels of that color . When the palette is a suggested quantization of a truecolor image , the histogram is necessarily approximate , since a decoder may map pixels to palette entries differently than the encoder did . In this situation , zero entries should not appear . The hIST chunk , if it appears , must follow the PLTE chunk , and must precede the first IDAT chunk . See Rationale : Palette histograms , and Recommendations for Decoders : Suggested - palette and histogram usage . Pixels per unit , X axis : 4 bytes ( unsigned integer ) Pixels per unit , Y axis : 4 bytes ( unsigned integer ) Unit specifier : 1 byte The following values are legal for the unit specifier : 0 : unit is unknown 1 : unit is the meter When the unit specifier is 0 , the pHYs chunk defines pixel aspect ratio only ; the actual size of the pixels remains unspecified . Conversion note : one inch is equal to exactly 0.0254 meters . If this ancillary chunk is not present , pixels are assumed to be square , and the physical size of each pixel is unknown . If present , this chunk must precede the first IDAT chunk . See Recommendations for Decoders : Pixel dimensions . For color type 0 ( grayscale ) , the sBIT chunk contains a single byte , indicating the number of bits that were significant in the source data . For color type 2 ( truecolor ) , the sBIT chunk contains three bytes , indicating the number of bits that were significant in the source data for the red , green , and blue channels , respectively . For color type 3 ( indexed color ) , the sBIT chunk contains three bytes , indicating the number of bits that were significant in the source data for the red , green , and blue components of the palette entries , respectively . For color type 4 ( grayscale with alpha channel ) , the sBIT chunk contains two bytes , indicating the number of bits that were significant in the source grayscale data and the source alpha data , respectively . For color type 6 ( truecolor with alpha channel ) , the sBIT chunk contains four bytes , indicating the number of bits that were significant in the source data for the red , green , blue and alpha channels , respectively . Each depth specified in sBIT must be greater than zero and less than or equal to the sample depth ( which is 8 for indexed - color images , and the bit depth given in IHDR for other color types ) . A decoder need not pay attention to sBIT : the stored image is a valid PNG file of the sample depth indicated by IHDR . However , if the decoder wishes to recover the original data at its original precision , this can be done by right - shifting the stored samples ( the stored palette entries , for an indexed - color image ) . The encoder must scale the data in such a way that the high - order bits match the original data . If the sBIT chunk appears , it must precede the first IDAT chunk , and it must also precede the PLTE chunk if present . See Recommendations for Encoders : Sample depth scaling and Recommendations for Decoders : Sample depth rescaling . Keyword : 1 - 79 bytes ( character string ) Null separator : 1 byte Text : n bytes ( character string ) The keyword and text string are separated by a zero byte ( null character ) . Neither the keyword nor the text string can contain a null character . Note that the text string is not null-terminated ( the length of the chunk is sufficient information to locate the ending ) . The keyword must be at least one character and less than 80 characters long . The text string can be of any length from zero bytes up to the maximum permissible chunk size less the length of the keyword and separator . Any number of tEXt chunks can appear , and more than one with the same keyword is permissible . The keyword indicates the type of information represented by the text string . The following keywords are predefined and should be used where appropriate : Title Short ( one line ) title or caption for image Author Name of image 's creator Description Description of image ( possibly long ) Copyright Copyright notice Creation Time Time of original image creation Software Software used to create the image Disclaimer Legal disclaimer Warning Warning of nature of content Source Device used to create the image Comment Miscellaneous comment ; conversion from GIF comment For the Creation Time keyword , the date format defined in section 5.2.14 of RFC 1123 is suggested , but not required [ RFC - 1123 ] . Decoders should allow for free - format text associated with this or any other keyword . Other keywords may be invented for other purposes . Keywords of general interest can be registered with the maintainers of the PNG specification . However , it is also permitted to use private unregistered keywords . ( Private keywords should be reasonably self - explanatory , in order to minimize the chance that the same keyword will be used for incompatible purposes by different people . ) Both keyword and text are interpreted according to the ISO 8859 - 1 ( Latin - 1 ) character set [ ISO - 8859 ] . The text string can contain any Latin-1 character . Newlines in the text string should be represented by a single linefeed character ( decimal 10 ) ; use of other control characters in the text is discouraged . Keywords must contain only printable Latin -1 characters and spaces ; that is , only character codes 32 - 126 and 161- 255 decimal are allowed . To reduce the chances for human misreading of a keyword , leading and trailing spaces are forbidden , as are consecutive spaces . Note also that the non-breaking space ( code 160 ) is not permitted in keywords , since it is visually indistinguishable from an ordinary space . Keywords must be spelled exactly as registered , so that decoders can use simple literal comparisons when looking for particular keywords . In particular , keywords are considered case-sensitive . See Recommendations for Encoders : Text chunk processing and Recommendations for Decoders : Text chunk processing . Year : 2 bytes ( complete ; for example , 1995 , not 95 ) Month : 1 byte ( 1 - 12 ) Day : 1 byte ( 1 - 31 ) Hour : 1 byte ( 0 - 23 ) Minute : 1 byte ( 0 - 59 ) Second : 1 byte ( 0 - 60 ) ( yes , 60 , for leap seconds ; not 61 , a common error ) Universal Time ( UTC , also called GMT ) should be specified rather than local time . The tIME chunk is intended for use as an automatically - applied time stamp that is updated whenever the image data is changed . It is recommended that tIME not be changed by PNG editors that do not change the image data . See also the Creation Time tEXt keyword , which can be used for a user-supplied time . For color type 3 ( indexed color ) , the tRNS chunk contains a series of one - byte alpha values , corresponding to entries in the PLTE chunk : Alpha for palette index 0 : 1 byte Alpha for palette index 1 : 1 byte ... etc ... Each entry indicates that pixels of the corresponding palette index must be treated as having the specified alpha value . Alpha values have the same interpretation as in an 8 - bit full alpha channel : 0 is fully transparent , 255 is fully opaque , regardless of image bit depth . The tRNS chunk must not contain more alpha values than there are palette entries , but tRNS can contain fewer values than there are palette entries . In this case , the alpha value for all remaining palette entries is assumed to be 255 . In the common case in which only palette index 0 need be made transparent , only a one - byte tRNS chunk is needed . For color type 0 ( grayscale ) , the tRNS chunk contains a single gray level value , stored in the format : Gray : 2 bytes , range 0 .. ( 2^bitdepth ) - 1 ( For consistency , 2 bytes are used regardless of the image bit depth . ) Pixels of the specified gray level are to be treated as transparent ( equivalent to alpha value 0 ) ; all other pixels are to be treated as fully opaque ( alpha value ( 2^bitdepth ) - 1 ) . For color type 2 ( truecolor ) , the tRNS chunk contains a single RGB color value , stored in the format : Red : 2 bytes , range 0 .. ( 2^bitdepth ) -1 Green : 2 bytes , range 0 .. ( 2^bitdepth ) -1 Blue : 2 bytes , range 0 .. ( 2^bitdepth ) - 1 ( For consistency , 2 bytes per sample are used regardless of the image bit depth . ) Pixels of the specified color value are to be treated as transparent ( equivalent to alpha value 0 ) ; all other pixels are to be treated as fully opaque ( alpha value ( 2^bitdepth ) - 1 ) . tRNS is prohibited for color types 4 and 6 , since a full alpha channel is already present in those cases . Note : when dealing with 16 - bit grayscale or truecolor data , it is important to compare both bytes of the sample values to determine whether a pixel is transparent . Although decoders may drop the low-order byte of the samples for display , this must not occur until after the data has been tested for transparency . For example , if the grayscale level 0x0001 is specified to be transparent , it would be incorrect to compare only the high - order byte and decide that 0x0002 is also transparent . When present , the tRNS chunk must precede the first IDAT chunk , and must follow the PLTE chunk , if any . A zTXt chunk contains : Keyword : 1 - 79 bytes ( character string ) Null separator : 1 byte Compression method : 1 byte Compressed text : n bytes The keyword and null separator are exactly the same as in the tEXt chunk . Note that the keyword is not compressed . The compression method byte identifies the compression method used in this zTXt chunk . The only value presently defined for it is 0 ( deflate / inflate compression ) . The compression method byte is followed by a compressed datastream that makes up the remainder of the chunk . For compression method 0 , this datastream adheres to the zlib datastream format ( see Deflate / Inflate Compression ) . Decompression of this datastream yields Latin - 1 text that is identical to the text that would be stored in an equivalent tEXt chunk .

They are 4 - byte integers . Zero is an invalid value . The maximum for each is ( 2^31 ) - 1 in order to accommodate languages that have difficulty with unsigned 4 - byte values . Bit depth is a single - byte integer giving the number of bits per sample or per palette index ( not per pixel ) . Valid values are 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 , although not all values are allowed for all color types . Color type is a single - byte integer that describes the interpretation of the image data . Color type codes represent sums of the following values : 1 ( palette used ) , 2 ( color used ) , and 4 ( alpha channel used ) . Valid values are 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 . Bit depth restrictions for each color type are imposed to simplify implementations and to prohibit combinations that do not compress well . Decoders must support all legal combinations of bit depth and color type . The allowed combinations are : Color Allowed Interpretation Type Bit Depths 0 1,2,4,8,16 Each pixel is a grayscale sample . 2 8,16 Each pixel is an R ,G,B triple . 3 1,2,4,8 Each pixel is a palette index ; a PLTE chunk must appear . 4 8,16 Each pixel is a grayscale sample , followed by an alpha sample . 6 8,16 Each pixel is an R ,G,B triple , followed by an alpha sample . The sample depth is the same as the bit depth except in the case of color type 3 , in which the sample depth is always 8 bits . Compression method is a single - byte integer that indicates the method used to compress the image data . At present , only compression method 0 ( deflate / inflate compression with a 32 K sliding window ) is defined . All standard PNG images must be compressed with this scheme . The compression method field is provided for possible future expansion or proprietary variants . Decoders must check this byte and report an error if it holds an unrecognized code . See Deflate / Inflate Compression for details . Filter method is a single - byte integer that indicates the preprocessing method applied to the image data before compression . At present , only filter method 0 ( adaptive filtering with five basic filter types ) is defined . As with the compression method field , decoders must check this byte and report an error if it holds an unrecognized code . See Filter Algorithms for details . Interlace method is a single - byte integer that indicates the transmission order of the image data . Two values are currently defined : 0 ( no interlace ) or 1 ( Adam7 interlace ) . See Interlaced data order for details . Red : 1 byte ( 0 = black , 255 = red ) Green : 1 byte ( 0 = black , 255 = green ) Blue : 1 byte ( 0 = black , 255 = blue ) The number of entries is determined from the chunk length . A chunk length not divisible by 3 is an error . This chunk must appear for color type 3 , and can appear for color types 2 and 6 ; it must not appear for color types 0 and 4 . If this chunk does appear , it must precede the first IDAT chunk . There must not be more than one PLTE chunk . For color type 3 ( indexed color ) , the PLTE chunk is required . The first entry in PLTE is referenced by pixel value 0 , the second by pixel value 1 , etc . The number of palette entries must not exceed the range that can be represented in the image bit depth ( for example , 2^4 = 16 for a bit depth of 4 ) . It is permissible to have fewer entries than the bit depth would allow . In that case , any out - of - range pixel value found in the image data is an error . For color types 2 and 6 ( truecolor and truecolor with alpha ) , the PLTE chunk is optional . If present , it provides a suggested set of from 1 to 256 colors to which the truecolor image can be quantized if the viewer cannot display truecolor directly . If PLTE is not present , such a viewer will need to select colors on its own , but it is often preferable for this to be done once by the encoder . ( See Recommendations for Encoders : Suggested palettes . ) Note that the palette uses 8 bits ( 1 byte ) per sample regardless of the image bit depth specification . In particular , the palette is 8 bits deep even when it is a suggested quantization of a 16 - bit truecolor image . There is no requirement that the palette entries all be used by the image , nor that they all be different . To read the image data , reverse this process . There can be multiple IDAT chunks ; if so , they must appear consecutively with no other intervening chunks . The compressed datastream is then the concatenation of the contents of all the IDAT chunks . The encoder can divide the compressed datastream into IDAT chunks however it wishes . ( Multiple IDAT chunks are allowed so that encoders can work in a fixed amount of memory ; typically the chunk size will correspond to the encoder 's buffer size . ) It is important to emphasize that IDAT chunk boundaries have no semantic significance and can occur at any point in the compressed datastream . A PNG file in which each IDAT chunk contains only one data byte is legal , though remarkably wasteful of space . ( For that matter , zero-length IDAT chunks are legal , though even more wasteful . ) See Filter Algorithms and Deflate / Inflate Compression for details . The standard ancillary chunks are listed in alphabetical order . This is not necessarily the order in which they would appear in a file . For color type 3 ( indexed color ) , the bKGD chunk contains : Palette index : 1 byte The value is the palette index of the color to be used as background . For color types 0 and 4 ( grayscale , with or without alpha ) , bKGD contains : Gray : 2 bytes , range 0 .. ( 2^bitdepth ) - 1 ( For consistency , 2 bytes are used regardless of the image bit depth . ) The value is the gray level to be used as background . For color types 2 and 6 ( truecolor , with or without alpha ) , bKGD contains : Red : 2 bytes , range 0 .. ( 2^bitdepth ) -1 Green : 2 bytes , range 0 .. ( 2^bitdepth ) -1 Blue : 2 bytes , range 0 .. ( 2^bitdepth ) -1 ( For consistency , 2 bytes per sample are used regardless of the image bit depth . ) This is the RGB color to be used as background . When present , the bKGD chunk must precede the first IDAT chunk , and must follow the PLTE chunk , if any . See Recommendations for Decoders : Background color . The cHRM chunk contains : White Point x : 4 bytes White Point y : 4 bytes Red x : 4 bytes Red y : 4 bytes Green x : 4 bytes Green y : 4 bytes Blue x : 4 bytes Blue y : 4 bytes Each value is encoded as a 4 - byte unsigned integer , representing the x or y value times 100000 . For example , a value of 0.3127 would be stored as the integer 31270 . cHRM is allowed in all PNG files , although it is of little value for grayscale images . If the encoder does not know the chromaticity values , it should not write a cHRM chunk ; the absence of a cHRM chunk indicates that the image 's primary colors are device-dependent . If the cHRM chunk appears , it must precede the first IDAT chunk , and it must also precede the PLTE chunk if present . See Recommendations for Encoders : Encoder color handling , and Recommendations for Decoders : Decoder color handling . The gAMA chunk contains : Image gamma : 4 bytes The value is encoded as a 4 - byte unsigned integer , representing gamma times 100000 . For example , a gamma of 0.45 would be stored as the integer 45000 . If the encoder does not know the image 's gamma value , it should not write a g AMA chunk ; the absence of a g AMA chunk indicates that the gamma is unknown . If the gAMA chunk appears , it must precede the first IDAT chunk , and it must also precede the PLTE chunk if present . See Gamma correction , Recommendations for Encoders : Encoder gamma handling , and Recommendations for Decoders : Decoder gamma handling . The hIST chunk contains a series of 2 - byte ( 16 bit ) unsigned integers . There must be exactly one entry for each entry in the PLTE chunk . Each entry is proportional to the fraction of pixels in the image that have that palette index ; the exact scale factor is chosen by the encoder . Histogram entries are approximate , with the exception that a zero entry specifies that the corresponding palette entry is not used at all in the image . It is required that a histogram entry be nonzero if there are any pixels of that color . When the palette is a suggested quantization of a truecolor image , the histogram is necessarily approximate , since a decoder may map pixels to palette entries differently than the encoder did . In this situation , zero entries should not appear . The hIST chunk , if it appears , must follow the PLTE chunk , and must precede the first IDAT chunk . See Rationale : Palette histograms , and Recommendations for Decoders : Suggested - palette and histogram usage . Pixels per unit , X axis : 4 bytes ( unsigned integer ) Pixels per unit , Y axis : 4 bytes ( unsigned integer ) Unit specifier : 1 byte The following values are legal for the unit specifier : 0 : unit is unknown 1 : unit is the meter When the unit specifier is 0 , the pHYs chunk defines pixel aspect ratio only ; the actual size of the pixels remains unspecified . Conversion note : one inch is equal to exactly 0.0254 meters . If this ancillary chunk is not present , pixels are assumed to be square , and the physical size of each pixel is unknown . If present , this chunk must precede the first IDAT chunk . See Recommendations for Decoders : Pixel dimensions . For color type 0 ( grayscale ) , the sBIT chunk contains a single byte , indicating the number of bits that were significant in the source data . For color type 2 ( truecolor ) , the sBIT chunk contains three bytes , indicating the number of bits that were significant in the source data for the red , green , and blue channels , respectively . For color type 3 ( indexed color ) , the sBIT chunk contains three bytes , indicating the number of bits that were significant in the source data for the red , green , and blue components of the palette entries , respectively . For color type 4 ( grayscale with alpha channel ) , the sBIT chunk contains two bytes , indicating the number of bits that were significant in the source grayscale data and the source alpha data , respectively . For color type 6 ( truecolor with alpha channel ) , the sBIT chunk contains four bytes , indicating the number of bits that were significant in the source data for the red , green , blue and alpha channels , respectively . Each depth specified in sBIT must be greater than zero and less than or equal to the sample depth ( which is 8 for indexed - color images , and the bit depth given in IHDR for other color types ) . A decoder need not pay attention to sBIT : the stored image is a valid PNG file of the sample depth indicated by IHDR . However , if the decoder wishes to recover the original data at its original precision , this can be done by right - shifting the stored samples ( the stored palette entries , for an indexed - color image ) . The encoder must scale the data in such a way that the high - order bits match the original data . If the sBIT chunk appears , it must precede the first IDAT chunk , and it must also precede the PLTE chunk if present . See Recommendations for Encoders : Sample depth scaling and Recommendations for Decoders : Sample depth rescaling . Keyword : 1 - 79 bytes ( character string ) Null separator : 1 byte Text : n bytes ( character string ) The keyword and text string are separated by a zero byte ( null character ) . Neither the keyword nor the text string can contain a null character . Note that the text string is not null-terminated ( the length of the chunk is sufficient information to locate the ending ) . The keyword must be at least one character and less than 80 characters long . The text string can be of any length from zero bytes up to the maximum permissible chunk size less the length of the keyword and separator . Any number of tEXt chunks can appear , and more than one with the same keyword is permissible . The keyword indicates the type of information represented by the text string . The following keywords are predefined and should be used where appropriate : Title Short ( one line ) title or caption for image Author Name of image 's creator Description Description of image ( possibly long ) Copyright Copyright notice Creation Time Time of original image creation Software Software used to create the image Disclaimer Legal disclaimer Warning Warning of nature of content Source Device used to create the image Comment Miscellaneous comment ; conversion from GIF comment For the Creation Time keyword , the date format defined in section 5.2.14 of RFC 1123 is suggested , but not required [ RFC - 1123 ] . Decoders should allow for free - format text associated with this or any other keyword . Other keywords may be invented for other purposes . Keywords of general interest can be registered with the maintainers of the PNG specification . However , it is also permitted to use private unregistered keywords . ( Private keywords should be reasonably self - explanatory , in order to minimize the chance that the same keyword will be used for incompatible purposes by different people . ) Both keyword and text are interpreted according to the ISO 8859 - 1 ( Latin - 1 ) character set [ ISO - 8859 ] . The text string can contain any Latin-1 character . Newlines in the text string should be represented by a single linefeed character ( decimal 10 ) ; use of other control characters in the text is discouraged . Keywords must contain only printable Latin -1 characters and spaces ; that is , only character codes 32 - 126 and 161- 255 decimal are allowed . To reduce the chances for human misreading of a keyword , leading and trailing spaces are forbidden , as are consecutive spaces . Note also that the non-breaking space ( code 160 ) is not permitted in keywords , since it is visually indistinguishable from an ordinary space . Keywords must be spelled exactly as registered , so that decoders can use simple literal comparisons when looking for particular keywords . In particular , keywords are considered case-sensitive . See Recommendations for Encoders : Text chunk processing and Recommendations for Decoders : Text chunk processing . Year : 2 bytes ( complete ; for example , 1995 , not 95 ) Month : 1 byte ( 1 - 12 ) Day : 1 byte ( 1 - 31 ) Hour : 1 byte ( 0 - 23 ) Minute : 1 byte ( 0 - 59 ) Second : 1 byte ( 0 - 60 ) ( yes , 60 , for leap seconds ; not 61 , a common error ) Universal Time ( UTC , also called GMT ) should be specified rather than local time . The tIME chunk is intended for use as an automatically - applied time stamp that is updated whenever the image data is changed . It is recommended that tIME not be changed by PNG editors that do not change the image data . See also the Creation Time tEXt keyword , which can be used for a user-supplied time . For color type 3 ( indexed color ) , the tRNS chunk contains a series of one - byte alpha values , corresponding to entries in the PLTE chunk : Alpha for palette index 0 : 1 byte Alpha for palette index 1 : 1 byte ... etc ... Each entry indicates that pixels of the corresponding palette index must be treated as having the specified alpha value . Alpha values have the same interpretation as in an 8 - bit full alpha channel : 0 is fully transparent , 255 is fully opaque , regardless of image bit depth . The tRNS chunk must not contain more alpha values than there are palette entries , but tRNS can contain fewer values than there are palette entries . In this case , the alpha value for all remaining palette entries is assumed to be 255 . In the common case in which only palette index 0 need be made transparent , only a one - byte tRNS chunk is needed . For color type 0 ( grayscale ) , the tRNS chunk contains a single gray level value , stored in the format : Gray : 2 bytes , range 0 .. ( 2^bitdepth ) - 1 ( For consistency , 2 bytes are used regardless of the image bit depth . ) Pixels of the specified gray level are to be treated as transparent ( equivalent to alpha value 0 ) ; all other pixels are to be treated as fully opaque ( alpha value ( 2^bitdepth ) - 1 ) . For color type 2 ( truecolor ) , the tRNS chunk contains a single RGB color value , stored in the format : Red : 2 bytes , range 0 .. ( 2^bitdepth ) -1 Green : 2 bytes , range 0 .. ( 2^bitdepth ) -1 Blue : 2 bytes , range 0 .. ( 2^bitdepth ) - 1 ( For consistency , 2 bytes per sample are used regardless of the image bit depth . ) Pixels of the specified color value are to be treated as transparent ( equivalent to alpha value 0 ) ; all other pixels are to be treated as fully opaque ( alpha value ( 2^bitdepth ) - 1 ) . tRNS is prohibited for color types 4 and 6 , since a full alpha channel is already present in those cases . Note : when dealing with 16 - bit grayscale or truecolor data , it is important to compare both bytes of the sample values to determine whether a pixel is transparent . Although decoders may drop the low-order byte of the samples for display , this must not occur until after the data has been tested for transparency . For example , if the grayscale level 0x0001 is specified to be transparent , it would be incorrect to compare only the high - order byte and decide that 0x0002 is also transparent . When present , the tRNS chunk must precede the first IDAT chunk , and must follow the PLTE chunk , if any . A zTXt chunk contains : Keyword : 1 - 79 bytes ( character string ) Null separator : 1 byte Compression method : 1 byte Compressed text : n bytes The keyword and null separator are exactly the same as in the tEXt chunk . Note that the keyword is not compressed . The compression method byte identifies the compression method used in this zTXt chunk . The only value presently defined for it is 0 ( deflate / inflate compression ) . The compression method byte is followed by a compressed datastream that makes up the remainder of the chunk . For compression method 0 , this datastream adheres to the zlib datastream format ( see Deflate / Inflate Compression ) . Decompression of this datastream yields Latin - 1 text that is identical to the text that would be stored in an equivalent tEXt chunk . Any number of z TXt and tEXt chunks can appear in the same file . See the preceding definition of the tEXt chunk for the predefined keywords and the recommended format of the text .

As a result , the way we reviewed applications also changed . It was especially important to be flexible this year ; understanding and empathy have been key considerations for us . \u201d Cornell admitted 5,836 students to the Class of 2025 , including early decision admission candidates . The university continues to attract a diverse and inclusive student body . The proportion of admitted students who self- identify as underrepresented minorities increased to 34.2 % from 33.7 % last year , and 59.3 % self- identify as students of color . That number has increased steadily over the past five years , enrollment officials said , from 52.5 % in 2017 and 57.2 % last year . Of those admitted 1,163 will be first-generation college students \u2013 another increase over last year 's 844 , Felton said . Admitted members of the Class of 2025 come from 49 U.S. states ( only Wyoming is not represented ) plus Washington , D.C. ; Puerto Rico ; the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam , as well as 87 countries outside the United States . Based on citizenship , admitted students represent 113 countries . The undergraduate admissions selection process was completed on April 6 , the official notification date for Ivy League schools . \u201c In a process that can be time - consuming and daunting on both sides in any year , pandemic conditions tested everyone , \u201d said Jonathan Burdick , vice provost for enrollment . \u201c I 'm astonished and want to recognize how much our applicants , their counselors and families , and our application readers persisted and even sometimes thrived through the uncertainties . \u201d Financial aid packages in the works Given the challenges many families have experienced in the past year , Burdick stressed that the university 's commitment to providing need - based financial aid is stronger than ever . \u201c Cornell 's bottom line in offering financial aid is that every student has to get what they need , \u201d he said , adding that patience will be key as the university continues to work through the pandemic 's disruptions to finalize aid packages . Cornell will update students on aid status via email , and \u201c if along the way we have to extend deadlines and reconsider information , that will happen , \u201d he said . A second year of virtual recruitment Though campus remains officially closed to visitors and tours because of the pandemic , administrators have planned engagement and interactive online communities , robust outreach and recruitment to connect prospective Cornellians to current students . \u201c We will celebrate , albeit differently , with our newly admitted students throughout April , \u201d Felton said . Admitted students have received a special invitation to join CUontheHill , a virtual engagement hub , where they can chat with and learn from current students , alumni , faculty and staff . Additional online , virtual , social media and texting events are planned , he added , to further connect admitted students to the university . \u201c I think especially during COVID , students are feeling extremely isolated and it can be incredibly hard to make any kind of social connection , \u201d said Crystal Tang ' 21 , a Cornell Engineering student and one of the Big Red Ambassadors \u2013 current students who engage with and connect prospective students with Cornell . \u201c In previous years , we were less reliant on virtual means of connection with incoming students . But as everything has shifted to being virtual , platforms like CUontheHill are becoming increasingly important for incoming students to check that they are truly a good match for Cornell , \u201d she said . Dave Sandoval ' 99 remembers when he made the decision to attend Cornell . \u201c It was one of the most important and best decisions of my life , \u201d said Sandoval , who is a leader for the Cornell Latino Alumni Association and CUontheHill liaison . \u201c And I can also remember the uncertainty , the questions and even the struggles when I first arrived . CUontheHill allows me to tell my story to the next generation of Cornell students \u2013 helping , guiding and inspiring potential incoming students to help make this crucial decision . \u201d Jahnay Bryan ' 23 said : \u201c Being able to interact with Cornell students ultimately led to my final decision to choose Cornell ; I saw myself in the students who greeted me and answered my questions . \u201d The CUontheHill platform is important \u201c as a means to build connections virtually , ask questions and confirm that Cornell is indeed a place for you , [ finding ] many people that remind you of yourself , \u201d she said . In addition to CUontheHill , the Welcome to Cornell website , designed for newly admitted students and their families , includes important information about student and residential life , housing , dining , athletics , financial aid and more .

As a result , the way we reviewed applications also changed . It was especially important to be flexible this year ; understanding and empathy have been key considerations for us . \u201d Cornell admitted 5,836 students to the Class of 2025 , including early decision admission candidates . The university continues to attract a diverse and inclusive student body . The proportion of admitted students who self- identify as underrepresented minorities increased to 34.2 % from 33.7 % last year , and 59.3 % self- identify as students of color . That number has increased steadily over the past five years , enrollment officials said , from 52.5 % in 2017 and 57.2 % last year . Of those admitted 1,163 will be first-generation college students \u2013 another increase over last year 's 844 , Felton said . Admitted members of the Class of 2025 come from 49 U.S. states ( only Wyoming is not represented ) plus Washington , D.C. ; Puerto Rico ; the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam , as well as 87 countries outside the United States . Based on citizenship , admitted students represent 113 countries . The undergraduate admissions selection process was completed on April 6 , the official notification date for Ivy League schools . \u201c In a process that can be time - consuming and daunting on both sides in any year , pandemic conditions tested everyone , \u201d said Jonathan Burdick , vice provost for enrollment . \u201c I 'm astonished and want to recognize how much our applicants , their counselors and families , and our application readers persisted and even sometimes thrived through the uncertainties . \u201d Financial aid packages in the works Given the challenges many families have experienced in the past year , Burdick stressed that the university 's commitment to providing need - based financial aid is stronger than ever . \u201c Cornell 's bottom line in offering financial aid is that every student has to get what they need , \u201d he said , adding that patience will be key as the university continues to work through the pandemic 's disruptions to finalize aid packages . Cornell will update students on aid status via email , and \u201c if along the way we have to extend deadlines and reconsider information , that will happen , \u201d he said . A second year of virtual recruitment Though campus remains officially closed to visitors and tours because of the pandemic , administrators have planned engagement and interactive online communities , robust outreach and recruitment to connect prospective Cornellians to current students . \u201c We will celebrate , albeit differently , with our newly admitted students throughout April , \u201d Felton said . Admitted students have received a special invitation to join CUontheHill , a virtual engagement hub , where they can chat with and learn from current students , alumni , faculty and staff . Additional online , virtual , social media and texting events are planned , he added , to further connect admitted students to the university . \u201c I think especially during COVID , students are feeling extremely isolated and it can be incredibly hard to make any kind of social connection , \u201d said Crystal Tang ' 21 , a Cornell Engineering student and one of the Big Red Ambassadors \u2013 current students who engage with and connect prospective students with Cornell . \u201c In previous years , we were less reliant on virtual means of connection with incoming students . But as everything has shifted to being virtual , platforms like CUontheHill are becoming increasingly important for incoming students to check that they are truly a good match for Cornell , \u201d she said . Dave Sandoval ' 99 remembers when he made the decision to attend Cornell . \u201c It was one of the most important and best decisions of my life , \u201d said Sandoval , who is a leader for the Cornell Latino Alumni Association and CUontheHill liaison . \u201c And I can also remember the uncertainty , the questions and even the struggles when I first arrived . CUontheHill allows me to tell my story to the next generation of Cornell students \u2013 helping , guiding and inspiring potential incoming students to help make this crucial decision . \u201d Jahnay Bryan ' 23 said : \u201c Being able to interact with Cornell students ultimately led to my final decision to choose Cornell ; I saw myself in the students who greeted me and answered my questions . \u201d The CUontheHill platform is important \u201c as a means to build connections virtually , ask questions and confirm that Cornell is indeed a place for you , [ finding ] many people that remind you of yourself , \u201d she said . In addition to CUontheHill , the Welcome to Cornell website , designed for newly admitted students and their families , includes important information about student and residential life , housing , dining , athletics , financial aid and more .

In Washington , House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Sander Levin called Japan 's currency intervention a \" deeply disturbing development \" and promised that Congress would be following the issue closely . Levin is a Democrat from Michigan , home to U.S. automakers . He made his comments during a hearing on China 's currency practices , which American manufacturers contend have cost millions of lost U.S. manufacturing jobs . \" China is not the only country with a predatory exchange rate policy , \" Levin said . The U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment on Japan 's currency move . The Japanese government now has a \" sense of crisis \" about the yen , said Tomoko Fujii , a senior currency strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch . Officials fear \" further yen appreciation would undermine the Japanese economy , \" she said . Earlier in the week , Hitachi Ltd. president Hiroaki Nakanishi urged the government to tackle the strong yen , calling it a \" big pressure \" while trying to transform one of Japan 's biggest companies into a nimbler operation . The yen 's rise has also underscored tensions with China . Some officials including the finance minister say China 's purchases of Japanese government bonds might be helping to drive the yen higher even as Beijing keeps its currency tightly controlled to protect the country 's exporters . The yuan has risen less than 1 percent against the dollar since mid-June when Beijing said it would allow it to trade more freely after keeping it virtually unchanged for 18 months . After the Bank of Japan sold yen on Wednesday morning , the dollar jumped above 85 yen from its earlier low of 82.87 yen . It was the first currency intervention since March 2004 . Stock investors cheered the move , sending the Nikkei 225 stock average up by 217.25 points , or 2.3 percent , to close at 9,516.56 . \" We have conducted an intervention in order to suppress excessive fluctuations in the currency market , \" said Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda . \" We will closely monitor currency developments , and take firm action including intervention , \" Noda said . But there was widespread skepticism that Tokyo can keep the yen on a tight leash without coordinated action by major central banks around the world . That suggests the stock market 's advance could prove fleeting and that U.S. manufacturers are likely to continue benefiting from a weak dollar . \" The effect from Japan 's solo intervention wo n't last very long . We have to see how the U.S. and European monetary authorities would react , \" said Yuji Kameoka , chief forex strategist at Daiwa Institute . Japanese electronics giant Sony Corp. weighed in with a cautious statement , saying that companies could only do so much on their own . \" While we welcome the latest currency intervention by the government and Bank of Japan ... we hope they will continue to closely monitor foreign exchange trends and take appropriate measures , \" it said . Fujii , the Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategist , forecasts that the dollar will by year - end break under the all - time low of 79.75 yen hit in 1995 . The dollar 's woes stem in part from market speculation that the Federal Reserve may restart buying Treasurys and other assets this year to try to bolster the U.S. economy . That would likely drive U.S. interest rates even lower , which would make some investments bought in dollars less appealing for investors . \" This could be a very tough time for Japanese authorities if the Fed really implements a massive quantitative easing , \" Fujii said . The yen , meanwhile , is seen as a safe haven currency . Japan 's government debt is largely owned by domestic investors , making the country less at risk to the capital flight that can occur when economic or political shocks cause confidence to collapse . And even with interest rates near zero , Japan 's real interest rate is higher because of persistent deflation . For foreigners , that means yen -denominated assets will look more attractive as prices keep falling . China 's acceleration of Japanese bond purchases \u2014 a strategy of diversifying its holdings of foreign assets which are currently concentrated in U.S. Treasurys \u2014 has also been blamed for contributing to the yen 's rise . But the purchases as a proportion of all Japanese bonds on issue are likely too small to have a sustained effect on the yen . Playing to a domestic audience , Finance Minister Noda told a parliamentary finance committee last Thursday that finance officials are monitoring Beijing 's moves closely . \" We are watching the development while closely coordinating with other financial authorities to find out what their intentions are , \" he said . Japan 's previous attempts to slow the yen 's rise through intervention had little lasting effect . Between January 2003 and January 2004 , Japan sold a total of about 35 trillion yen in a massive effort to fight deflation and slow the appreciation of its currency . One reason that intervention is likely to be even less potent nowadays is that the global volume of the foreign exchange trading has grown rapidly in recent years . Since 2007 , average daily turnover has risen 20 percent to $ 4 trillion , according to the Bank for International Settlements . That means intervention by a single government ends up being akin to a drop in the ocean . More recently , Switzerland 's central bank abandoned its efforts to soften the Swiss franc , which had risen rapidly in the wake of financial crisis . Some analysts say the finance ministry 's currency intervention may be more potent if the central bank follows with a policy change of its own .

But recently , I 've realized the problem was where it began , not where it ends . The real reason the New millennium could n't start till 2001 was that the 90s did n't start till Nirvana released Nevermind in ' 91 . If you shift the beginning of one decade , the next decade ( and hence the next century and millennium ) has to shift as well . Grunge has finally freed me from my grudge . G.W.F. Hegel Will Have His Revenge \u201c But surely \u201d you object , \u201c Nevermind was n't that big of a deal . \u201d \u201c Au contraire ! \u201d I respond . \u201c When people saw the ' Smells Like Teen Spirit ' video , they realized the tyranny of spandex and neon tank tops was over . When they heard Dave Grohl play drums , they realized choruses can actually rock if you eschew the cowbell for the crash cymbal . When they heard Krist Novoselic play bass , they realized songs were better when bassists played more than one note . And when they heard Kurt Cobain play an entire guitar solo that was just the melody of the verses all over again , they realized they did n't have to be Jimi Hendrix in order to play guitar . You do n't have to be a virtuoso to write a good riff , invent a good melody , and make good music . Grunge democratized rock like nothing had done since the folk movement of the 60s . \u201d \u201c But what about punk in the 70s ? \u201d you ask , because you know your music history . \u201c Was n't that an anti-virtuoso , power - to - the - people kind of thing ? \u201d \u201c Okay , yeah , \u201d I admit . \u201c First there was 60s folk , then 70s punk , then 90s grunge . Whenever pop music starts to get too fancy , there 's a swing back toward simplicity . There 's a return to its roots . Every virtuoso phase is followed by a folk rebellion . \u201d \u201c Ah , so the history of music is a Hegelian dialectic , \u201d you offer . \u201c The virtuoso phase is like Hegel 's ' thesis ' , and the folk rebellion is like Hegel 's ' antithesis ' . \u201d \u201c True , true , \u201d I admit , \u201c the folk revivals see themselves as opposed to the fancy , artsy , virtuosic music of the time . But then even the folk artists start to get fancy , developing more and more technically - complex songs . Just think of how the Beatles changed over time . Or remember Green Day 's attempt at a concept album . \u201d \u201c Well , then you have Hegel 's ' synthesis ' ! \u201d you exclaim in triumph . \u201c Pop music has all three phases ! There 's the original style ( thesis ) , then its opposite ( antithesis ) , and then their union ( synthesis ) into a new and higher style . \u201d Shoulda Been a Nietzschean \u201c That would surely be nifty , \u201d I respond with the merest hint of disappointment . \u201c But I think it 's just a cycle back and forth between virtuoso and folk . Between technical and organic . Between elitist and populist . I do n't think there 's any progress happening . We 're not headed toward some ultimate goal , like Hegel thought . \u201d \u201c We 're just spinning our wheels , then ? \u201d you ask . \u201c Well , yeah . But they 're some mighty fine wheels . \u201d \u201c So , you 're not a Hegelian , \u201d you say . \u201c You 're a Nietzschean . You believe in the Eternal Return of the Same . History just repeats itself , over and over , forever . \u201d \u201c You have a problem with Nietzsche ? \u201d \u201c Nietzsche is great for angsty teens , like the brother in Little Miss Sunshine . But you have to eventually grow up . \u201d \u201c So , you think people grow out of folk-oriented styles of music ? You never heard of Pete Seeger ? \u201d I retort . \u201c Well , look , \u201d you respond , \u201c it 's just a fact that Nietzsche \u2014 and the existentialists after him \u2014 are primarily attractive to people in their teens . And in the 90s , it was the teens who got into grunge . \u201d \u201c Ummmm . . . . \u201d \u201c And it 's just a fact , \u201d you continue , \u201c that grunge , like all folk genres , is simplistic . It 's the kind of thing a kid can learn to play . Four chords , no solo , and you 're done . But you should n't stop growing in your teens . You should keep developing your skills . You have to mature . \u201d Back to the Big Cheese Himself This , of course , gives me pause . \u201c So , you 're saying that being a virtuoso is virtuous . \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d you say , \u201c I 'm an Aristotelian . \u201d ( Congratulations ! You 're an Aristotelian now . ) \u201c I think everything has an essence . Everything belongs to a definite type or kind . And everything should work to become as excellent and mature as it can be , given the kind of thing it is . \u201d \u201c Ah , but you see , \u201d I say with glee in my beady little eyes , \u201c I think the more complex and artsy pop music gets , the more it moves away from being ' song ' . ' Song ' comes from ' sing ' \u201d \u2014 a fact I just totally made up ( but which seems to be supported by the ultimate etymology of the word ) . \u201c So , if you ca n't sing it , it is n't a song . And the more difficult it is to sing without accompaniment , or without pausing for long guitar solos , the worse of a song it is . \u201d \u201c So , you think prog rock and thrash metal songs are n't songs ? \u201d you ask . \u201c Or maybe they 're songs we 've caught in the middle of morphing into something else . Songs are n't the only kind of music , you know . \u201d \u201c I think you 're letting your theory get in the way of seeing what 's obvious . \u201d \u201c Or maybe I 'm a visionary who 's ahead of his time , \u201d I say , defensively . \u201c Could you go from door to door , caroling Megadeth a cappella ? \u201d \u201c Ummmmm . . . . \u201d \u201c I thought not , \u201d I cry in triumph . \u201c The great thing about Nevermind is the melodies . Both Spin and Rolling Stone called the songs ' hummable ' , and that evaluation remains current . \u201d \u201c But metal songs can be singable too . What about ' We 're Not Gonna Take It ' , by Twisted Sister ? \u201d \u201c That 's a punk song . They can dress themselves up all they want , but it does n't make the song not punk . \u201d \u201c And punk is just another folk genre , like grunge , \u201d you offer . \u201c Exactly . \u201d Coda : You Know You 're Right \u201c Well , okay . But I still think I could poke a whole ton of holes in your theory if I was n't late for work at the Fortune 500 company I own , \u201d you say , wearing your very , very expensive suit . \u201c No doubt . And maybe I need to grow up , delete my Nirvana albums , throw out my Nietzsche , Sartre , and Camus books , and take guitar lessons so I can learn to solo . But I still think Bob Dylan was right when he said , ' Folk music is the greatest music , and grunge is the greatest folk ' . \u201d You pause for a moment , trying to decide if I 'm serious . \u201c You just made that up , \u201d you finally conclude . \u201c Maybe , \u201d I say . \u201c I would say more , but I 'm late for work at my apartment , where I have a whole stack of papers to grade . So , I guess you 'll just never know . \u201d \u201c I know how to use a search engine , \u201d you reply . \u201c I can find out if Bob Dylan really said that . \u201d \u201c Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence , \u201d I say cryptically , and walk away whistling a mixture of \u201c Blowin ' in the Wind \u201d and \u201c Come As You Are . \u201d Micah Tillman teaches at McDaniel College and University of Maryland , College Park .

Or remember Green Day 's attempt at a concept album . \u201d \u201c Well , then you have Hegel 's ' synthesis ' ! \u201d you exclaim in triumph . \u201c Pop music has all three phases ! There 's the original style ( thesis ) , then its opposite ( antithesis ) , and then their union ( synthesis ) into a new and higher style . \u201d Shoulda Been a Nietzschean \u201c That would surely be nifty , \u201d I respond with the merest hint of disappointment . \u201c But I think it 's just a cycle back and forth between virtuoso and folk . Between technical and organic . Between elitist and populist . I do n't think there 's any progress happening . We 're not headed toward some ultimate goal , like Hegel thought . \u201d \u201c We 're just spinning our wheels , then ? \u201d you ask . \u201c Well , yeah . But they 're some mighty fine wheels . \u201d \u201c So , you 're not a Hegelian , \u201d you say . \u201c You 're a Nietzschean . You believe in the Eternal Return of the Same . History just repeats itself , over and over , forever . \u201d \u201c You have a problem with Nietzsche ? \u201d \u201c Nietzsche is great for angsty teens , like the brother in Little Miss Sunshine . But you have to eventually grow up . \u201d \u201c So , you think people grow out of folk-oriented styles of music ? You never heard of Pete Seeger ? \u201d I retort . \u201c Well , look , \u201d you respond , \u201c it 's just a fact that Nietzsche \u2014 and the existentialists after him \u2014 are primarily attractive to people in their teens . And in the 90s , it was the teens who got into grunge . \u201d \u201c Ummmm . . . . \u201d \u201c And it 's just a fact , \u201d you continue , \u201c that grunge , like all folk genres , is simplistic . It 's the kind of thing a kid can learn to play . Four chords , no solo , and you 're done . But you should n't stop growing in your teens . You should keep developing your skills . You have to mature . \u201d Back to the Big Cheese Himself This , of course , gives me pause . \u201c So , you 're saying that being a virtuoso is virtuous . \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d you say , \u201c I 'm an Aristotelian . \u201d ( Congratulations ! You 're an Aristotelian now . ) \u201c I think everything has an essence . Everything belongs to a definite type or kind . And everything should work to become as excellent and mature as it can be , given the kind of thing it is . \u201d \u201c Ah , but you see , \u201d I say with glee in my beady little eyes , \u201c I think the more complex and artsy pop music gets , the more it moves away from being ' song ' . ' Song ' comes from ' sing ' \u201d \u2014 a fact I just totally made up ( but which seems to be supported by the ultimate etymology of the word ) . \u201c So , if you ca n't sing it , it is n't a song . And the more difficult it is to sing without accompaniment , or without pausing for long guitar solos , the worse of a song it is . \u201d \u201c So , you think prog rock and thrash metal songs are n't songs ? \u201d you ask . \u201c Or maybe they 're songs we 've caught in the middle of morphing into something else . Songs are n't the only kind of music , you know . \u201d \u201c I think you 're letting your theory get in the way of seeing what 's obvious . \u201d \u201c Or maybe I 'm a visionary who 's ahead of his time , \u201d I say , defensively . \u201c Could you go from door to door , caroling Megadeth a cappella ? \u201d \u201c Ummmmm . . . . \u201d \u201c I thought not , \u201d I cry in triumph . \u201c The great thing about Nevermind is the melodies . Both Spin and Rolling Stone called the songs ' hummable ' , and that evaluation remains current . \u201d \u201c But metal songs can be singable too . What about ' We 're Not Gonna Take It ' , by Twisted Sister ? \u201d \u201c That 's a punk song . They can dress themselves up all they want , but it does n't make the song not punk . \u201d \u201c And punk is just another folk genre , like grunge , \u201d you offer . \u201c Exactly . \u201d Coda : You Know You 're Right \u201c Well , okay . But I still think I could poke a whole ton of holes in your theory if I was n't late for work at the Fortune 500 company I own , \u201d you say , wearing your very , very expensive suit . \u201c No doubt . And maybe I need to grow up , delete my Nirvana albums , throw out my Nietzsche , Sartre , and Camus books , and take guitar lessons so I can learn to solo . But I still think Bob Dylan was right when he said , ' Folk music is the greatest music , and grunge is the greatest folk ' . \u201d You pause for a moment , trying to decide if I 'm serious . \u201c You just made that up , \u201d you finally conclude . \u201c Maybe , \u201d I say . \u201c I would say more , but I 'm late for work at my apartment , where I have a whole stack of papers to grade . So , I guess you 'll just never know . \u201d \u201c I know how to use a search engine , \u201d you reply . \u201c I can find out if Bob Dylan really said that . \u201d \u201c Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence , \u201d I say cryptically , and walk away whistling a mixture of \u201c Blowin ' in the Wind \u201d and \u201c Come As You Are . \u201d Micah Tillman teaches at McDaniel College and University of Maryland , College Park .

Chaput will succeed Cardinal Justin Rigali as archbishop of Philadelphia . Pope Benedict XVI accepted Cardinal Rigali 's resignation and named the Denver archbishop as his successor July 19 . In introducing Archbishop Chaput in a news conference at the Archdiocese of Philadelphia offices , Cardinal Rigali also offered an apology \" if I have offended \" and \" for any weaknesses on my part , \" but said he saw no particular connection between the timing of the Vatican accepting his resignation and turbulence in the archdiocese over a February grand jury report on how sex abuse cases were handled . In addition to the announcement about Philadelphia , the pope also accepted the resignation of Bishop J. Kevin Boland of Savannah , Ga. , and appointed as his replacement Father Gregory Hartmayer , a Conventual Franciscan priest who currently is pastor of St. John Vianney Parish in Lithia Springs , Ga . The bishop-designate also was introduced at news conference sponsored by the diocese that morning in Savannah . The changes in Philadelphia and Savannah were first announced in Washington by Msgr. Jean-Francois Lantheaume , charge d'affaires at the apostolic nunciature in Washington , along with another diocese 's pastoral transition . Archbishop Chaput is scheduled to be installed as Philadelphia 's new archbishop Sept. 8 at the Cathedral Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul . Bishop-designate Hartmayer will be ordained as bishop Oct. 18 in Savannah 's Cathedral of St. John the Baptist . Both retiring prelates are 76 , a year past the age at which they are required by canon law to submit their resignations to the Vatican . Philadelphia news organizations had been speculating that Cardinal Rigali 's resignation was related to public criticism of how the archdiocese has handled clergy sex abuse cases , but he had submitted his resignation when he turned 75 on April 19 , 2010 , as required under canon law . In the news conference , Cardinal Rigali explained the timeline of his resignation , saying there was \" no particular relationship \" between the pope accepting his retirement and events in the archdiocese , saying it was \" very , very providential . \" A native of Los Angeles who was ordained for the Los Angeles Archdiocese in 1961 , Cardinal Rigali has headed the Archdiocese of Philadelphia since 2003 . He previously served as archbishop of St. Louis after a long career in various Vatican posts , most in diplomatic positions . He was named a cardinal in 2003 . The cardinal 's successor , Archbishop Chaput , is a Capuchin Franciscan who was born in Concordia , Kan. , Sept. 26 , 1944 . A member of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Tribe , he was the first Native American to be named an archbishop when he was appointed to Denver in 1997 . He had become the second Native American to be made a bishop when he was named to the Diocese of Rapid City , S.D. , in 1988 . In the Philadelphia news conference , Archbishop Chaput said he has two Indian names , one from the Potawatomi meaning \" he who makes the leaves rustle like the wind \" and the other from the Lakota , meaning \" good eagle . \" Before becoming a bishop , he held several positions in administration for the Capuchins . Archbishop Chaput holds a bachelor 's degree in philosophy from St. Fidelis College in Herman , Pa. , a master 's degree in religious education from Capuchin College in Washington , and a master 's in theology from the University of San Francisco . Among his recent writings are two books , \" Render Unto Caesar , \" about Catholic participation in the public square , and \" Living the Catholic Faith : Rediscovering the Basics . \" He has served on the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom , a federal advisory organization . Among his recent projects and activities were helping found the Catholic Association of Latino Leaders and serving as the apostolic visitor in 2007 for the Vatican 's review of former Australian Bishop William Morris . The bishop of Toowoomba was the subject of lengthy efforts to force his resignation after a decade of conflict with the Vatican , largely over some pastoral practices and Bishop Morris 's statements on married priests and women priests . Archbishop Chaput 's appointment to Philadelphia comes as the archdiocese is still reeling from a scathing grand jury report released in February . It accused the Philadelphia Archdiocese of failing to stop priests from sexually abusing children even after a previous report had called attention to problems . It said more than three dozen priests with allegations of sexual abuse were still in positions where they could contact children . At the grand jury 's recommendation , two priests , a layman and a former archdiocesan priest were charged with criminal counts related to abuse of juveniles . Another priest was charged with endangering child welfare for his role in assigning the accused priests . In response , the Philadelphia Archdiocese among other things has hired a former sex crimes prosecutor to review personnel files of the 37 priests named in the grand jury 's report . Cardinal Rigali also placed 21 priests on administrative leave while allegations against them are reviewed . In his remarks before introducing Archbishop Chaput , the cardinal did not refer directly to the sex abuse situation , but said \" if I have offended anyone , I am sorry \" and apologized \" for any weaknesses on my part . \" Later , in response to questions from the press about whether he had any regrets , he said \" we 've learned so much we did n't know before , \" and that \" we see now with greater precision \" what might have been done differently . He added that the archdiocese is \" very , very committed to assistance for victims . \" For his part , Archbishop Chaput said his transition to leading the Philadelphia Archdiocese was a little like joining a family and that it would take some time to become familiar and adjust to each other . \" I do not know why the Holy Father sent me here , \" he said . \" No bishop will try harder to help persons who have been hurt by the sins of the past or work harder to strengthen or encourage our priests and to win the hearts of the people . \" He said he needed to read the grand jury reports and spend a lot of time talking to people , including abuse victims and their families , before he could talk about how to fix the problems of the abuse cases . \" It 's not my problem , it 's our problem ... give me some time , \" he said . In Georgia , retiring Bishop Boland is a native of County Cork , Ireland , who studied for the priesthood in Dublin and came to the United States to be ordained for the Savannah Diocese in 1959 .

Many Asian Americans have had this experience , including many of our own journalist -members . \" Astudillo reminds us there are thousands of Asian - American readers \" who constantly bear the insult and hurt caused by even the slightest suggestion or implication that they are less American than their fellow Americans . \" It 's a message we wo n't forget .

On November 27th ( and running until the 31st of March 2019 ) the Jordanian National Gallery of Fine Arts opened its retrospective exhibition on Durra 's career , featuring works from 1948 to the present day . artmejo was present on the opening night to be the first to experience the new retrospective and was given exclusive access to the artist himself , interviewing him at his home . Paintings decorate the insides of the Durra residence ( images by artmejo team ) Walking down Durra 's unassuming street , it is immediately apparent whose house belongs to the artist . In a mass of green trees , the bright red fencing surrounding his garden makes it clear that this is someone who values colour and vibrancy . Inside , we were greeted by a whiff of oil paint coming from recent worksgracing the walls , ones yet to be seen by the outside world , while all other spare wall space is dedicated to filled bookshelves . Hours could be spent browsing the array of artefacts on display , were it not for the arrival of Durra himself . Emerging directly from his studio and proffering a welcoming hand stained with fresh paint , we were received like old friends . Over some tea and biscuits , we spent 2 hours with the artist . Throughout , all manner of subjects were broached , from nostalgic childhood memories to the ubiquity of art in everyone 's daily life . As the surroundings suggest , Durra is a man obsessed by painting , and the pride he feels when talking about the Jordanian National Gallery of Fine Art 's new retrospective is palpable . In talking about the exhibition , Durra gave us never - before heard insights into his paintings ' provenances , which we have shared with you in this review . Mohanna Durra , Abstraction , Oil on Canvas , 151\u00d7301 cm , 2016 The all - encompassing exhibition of the artist 's long and illustrious career sees the works divided over four floors , separated into ' Figures ' on the ground floor , ' Clowns ' , ' Portraits ' and ' Drawings ' on the first , ' Abstraction ' and ' Landscapes ' on the second and ' Abstraction ' on the third floor . With 194 paintings taken from private collections , the museum 's permanent collection and Durra 's personal collection , the exhibition brings together a comprehensive assemblage of a lifetime of work as will most likely never be seen again . Durra himself expressed his joy at being reunited with lost works , saying \u201c I was delighted to see many of my old paintings again . \u201d Mohanna Durra , Cowboy and Windmill , Oil on Canvas , 23\u00d732.5 cm , 1948 Rather than show Durra 's work in chronological order , as one might expect from a retrospective , the curatorial team at the Jordanian National Gallery of Fine Arts ( JNGFA ) have opted for division by subject matter , thus resulting in each section featuring works from Durra 's earliest years to 2018 . This unconventional decision is instantly justified by even the most cursory of visits . While Durra has experimented with many artistic styles and subject matters throughout his career he is by no means a linear artist , and one repeatedly witnesses a reversion to specific colour palettes and styles at different stages of Durra 's artistic journey . For this reason , the most reliable constant for Durra 's opus is indeed subject matter over execution , and it is this division that enables us to best understand Durra 's work . As he explains : My work depends on my mood . Style is not a political party ; it is not a dogma . Style is how you feel one morning . One morning you may feel like you want make an abstract painting , and it 's important to be honest with what you 're doing , to be spontaneous . Mohanna Durra , Untitled , Oil on Wood , 81\u00d7119 cm , 1967 Mohanna Durra , Three Faces , Oil on Wood , 47\u00d753.5 cm , 1959 This being said , the JNGFA has respected major thematic events in Durra 's career . While a European trained artist , Durra remains Jordanian by nature , and his depiction of the Bedouin and local Jordanian were key subjects in his early years ( and they continue to be addressed to this day ) . It is thus fitting that some of the first works we see upon entering the exhibition are portraits of Jordanians in traditional scenes ( such as Untitled , 1966 ) executed in a realist style ( albeit with a hint of abstraction in his liberated brush strokes ) , highlighting before all else that Durra is a Jordanian artist . And yet , these naturalist portraits are adjacent to abstract works such as ' 3 Faces ' ( 1959 ) and ' Dance and Movement ' ( 1971 ) ( seen later below ) whose brushstrokes are wild and loose , rejecting the naturalistic tendencies of their neighbours , despite sometimes occurring earlier in his career . In the first room in the exhibition , therefore , we are introduced to Durra 's wide ranging stylistic abilities . Nestled between these works a small , simple scene of a Dervish can be spotted , innocent in its subject matter and execution . Dated to 1948 , it is one of two works in the exhibition dating from when Durra was just 10 years old , and serves as a gentle reminder of the natural gift that Durra possesses . Whatever we see from this moment on , it seems to tell us , remember the talent that is required to create effective , expressive abstraction . Mohanna Durra , Circassian Dance , China Ink on Paper , 49\u00d763 , 1982 The insistence on classical training in the fine arts before embarking on the journey of abstraction is something Durra feels strongly about . He says \u201c I believe you have to be able to know how to draw [ before you can attempt to be abstract ] , you have to be able to know the form and the shape in order to develop it or destroy it . \u201d On the first floor , therefore , the viewer is introduced to Durra 's drawings , portraits and clowns . The effortless confidence in the free - flowing lines renders Durra 's sketches breath-taking , with their economy of line reminiscent of Matisse and Schiele 's sketches , while the knowledge of their existence aids the viewer in understanding the traditional artistic skill necessary to successfully execute an abstract work ( eg. ' Circassian Dance ' , 1982 ) . Mohanna Durra , My First Teacher George Aleef , Acrylic on Canvas , 75\u00d750 cm , 1960 Among the portraits , the viewer is drawn towards a depiction of George Aleef , Durra 's first teacher while still a child in Jordan . Durra shared the story behind this portrait with artmejo : When I returned home from Rome , George Aleef , who was my teacher before my departure and who had taught me the scholastic method , the classic lessons about art , he was afraid that I had become so modern in throwing colours on the canvas that he came to my studio and he was almost angry ! But then he sat on a chair and I painted him while he was talking , and after he saw [ the portrait I had done of him ] he forgave me and pardoned me and he said to me \u201c in spite of the fact that you betrayed my teaching , you still have something , a gift . \u201d Mohanna Durra , Self Portrait , Oil on Wood , 56\u00d745 cm , undated Also on this floor , we are introduced to one of Durra 's favourite subject matters : Faces and Clowns . For Durra , his \u201c fascination with portraits results from the powerful impact of the different facial expressions and the story told by each face . \u201d Durra has the rare of skill of being able to express the personality of his sitter while simultaneously transmitting his own artistic character through the canvas . He claims that \u201c for me , the resemblance is not important . Rather it is what she conveys to me , it is the feeling that is important . Everybody emanates some sort of energy , and it is my job to capture that . \u201d By employing looser brush strokes than used on conventional portraits and forgoing a detailed background in a favour of block colour , Durra focuses the viewer 's attention entirely on the face and breaks the barrier between sitter and spectator , thus creating a portrait that is informal , intimate and warm . Mohanna Durra , Clown , Oil on Canvas , 57\u00d743 cm , 2004 and Mohanna Durra , Clown , Oil on Paper , 51\u00d740 cm , 1982 While the portrait is important for Durra , the recurring subject matter of clowns suggests that his fascination is primarily with the face itself and in the unlocking of its secrets . While externally exhibiting the attributes of happiness , for Durra a clown can \u201c hide behind [ his ] mask ; putting a smile on other people 's faces in spite of his sadness . \u201d The works featuring Clowns in Durra 's work date from 1982 - 2010 , once again showing Durra 's long - enduring fascination in recurring subject matters . However , it was in fact as early as 1952 , when Durra was only 14 years old , that the fascination manifested itself . When I was a boy , I went to a movie ( The Greatest Show on Earth ) featuring James Stewart and in this movie he played a nice , very human character who was accused of something and had to run away and hide , thus joining the circus as a clown . He was filled with sadness , and yet he was making people laugh . I was struck by someone so , so sad still making people laugh . I was so impressed by this story that it keeps on coming back to me . Mohanna Durra , Clown , Mixed Media on Paper , 14\u00d79 cm , 2002 and Clown section at JNGFA with Clown ( 2002 ) seen on the far left end It is with this Clowns series that we are best able to observe the wide range of media used by Durra , ranging from charcoal on paper to watercolour on paper to oil on canvas . Durra is not limited in his artistic talents . It is at this point worth noting that an exhibition can only be so good as its curation . JNGFA has found a perfect balance between spacious viewing opportunities and the occasional , intimate space where one can interact with the work on a personal level . Miniature canvases ( such as ' Clown ' , 2002 ) placed in a broader context of larger works serve as a reminder to the viewer to approach the canvas and interact with the painting , encouraging dialogue between the individual and the art . Mohanna Durra , Abstraction , Acrylic on Canvas , 102\u00d7151 cm , 2012 Having been introduced to Durra 's more traditional subject matters and styles , the exhibition next introduces us to Durra 's more famous larger - scale abstract works . Throughout the exhibition the viewer is given hints of the textural experimentation that occurs in Durra 's works in the latter half of his career , however it is not until Floor 2 that this is shown explicitly . This writer is tempted to coin Durra 's larger abstract works ' The Sheet Series ' , so explicit is his application of texture in his works . Layering canvas on top of the base canvas layer , Durra creates an almost topographical aspect in his works with creases emerging from the canvasses surface , reminiscent of a crumpled bed sheet . While the shades of blue that are constantly recurring in Durra 's palette of choice feature in his Abstract scenes , there is also the introduction of an emphasis on red and orange . By placing a primarily blue canvas ' Abstraction ' ( 2016 ) opposite its counterpoint ' Abstraction ' ( 2012 ) , whose palette is entirely in shades of red , the exhibition succeeds once again in highlighting for the viewer the variety and progression in Durra 's paintings . Throughout our conversation with Durra at his home , he repeatedly referenced artists , psychological theories , literature and music . Here is an artist , indeed , but more than that he is an intellectual . When describing his process for creating abstraction , Durra explains that : I do n't draw [ or use underdrawings ] , I just use the brush , a thick brush at that , because a thick brush will not give details , and through these clouds of whatever colour I throw on the canvas , one can see things . You know , it 's like the Rorschach Test \u2026 we may all see movement in a stroke , but how we interpret that movement , it 's different for all of us . It 's important that you [ the artist ] give the interpretation of movement as you yourself feel it / want . Mohanna Durra , Composition 2 , Oil on Canvas , 74\u00d796.5 cm , 1977 Painting is an art form , but it should not be limited to itself . Durra fondly recalls the Arabic proverb that says that \u201c ' the Arts , when they develop and become refined , meet . \u201d \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u062a\u0642\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646\u0648\u0646 , \u062a\u0644\u062a\u0642 \u064a \u201d Poetry meets music , and music meets art . So \u201d explains Durra \u201c when you paint you think about these tonalities \u2026 you have to listen to what you are doing . It may take a while until you feel comfortable with what you 've done but it is necessary . \u201d Mohanna Durra , Dance and Movement , Oil on Canvas , 58\u00d745 cm , 1971 The coalescing of music and art is something that Durra , a classical music enthusiast , is passionate about . Whenever he paints , music plays . It was during his 10 years spent in Moscow , where he lived while working as a member of the Jordanian Foreign Office , that the works of Stravinsky , Rachmaninoff and Wagner caught his attention . In our private audience , artmejo was shown the painter 's sketches of conductors created while watching live orchestras playing at venues such as the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall . They reveal an intimate insight into the painter 's attempts to convey musical direction , be it piano or fortissimo , via pen strokeand highlight his recurrent interest in the dialogue between motion and drawing , as can be seen in the \u201c Line and Movement \u201d sketches on the first floor . Mohanna Durra , Silver Abstraction , Oil on Canvas , 101\u00d7181 , 2018 On the final floor , Durra 's largest and most ' modern ' abstract works are displayed . In later works from the 1990s and 2000s Durra appears to leave behind the mixing of paints before application , instead favouring the application of block colours directly from the tube . While by no means pop-art , the resulting canvases most certainly pop , expressing a vibrancy and strength different from any of his earlier abstract works . The confidence in line conveys the genius of the painter . Durra struggled with the confines of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma as a young student . While he sought to express himself with abstraction , his professors sought to mould him into a conventional artist . Durra told us that : We tend to think that in order to distort a form or to develop a certain form you have to know it first . The trouble with people who have a solid academic background is that they become prisoners of the Academy , let 's call this ' Academism ' . The artist himself should take a certain proportion of what he learns but not be governed by it Mohanna Durra , Abstraction , Oil on Paper , 49\u00d774 cm , undated In this final floor it is made that clear that Durra has succeeded in his mission to respect his traditional artistic education while not being governed by it . These works , as with all those in the exhibition , are unique in their execution and capture the energy of the artist , an energy that emanates from every canvas we lay our eyes on . Durra estate door , and the artist in conversation ( images by artmejo team ) As our interview with Durra came to its conclusion artmejo was invited into the artist 's studio , a most intimate of sanctuaries . While ironically devoid of paintings ( many of the paintings you see at the exhibition have come directly from the artist 's house ) , the space retained its charismatic aura . Perched on the easel , a half - completed canvas rested . While unfinished , the work hinted at the direction in which Durra 's art is headed , revealing muted pastels and pared down tones . As we made our exit from Durra 's house , a final surprise awaited us . While Durra was recovering from cancer , he told us , he was unable to descend to his studio to paint and as such resorted to new , unconventional surfaces on which to express his emotions . This is how the unassuming front door , appearing as a simple blue from the exterior of the house , came to be covered in an unmistakable Durra Abstraction of soft pinks on its interior . Despite having had a career spanning over 70 years , Durra is still continuing to surprise and develop . A veritable Great .","annotations":[{"text":"Mohanna Durra","span":[0,12],"token_span":[0,1],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The animate protagonist who causes the Fluid to move."},{"text":"colours","span":[6845,6851],"token_span":[1285,1285],"role":"Fluid","label":"Fluid","role_definition":"The entity that changes location and moves in a fluidic way.

On November 27th ( and running until the 31st of March 2019 ) the Jordanian National Gallery of Fine Arts opened its retrospective exhibition on Durra 's career , featuring works from 1948 to the present day . artmejo was present on the opening night to be the first to experience the new retrospective and was given exclusive access to the artist himself , interviewing him at his home . Paintings decorate the insides of the Durra residence ( images by artmejo team ) Walking down Durra 's unassuming street , it is immediately apparent whose house belongs to the artist . In a mass of green trees , the bright red fencing surrounding his garden makes it clear that this is someone who values colour and vibrancy . Inside , we were greeted by a whiff of oil paint coming from recent worksgracing the walls , ones yet to be seen by the outside world , while all other spare wall space is dedicated to filled bookshelves . Hours could be spent browsing the array of artefacts on display , were it not for the arrival of Durra himself . Emerging directly from his studio and proffering a welcoming hand stained with fresh paint , we were received like old friends . Over some tea and biscuits , we spent 2 hours with the artist . Throughout , all manner of subjects were broached , from nostalgic childhood memories to the ubiquity of art in everyone 's daily life . As the surroundings suggest , Durra is a man obsessed by painting , and the pride he feels when talking about the Jordanian National Gallery of Fine Art 's new retrospective is palpable . In talking about the exhibition , Durra gave us never - before heard insights into his paintings ' provenances , which we have shared with you in this review . Mohanna Durra , Abstraction , Oil on Canvas , 151\u00d7301 cm , 2016 The all - encompassing exhibition of the artist 's long and illustrious career sees the works divided over four floors , separated into ' Figures ' on the ground floor , ' Clowns ' , ' Portraits ' and ' Drawings ' on the first , ' Abstraction ' and ' Landscapes ' on the second and ' Abstraction ' on the third floor . With 194 paintings taken from private collections , the museum 's permanent collection and Durra 's personal collection , the exhibition brings together a comprehensive assemblage of a lifetime of work as will most likely never be seen again . Durra himself expressed his joy at being reunited with lost works , saying \u201c I was delighted to see many of my old paintings again . \u201d Mohanna Durra , Cowboy and Windmill , Oil on Canvas , 23\u00d732.5 cm , 1948 Rather than show Durra 's work in chronological order , as one might expect from a retrospective , the curatorial team at the Jordanian National Gallery of Fine Arts ( JNGFA ) have opted for division by subject matter , thus resulting in each section featuring works from Durra 's earliest years to 2018 . This unconventional decision is instantly justified by even the most cursory of visits . While Durra has experimented with many artistic styles and subject matters throughout his career he is by no means a linear artist , and one repeatedly witnesses a reversion to specific colour palettes and styles at different stages of Durra 's artistic journey . For this reason , the most reliable constant for Durra 's opus is indeed subject matter over execution , and it is this division that enables us to best understand Durra 's work . As he explains : My work depends on my mood . Style is not a political party ; it is not a dogma . Style is how you feel one morning . One morning you may feel like you want make an abstract painting , and it 's important to be honest with what you 're doing , to be spontaneous . Mohanna Durra , Untitled , Oil on Wood , 81\u00d7119 cm , 1967 Mohanna Durra , Three Faces , Oil on Wood , 47\u00d753.5 cm , 1959 This being said , the JNGFA has respected major thematic events in Durra 's career . While a European trained artist , Durra remains Jordanian by nature , and his depiction of the Bedouin and local Jordanian were key subjects in his early years ( and they continue to be addressed to this day ) . It is thus fitting that some of the first works we see upon entering the exhibition are portraits of Jordanians in traditional scenes ( such as Untitled , 1966 ) executed in a realist style ( albeit with a hint of abstraction in his liberated brush strokes ) , highlighting before all else that Durra is a Jordanian artist . And yet , these naturalist portraits are adjacent to abstract works such as ' 3 Faces ' ( 1959 ) and ' Dance and Movement ' ( 1971 ) ( seen later below ) whose brushstrokes are wild and loose , rejecting the naturalistic tendencies of their neighbours , despite sometimes occurring earlier in his career . In the first room in the exhibition , therefore , we are introduced to Durra 's wide ranging stylistic abilities . Nestled between these works a small , simple scene of a Dervish can be spotted , innocent in its subject matter and execution . Dated to 1948 , it is one of two works in the exhibition dating from when Durra was just 10 years old , and serves as a gentle reminder of the natural gift that Durra possesses . Whatever we see from this moment on , it seems to tell us , remember the talent that is required to create effective , expressive abstraction . Mohanna Durra , Circassian Dance , China Ink on Paper , 49\u00d763 , 1982 The insistence on classical training in the fine arts before embarking on the journey of abstraction is something Durra feels strongly about . He says \u201c I believe you have to be able to know how to draw [ before you can attempt to be abstract ] , you have to be able to know the form and the shape in order to develop it or destroy it . \u201d On the first floor , therefore , the viewer is introduced to Durra 's drawings , portraits and clowns . The effortless confidence in the free - flowing lines renders Durra 's sketches breath-taking , with their economy of line reminiscent of Matisse and Schiele 's sketches , while the knowledge of their existence aids the viewer in understanding the traditional artistic skill necessary to successfully execute an abstract work ( eg. ' Circassian Dance ' , 1982 ) . Mohanna Durra , My First Teacher George Aleef , Acrylic on Canvas , 75\u00d750 cm , 1960 Among the portraits , the viewer is drawn towards a depiction of George Aleef , Durra 's first teacher while still a child in Jordan . Durra shared the story behind this portrait with artmejo : When I returned home from Rome , George Aleef , who was my teacher before my departure and who had taught me the scholastic method , the classic lessons about art , he was afraid that I had become so modern in throwing colours on the canvas that he came to my studio and he was almost angry ! But then he sat on a chair and I painted him while he was talking , and after he saw [ the portrait I had done of him ] he forgave me and pardoned me and he said to me \u201c in spite of the fact that you betrayed my teaching , you still have something , a gift . \u201d Mohanna Durra , Self Portrait , Oil on Wood , 56\u00d745 cm , undated Also on this floor , we are introduced to one of Durra 's favourite subject matters : Faces and Clowns . For Durra , his \u201c fascination with portraits results from the powerful impact of the different facial expressions and the story told by each face . \u201d Durra has the rare of skill of being able to express the personality of his sitter while simultaneously transmitting his own artistic character through the canvas . He claims that \u201c for me , the resemblance is not important . Rather it is what she conveys to me , it is the feeling that is important . Everybody emanates some sort of energy , and it is my job to capture that . \u201d By employing looser brush strokes than used on conventional portraits and forgoing a detailed background in a favour of block colour , Durra focuses the viewer 's attention entirely on the face and breaks the barrier between sitter and spectator , thus creating a portrait that is informal , intimate and warm . Mohanna Durra , Clown , Oil on Canvas , 57\u00d743 cm , 2004 and Mohanna Durra , Clown , Oil on Paper , 51\u00d740 cm , 1982 While the portrait is important for Durra , the recurring subject matter of clowns suggests that his fascination is primarily with the face itself and in the unlocking of its secrets . While externally exhibiting the attributes of happiness , for Durra a clown can \u201c hide behind [ his ] mask ; putting a smile on other people 's faces in spite of his sadness . \u201d The works featuring Clowns in Durra 's work date from 1982 - 2010 , once again showing Durra 's long - enduring fascination in recurring subject matters . However , it was in fact as early as 1952 , when Durra was only 14 years old , that the fascination manifested itself . When I was a boy , I went to a movie ( The Greatest Show on Earth ) featuring James Stewart and in this movie he played a nice , very human character who was accused of something and had to run away and hide , thus joining the circus as a clown . He was filled with sadness , and yet he was making people laugh . I was struck by someone so , so sad still making people laugh . I was so impressed by this story that it keeps on coming back to me . Mohanna Durra , Clown , Mixed Media on Paper , 14\u00d79 cm , 2002 and Clown section at JNGFA with Clown ( 2002 ) seen on the far left end It is with this Clowns series that we are best able to observe the wide range of media used by Durra , ranging from charcoal on paper to watercolour on paper to oil on canvas . Durra is not limited in his artistic talents . It is at this point worth noting that an exhibition can only be so good as its curation . JNGFA has found a perfect balance between spacious viewing opportunities and the occasional , intimate space where one can interact with the work on a personal level . Miniature canvases ( such as ' Clown ' , 2002 ) placed in a broader context of larger works serve as a reminder to the viewer to approach the canvas and interact with the painting , encouraging dialogue between the individual and the art . Mohanna Durra , Abstraction , Acrylic on Canvas , 102\u00d7151 cm , 2012 Having been introduced to Durra 's more traditional subject matters and styles , the exhibition next introduces us to Durra 's more famous larger - scale abstract works . Throughout the exhibition the viewer is given hints of the textural experimentation that occurs in Durra 's works in the latter half of his career , however it is not until Floor 2 that this is shown explicitly . This writer is tempted to coin Durra 's larger abstract works ' The Sheet Series ' , so explicit is his application of texture in his works . Layering canvas on top of the base canvas layer , Durra creates an almost topographical aspect in his works with creases emerging from the canvasses surface , reminiscent of a crumpled bed sheet . While the shades of blue that are constantly recurring in Durra 's palette of choice feature in his Abstract scenes , there is also the introduction of an emphasis on red and orange . By placing a primarily blue canvas ' Abstraction ' ( 2016 ) opposite its counterpoint ' Abstraction ' ( 2012 ) , whose palette is entirely in shades of red , the exhibition succeeds once again in highlighting for the viewer the variety and progression in Durra 's paintings . Throughout our conversation with Durra at his home , he repeatedly referenced artists , psychological theories , literature and music . Here is an artist , indeed , but more than that he is an intellectual . When describing his process for creating abstraction , Durra explains that : I do n't draw [ or use underdrawings ] , I just use the brush , a thick brush at that , because a thick brush will not give details , and through these clouds of whatever colour I throw on the canvas , one can see things . You know , it 's like the Rorschach Test \u2026 we may all see movement in a stroke , but how we interpret that movement , it 's different for all of us . It 's important that you [ the artist ] give the interpretation of movement as you yourself feel it / want . Mohanna Durra , Composition 2 , Oil on Canvas , 74\u00d796.5 cm , 1977 Painting is an art form , but it should not be limited to itself . Durra fondly recalls the Arabic proverb that says that \u201c ' the Arts , when they develop and become refined , meet . \u201d \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u062a\u0642\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646\u0648\u0646 , \u062a\u0644\u062a\u0642 \u064a \u201d Poetry meets music , and music meets art . So \u201d explains Durra \u201c when you paint you think about these tonalities \u2026 you have to listen to what you are doing . It may take a while until you feel comfortable with what you 've done but it is necessary . \u201d Mohanna Durra , Dance and Movement , Oil on Canvas , 58\u00d745 cm , 1971 The coalescing of music and art is something that Durra , a classical music enthusiast , is passionate about . Whenever he paints , music plays . It was during his 10 years spent in Moscow , where he lived while working as a member of the Jordanian Foreign Office , that the works of Stravinsky , Rachmaninoff and Wagner caught his attention .

They reveal an intimate insight into the painter 's attempts to convey musical direction , be it piano or fortissimo , via pen strokeand highlight his recurrent interest in the dialogue between motion and drawing , as can be seen in the \u201c Line and Movement \u201d sketches on the first floor . Mohanna Durra , Silver Abstraction , Oil on Canvas , 101\u00d7181 , 2018 On the final floor , Durra 's largest and most ' modern ' abstract works are displayed . In later works from the 1990s and 2000s Durra appears to leave behind the mixing of paints before application , instead favouring the application of block colours directly from the tube .

Earlier this month , nearly 300 cars , trucks , vans and jeeps sounded their support for the truck drivers ' campaign by beeping their horns as they passed Iceland 's national parliament , Althingi . Currently , almost half the cost of a tank of gas in Iceland is made up of government taxes , including a value - added tax and a special tax on fuel . While local taxes have n't increased , the rising cost of crude on world oil markets is driving prices higher . A sharp decline in the Icelandic krona is also adding to the cost of imported fuel .

He says the present fluctuations were created by the \" extraordinary \" growth of the Iceland banking sector coupled with difficulties in global financial systems .

The video was shot on Wednesday morning in Reykjavik , Iceland by retired truck driver Halldor Sigurgson and submitted to CNN 's i Report . watch the i Report \" This is the first time in a long time we have seen in Iceland violence against protestors , \" Halldor Sigurgson told CNN , adding \" we are not used to violence against groups of people at all . \" The group of people in this case is truck drivers who have been blocking major roads in the Icelandic capital to protest against the rising cost of fuel . They 're also objecting to EU regulations on how long they can drive without resting . Earlier this month , nearly 300 cars , trucks , vans and jeeps sounded their support for the truck drivers ' campaign by beeping their horns as they passed Iceland 's national parliament , Althingi . Currently , almost half the cost of a tank of gas in Iceland is made up of government taxes , including a value - added tax and a special tax on fuel . While local taxes have n't increased , the rising cost of crude on world oil markets is driving prices higher . A sharp decline in the Icelandic krona is also adding to the cost of imported fuel . Protestors are calling on the government to reduce taxes to ease the burden on local motorists . Like many Icelanders , Thrandur Arnthorsson is wedded to his 4x4 . In his spare time the software project manager runs a Web site dedicated to off-roading . Recently , he has noticed it is becoming more expensive to fill his tank . \" Yesterday I filled it up for 12,000 kronas , \" Thrandur Arnthorsson says . That is about $ 161 . \" It has risen with the fall of the krona against other currencies and the rising price of oil at the same time so people are frustrated about how high the taxes are on fuel . \" The discontent over high fuel prices is being exacerbated by a sharp decline in Iceland 's economy . The Central Bank of Iceland has hiked interest rates to 15.5 percent to staunch a steep slide in the Icelandic krona . Inflation is nearing 10 percent and , after years of impressive growth , the country 's economy is forecast to expand just one percent this year . Iceland 's biggest banks -- Kaupthing , Glitnir and Landsbanki -- have been borrowing from abroad to finance their international expansion making them particularly vulnerable to the global credit crunch . In a recent interview with CNN 's Principal Voices , Iceland President Olafur Grimsson said he 's relatively calm about the country 's current economic challenges . \" While I 'm concerned I 'm both relaxed and optimistic because fundamentally the Icelandic economy is very strong , \" he said . He says the present fluctuations were created by the \" extraordinary \" growth of the Iceland banking sector coupled with difficulties in global financial systems . It 's interesting when you look at the international discussions about Iceland , \" Grimsson said . \" The more knowledgeable people are about Iceland the less alarmist they are about looking at our present situation . \" For truck drivers , the present situation of high fuel costs is all too real . Halldor Sigurgson says the majority of Icelanders support the recent protests . \" I stand by them because I was on it this morning , \" he told CNN . \" I went out there to take photos and video . There is a lot of public support for them here in Iceland . \" E-mail to a friend All About Oil Prices \u2022 Iceland | From psychiatrist to ' Butcher of Bosnia ' || Why trial could take years |","annotations":[{"text":"someone","span":[266,272],"token_span":[47,47],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The animate protagonist who causes the Fluid to move."},{"text":"a can of fluid","span":[281,294],"token_span":[49,52],"role":"Fluid","label":"Fluid","role_definition":"The entity that changes location and moves in a fluidic way.

They are among those killed as protests have roiled American cities in the week since the death of George Floyd , a black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis officer jammed a knee into his neck . The deaths , as well as widespread peaceful protests , have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of heavy - handed police tactics , vandalism and arson . Dozens have been injured in the chaos . Many of the people killed were African Americans , compounding the tragedy for black communities . The death toll and circumstances of the killings are still being sorted out in many cities , but here is what we know so far : ST .

But we are releasing it to provide transparency . It does not answer every question , including why did he fire and where were police at the time he fired , \u201d Schroeder said .

No arrests have been made . \u201c She was always smiling , always laughing . That 's why it 's so sad that she was taken in such a violent way , \u201d Hale said . \u201c That is not Italia .

The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating , \u201d coach Tom Allen said in a statement . \u201c Since I returned home to coach at Indiana , Chris embraced me , encouraged me and supported me ! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together . \u201d The circumstances of Beaty 's shooting were n't immediately clear , but some media reports said it happened near his apartment . It came the same night an 18- year - old man was fatally shot as protests erupted in the city . ___ DAVENPORT , IOWA Police are investigating the deaths of 22 - year - old Italia Kelly , who was shot Monday while leaving a protest outside a Walmart , and of a man found near where suspects exchanged gunfire with police in the city of 100,000 people across the Mississippi River from Illinois . Kelly and a friend were getting in a vehicle to leave because a protest had turned unruly when she was struck in the back by a bullet , said her aunt , Amy Hale of Atchison , Kansas . No arrests have been made . \u201c She was always smiling , always laughing . That 's why it 's so sad that she was taken in such a violent way , \u201d Hale said . \u201c That is not Italia . She was the bright , bubbly big personality in the room . \u201d Separately , authorities said an officer was \u201c ambushed \u201d with gunfire Sunday . Another officer shot back , and the suspects fled but were arrested . Near where the officer was wounded , police found a man shot to death and a handgun under his body . His identity was n't released . Police said surveillance video shows that the man and some of the arrested suspects were involved in a shooting outside a jewelry store hours earlier . They were casing the business when other cars arrived and multiple people fired shots at each other , police said . ___ MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out , Calvin L. Horton Jr. was fatally shot outside a pawn shop last week . The owner of the pawn shop , who is white , was arrested in the death of Horton , a 43 - year - old black man . Police say they are investigating the circumstances of the killing , including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood . The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during the unrest . ___ OMAHA , NEBRASKA James Scurlock , a 22 - year - old black man , was killed Saturday after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two downtown bars . Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people , including Scurlock , approach white bar owner Jake Gardner . Two people shove Gardner to the ground , and he fired shots in the air . Seconds later , Scurlock is seen jumping on Gardner , who then fires the gun over his shoulder , striking Scurlock . Authorities have declined to press charges in the death , calling the shooting self -defense . But Gardner could still face misdemeanor gun charges because his concealed carry permit for the gun had expired , the police chief said . ___ DETROIT A 21 -year - old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest . According to a police report , the man was sitting in the driver 's seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone opened fire and then ran away . ___ SUBURBAN CHICAGO Two people were killed during unrest Monday in the suburb of Cicero , according to a town official .

Facing a an undersized opponent on short notice , the Ohio -based heavyweight performed as one might expect he should , as he stopped Fabio Maldonado -- a natural light heavyweight -- via technical knockout just 35 seconds into the opening frame of their heavyweight main event bout at the \u201c The Ultimate Fighter : Brazil 3 Finale \u201d in Sao Paulo , Brazil , on Saturday night . \u201c I was really nervous , that guy is a tank . He keeps coming forward . He does n't stop . He 's got the heart of a lion , \u201d said Miocic , who was originally scheduled to face Junior dos Santos until \u201c Cigano \u201d bowed out of the fight with an injury . Advertisement Miocic ( 12 - 1 , 6-1 UFC ) did n't need long to assert himself . The Strong Style Fight Team representative buckled the former professional boxer with a left hook almost immediately . Although a backpedaling Maldonado ( 21 - 7 , 4 - 4 UFC ) appeared to be hurt by the blow , Miocic chose to err on the side of caution at first . \u201c Me and my coaches went over it again and again . He can get rocked at the beginning , but he comes back stronger , \u201d Miocic said . \u201c I did n't want him to play possum with me , so I just waited for an opportunity and I got it . \u201d The patient approach paid off , as Miocic dropped the Brazilian with a right cross to the temple moments later . About eight unanswered hammerfists on the ground would follow before referee Mario Yamasaki intervened , marking the first time that Maldonado had been stopped by strikes ( the loss to Glover Teixeira at UFC 153 was a doctor stoppage ) in 28 pro fights . Carlos Jr. Grounds Former Kickboxer Miranda Antonio Carlos Jr. may be undersized , but he was plenty big enough to capture \u201c The Ultimate Fighter Brazil 3 \u201d heavyweight crown . In just his fourth professional fight , Carlos Jr. ( 4 - 0 , 1-0 UFC ) took a unanimous decision over former professional kickboxer Vitor Miranda ( 9 - 4 , 0 - 1 UFC ) . Two judges scored it 30 - 27 , while a third had it 29 - 28 -- all in favor of Carlos Jr. , who went the distance for the first time in his young career . \u201c This is a very special night for me , I 'm really happy to be here in front of all my family with the crowd shouting my name , \u201d Carlos Jr. said . \u201c Vitor is a very strong fighter -- he really deserves to be here tonight . \u201d The 24-year - old known as \u201c Cara de Sapato \u201d landed takedowns in each round and largely neutralized Miranda 's striking prowess . Carlos Jr. , meanwhile , was able to smoothly integrate his striking and wrestling , often transitioning from combinations on the feet to takedowns . Alves Captures ' TUF : Brazil 3 ' Middleweight Crown Warlley Alves became the middleweight winner of \u201c The Ultimate Fighter : Brazil 3 , \u201d as he submitted Marcio Alexandre Jr. with a guillotine choke . The contest ended 25 seconds into the third round , as Alves rocked his foe with a counter overhand right before securing the finish . The 23- year-old Alves rarely gave the karateka nicknamed \u201c Lyoto \u201d room to breathe . The four-time Jungle Fight veteran dropped Alexandre with an overhand right in round one and consistently punctuated his combinations with clinches and takedowns . On the mat , the X-Gym representative attacked with heavy ground - and - pound . Alves ( 7 - 0 , 1-0 UFC ) continued to wear his foe down with constant pressure right up until the end . Alexandre ( 12 - 1 , 0 -1 UFC ) struggled to mount anything in the way of meaningful offense , as a final desperation takedown attempt resulted in him being trapped in Alves ' guillotine choke . \u201c I do n't practice jiu-jitsu ; I do n't practice wrestling ; I do n't practice individual sports -- I practice MMA , \u201d Alves said . \u201c This is a dream come true . I 'm telling you , the Octagon is going to become much more exciting from now on . \u201d Maia Dominates Octagon Newcomer Yakovlev Demian Maia badly needed to get back into the win column . As it turned out , Octagon rookie Alexander Yakovlev was the unfortunate victim in his way . The former Abu Dhabi Combat Club Submission Wrestling World Championship gold medalist authored a dominant performance , as he mounted Yakovlev in every round en route to cruising to a unanimous verdict . All three judges scored the fight 30 - 27 in favor of Maia ( 19 - 6 , 13 - 6 ) , who improved to 4 - 2 in the UFC at 170 pounds . \u201c I fought very hard to try to get a submission but I was n't able to do so , \u201d Maia said . Yakovlev did well to make it to the judges . Maia dropped his foe with a left hand in the opening frame and moved seamlessly to full mount . He spent the rest of the frame unloading with elbows and punches from top position , but Yakovlev ( 21 - 5 - 1 , 0 - 1 UFC ) proved to be resilient . Despite being in a number of precarious positions , the Russian had positive moments , most notably reversing Maia from mount and moving into top position himself in round two . However , Maia controlled the positional battle for the majority of the bout . Peralta Takes Tough Split Verdict Over Bezerra Robbie Peralta disappointed the Brazilian faithful , as he took a closely - contested split verdict against \u201c TUF : Brazil 1 \u201d winner Rony Mariano Bezerra in a featherweight affair . Two judges scored the bout 30 - 27 -- one in favor for Peralta and the other for \u201c Rony \u201d Jason -- while a third scored it 29 - 28 for the American . Peralta ( 18 - 4 , 4-1 UFC ) was able to land with more volume than his Brazilian opponent over the course of the 15 - minute clash . \u201c Problems \u201d controlled distance with leg kicks , won his share of scrambles on the mat and held his own in a couple of firefights . Bezerra ( 14 - 5 , 4 - 2 UFC ) had his moments as well . He landed a spinning back elbow in round one , attacked with jumping knees and threatened with submissions on the mat . However , it was Peralta 's sporadic bursts of aggression that ultimately made the difference . ATT 's Magomedov Outpoints Damm Rashid Magomedov to a unanimous decision triumph over \u201c TUF : Brazil 1 \u201d veteran Rodrigo Damm . All three cageside judges scored the lightweight fight 30 - 27 in favor of the American Top Team product . Damm ( 12 - 7 , 3 - 2 UFC ) never really got on track against the former M-1 Global champion . Magomedov ( 17 - 1 , 2-0 UFC ) kept Damm at bay by consistently landing kicks to the legs and body . A hard left jab followed by a right behind the ear dropped the Brazilian in round one , but Magomedov refused to dive into his foe 's guard as time expired . Magomodev continued to control the range with hard left kicks to the body and effective counter - punching combinations in the second frame . Damm picked up the pace in the final period , but it was not nearly enough to sway the fight in his favor . Unbeaten Silverio Submits Chavez Elias Silverio earned his third straight UFC victory , submitting Ernest Chavez with a rear - naked choke in the third stanza of their lightweight tussle . After a promising beginning , Chavez ( 7 - 1 , 1-1 UFC ) asked out of the fight 4:21 into round three . Chavez kept Silverio off balance thanks to clever movement in the opening round , but he was unable to maintain that pace as the bout progressed . Silverio began to assert himself in round two by controlling the range with his jab and a variety of kicks . While Chavez was able to hold his own against his larger foe in the clinch , that approach took its toll on his offensive output . Silverio ( 11 - 0 , 3 - 0 UFC ) put his foot on the gas pedal in round three , landing a spinning back kick and peppering the Californian with punching combinations . A final clinch attempt from Chavez proved disastrous , as Silverio reversed the position , took his back and secured the rear-naked choke . Umalatov Wears Down Thiago Gasan Umalatov utilized a physical approach to take a unanimous verdict over Paulo Thiago . Two cageside judges scored it 30 - 27 in favor of Umalatov , while a third saw in 29 - 28 for the Russian . Thiago ( 15 - 7 , 5 - 7 UFC ) expended a great deal of energy attempting to drag Umalatov ( 15 - 3 - 1 , 1-1 UFC ) to the canvas in the opening two frames , but he did not land his first takedown until less than 20 seconds remained in the second . By then , the Russian fighter had already built a lead on the scorecards behind clinch work , takedowns and the occasional well - timed power punch . Thiago appeared to finally get comfortable in the third round , but he was unable to land anything of significance to alter the course of the bout . The former world - ranked welterweight has now lost four of his last five Octagon appearances . Relentless Souza TKOs Eddiva Edimilson Souza past Mark Eddiva in a featherweight matchup . The end came 4:52 into the second frame , as Souza teed off with heavy unanswered punches to the head and body of his Filipino opponent . The slugfest started early when Souza found a home for two solid left hooks in round one , and the Brazilian ended the frame unloading with punches against the shorter Eddiva near the fence . Somehow , Eddiva survived . Eddiva ( 6 - 1 , 1-1 UFC ) appeared to slow his adversary 's movement with a steady diet of kicks to the Brazilian 's lead leg to begin round two . However , Souza ( 15 - 3 , 2-0 UFC ) would eventually find his rhythm again , trapping Eddiva against the fence with another furious salvo of punches to earn the stoppage . ' Demente ' Chokes Out Wagner Silva Ricardo Abreu submitted Wagner Silva with a rear - naked choke in the second round of a middleweight tilt . The end came 1:06 into the period , as \u201c Demente \u201d transitioned to his opponent 's back to elicit the tapout . Powerful overhand rights were Abreu 's weapon of choice throughout the bout . The Wand Fight Team member dropped Silva in the opening frame but was unable to finish . In round two , Abreu ( 5 - 0 , 1-0 UFC ) capitalized on Silva 's ( 3 - 1 , 0 - 1 UFC ) aggression to drop his man once again with another big right hand . Abreu then moved into full mount and dropped heavy punches on his opponent before transitioning to the fight-ending choke . De Lima Blasts ' TUF Brazil : 3 ' Castmate Moreira Marcos Rogerio de Lima made short work of \u201c Ultimate Fighter : Brazil \u201d castmate Richardson Moreira , winning via knockout 20 seconds into the opening frame of their heavyweight clash . The muay Thai specialist began the action by throwing a head kick before quickly initiating the clinch against Moreira . De Lima ( 12 - 2 - 1 , 1-0 UFC ) , who held a significant size advantage over his opponent , landed a couple of knees in close quarters before connecting flush with a straight right hand when the two combatants separated . The punch sent Moreira ( 7 - 2 , 0 - 1 UFC ) tumbling to the canvas , and de Lima needed only a couple follow - up blows before referee Wernei Cardoso intervened to halt the bout . \u201c That 's exactly what I was training in camp , \u201d de Lima said through a translator . \u201c That worked out , so I have to thank all of my team . \u201d Prospect Munhoz Overwhelms Hobar Pedro Munhoz earned his first UFC triumph in impressive fashion , stopping former Legacy Fighting Championship titlist Matt Hobar in the first round of their bantamweight clash . A series of standing - to - ground shots from Munhoz brought a halt to the contest at the 2:47 mark of round one . Munhoz ( 11 - 1 , 1-1 UFC ) set the tone by staggering his opponent with a head kick early in the round , and Hobar ( 8 - 2 , 0 - 1 UFC ) never recovered . The Blackhouse MMA member was unable to secure a guillotine choke , but he kept the pressure on . With the fight back on the feet , Munhoz wobbled Hobar with a right hand and immediately followed with a takedown . From there , \u201c The Young Punisher \u201d passed guard and sealed the victory with heavy punches from above .

De Lima ( 12 - 2 - 1 , 1-0 UFC ) , who held a significant size advantage over his opponent , landed a couple of knees in close quarters before connecting flush with a straight right hand when the two combatants separated . The punch sent Moreira ( 7 - 2 , 0 - 1 UFC ) tumbling to the canvas , and de Lima needed only a couple follow - up blows before referee Wernei Cardoso intervened to halt the bout . \u201c That 's exactly what I was training in camp , \u201d de Lima said through a translator . \u201c That worked out , so I have to thank all of my team . \u201d Prospect Munhoz Overwhelms Hobar Pedro Munhoz earned his first UFC triumph in impressive fashion , stopping former Legacy Fighting Championship titlist Matt Hobar in the first round of their bantamweight clash . A series of standing - to - ground shots from Munhoz brought a halt to the contest at the 2:47 mark of round one . Munhoz ( 11 - 1 , 1-1 UFC ) set the tone by staggering his opponent with a head kick early in the round , and Hobar ( 8 - 2 , 0 - 1 UFC ) never recovered . The Blackhouse MMA member was unable to secure a guillotine choke , but he kept the pressure on . With the fight back on the feet , Munhoz wobbled Hobar with a right hand and immediately followed with a takedown . From there , \u201c The Young Punisher \u201d passed guard and sealed the victory with heavy punches from above .

When a safety car came out on lap six to allow Lucas di Grassi 's stricken Audi to be retrieved , Farfus was ordered to come into the pits so damaged bodywork from the opening lap incident could be removed . He would eventually recover to finish fourth .

By the final lap , Frijns had broken clear from Engel and closed right behind Mortara , but the leading Mercedes had it under control and came home 0.618 seconds clear . Speaking after his victory , Mortara said : \u201c It was easy to make mistakes , but in the end it worked out perfect .

In the end , 35 matches came down to one over , and then just one ball and one run as Scorchers scrambled a single off the last delivery of the match to complete their chase of Sydney Sixers ' 5 for 147 with four wickets standing . Scorchers required eight off the final over , bowled by Brett Lee who was playing his last professional match . An outrageous scoop-shovel four from Michael Carberry off the first ball of the over halved the equation before a two and a one off the following balls left Scorchers just one short with three balls remaining . An amazing match still had one final twist left in it as Lee bowled Nathan Coulter - Nile and Sam Whiteman with two searing yorkers , followed by his vein-throbbing chainsaw celebration one final time .

However , the required run-rate , which began at 7.4 never once fell below 7.5 for the entire innings . Klinger and Marsh had provided a platform but they had left their team with work to do . The partnership was ended in the twelfth over when Klinger was caught by Sean Abbott off Lee. Adam Voges then joined Marsh and added 43 runs before he fell for a 13 - ball 20 . Again , it was a useful partnership but there was still work to be done . As long as Marsh was there , though , you sensed Scorchers would be okay . Henriques ' decision to throw the ball to Nathan Lyon in the penultimate over was a bold one , but it was justified by the first ball when he ended Marsh 's anchoring innings , a 59 - ball 73 , the batsman holing out on the midwicket boundary . Two balls later the Scorchers chase was pegged back further when Ashton Turner was also caught on the midwicket boundary . The new man Coulter - Nile thumped a huge six off the final ball of the over to set up the jaw-dropping final over . It was Henriques who in the end made the mistake that cost Sixers a tie and a Super Over , but earlier it was his wonderfully paced 77 off 57 that was to thank for them setting as many as they did .

Dubbed the \" Pharaohs ' Golden Parade \" , the 18 kings and four queens travelled in order , oldest first , each aboard a separate vehicle decorated in ancient Egyptian style . Both pedestrians and vehicles were barred from Tahrir Square , site of the current museum , and other sections of the route .

For their procession through Cairo 's streets , the mummies were placed in special containers filled with nitrogen , under conditions similar to their regular display cases . The new resting place , the National Museum of Egyptian Civilisation in the Fustat district of Old Cairo , consists of sleek , low- rise buildings topped with a pyramid amid expansive grounds .

It too will house pharaonic collections , including the celebrated treasure of Tutankhamun .

A so -called \" curse of the pharaoh \" emerged in the wake of Tutankhamun 's unearthing in 1922 - 23 . A key funder of the dig , Lord Carnarvon , died of blood poisoning months after the tomb was opened , while an early visitor likewise died abruptly in 1923 .

But she rose to become a powerful monarch under whose rule numerous projects were built and trade with other countries flourished . 8 - King Thutmose III was remembered as one of the great warrior kings of the New Kingdom , whose battle at Megiddo is considered a model of military strategy . 9 - King Amenhotep II , his son , was known as an excellent charioteer and all - round athlete as well as skilled with bow and arrow . He secured Egypt 's borders and fought military campaigns that secured immense wealth and power , and was also known for expanding the Karnak temple complex near Luxor . 10 - Thutmose IV , son of the previous king . 11 - Amenhotep III ruled for 37 or 38 years . His reign was known for its opulence and the grandeur of its monuments , including the Colossi of Memnon - two massive stone statues near Luxor that represent him and his wife . 12 - Queen Tiye was married to Amenhotep III . 13 - Seti I , son of Ramses I , ruled for at least 21 years during which he led several military campaigns to reimpose Egypt 's authority outside its borders .

At that point , the renamed SFX Entertainment held on to a pair of small concert promoters , eventually turning the company into the world 's largest producer and presenter of live entertainment , selling the company to Clear Channel for $ 4.4 billion in 2000 .

But in the spring one can : - Admire new tender leaves , flowers and snowy mountains of High Atlas at the horizon line ; - Watch women by their everyday labor and the bridge with carpets , before the river dried out ; - Take a walk through paths along canals of irrigation system and look at the plants grown by locals . In 40 km. from Kelaat M'Gouna there is Dades gorge ( Gorges du Dades ) . The road to Dades starts with many hairpin turns that are visible from above . A good spot to make beautiful pictures . Todra gorge ( Gorges du Toudra ) is in 80 km. from Kelaat M'Gouna . The height of its walls is up to 400 m . The rivers of both canyons stay dry in summer and autumn .

But in the spring one can : - Admire new tender leaves , flowers and snowy mountains of High Atlas at the horizon line ; - Watch women by their everyday labor and the bridge with carpets , before the river dried out ; - Take a walk through paths along canals of irrigation system and look at the plants grown by locals . In 40 km. from Kelaat M'Gouna there is Dades gorge ( Gorges du Dades ) . The road to Dades starts with many hairpin turns that are visible from above . A good spot to make beautiful pictures . Todra gorge ( Gorges du Toudra ) is in 80 km. from Kelaat M'Gouna . The height of its walls is up to 400 m . The rivers of both canyons stay dry in summer and autumn .

That 's because the pine family is the biggest conifer family , and in many cases , pines are the conifers with which most people are familiar ! To most of us , all cones are ' pine cones ' and in Mexico , all conifers are commonly called ' pinos ' . Read on to discover what makes a pine a pine . Pines are trees in the genus Pinus in the family Pinaceae and are the only genus in the order Pinales . There are about 115 species of pine , although different authorities accept between 105 and 124 species . Pines are native to most of the Northern Hemisphere and are grown in most temperate and subtropical regions of the world , where they are grown as timber and cultivated as ornamental plants in parks and gardens . One species ( Sumatran pine ) crosses the equator in Sumatra to 2\u00b0S . In North America , they range from 66\u00b0N to 12\u00b0N . A number of introduced species have become invasive , threatening native ecosystems . Most states in the U.S. have native pines . The English name pine derives from Latin Pinus which some have traced to the Indo - European base * p\u012bt , which means ' resin ' . In the past ( pre-19th century ) they were often known as fir , from Old Norse fyrre , by way of Middle English firre . The Old Norse name is still used for pines in some modern north European languages , in Danish fyr , in Norwegian fura / fure / furu , Swedish fura / furu ... but in modern English , fir is now restricted to fir ( Abies ) and Douglas -fir ( Pseudotsuga ) . Pines , like all conifers , belong to a group of seed - producing plants called gymnosperms . Pines are evergreen , coniferous , resinous trees ( or rarely shrubs ) that grow to heights of 10 to 250 feet ( 3 \u2013 80 m ) tall , with the majority of species reaching 50 to 145 feet ( 15 \u2013 45 m ) tall . The smallest are Siberian dwarf pine and Potosi pinyon , and the tallest is a 268.35 - foot ( 81.79 m ) tall Ponderosa pine located in southern Oregon 's Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest . The bark of most pines is thick and scaly , but some species have thin , flaking bark . The branches are produced in regular \" pseudo whorls \" , actually a very tight spiral but appearing like a ring of branches arising from the same point . Many pines are uninodal , producing just one such whorl of branches each year , from buds at the tip of the year 's new shoot , but others are multinodal , producing two or more whorls of branches per year . The spiral growth of branches , needles , and cone scales are arranged in Fibonacci number ratios . The new spring shoots are sometimes called \" candles \" \u2014 they are covered in brown or whitish bud scales and point upward at first , then later turn green and spread outward . These \" candles \" offer foresters a means to evaluate fertility of the soil and vigor of the trees . Pines are long - lived , typically reaching ages of 100 to 1,000 years , some even more . The longest-lived is the Great Basin bristlecone pine , Pinus longaeva . One individual of this species , dubbed Methuselah , is one of the world 's oldest living organisms at around 4,600 years old . This tree can be found in the White Mountains of California . An older tree , unfortunately now cut down , was dated at 4,900 years old . It was discovered in a grove beneath Wheeler Peak and it is now known as Prometheus after the Greek immortal . Needles , the adult leaves , are green ( photosynthetic ) , bundled in clusters ( fascicles ) of 1 to 6 , commonly 2 to 5 , needles together , each fascicle produced from a small bud on a dwarf shoot in the axil of a scale leaf . These bud scales often remain on the fascicle as a basal sheath . The needles persist for 1.5 to 40 years , depending on species . If a shoot is damaged ( e.g. eaten by an animal ) , the needle fascicles just below the damage will generate a bud which can then replace the lost leaves . Pines are mostly monoecious , having the male and female cones on the same tree , though a few species are sub-dioecious with individuals predominantly , but not wholly , single - sex . The male cones are small , typically 0.4 to 2 inches ( 1 \u2013 5 cm ) long , and only present for a short period ( usually in spring , though autumn in a few pines ) , falling as soon as they have shed their pollen . The female cones take 1.5 to 3 years ( depending on species ) to mature after pollination , with actual fertilization delayed one year . At maturity the female cones are 1.2 to 24 inches ( 3 \u2013 60 cm ) long . Each cone has numerous spirally arranged scales , with two seeds on each fertile scale ; the scales at the base and tip of the cone are small and sterile , without seeds . The seeds are mostly small and winged , and are anemophilous ( wind -dispersed ) , but some are larger and have only a vestigial wing , and are bird -dispersed . At maturity , the cones usually open to release the seeds , but in some of the bird - dispersed species ( e.g. Whitebark pine ) , the seeds are only released by the bird breaking the cones open . In others , the seeds are stored in closed ( \" serotinous \" ) cones for many years until an environmental cue triggers the cones to open , releasing the seeds . The most common form of serotiny is pyriscence , in which a resin binds the cones cones shut until melted by a forest fire . Pines grow well in acid soils , some also on calcareous soils ; most require good soil drainage , preferring sandy soils , but a few ( e.g. Shore pine ) will tolerate poorly drained wet soils . A few are able to sprout after forest fires ( e.g. Canary Island pine ) . Some species of pines ( e.g. Bishop pine ) need fire to regenerate , and their populations slowly decline under fire suppression regimes . Several species are adapted to extreme conditions imposed by elevation and latitude ( e.g. Siberian dwarf pine , Mountain pine , Whitebark pine and the Bristlecone pines ) . The Pinyon pines and a number of others , notably Turkish pine and Gray pine , are particularly well adapted to growth in hot , dry semi-desert climates . The seeds are commonly eaten by birds and squirrels . Some birds , notably the Spotted Nutcracker , Clark 's Nutcracker and Pinyon Jay , are of importance in distributing pine seeds to new areas . Pine needles are sometimes eaten by some Lepidoptera ( butterfly and moth ) species , the Symphytan species pine sawfly , and goats . Pines are among the most commercially important of tree species , valued for their timber and wood pulp throughout the world . In temperate and tropical regions , they are fast -growing softwoods that will grow in relatively dense stands , their acidic decaying needles inhibiting the sprouting of competing hardwoods . Commercial pines are grown in plantations for timber that is denser , more resinous , and therefore more durable than spruce ( Picea ) . Pine wood is widely used in high - value carpentry items such as furniture , window frames , paneling , floors and roofing , and the resin of some species is an important source of turpentine . Many pine species make attractive ornamental plantings for parks and larger gardens , with a variety of dwarf cultivars being suitable for smaller spaces . Pines are also commercially grown and harvested for Christmas trees . Pine cones , the largest and most durable of all conifer cones , are craft favorites . Pine boughs , appreciated especially in wintertime for their pleasant smell and greenery , are popularly cut for decorations . A number of species are attacked by nematodes , causing pine wilt disease , which can kill some quickly . Pine needles are also used for making decorative articles like baskets , trays , pots , etc . This Native American skill is now being replicated across the world . Pine needle handicrafts are made in the US , Canada , Mexico , Nicaragua and India . Because pines have no insect or decay resistant qualities after logging , they are generally recommended for construction purposes as indoor use only ( ex. indoor drywall framing ) . This wood left outside can be expected to last no more than 12 to 18 months depending on the type of climate it is exposed to . It is commonly referred to by several different names which include North American timber , SPF ( spruce , pine , fir ) and whitewood . Some species have large seeds , called pine nuts , that are harvested and sold for cooking and baking . They are an important ingredient of Pesto alla genovese . The soft , moist , white inner bark ( cambium ) found clinging to the woody outer bark is edible and very high in vitamins A and C . It can be eaten raw in slices as a snack or dried and ground up into a powder for use as an ersatz flour or thickener in stews , soups , and other foods , such as bark bread . Adirondack Indians got their name from the Mohawk Indian word atir\u00fa : taks , meaning \" tree eaters \" . A tea made by steeping young , green pine needles in boiling water ( known as \" tallstrunt \" in Sweden ) is high in vitamins A and C. Editor 's Note : Want to learn more about Conifers ?

Of all the environmental groups that have sprung up in New Hampshire over the past decade , the catchiest name and most intriguing angle definitely belongs to Concord - based Project Laundry List , which urges people to take a single step : Dry your washing on an airy clothesline rather than in a hot , power - sucking tub . Dryers are inefficient devices , so bad that the government wo n't give any of them an Energy Star rating , and they consume more electricity in most American homes than any other appliance except the refrigerator . Trimming their use could make a significant dent in residential power usage . Concord resident Alexander Lee says he was inspired to start PLL , as it is often known , after hearing anti-nuclear activist Helen Caldicott say \u201c If we all did things like hang out our clothes , we could shut down the nuclear industry . \u201d An exaggeration perhaps , but inspirational to Lee. Lee , 36 , a Massachusetts native who graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy , started Project Laundry List as a website and kept it percolating on the side until national media attention in 2007 , prompted by a New York Times article , made him decide to step it up . He left the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission , where he had come to work after getting a law degree , and became PLL 's full - time director . Since then , Stephen Colbert 's show , ABC News and the Wall Street Journal have joined in , not to mention more regional media than you can shake a press release at , including The Telegraph . The site has launched a national \u201c right to dry \u201d movement , resulting in state laws being passed from Massachusetts to Nova Scotia to Hawaii ( but not New Hampshire ) that keep community associations from forbidding outdoor clotheslines .

Of all the environmental groups that have sprung up in New Hampshire over the past decade , the catchiest name and most intriguing angle definitely belongs to Concord - based Project Laundry List , which urges people to take a single step : Dry your washing on an airy clothesline rather than in a hot , power - sucking tub . Dryers are inefficient devices , so bad that the government wo n't give any of them an Energy Star rating , and they consume more electricity in most American homes than any other appliance except the refrigerator . Trimming their use could make a significant dent in residential power usage . Concord resident Alexander Lee says he was inspired to start PLL , as it is often known , after hearing anti-nuclear activist Helen Caldicott say \u201c If we all did things like hang out our clothes , we could shut down the nuclear industry . \u201d An exaggeration perhaps , but inspirational to Lee. Lee , 36 , a Massachusetts native who graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy , started Project Laundry List as a website and kept it percolating on the side until national media attention in 2007 , prompted by a New York Times article , made him decide to step it up . He left the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission , where he had come to work after getting a law degree , and became PLL 's full - time director . Since then , Stephen Colbert 's show , ABC News and the Wall Street Journal have joined in , not to mention more regional media than you can shake a press release at , including The Telegraph . The site has launched a national \u201c right to dry \u201d movement , resulting in state laws being passed from Massachusetts to Nova Scotia to Hawaii ( but not New Hampshire ) that keep community associations from forbidding outdoor clotheslines . Project Laundry List has also sold $ 100,000 of drying racks and clotheslines , and been a big part of getting people to realize that washing clothes in cold water works just fine . It 's even got a documentary coming out .

Should North Carolina finish atop the Coastal Division standings this year , the division trophy and title will go to the team with the next- best record .","annotations":[{"text":"Pitt","span":[777,780],"token_span":[134,134],"role":"New_member","label":"New_member","role_definition":"An item that becomes a part of the Group."},{"text":"Syracuse","span":[784,791],"token_span":[136,136],"role":"New_member","label":"New_member","role_definition":"An item that becomes a part of the Group."},{"text":"Notre Dame","span":[797,806],"token_span":[138,139],"role":"New_member","label":"New_member","role_definition":"An item that becomes a part of the Group."},{"text":"us","span":[816,817],"token_span":[141,141],"role":"Group","label":"Group","role_definition":"The Group is anything that can be conceptualized as a complex collection of parts or ingredients, including through metonymy like containers or locations, which New_members can join."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-2831-1240-frame-Cause_to_be_included","frame":"Cause_to_be_included","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Agent or Cause makes a New_member part of Group.","frame_ancestors":["Transitive_action","Objective_influence","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"MetalGeorge of Metal Rules also criticized the album saying that it \" severs all ties between the band and [ its ] old fan base by catering even more to the plague that is the New Wave of American Heavy Metal \" and that \" where as albums such as Burning Bridges and Wages of Sin lead the heavy metal charge , Doomsday Machine seems content to merely follow in the trodden footsteps of today 's trends and common sounds . \" Greg Pratt of Exclaim ! wrote that the album is \" basically more of the same but they 've managed to revitalise their sound a bit , adding in some toe-tapping maturity , along with the usual balls - out shredding . \"","annotations":[{"text":"they","span":[504,507],"token_span":[99,99],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent is a volitional animate being who causes the New_member to become part of the Group."},{"text":"some toe-tapping maturity","span":[565,589],"token_span":[111,113],"role":"New_member","label":"New_member","role_definition":"An item that becomes a part of the Group."},{"text":"the usual balls - out shredding","span":[604,634],"token_span":[117,122],"role":"Existing_member","label":"Existing_member","role_definition":"Something that is already a member of the Group and represents the Group as a whole."}],"trigger":{"text":"adding in","start_char":555,"end_char":563,"start_token":109,"end_token":110,"frame":"Cause_to_be_included"}},"source":{"text":"Arch Enemy Doomsday Machine Published Sep 01 , 2005 Hype can be a bands worst nightmare .

Continuing Education Activity Moisturizers are topically applied products designed to increase the water content of the skin . Ingredients used in these products have a range of actions , including preventing transepidermal water loss and promotion of desquamation . This activity will review the role of the skin barrier function , maintenance of water balance in the skin , and how these functions relate to moisturizing agents . Objectives : - Review the physiology of the skin barrier and how moisturizers can improve this function . - Identify the role of moisturizers in the management of a patient with an impaired skin barrier . - Summarize the treatment considerations for a moisturizer when approaching a patient with dry skin . - Identify the importance of collaboration amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for a patient using moisturizers to increase their skin barrier protection in the management of atopic dermatitis . Introduction To discuss moisturizers of the skin , we need a brief discussion on the skin barrier structure and function and the mechanism of maintaining water balance . The stratum corneum , the outermost layer of the epidermis , is the primary physiologic barrier of the skin and is of critical importance in maintaining water balance . [ 1 ] The role of water within the stratum corneum is pivotal to maintaining normal skin integrity and turnover . [ 2 ] Water allows for the increased flexibility of the tissues and is a crucial component of the enzymatic reactions responsible for cleavage of the corneodesmosomal connections between corneocytes during the desquamation process . Below a critical water concentration , the corneodesmosomal connections remain intact , which results in a build - up of corneocytes and the appearance of dry , flaky skin . [ 3 ] Function The stratum corneum contains high concentrations of osmotically active molecules , including amino acids and their derivatives , lactic acid , urea , and electrolytes . These molecules form from the breakdown of filaggrin and are referred to as natural moisturizing factor ( NMF ) . The molecules that make up NMF are hygroscopic and absorb atmospheric water at concentrations as low as 50 % . The formation of NMF from filaggrin is highly correlated with the water content of the stratum corneum and only occurs within a specific range of water concentrations . When the water content is high , filaggrin is stable , and conversion to NMF does not take place . [ 3 ] Conversely , when the water content is too low , hydrolytic enzymes needed for this reaction are unable to function . The water content of the stratum corneum ranges from 10 % to 30 % in healthy skin , as compared to 75 % to 85 % water content of stratum basale . [ 4 ] This gradient is a key feature in its function as a barrier . Organized in a \u201c bricks and mortar \u201d structure , the stratum corneum is composed of a variety of proteins and lipids . [ 5 ] Corneocytes have a tight organization in an interlocking and overlapping fashion , surrounded by a lipid lamella . [ 3 ] The major lipids involved in this structure are ceramides , cholesterol , and free fatty acids , which are synthesized by the keratinocytes , and stored in secretory granules . [ 6 ] [ 3 ] [ 1 ] These granules get released at a slow rate under normal conditions , but upon insult to the barrier , they undergo rapid secretion . The acute barrier disruption results in loss of the calcium gradient , which is an important regulator in the secretion of these granules . [ 7 ] Issues of Concern Dry skin has many causes , including frequent hand washing , exposure to harsh chemicals , low ambient humidity , and medical conditions like atopic dermatitis , ichthyosis , and psoriasis . The goals of moisturizing the skin are to improve the appearance and function of the skin . In patients with medical conditions associated with impaired barrier function of the skin , like atopic dermatitis , the diligent use of moisturizers is a fundamental component of their treatment . [ 8 ] The choice of moisturizing agents can be adjusted to best fit the needs of a patient . Factors like acne , flaking , hyperkeratosis , itching , or sensitive skin merit consideration when making recommendations of a moisturizing agent . Clinical Significance Types of Moisturizers Moisturizers divide into several categories , and their functions include preventing water loss through the skin , adding water to the skin , and reducing visible flakes . In recent years , with a fuller understanding of the structure and function of the skin barrier , the science of moisturizer development has advanced significantly . As a result , modern moisturizers frequently combine ingredients with different mechanisms of action to achieve specific results . Occlusive moisturizers prevent evaporation of water or reduce transepidermal water loss ( TEWL ) from the skin by forming a barrier . This barrier allows replenishment of the water content of the stratum corneum by the deeper layers of the epidermis and dermis . Petrolatum is the classic example of an occlusive moisturizer , and it is the most effective . It reduces water loss through the epidermis by nearly 99 % . [ 9 ] Many other substances can serve as occlusive moisturizers : - Hydrocarbons : petrolatum , mineral oil , paraffin , squalene - Silicones : dimethicone - Vegetable oils : coconut oil , castor oil , olive oil , grape seed oil , soybean oil - Animal Fats : Mink oil , emu oil , lanolin - Wax Esters : Lanolin , beeswax - Sterols : Cholesterol , ceramides Humectants are compounds that attract and bind water . Some of these substances , like urea , are endogenously present and make up part of the NMF . Humectants can hydrate the skin if the humidity is more than 70 % , but more commonly , they will draw water from the deeper epidermis and dermis . Without concomitant use of an occlusive moisturizer , some humectants can result in an increased transepidermal water loss and exacerbate skin dryness . Alpha-hydroxy acids ( AHAs ) are an important group of humectant molecules and have more recently focused on their use as moisturizing agents and cosmetics . AHAs include glycolic and lactic acids . These agents impact the water content of the stratum corneum by several mechanisms . They are effective humectants . They promote desquamation by reducing corneocyte cohesion and also improve the barrier function by increasing levels of ceramides . [ 3 ] [ 10 ] Lactic acid has been used topically at concentrations up to 12 % in the treatment of ichthyosis and dry skin for many years . [ 3 ] Urea is a component of NMF . The addition of urea to moisturizers helps with the absorption of water into the stratum corneum . It promotes the desquamation of corneocytes and increases penetration of other topically applied medications . [ 10 ] It also improves the skin 's barrier function and reduces TEWL . [ 3 ] Urea improves itching and is useful in the treatment of ichthyosis , disorders associated with hyperkeratosis , and atopic dermatitis . [ 8 ] Glycerin is another commonly used humectant and is present in many skincare products . In addition to attracting and binding water , it has demonstrated beneficial effects in barrier repair . [ 10 ] [ 3 ] Other humectants include honey , propylene glycol , sorbitol , and hyaluronic acid . An emulsifier is another classification of ingredients commonly found in moisturizers . It is a molecule that allows for two immiscible substances to exist as a single phase . The molecules are typically long carbon chains with a polar group . Commonly used emulsifiers are fatty acids , like stearic acid . [ 11 ] Formulations When a moisturizer contains humectants , the water content of the skin more rapidly increases , but as mentioned previously , this does not necessarily reduce trans- epidermal water loss . Similarly , when using an occlusive agent , the water content of the skin takes a long time to increase , as the water must be drawn from deeper levels of the skin before an improvement takes place . The term \u201c cream \u201d traditionally refers to a product containing more occlusive ingredients , whereas a \u201c lotion \u201d contains humectants primarily . [ 11 ] Modern moisturizers often contain both occlusives and humectants that contribute to efficacy . Understanding the physiology of the skin barrier and how a disease state or circumstance may contribute to dry skin , impaired barrier function , or flaking of the skin can help us choose the best ingredients for a patient . The specific balance and combination of ingredients will help achieve a variety of outcomes depending on the desire of the consumer . Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Particularly in the management of chronic medical conditions , like atopic dermatitis , the liberal use of moisturizers is a fundamental component of treatment . [ 8 ] [ 12 ] The application of moisturizers can be time - intensive for patients and caregivers , and as a result , is often neglected . Having consistent discussions by all members of the care teams , including dermatologists , pediatricians , and nurses , is extremely important . Dry skin affects millions of people and can seriously affect the quality of life . The use of moisturizers is the simplest way to obtain symptom relief . Hence , nurses , pharmacists , and primary care providers should encourage patients to use moisturizers liberally . However , patients should be educated to select moisturizers that are free of fragrance ; the more chemicals in a moisturizer , the more likely it causes an allergic reaction . The consistent use of moisturizers in atopic dermatitis can reduce symptoms and frequency of disease flares . Numerous randomized controlled trials form the basis of this recommendation . The level and strength of evidence are IA . Physicians ( MDs , DOs , NPs , PAs ) need to include moisturizers in their prescribing and care instructions . Pharmacists can make recommendations on the most appropriate types of agents to the prescriber or nursing staff . Nursing will often be in charge of application in the inpatient setting and can assess the effectiveness of moisturizing therapy , or in the outpatient setting can determine compliance with the moisturizing regimen and report back to the interprofessional healthcare team on the success or failure of treatment . Moisturizing agents can be a part of the compounding process if the pharmacist needs to make a topical preparation to deliver medication , and the pharmacist should consult with the clinician on such matters on a case - by - case basis . As with any intervention , using moisturizers is most effective with an interprofessional team approach . [ Level V ] References - 1 . - Madison KC .

[ 4 ] This gradient is a key feature in its function as a barrier . Organized in a \u201c bricks and mortar \u201d structure , the stratum corneum is composed of a variety of proteins and lipids . [ 5 ] Corneocytes have a tight organization in an interlocking and overlapping fashion , surrounded by a lipid lamella . [ 3 ] The major lipids involved in this structure are ceramides , cholesterol , and free fatty acids , which are synthesized by the keratinocytes , and stored in secretory granules . [ 6 ] [ 3 ] [ 1 ] These granules get released at a slow rate under normal conditions , but upon insult to the barrier , they undergo rapid secretion . The acute barrier disruption results in loss of the calcium gradient , which is an important regulator in the secretion of these granules . [ 7 ] Issues of Concern Dry skin has many causes , including frequent hand washing , exposure to harsh chemicals , low ambient humidity , and medical conditions like atopic dermatitis , ichthyosis , and psoriasis . The goals of moisturizing the skin are to improve the appearance and function of the skin . In patients with medical conditions associated with impaired barrier function of the skin , like atopic dermatitis , the diligent use of moisturizers is a fundamental component of their treatment . [ 8 ] The choice of moisturizing agents can be adjusted to best fit the needs of a patient . Factors like acne , flaking , hyperkeratosis , itching , or sensitive skin merit consideration when making recommendations of a moisturizing agent . Clinical Significance Types of Moisturizers Moisturizers divide into several categories , and their functions include preventing water loss through the skin , adding water to the skin , and reducing visible flakes . In recent years , with a fuller understanding of the structure and function of the skin barrier , the science of moisturizer development has advanced significantly . As a result , modern moisturizers frequently combine ingredients with different mechanisms of action to achieve specific results . Occlusive moisturizers prevent evaporation of water or reduce transepidermal water loss ( TEWL ) from the skin by forming a barrier . This barrier allows replenishment of the water content of the stratum corneum by the deeper layers of the epidermis and dermis . Petrolatum is the classic example of an occlusive moisturizer , and it is the most effective . It reduces water loss through the epidermis by nearly 99 % . [ 9 ] Many other substances can serve as occlusive moisturizers : - Hydrocarbons : petrolatum , mineral oil , paraffin , squalene - Silicones : dimethicone - Vegetable oils : coconut oil , castor oil , olive oil , grape seed oil , soybean oil - Animal Fats : Mink oil , emu oil , lanolin - Wax Esters : Lanolin , beeswax - Sterols : Cholesterol , ceramides Humectants are compounds that attract and bind water . Some of these substances , like urea , are endogenously present and make up part of the NMF . Humectants can hydrate the skin if the humidity is more than 70 % , but more commonly , they will draw water from the deeper epidermis and dermis . Without concomitant use of an occlusive moisturizer , some humectants can result in an increased transepidermal water loss and exacerbate skin dryness . Alpha-hydroxy acids ( AHAs ) are an important group of humectant molecules and have more recently focused on their use as moisturizing agents and cosmetics . AHAs include glycolic and lactic acids . These agents impact the water content of the stratum corneum by several mechanisms . They are effective humectants . They promote desquamation by reducing corneocyte cohesion and also improve the barrier function by increasing levels of ceramides . [ 3 ] [ 10 ] Lactic acid has been used topically at concentrations up to 12 % in the treatment of ichthyosis and dry skin for many years . [ 3 ] Urea is a component of NMF . The addition of urea to moisturizers helps with the absorption of water into the stratum corneum . It promotes the desquamation of corneocytes and increases penetration of other topically applied medications . [ 10 ] It also improves the skin 's barrier function and reduces TEWL . [ 3 ] Urea improves itching and is useful in the treatment of ichthyosis , disorders associated with hyperkeratosis , and atopic dermatitis . [ 8 ] Glycerin is another commonly used humectant and is present in many skincare products . In addition to attracting and binding water , it has demonstrated beneficial effects in barrier repair . [ 10 ] [ 3 ] Other humectants include honey , propylene glycol , sorbitol , and hyaluronic acid . An emulsifier is another classification of ingredients commonly found in moisturizers . It is a molecule that allows for two immiscible substances to exist as a single phase . The molecules are typically long carbon chains with a polar group . Commonly used emulsifiers are fatty acids , like stearic acid . [ 11 ] Formulations When a moisturizer contains humectants , the water content of the skin more rapidly increases , but as mentioned previously , this does not necessarily reduce trans- epidermal water loss . Similarly , when using an occlusive agent , the water content of the skin takes a long time to increase , as the water must be drawn from deeper levels of the skin before an improvement takes place . The term \u201c cream \u201d traditionally refers to a product containing more occlusive ingredients , whereas a \u201c lotion \u201d contains humectants primarily . [ 11 ] Modern moisturizers often contain both occlusives and humectants that contribute to efficacy . Understanding the physiology of the skin barrier and how a disease state or circumstance may contribute to dry skin , impaired barrier function , or flaking of the skin can help us choose the best ingredients for a patient . The specific balance and combination of ingredients will help achieve a variety of outcomes depending on the desire of the consumer . Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes Particularly in the management of chronic medical conditions , like atopic dermatitis , the liberal use of moisturizers is a fundamental component of treatment . [ 8 ] [ 12 ] The application of moisturizers can be time - intensive for patients and caregivers , and as a result , is often neglected . Having consistent discussions by all members of the care teams , including dermatologists , pediatricians , and nurses , is extremely important . Dry skin affects millions of people and can seriously affect the quality of life . The use of moisturizers is the simplest way to obtain symptom relief . Hence , nurses , pharmacists , and primary care providers should encourage patients to use moisturizers liberally . However , patients should be educated to select moisturizers that are free of fragrance ; the more chemicals in a moisturizer , the more likely it causes an allergic reaction . The consistent use of moisturizers in atopic dermatitis can reduce symptoms and frequency of disease flares . Numerous randomized controlled trials form the basis of this recommendation . The level and strength of evidence are IA . Physicians ( MDs , DOs , NPs , PAs ) need to include moisturizers in their prescribing and care instructions . Pharmacists can make recommendations on the most appropriate types of agents to the prescriber or nursing staff . Nursing will often be in charge of application in the inpatient setting and can assess the effectiveness of moisturizing therapy , or in the outpatient setting can determine compliance with the moisturizing regimen and report back to the interprofessional healthcare team on the success or failure of treatment . Moisturizing agents can be a part of the compounding process if the pharmacist needs to make a topical preparation to deliver medication , and the pharmacist should consult with the clinician on such matters on a case - by - case basis . As with any intervention , using moisturizers is most effective with an interprofessional team approach . [ Level V ] References - 1 . - Madison KC .

The Tigers destroyed the Yellow Jackets in the shadow of Samford Tower to the killer tune of 45 - 0 . However , there is a good chance the game was not decided , at least entirely , by Auburn 's superior grasp of Xs and Os but rather Tech 's curious lack of Zzzs . The buzz , as it were , was that the coach - less team from Georgia was hitting town by train in the wee , gameday morning hours .

Jay replied that the intelligence \" is unfortunately of such a Nature , or rather so circumstanced , as to render Secrecy necessary . \" Jay prevailed . Robert Townsend , an important American agent in British-occupied New York , used the guise of being a merchant , as did Silas Deane when he was sent to France by the Committee of Secret Correspondence . Townsend was usually referred to by his cover name of \" Culper , Junior . \" When Major ( later Colonel ) Benjamin Tallmadge , who directed Townsend 's espionage work , insisted that he disengage himself from his cover business to devote more time to intelligence gathering , General Washington overruled him : \" it is not my opinion that Culper Junior should be advised to give up his present employment . I would imagine that with a little industry he will be able to carry on his intelligence with greater security to himself and greater advantages to us , under the cover of his usual business . . .. it prevents also those suspicions which would become natural should he throw himself out of the line of his present employment . \" Townsend also was the silent partner of a coffee house frequented by British officers , an ideal place for hearing loose talk that was of value to the American cause . Major John Clark 's agents in and around British-controlled Philadelphia used several covers ( farmer , peddler , and smuggler , among others ) so effectively that only one or two operatives may have been detained . The agents traveled freely in and out of Philadelphia and passed intelligence to Washington about British troops , fortifications , and supplies , and of a planned surprise attack . Enoch Crosby , a counterintelligence officer , posed as an itinerant shoemaker ( his civilian trade ) to travel through southern New York while infiltrating Loyalist cells . After the Tories started to suspect him when he kept \" escaping \" from the Americans , Crosby 's superiors moved him to Albany , where he resumed his undercover espionage . John Honeyman , an Irish weaver who had offered to spy for the Americans , used several covers ( butcher , Tory , British agent ) to collect intelligence on British military activities in New Jersey . He participated in a deception operation that left the Hessians in Trenton unprepared for Washington 's attack across the Delaware River on December 26 , 1776 . In January 1778 , Nancy Morgan Hart , who naturally was tall , muscular , and cross -eyed , disguised herself as a \" touched \" or crazy man and entered Augusta , Georgia , to obtain intelligence on British defenses . Her mission was a success . Later , when a group of Tories attacked her home to gain revenge , she captured them all , and was witness to their execution . In June 1778 , General Washington instructed \" Light - Horse Harry \" Lee to send an agent into the British fort at Stony Point to gather intelligence on the exact size of the garrison and the progress it was making in building defenses . Captain Allan McLane took the assignment . Dressing himself as a country bumpkin , and utilizing the cover of escorting a Mrs. Smith into the fort to see her sons , McLane spent two weeks collecting intelligence within the British fort and returned safely . Photo : Nancy Morgan Hart capturing Tories attacking her home While serving in Paris as an agent of the Committee of Secret Correspondence , Silas Deane is known to have used a heat -developing invisible ink , compounded of cobalt chloride , glycerine and water , for some of his intelligence reports back to America . Even more useful to him later was a \" sympathetic stain \" created for secret communications by James Jay , a physician and the brother of John Jay . Dr. Jay , who had been knighted by George III , used the \" stain \" for reporting military information from London to America . Later he supplied quantities of the stain to George Washington at home and to Silas Deane in Paris . The stain required one chemical for writing the message and a second to develop it , affording greater security than the ink used by Deane earlier . Once , in a letter to John Jay , Robert Morris spoke of an innocuous letter from \" Timothy Jones \" ( Deane ) and the \" concealed beauties therein , \" noting \" the cursory examinations of a sea captain would never discover them , but transferred from his hand to the penetrating eye of a Jay , the diamonds stand confessed at once . \" Washington instructed his agents in the use of the \" sympathetic stain , \" noting in connection with \" Culper Junior \" that the ink \" will not only render his communications less exposed to detection , but relieve the fears of such persons as may be entrusted in its conveyance . \" Washington suggested that reports could be written in the invisible ink \" on the blank leaves of a pamphlet . . . a common pocket book , or on the blank leaves at each end of registers , almanacks , or any publication or book of small value . \" Washington especially recommended that agents conceal their reports by using the ink in correspondence : \" A much better way is to write a letter in the Tory stile with some mixture of family matters and between the lines and on the remaining part of the sheet communicate with the Stain the intended intelligence . \" Even though the Patriots took great care to write sensitive messages in invisible ink , or in code or cipher , it is estimated that the British intercepted and decrypted over half of America 's secret correspondence during the war . American Revolutionary leaders used various methods of cryptography to conceal diplomatic , military , and personal messages . John Jay and Arthur Lee devised dictionary codes in which numbers referred to the page and line in an agreed - upon dictionary edition where the plaintext ( unencrypted message ) could be found . In 1775 Charles Dumas designed the first diplomatic cipher that the Continental Congress and Benjamin Franklin used to communicate with agents and ministers in Europe . Dumas 's system substituted numbers for letters in the order in which they appeared in a preselected paragraph of French prose containing 682 symbols . This method was more secure than the standard alphanumeric substitution system , in which a through z are replaced with 1 through 26 , because each letter in the plain text could be replaced with more than one number . The Culper spy ring used a numerical substitution code developed by Major Benjamin Tallmadge , the network 's leader . The Ring began using the code after the British captured some papers indicating that some Americans around New York were using \" sympathetic stain . \" Tallmadge took several hundred words from a dictionary and several dozen names of people or places and assigned each a number from 1 to 763 . For example , 38 meant attack , 192 stood for fort , George Washington was identified as 711 , and New York was replaced by 727 . An American agent posing as a deliveryman transmitted the messages to other members of the ring . One of them , Anna Strong , signalled the messages ' location with a code involving laundry hung out to dry . A black petticoat indicated that a message was ready to be picked up , and the number of handkerchiefs identified the cove on Long Island Sound where the agents would meet . By the end of the war , several prominent Americans - among them Robert Morris , John Jay , Robert Livingston , and John Adams - were using other versions of numerical substitution codes . The Patriots had two notable successes in breaking British ciphers . In 1775 Elbridge Gerry and the team of Elisha Porter and the Rev. Samuel West , working separately at Washington 's direction , decrypted a letter that implicated Dr. Benjamin Church , the Continental Army 's chief surgeon , in espionage for the British . In 1781 James Lovell , who designed cipher systems used by several prominent Americans , determined the encryption method that British commanders used to communicate with each other . When a dispatch from Lord Cornwallis in Yorktown to General Henry Clinton in New York was intercepted , Lovell 's cryptanalysis enabled Washington to gauge how desperate Cornwallis 's situation was and to time his attack on the British lines . Soon after , another decrypt by Lovell provided warning to the French fleet off Yorktown that a British relief expedition was approaching . The French scared off the British flotilla , sealing victory for the Americans . The Continental Congress regularly received quantities of intercepted British and Tory mail . On November 20 , 1775 , it received some intercepted letters from Cork , Ireland , and appointed a committee made up of John Adams , Benjamin Franklin , Thomas Johnson , Robert Livingston , Edward Rutledge , James Wilson and George Wythe \" to select such parts of them as may be proper to publish . \" The Congress later ordered a thousand copies of the portions selected by the Committee to be printed and distributed . A month later , when another batch of intercepted mail was received , a second committee was appointed to examine it . Based on its report , the Congress resolved that \" the contents of the intercepted letters this day read , and the steps which Congress may take in consequence of said intelligence thereby given , be kept secret until further orders . \" By early 1776 , abuses were noted in the practice , and Congress resolved that only the councils or committees of safety of each colony , and their designees , could henceforth open the mail or detain any letters from the post . When Moses Harris reported that the British had recruited him as a courier for their Secret Service , General Washington proposed that General Schuyler \" contrive a means of opening them without breaking the seals , take copies of the contents , and then let them go on . By these means we should become masters of the whole plot . \" From that point on , Washington was privy to British intelligence pouches between New York and Canada . Dr. James Jay used the advanced technology of his time in creating the invaluable \" sympathetic stain \" used for secret communications . Perhaps the American patriots ' most advanced - if not successful - application of technology was in David Bushnell 's \" turtle , \" a one - man submarine created for affixing watchwork - timed explosive charges to the bottom of enemy ships . The \" turtle , \" now credited with being the first use of the submarine in warfare , was an oaken chamber about five - and - a- half feet wide and seven feet high . it was propelled by oars at a speed of about three miles an hour , had a barometer to read depth , a pump and second set of oars to raise or lower the submarine through the water , and provision for both lead and water ballast . When Bushnell learned that the candle used to illuminate instruments inside the \" turtle \" consumed the oxygen in its air supply , he turned to Benjamin Franklin for help . The solution : the phosphorescent weed , foxfire . Heavy tides thwarted the first sabotage operation . A copper-clad hull which could not be penetrated by the submarine 's auger foiled the second . ( The \" turtle \" did blow up a nearby schooner , however . ) The secret weapon would almost certainly have achieved success against a warship if it had not gone to the bottom of the Hudson River when the mother ship to which it was moored was sunk by the British in October of 1776 . An early device developed for concealing intelligence reports when traveling by water was a simple , weighted bottle that could be dropped overboard if there was a threat of capture . This was replaced by a wafer - thin leaden container in which a message was sealed . Not only would it sink in water , but it would melt and destroy its contents if thrown into a fire , and could be used by agents on land or water . It had one drawback - lead poisoning if it was swallowed ! It was replaced by a silver , bullet - shaped container that could be unscrewed to hold a message and which would not poison a courier who might be forced to swallow it . Drawing : The Silver Bullet Drawing : David Bushell 's \" Turtle \" On May 29 , 1776 , the Continental Congress received the first of many intelligence estimates prepared in response to questions it posed to military commanders . The report estimated the size of the enemy force to be encountered in an attack on New York , the number of Continental troops needed to meet it , and the kind of force needed to defend the other New England colonies . An example of George Washington 's interest in intelligence analysis and estimates can be found in instructions he wrote to General Putnam in August of 1777 : \" Deserters and people of that class always speak of number . . . indeed , scarce any person can form a judgement unless he sees the troops paraded and can count the divisions . But , if you can by any means obtain a list of the regiments left upon the island , we can compute the number of men within a few hundreds , over or under . \" On another occasion , in thanking James Lovell for a piece of intelligence , Washington wrote : \" it is by comparing a variety of information , we are frequently enabled to investigate facts , which were so intricate or hidden , that no single clue could have led to the knowledge of them . . . intelligence becomes interesting which but from its connection and collateral circumstances , would not be important . \" Washington 's intelligence chief for a short period in 1778 , Colonel David Henley , received these instructions when he wrote to Washington for guidance : \" Besides communicating your information as it arises . . . you might make out a table or something in the way of columns , under which you might range , their magazines of forage , grain and the like , the different corps and regiments , the Works , where thrown up , their connexion , kind and extent , the officers commanding , with the numbers of guns &ca . &ca . This table should comprehend in one view all that can be learned from deserters , spies and persons who may come out from the enemy 's boundaries . \" ( It was common practice to interrogate travelers from such British strongholds as New York , Boston and Philadelphia . )","annotations":[{"text":"1776","span":[395,398],"token_span":[68,68],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the Process continues."},{"text":"the Committee 's proceedings","span":[407,434],"token_span":[71,74],"role":"Process","label":"Process","role_definition":"A Process that is maintained by the Agent or Cause."},{"text":"under the injunction of secrecy","span":[518,548],"token_span":[92,96],"role":"State","label":"State","role_definition":"The State that is maintained by the Agent or Cause."},{"text":"The Continental Congress","span":[554,577],"token_span":[99,101],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The individual who causes the Process to continue or the State to be maintained."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"Since the Committee of Secret Correspondence put much of its efforts into gaining patriot sympathy abroad to be used during the American Revolution , they requested of the Continental Congress that the members and actions of the committee be kept confidential , so that Great Britain would not hear about the United States forging foreign alliances for the looming revolution .","annotations":[{"text":"the Continental Congress","span":[168,191],"token_span":[27,29],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The individual who causes the Process to continue or the State to be maintained."},{"text":"confidential","span":[247,258],"token_span":[40,40],"role":"State","label":"State","role_definition":"The State that is maintained by the Agent or Cause."},{"text":"during the American Revolution","span":[117,146],"token_span":[19,22],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the Process continues."}],"trigger":{"text":"kept","start_char":242,"end_char":245,"start_token":39,"end_token":39,"frame":"Cause_to_continue"}},"source":{"text":"The Committee of Secret Correspondence insisted that matters pertaining to the funding and instruction of intelligence agents be held within the Committee .

In January 1778 , Nancy Morgan Hart , who naturally was tall , muscular , and cross -eyed , disguised herself as a \" touched \" or crazy man and entered Augusta , Georgia , to obtain intelligence on British defenses . Her mission was a success . Later , when a group of Tories attacked her home to gain revenge , she captured them all , and was witness to their execution . In June 1778 , General Washington instructed \" Light - Horse Harry \" Lee to send an agent into the British fort at Stony Point to gather intelligence on the exact size of the garrison and the progress it was making in building defenses . Captain Allan McLane took the assignment . Dressing himself as a country bumpkin , and utilizing the cover of escorting a Mrs. Smith into the fort to see her sons , McLane spent two weeks collecting intelligence within the British fort and returned safely . Photo : Nancy Morgan Hart capturing Tories attacking her home While serving in Paris as an agent of the Committee of Secret Correspondence , Silas Deane is known to have used a heat -developing invisible ink , compounded of cobalt chloride , glycerine and water , for some of his intelligence reports back to America . Even more useful to him later was a \" sympathetic stain \" created for secret communications by James Jay , a physician and the brother of John Jay . Dr. Jay , who had been knighted by George III , used the \" stain \" for reporting military information from London to America . Later he supplied quantities of the stain to George Washington at home and to Silas Deane in Paris . The stain required one chemical for writing the message and a second to develop it , affording greater security than the ink used by Deane earlier . Once , in a letter to John Jay , Robert Morris spoke of an innocuous letter from \" Timothy Jones \" ( Deane ) and the \" concealed beauties therein , \" noting \" the cursory examinations of a sea captain would never discover them , but transferred from his hand to the penetrating eye of a Jay , the diamonds stand confessed at once . \" Washington instructed his agents in the use of the \" sympathetic stain , \" noting in connection with \" Culper Junior \" that the ink \" will not only render his communications less exposed to detection , but relieve the fears of such persons as may be entrusted in its conveyance . \" Washington suggested that reports could be written in the invisible ink \" on the blank leaves of a pamphlet . . . a common pocket book , or on the blank leaves at each end of registers , almanacks , or any publication or book of small value . \" Washington especially recommended that agents conceal their reports by using the ink in correspondence : \" A much better way is to write a letter in the Tory stile with some mixture of family matters and between the lines and on the remaining part of the sheet communicate with the Stain the intended intelligence . \" Even though the Patriots took great care to write sensitive messages in invisible ink , or in code or cipher , it is estimated that the British intercepted and decrypted over half of America 's secret correspondence during the war . American Revolutionary leaders used various methods of cryptography to conceal diplomatic , military , and personal messages . John Jay and Arthur Lee devised dictionary codes in which numbers referred to the page and line in an agreed - upon dictionary edition where the plaintext ( unencrypted message ) could be found . In 1775 Charles Dumas designed the first diplomatic cipher that the Continental Congress and Benjamin Franklin used to communicate with agents and ministers in Europe . Dumas 's system substituted numbers for letters in the order in which they appeared in a preselected paragraph of French prose containing 682 symbols . This method was more secure than the standard alphanumeric substitution system , in which a through z are replaced with 1 through 26 , because each letter in the plain text could be replaced with more than one number . The Culper spy ring used a numerical substitution code developed by Major Benjamin Tallmadge , the network 's leader . The Ring began using the code after the British captured some papers indicating that some Americans around New York were using \" sympathetic stain . \" Tallmadge took several hundred words from a dictionary and several dozen names of people or places and assigned each a number from 1 to 763 . For example , 38 meant attack , 192 stood for fort , George Washington was identified as 711 , and New York was replaced by 727 . An American agent posing as a deliveryman transmitted the messages to other members of the ring . One of them , Anna Strong , signalled the messages ' location with a code involving laundry hung out to dry . A black petticoat indicated that a message was ready to be picked up , and the number of handkerchiefs identified the cove on Long Island Sound where the agents would meet . By the end of the war , several prominent Americans - among them Robert Morris , John Jay , Robert Livingston , and John Adams - were using other versions of numerical substitution codes . The Patriots had two notable successes in breaking British ciphers . In 1775 Elbridge Gerry and the team of Elisha Porter and the Rev. Samuel West , working separately at Washington 's direction , decrypted a letter that implicated Dr. Benjamin Church , the Continental Army 's chief surgeon , in espionage for the British . In 1781 James Lovell , who designed cipher systems used by several prominent Americans , determined the encryption method that British commanders used to communicate with each other . When a dispatch from Lord Cornwallis in Yorktown to General Henry Clinton in New York was intercepted , Lovell 's cryptanalysis enabled Washington to gauge how desperate Cornwallis 's situation was and to time his attack on the British lines . Soon after , another decrypt by Lovell provided warning to the French fleet off Yorktown that a British relief expedition was approaching . The French scared off the British flotilla , sealing victory for the Americans . The Continental Congress regularly received quantities of intercepted British and Tory mail . On November 20 , 1775 , it received some intercepted letters from Cork , Ireland , and appointed a committee made up of John Adams , Benjamin Franklin , Thomas Johnson , Robert Livingston , Edward Rutledge , James Wilson and George Wythe \" to select such parts of them as may be proper to publish . \" The Congress later ordered a thousand copies of the portions selected by the Committee to be printed and distributed . A month later , when another batch of intercepted mail was received , a second committee was appointed to examine it . Based on its report , the Congress resolved that \" the contents of the intercepted letters this day read , and the steps which Congress may take in consequence of said intelligence thereby given , be kept secret until further orders . \" By early 1776 , abuses were noted in the practice , and Congress resolved that only the councils or committees of safety of each colony , and their designees , could henceforth open the mail or detain any letters from the post . When Moses Harris reported that the British had recruited him as a courier for their Secret Service , General Washington proposed that General Schuyler \" contrive a means of opening them without breaking the seals , take copies of the contents , and then let them go on . By these means we should become masters of the whole plot . \" From that point on , Washington was privy to British intelligence pouches between New York and Canada . Dr. James Jay used the advanced technology of his time in creating the invaluable \" sympathetic stain \" used for secret communications . Perhaps the American patriots ' most advanced - if not successful - application of technology was in David Bushnell 's \" turtle , \" a one - man submarine created for affixing watchwork - timed explosive charges to the bottom of enemy ships . The \" turtle , \" now credited with being the first use of the submarine in warfare , was an oaken chamber about five - and - a- half feet wide and seven feet high . it was propelled by oars at a speed of about three miles an hour , had a barometer to read depth , a pump and second set of oars to raise or lower the submarine through the water , and provision for both lead and water ballast . When Bushnell learned that the candle used to illuminate instruments inside the \" turtle \" consumed the oxygen in its air supply , he turned to Benjamin Franklin for help . The solution : the phosphorescent weed , foxfire . Heavy tides thwarted the first sabotage operation . A copper-clad hull which could not be penetrated by the submarine 's auger foiled the second . ( The \" turtle \" did blow up a nearby schooner , however . ) The secret weapon would almost certainly have achieved success against a warship if it had not gone to the bottom of the Hudson River when the mother ship to which it was moored was sunk by the British in October of 1776 . An early device developed for concealing intelligence reports when traveling by water was a simple , weighted bottle that could be dropped overboard if there was a threat of capture . This was replaced by a wafer - thin leaden container in which a message was sealed . Not only would it sink in water , but it would melt and destroy its contents if thrown into a fire , and could be used by agents on land or water . It had one drawback - lead poisoning if it was swallowed ! It was replaced by a silver , bullet - shaped container that could be unscrewed to hold a message and which would not poison a courier who might be forced to swallow it . Drawing : The Silver Bullet Drawing : David Bushell 's \" Turtle \" On May 29 , 1776 , the Continental Congress received the first of many intelligence estimates prepared in response to questions it posed to military commanders . The report estimated the size of the enemy force to be encountered in an attack on New York , the number of Continental troops needed to meet it , and the kind of force needed to defend the other New England colonies . An example of George Washington 's interest in intelligence analysis and estimates can be found in instructions he wrote to General Putnam in August of 1777 : \" Deserters and people of that class always speak of number . . . indeed , scarce any person can form a judgement unless he sees the troops paraded and can count the divisions . But , if you can by any means obtain a list of the regiments left upon the island , we can compute the number of men within a few hundreds , over or under . \" On another occasion , in thanking James Lovell for a piece of intelligence , Washington wrote : \" it is by comparing a variety of information , we are frequently enabled to investigate facts , which were so intricate or hidden , that no single clue could have led to the knowledge of them . . . intelligence becomes interesting which but from its connection and collateral circumstances , would not be important . \" Washington 's intelligence chief for a short period in 1778 , Colonel David Henley , received these instructions when he wrote to Washington for guidance : \" Besides communicating your information as it arises . . . you might make out a table or something in the way of columns , under which you might range , their magazines of forage , grain and the like , the different corps and regiments , the Works , where thrown up , their connexion , kind and extent , the officers commanding , with the numbers of guns &ca . &ca . This table should comprehend in one view all that can be learned from deserters , spies and persons who may come out from the enemy 's boundaries . \" ( It was common practice to interrogate travelers from such British strongholds as New York , Boston and Philadelphia . )","annotations":[{"text":"The Continental Congress","span":[554,577],"token_span":[99,101],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The individual who causes the Process to continue or the State to be maintained."},{"text":"under the injunction of secrecy","span":[518,548],"token_span":[92,96],"role":"State","label":"State","role_definition":"The State that is maintained by the Agent or Cause."},{"text":"1776","span":[395,398],"token_span":[68,68],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the Process continues."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-2474-421-frame-Cause_to_continue","frame":"Cause_to_continue","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Agent or Cause causes a Process or State to continue.

I would argue that there is a conceptual problem in ascribing the term revisionist to describe the respective foreign policy goals to international actors , such as Napoleonic France , modern Iran , and Fidel Castro 's Cuba . Revisionist , after all , derives from the verb to revise , i.e. to change , to modify , which does not exactly reflect the intentions behind the territorially expansionist and politically hegemonic policies of either power or , indeed , of any other so called revisionist power in modern history . In this respect , the term revolutionary , employed by Henry Kissinger and a few other scholars , seems to be a more accurate description . The revolutionaries behind the French Revolution of 1789 tried to export its ideas to other parts of Europe , both through the pen and the gun . Napoleon 's France expanded much further , destroying the classical balance of power that had existed for most of the 18th century . The multi-polar international system that had characterized the pre-Napoleonic period was replaced by a system dominated by one major power wishing to impose its will on all the other actors within it . The foreign policy goals of Napoleon 's France could hardly be described as revisionist . This was a revolutionary power intent on destroying the existing international system . The same concept applies to sub-systems of the international system . Thus , in a sub-system like the Middle East , the current Iranian regime can be said to have revolutionary foreign policy goals , leading it to seek major changes in the region , including the destruction of Israel as a sovereign state . The Islamic Republic of Iran cannot be described as a revisionist power . That would hardly reflect the dimensions of its regional objectives or the means it is willing to employ in order to bring them about . Fidel Castro 's Cuba was likewise a revolutionary actor in the region , hoping to advance the cause of Marxism in its diverse radical forms both in Central and South America and beyond , as in Angola and Mozambique . Taking into account the scope and magnitude of the change resulting from accomplishing its goals , Castro 's government cannot be considered revisionist . His efforts to intervene in Angola and Mozambique in the 1970s to help the Marxist guerrilla , in addition to similar efforts undertaken throughout Latin America , make Castro 's Cuba a revolutionary actor in the international system . Moreover , sovereign states are not the only revolutionary actors . Organizations such as Al Qaeda and its various affiliates are revolutionary in nature because they seek to overthrow the existing international system and its underlying norms . In the context of sub-systems , organizations such as Hezbollah in the Middle East can also be described as revolutionary . It simply does not make sense to define an organization such as Al Qaeda as revisionist or to claim that Hezbollah merely wishes to revise the prevailing order in the region as it calls for the destruction of Israel and the advancement of Iran 's regional ambitions . What matters in this regard is not necessarily the ability of these organizations to implement all their objectives , but rather their intention and willingness to do so . The same determination applies to sovereign states . Revolutionary actors are not monolithic , nor are status quo actors necessarily static in shaping the political system . Some of the first may be more revolutionary in intention than others and some of the latter may be more satisfied with the existing international or sub-system than others . For instance , a status quo power like the United States was less satisfied with the prevailing status quo under president George W. Bush than it was under the presidency of his father George H.W. Bush . Following the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11 , 2001 , President Bush and his administration shaped a strategy aimed at changing the status quo , both by toppling the Taliban in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein 's regime in Iraq , and by promoting democracy in the Middle East . The aim was not to destroy the prevailing international order , but to change some aspects of it . Thus , although he started his presidency by enunciating that his Administration would not intervene internationally as the Clinton Administration had done , due to 9/11 he altered his policy and transformed the United States , in a sense , into a revisionist power . Considering the previous points , the term revisionist does not reflect the true nature of the actors to which the term is usually applied . Conceptually a revisionist state or organization may be a status quo actor wishing to introduce some changes in an otherwise acceptable order . An international actor wishing to change substantially , let alone completely destroy , the existing international system cannot be said to be revisionist . There is a conceptual problem entailed in referring to such an international actor as revisionist , as its aim is not merely to revise the prevailing international order , but to overthrow it .

In the context of sub-systems , organizations such as Hezbollah in the Middle East can also be described as revolutionary . It simply does not make sense to define an organization such as Al Qaeda as revisionist or to claim that Hezbollah merely wishes to revise the prevailing order in the region as it calls for the destruction of Israel and the advancement of Iran 's regional ambitions . What matters in this regard is not necessarily the ability of these organizations to implement all their objectives , but rather their intention and willingness to do so . The same determination applies to sovereign states . Revolutionary actors are not monolithic , nor are status quo actors necessarily static in shaping the political system . Some of the first may be more revolutionary in intention than others and some of the latter may be more satisfied with the existing international or sub-system than others . For instance , a status quo power like the United States was less satisfied with the prevailing status quo under president George W. Bush than it was under the presidency of his father George H.W. Bush . Following the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11 , 2001 , President Bush and his administration shaped a strategy aimed at changing the status quo , both by toppling the Taliban in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein 's regime in Iraq , and by promoting democracy in the Middle East . The aim was not to destroy the prevailing international order , but to change some aspects of it . Thus , although he started his presidency by enunciating that his Administration would not intervene internationally as the Clinton Administration had done , due to 9/11 he altered his policy and transformed the United States , in a sense , into a revisionist power . Considering the previous points , the term revisionist does not reflect the true nature of the actors to which the term is usually applied . Conceptually a revisionist state or organization may be a status quo actor wishing to introduce some changes in an otherwise acceptable order . An international actor wishing to change substantially , let alone completely destroy , the existing international system cannot be said to be revisionist . There is a conceptual problem entailed in referring to such an international actor as revisionist , as its aim is not merely to revise the prevailing international order , but to overthrow it .

It was worth watching to see how much sweat he could hold on his top lip , while every hair stayed in place . Matthew had his session of mental torture all sewn up . He got Steve to believe he had killed Saskia 's sister and set his ex-boss up for the murder . After sticky - taping Steve to his seat , he took him on a mental journey to hell and back . With the whites of his eyes showing , he let Steve know he was teetering on the brink of insanity . Meanwhile , Steve was trussed up like a chicken . The club owner believed Matthew 's act , but we needed a lot more convincing . Matthew was being far too poetic to be scary . In one cringe - worthy moment , Steve asked him if their friendship meant nothing to him . Matthew hissed : \" It meant everything . \" And with a nod to Byron , he added : \" Something in me died that night because of you . What you did changed everything forever . \" Too right - it gave actor Joe Absolom a storyline from which there was no return . No wonder the young star preferred to take the exit door after all that . Finally , Matthew emptied a petrol can and pulled out a lighter , just as Jackie and Teresa walked in . The twist was that the can was filled with water - and the door had never been locked . Perhaps now everything can get back to normal on Albert Square - with less snot and more plot . | Printer friendly Cite / link Email Feedback | | Title Annotation : || Features | | Author : || Morgan , Kathleen | | Publication : || Daily Record ( Glasgow , Scotland ) | | Date : || Feb 4 , 2000 | | Words : | |349 | | Previous Article : || PICK OF THE BOX ; Ardal goes from zero to hero . | | Next Article : || Letters Page : VOICE OF SCOTLAND ; Terror student insult to Scots . |","annotations":[{"text":"Matthew","span":[114,120],"token_span":[26,26],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent is an External Argument of the target word and purposefully arouses an emotional state."},{"text":"Steve","span":[154,158],"token_span":[32,32],"role":"Experiencer","label":"Experiencer","role_definition":"The Experiencer is the person the Agent causes to have a particular emotional state."},{"text":"E20","span":[400,402],"token_span":[81,81],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the Agent affects the Experiencer"},{"text":"the nightclub where Saskia had died a year ago","span":[406,451],"token_span":[83,91],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the Agent affects the Experiencer"}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-3042-232-frame-Cause_to_experience","frame":"Cause_to_experience","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Agent intentionally seeks to bring about an internal mental or emotional state in the Experiencer.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Silas then tries to scare Lynsey off with a menacing warning .

NIOSH found that such exposures could be reduced by using a water - spray attachment . This low-flow , water - spray control suppressed and reduced dust exposures by 70 % \u201390 % . [ 1 ] The Jackhammer without Engineering Controls video shows a worker breaking concrete with a jackhammer without any dust controls . The bar on the right shows the worker 's respirable dust exposure , which is elevated . The units are milligrams of dust per cubic meter of air . Download the Jackhammer without Engineering Controls videomedia icon NIOSH is not aware at this time of off - the -shelf , commercially available retrofit kits or jackhammers that come with built - in water - spray units . However , it is relatively simple to build a water - spray control for a jackhammer using the diagram below and the parts and instructions in Workplace Solution 2008 - 127 ( Spanish Version ) . Plans for a simplified version are also available from a NIOSH partnerpdf iconexternal icon . The spray angle ( the angle included between the sides of the cone formed by the water discharged by the nozzle ) and the spray pattern are two critical design parameters required to match the performance of the tested device . The device tested used a solid - cone nozzle with an 80 - degree spray angle . The third critical design parameter is the water flow rate . This spray used 350 milliliters ( 11.8 ounces ) of water per minute for dust control . Higher water flow rates may not greatly improve dust control . Lower flow rates may not be as effective . This Jackhammer with Engineering Controls video shows the same worker using a jackhammer with a water spray control attached . The bar on the right shows that the worker 's respirable dust exposure is much lower when the water spray is used .

NIOSH found that such exposures could be reduced by using a water - spray attachment . This low-flow , water - spray control suppressed and reduced dust exposures by 70 % \u201390 % . [ 1 ] The Jackhammer without Engineering Controls video shows a worker breaking concrete with a jackhammer without any dust controls . The bar on the right shows the worker 's respirable dust exposure , which is elevated . The units are milligrams of dust per cubic meter of air . Download the Jackhammer without Engineering Controls videomedia icon NIOSH is not aware at this time of off - the -shelf , commercially available retrofit kits or jackhammers that come with built - in water - spray units . However , it is relatively simple to build a water - spray control for a jackhammer using the diagram below and the parts and instructions in Workplace Solution 2008 - 127 ( Spanish Version ) . Plans for a simplified version are also available from a NIOSH partnerpdf iconexternal icon . The spray angle ( the angle included between the sides of the cone formed by the water discharged by the nozzle ) and the spray pattern are two critical design parameters required to match the performance of the tested device . The device tested used a solid - cone nozzle with an 80 - degree spray angle . The third critical design parameter is the water flow rate . This spray used 350 milliliters ( 11.8 ounces ) of water per minute for dust control . Higher water flow rates may not greatly improve dust control . Lower flow rates may not be as effective . This Jackhammer with Engineering Controls video shows the same worker using a jackhammer with a water spray control attached . The bar on the right shows that the worker 's respirable dust exposure is much lower when the water spray is used .

THE GLASSHARMONICA by Thomas Bloch Translation to English by Michelle Vadon Glasses filled with more or less water so as to alter the pitch of the sounds obtained by striking them with sticks were already used by the Persians , the Chinese ( Shui Chan ) , the Japanese and the Arabs ( the Tusut was mentioned in 1406 ) . But the technique took a decisive turn in 1743 when an Irishman , Richard Puckeridge , had the bright idea of rubbing with wet fingers the glasses standing on the table , Benjamin Franklin saw for the first time that instrument , also played by Gluck , the composer , at a concert given by the English virtuoso Delaval . It was called angelic organ , then musical glasses or seraphim . B. Franklin , fascinated by the \" soft and pure sound of the musical glasses \" , modified them so as to increase their possibilities . In a letter to Pr Beccaria , of Torino , in 1762 , be explained how he had improved them . He called the new instrument glassharmonica because of its harmonious sounds . He had glasses of different diameters blown , each corresponding to a note , instead of filling glasses with water . When the bowls are chromatically fitted into one another , but not in contact , with a horizontal rod - whose rotation is controlled by a pedal - going through their centers , complex chords can be played and virtuosity is increased . A number of instruments derived from the glassharmonica have been built since that time : the melodion , the eumelia , the clavicylindre , the transpornierharmonica , the sticcardo pastorate , the spirafina , the parnasse instrument , the glassharfe , Tobias Schmidt piano harmonica ( he also built the first guillotine ) , the uranion , the hydrodaktulopsychicharmonica and others . The glassharmonica was very popular from the start . 400 works were composed for it , some unfortunately now lost , and probably about 4000 instruments were built in 70 years . The instrument , adored or hated , roused passion . Paganini said \" such a celestial voice \" , Thomas Jefferson claimed it was \" the greatest gift offered to the musical world of this century \" , Goethe , Mozart , Jean - Paul , Hasse , Theophile Gautier praised it . A dictionary of instruments mentions that the sounds ' are of nearly celestial softness but can cause spasms \" , In a Treaty on the Effects of Music on the Human Body by J.M. Roger , 1803 , we can read that \" its melancholy tone plunges you into dejection ( ) to a point the strongest man could not hear it for an hour without fainting \" . True , some interpreters ended their lives in mental hospitals , among them one of the best , Marianne Davies . In his Method to Teach Yourself Armonica ( 1788 ) , J.C. Miller retorts - \" It is true that the Armonica has strange effects on people . If you are irritated or disturbed by bad news , by friends or even by a disappointing lady , abstain from playing , it would only increase your disturbance \" . The Armonica was accused of causing evils such as nervous disorder , domestic squabbles , premature deliveries , fatal disorders , animal 's convulsions . The instrument was even banned from a German town by police decision for ruining the health of people and disturbing public order ( a child died during a concert ) . Franz Anton Mesmer , a Vienna doctor known for his experiments ( Mesmerism ) and for using hypnosis to treat his clients , would condition them by playing the glassharmonica for them . He was expelled from Vienna after a blind pianist , Marie Paradies , recovered sight but to the detriment of her mental health . Spread by rumor , this contributed to the death of the Armonica considered in 1829 as \" the fashionable accessory of parlors and sitting - rooms \" . Although Rollig tried to associate a keyboard with it in order to avoid the possible danger caused by rubbing your fingers against the glasses , few later composers were interested in the instrument . The increasing intensity of the sound of orchestras deterred musicians from using a fragile instrument with such a delicate sound . Yet , there were two outstanding exceptions : Lucia di Lammermoor by Donizetti in 1835 ( the Mad Scene ! ... ) in which the glassharmonica was soon replaced by two flutes ( the part recorded here is the original version crossed out on the manuscript ) and Die Frau ohne Schatten by Richard Strauss ( 1914 - 1917 ) . Thanks to a German interpreter , Bruno Hoffmann - who did not play a glassharmonica but a glasharfe ( glasses standing on a table ) - and also thanks to a German born master glass - blower , Gerhard Finkenbeiner who has settled near Boston ( USA ) , a new generation of interpreters ( still very few of them ) , of composers and of instrument makers have re-discovered the glassharmonica since 1982 . To build a glassharmonica , G. Finkenbeiner now uses quartz - the purest glass - in the shape of a long cylinder , heated to 3100 ' F and blown out into a special shape , which is then cut in half , so as to get two bowls . In the 18th century , 40 % lead glass was used , The bowls were worn and tuned with an emery grind wheel . As the depth of a bowl decreases , the pitch becomes higher . Sometimes , the seven colors of the rainbow were used to symbolize the seven diatonic degrees , black figuring the inflected notes . G. Finkenbeiner uses transparent glass - and gold for the brims of the bowls corresponding to the black keys of a keyboard , as Rollig did in the 18th century . Glassharmonicas belong to the family of autophone rubbed instruments . The glasses start vibrating according to a relaxation principle : when a finger rubs a bowl , it alternately catches and releases . This creates a series of impulses which set the bowl into vibration . The phenomenon is complex , so the master glass - blower must be very gifted to give the instrument its personality . A number of parameters can play a part , modify the tone , the mode and the harmonic composition of the bowls . Thus , two bowl , . ; giving the same note will have different tones according to the materials used , to their shapes , their thicknesses , their dimensions , their hidden defects . It is said that sounds and noises are closely related to each period of time . It would be interesting to know what has caused the renewal of the glassharmonica at the end of the 20th century and the passion it has aroused - maybe simply the new demands of both music specialists and interpreters in quest for authenticity . ... as Lucia said : \" Un ' armonia celeste , di ' , non ascolti ? \" ( \" Ca n't you hear a celestial harmony ? \" ) Thomas Bloch","annotations":[{"text":"1743","span":[696,699],"token_span":[123,123],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the noise is produced."},{"text":"an Irishman , Richard Puckeridge","span":[706,737],"token_span":[125,129],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The individual that manipulates a Sound_maker so that it makes Noise."},{"text":"rubbing with wet fingers the glasses standing on the table","span":[764,821],"token_span":[136,145],"role":"Cause","label":"Cause","role_definition":"The inanimate force of nature that causes the Sound_maker to produce noise."},{"text":"angelic organ","span":[989,1001],"token_span":[178,179],"role":"Sound_maker","label":"Sound_maker","role_definition":"The entity that produces the Noise, as a result of the action of the Agent."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"The Irish musician Richard Pockrich is typically credited as the first to play an instrument composed of glass vessels ( glass harp ) by rubbing his fingers around the rims .","annotations":[{"text":"The Irish musician Richard Pockrich","span":[0,34],"token_span":[0,4],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The individual that manipulates a Sound_maker so that it makes Noise."},{"text":"an instrument composed of glass vessels ( glass harp )","span":[79,132],"token_span":[13,22],"role":"Sound_maker","label":"Sound_maker","role_definition":"The entity that produces the Noise, as a result of the action of the Agent."},{"text":"by rubbing his fingers around the rims","span":[134,171],"token_span":[23,29],"role":"Cause","label":"Cause","role_definition":"The inanimate force of nature that causes the Sound_maker to produce noise."}],"trigger":{"text":"play","start_char":74,"end_char":77,"start_token":12,"end_token":12,"frame":"Cause_to_make_noise"}},"source":{"text":"HOME PRODUCTS GLASS REPAIR GLASS PROPERTIES CONTACT US GLASS HARMONICA GALLERY ABOUT US Media Coverage GFI RECESS DATES ORDERING INFORMATION ANATOMICAL MODELS .........

Some of them had studied drumming with Civil War veterans , whom they referred to as The Ancients . The N.A.R.D. was formed to enhance , preserve and disseminate what in their minds was an endangered style of drumming . They combined Gardiner Strube 's 25 lessons , added the long roll and perhaps for the first time in history , unambiguously declared each heretofore lesson , pattern , beat , or principle , a Rudiment . They called the first 13 rudiments \u201c Essential \u201d . These were used to test applicants seeking membership in the Thirteen Club . Another list of snare drum rudiments was compiled in 2008 by a group of drummers from the Percussive Arts Society ( P.A.S. ) Marching Percussion Committee .

Their answers ranged in number from 1 to 11 , and one person replied , \u201c Is this a trick question ? \u201d If no agreement exists among some of the best drummers in North America about the number of strokes needed to play a snare drum , might not arguments about Ruffs and Drags be considered akin to bickering ? Today , within the ranks of Fife and Drum corps drummers , the Ruff 's proud name , it 's romantic evocation of history and onomatopoetic pedigree survive , but outside that cozy womb of nostalgia , in the brittle , frenetic world of Kevlar heads and carpal tunnel syndromes , the Ruff is only a memory , if that .

The new model arrives at Chevrolet dealerships in January 2016 .

Chevrolet is the first brand globally to introduce Apple CarPlay 's Siri Eyes Free functionality . Similarly , Apple CarPlay puts select i Phone features on the vehicle 's display , allowing drivers to make calls , send and receive messages , and select music from the touchscreen or by Siri voice command . Apple CarPlay-supported apps include Phone , Messages , Maps , Music and compatible third - party apps . A full list of apps and market availability can be found at Apple.com / ios / carplay . Apple CarPlay requires an i Phone 5 or later model . \u201c Smartphones are essential for most of us , and customers are demanding better integration between phones and their vehicles , \u201d Devereux said . \u201c Chevrolet is committed to providing the smartest , simplest connected driving experience possible , and Captiva is one of the first global models to offer this capability . \u201d 2016 Captiva users can connect their smartphone to MyLink via USB , which enables phone recharging . If the user has a compatible i Phone with Apple CarPlay , the system will launch automatically , projecting familiar icons of the phone 's contacts , media and selected apps on MyLink 's newly enhanced 7 - inch capacitive touchscreen . \u201c By allowing MyLink to use Apple 's familiar operating systems and app icons , the Captiva owner can plug and play , using the system immediately without having to learn anything new , \u201d said Seungwon Park , MyLink program engineer at GM Korea . By using voice commands through Siri Eyes Free , users can safely make and receive hands - free phone calls and respond to text messages . New Captiva owners can use the same functions to access and play music stored on their phone or \u201c in the cloud . \u201d Preventing accidents in real time While MyLink 's voice command capability speaks to Chevrolet 's commitment to safety , the 2016 Captiva takes accident prevention to yet another level with the introduction of Side Blind Zone Alert and Rear Cross Traffic Alert . These active safety features use radar sensors located in the rear bumper to monitor the vehicle 's side blind spots , help drivers maneuver when backing up or changing lanes , and potentially avoid accidents . Research shows 90 percent of crashes are caused by human error , and radar - based crash - avoidance systems like those on the Captiva offer more accuracy than the ultrasonic sensors used on competitor models , and perform better at varying speeds . \u201c Midsize SUV owners are often young parents or planning to have children , so safety is top of mind for them , \u201d Devereux said . \u201c With the 2016 Captiva , they can focus on the road ahead while the vehicle 's active safety features control the sides and back of the car . \u201d Side Blind Zone Alert is a lane - changing aid that helps drivers avoid potential collisions by helping to identify other vehicles in blind spots while moving forward or standing still . When a vehicle is detected in a blind spot , an amber symbol in the outside rearview mirror on that side of the vehicle illuminates solid and non-blinking . If the driver activates the turn signal to indicate a lane change while another vehicle is in that blind zone , the symbol will flash in the mirror to further warn the driver of a potential hazard . Rear Cross Traffic Alert is designed to provide enhanced customer visibility . It works in conjunction with the rear camera system to detect oncoming traffic when backing up in a parking spot . If oncoming traffic or something like a child on a bike is detected , the direction of the approaching hazard is highlighted with a red triangle on the RVC screen . An audible alert also sounds from the speakers on that side of the vehicle . \u201c Both of these features have been proven to be effective at preventing accidents , and we encourage drivers to use them wisely , \u201d said Byungsoo Lee , Captiva chief engineer at GM Korea . \u201c While we highly encourage leaving these features on all of the time , we 've made it possible for the driver to turn them off if conditions warrant \u2013 such as in a slow - moving traffic jam \u2013 because we do n't want the driver to be annoyed by too many alerts . \u201d The Captiva 's rear camera is activated when reverse gear is selected . The area immediately behind the vehicle is shown on the on- board 7 - inch touchscreen color display . Automatically adjusting gridlines show the vehicle 's potential coverage area , allowing the driver to judge if the chosen space is big enough for the Captiva . The projected coverage area changes its orientation according to steering inputs . In addition to convenience , the reverse camera enhances safety , especially since it is impossible to see directly behind the vehicle from the driver 's seat . The Captiva 's active and passive stability and safety features also include ESC ( Electronic Stability Control ) that features ABS ( Anti-lock Braking System ) , TCS ( Traction Control System ) , ARP ( Active Rollover Protection ) , EBD ( Electronic Brake -force Distribution ) and HBA ( Hydraulic Brake Assist ) . Additionally , the Captiva features Hill Start Assist , which prevents the vehicle from rolling backward when the brakes are released on a slope , and Hill Descent Control , which works with ABS and EBD to maintain a constant low speed when descending steep and slippery slopes , maximizing traction and steering control . The Captiva has dual front and curtain air bags , and dual pre-tensioner seatbelts . Upgraded , modernized design and improved usability As one of Chevrolet 's most popular and established models , the Captiva offered a challenge for designers : creating something unique for the 2016 Captiva that would separate the Captiva from its competitors yet maintain the model 's signature \u201c SUV - esque \u201d exterior . One of the most noticeable changes is the treatment to the front end , particularly the headlamps , which are more compact and come integrated with daytime running lights . The other major redesign is on the front grille , with the Chevrolet bowtie repositioned on the upper section of the redesigned signature dual - port grille . The overall treatment has given the Captiva a refreshed , high - tech and contemporary feel . More important , this brings the Captiva 's design in line with Chevrolet 's current global design direction , enhancing the model 's relevance among the brand 's product portfolio . Likewise , the rear fascia is updated with integrated , stylized chrome exhaust tips and LED taillamps for a sportier , more up - to-date appearance . According to Wonsuk Park , design director at GM Korea , the fact that the Captiva 's architecture is bespoke , and not based on any existing passenger - car architecture , already sets it apart from its competitors . \u201c If you look at SUVs , most of them are built to be more like a car , with a crossover feel . The Captiva is on the opposite end of this spectrum . It is a dedicated SUV built to look like an SUV , but with modern amenities , high technology and the luxury of sedans , \u201d he said . \u201c The Captiva has more ground clearance , bigger wheel openings and large 19 - inch wheels , placing it not just on the SUV end of the crossover spectrum but at quite a premium one too . Yet it remains one of the best-handling SUVs in the market today , \u201d Wonsuk Park added . \u201c Apart from the redesigned front end , we also played with the exterior such as using black moulding to provide a more robust look , while using painted or color-coordinated moulding to make the vehicle look more upscale . In short , the facelift did not detract , but accentuates , the Captiva as a proper , urban SUV . \u201d The new Captiva will be available in three exterior colors , including the new Sun of a Gun Gray Metallic , Old Blue Eyes Metallic and Burnt Coconut Metallic . The LTZ will have integrated stainless steel side steps and new five - spoke , two -tone , machine - faced , 19 - inch wheels for a more luxurious , sporty appearance . Improvements have also been made inside the Captiva . In addition to the major upgrade of the vehicle 's connectivity package , the interior is more contemporary and up to date with current trends . Thanks to the introduction of the new MyLink system , the radio and navigation controls are now integrated and operable from the large full - color touchscreen on the center console , while the dedicated HVAC ( Heating , Ventilation and Air-Conditioning ) controls for the Captiva 's dual - zone climate control system have simplified operation . According to Wonsuk Park , the simplification of the interior is actually at the \u201c heart \u201d of Chevrolet 's connectivity strategy \u2013 dedicated HVAC controls , with integrated and centralized radio and navigation controls . The revamped interior is a big improvement in functional usability and makes the Captiva 's interior more contemporary . A new three - spoke steering wheel adds a sporty feel to the freshened interior . Wonsuk Park added , \u201c While the lives of today 's young professionals can be busy and complicated , they want their home and by extension their car to look and feel simple and uncluttered . Far from being uninteresting , the Captiva 's interior now has a more contemporary flair while offering improved functional usability and refinements . \u201d Other improvements include a new driver information cluster display with more legible graphics , including new icons for differentiating between Cruise Control Engaged and Cruise Control Ready . The driver information can be customized via switches next to the steering wheel . Viewing options include distance , fuel range , average and real - time fuel economy , and speed . The driver can view engine coolant temperature and specific air pressure levels for each tire , the latter being an industry or segment first in some markets . The center stack buttons are now backlit in white for better visibility and reconfigured for improved driver ergonomics . Other features include HVAC outlets for second - row occupants and three - row flexibility with the capability of accommodating up to seven people comfortably while providing 930 liters of cargo space , all packaged in an expressively stylish and contemporary yet rugged and robust SUV package . Proven power and assured stability The 2016 Captiva maintains its proven power and drivetrain systems , but improves the final drive ratio , enabling the driven sprocket to turn fewer times to turn the wheels or drive axle . Fewer rotations per drive axle rotation leads to lower engine rpm at higher vehicle speeds and better fuel efficiency and lower emissions . The Captiva comes with a 2.4L four-cylinder E85 - capable ( first - in - class ) gasoline engine capable of 123 k W ( 167 hp ) at 5,600 rpm and 23.45 kg -m ( 230 Nm ) at 4,600 rpm . Power is sent to the driving wheels via a first - in- class six-speed automatic transmission with Driver Shift Control ( DSC ) . The Captiva comes with Passive Entry Passive Start ( PEPS ) , which allows drivers to unlock the doors and start the engine by being in range of the Captiva 's sensors , without having to put the key in their hands . For convenience , there is a switch to the right of the steering wheel that turns this feature on and off . The Captiva 's Self - Levelizer System ensures a constant ride height regardless of load , enhancing its already superior stability , ride and handling characteristics . Its large-diameter anti-roll bars and tuned suspension , featuring independent MacPherson struts in front and an independent multi-link setup in the rear , provide superior handling and driving dynamics . # # # Founded in 1911 in Detroit , Chevrolet is now one of the world 's largest car brands , doing business in more than 115 countries and selling around 4.8 million cars and trucks a year . Chevrolet provides customers with fuel - efficient vehicles that feature engaging performance , design that makes the heart beat , passive and active safety features and easy - to -use technology , all at a value .

The new model arrives at Chevrolet dealerships in January 2016 . Chevrolet has sold more than 1 million midsize SUVs in over 60 countries around the world . \u201c We know from market research that the Captiva attracts tech - savvy , upwardly mobile young professionals who are socially engaged and on the go , \u201d said Mike Devereux , GM International vice president of Sales , Marketing and Aftersales . \u201c We have redesigned the vehicle with their needs in mind , based in part on their feedback , putting in place some of the most up - to- date features , technologies and material refinements available . \u201d Devereux added , \u201c This is , without a doubt , the most exciting Captiva since the model 's introduction , and it will raise the bar in the midsize SUV segment in the many markets where it is sold . \u201d A smartphone on wheels One of the ways the new Captiva addresses the needs of young professionals is through its new Chevrolet MyLink infotainment system , which provides unsurpassed connectivity and convenience for smartphone users through Apple CarPlay apps .

CSA members work closely among themselves in the development of new policy initiatives and the continuous improvement of the regulatory framework for securities . They further coordinate its regulatory initiatives with the Joint Forum of Financial Services . Various CSA members are also active in international organizations such NASAA , COSRA , and IOSCO which represent North American , pan-American , and international securities regulators respectively . Pan-Canadian Passport Passport is a regulatory system that gives a market participant automatic access to the capital markets in other jurisdictions by obtaining a decision only from its principal regulator and meeting the requirements of one set of harmonized laws . It is a major step forward in improving Canada 's securities regulatory system by providing market participants with streamlined access to Canada 's capital markets and fulfills a major commitment in the 2004 Memorandum of Understanding ( 25 KB PDF ) regarding securities regulation among governments of all Canadian provinces and territories , except Ontario . CSA jurisdictions have outlined how the system works among participating passport jurisdictions and how non-Ontario market participants can obtain access to the market in Ontario through an interface system in which the Ontario Securities Commission ( OSC ) makes its own decision but generally relies on the review by the principal regulator . To achieve maximum efficiency for the benefit of the market , the passport regulators accept the OSC 's decisions under passport . Joint Forum of Financial Markets Regulators The Joint Forum of Financial Market Regulators includes representatives of the Canadian Securities Administrators ( CSA ) , the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators ( CCIR ) and the Canadian Association of Pension Supervisory Authorities ( CAPSA ) . The mandate of the Joint Forum is to coordinate and streamline the regulation of products and services in the Canadian financial markets . One of the latest Joint Forum initiatives is the development of the Point of Sale Framework . International CSA members participate and collaborate actively with the following international organizations : North American Securities Administrators Association ( NASAA ) The North American Securities Administrators Association is an international organization devoted to investor protection . It is a voluntary association whose membership consists of state , provincial , and territorial securities administrators in the United States , Puerto Rico , Canada , and Mexico . In the United States , NASAA is the voice of the state securities agencies responsible for efficient capital formation and investor protection . Council of Securities Regulators of the Americas ( COSRA ) COSRA was established in 1992 as a forum for securities regulators in North , South and Central America , as well as the Caribbean . Like IOSCO , COSRA focuses on subjects such as investor protection , the maintenance of market integrity , regulatory cooperation and information - sharing . Because COSRA brings together in a regional forum regulators from developed and developing countries , COSRA is also particularly interested in promoting reforms to strengthen capital markets and enhance investor protection in the Americas . International Organization of Securities Commissions ( IOSCO ) The members of the International Organization of Securities Commissions have resolved to : - cooperate together to promote high standards of regulation in order to maintain just , efficient and sound markets - exchange information on their respective experiences in order to promote the development of domestic markets - unite their efforts to establish standards and an effective surveillance of international securities transactions - provide mutual assistance to promote the integrity of the markets by a rigorous application of the standards and by effective enforcement against offenses International Joint Forum The Joint Forum was established in 1996 under the aegis of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ( BCBS ) , the International Organization of Securities Commissions ( IOSCO ) and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors ( IAIS ) to deal with issues common to the banking , securities and insurance sectors , including the regulation of financial conglomerates .

Various CSA members are also active in international organizations such NASAA , COSRA , and IOSCO which represent North American , pan-American , and international securities regulators respectively . Pan-Canadian Passport Passport is a regulatory system that gives a market participant automatic access to the capital markets in other jurisdictions by obtaining a decision only from its principal regulator and meeting the requirements of one set of harmonized laws . It is a major step forward in improving Canada 's securities regulatory system by providing market participants with streamlined access to Canada 's capital markets and fulfills a major commitment in the 2004 Memorandum of Understanding ( 25 KB PDF ) regarding securities regulation among governments of all Canadian provinces and territories , except Ontario . CSA jurisdictions have outlined how the system works among participating passport jurisdictions and how non-Ontario market participants can obtain access to the market in Ontario through an interface system in which the Ontario Securities Commission ( OSC ) makes its own decision but generally relies on the review by the principal regulator . To achieve maximum efficiency for the benefit of the market , the passport regulators accept the OSC 's decisions under passport . Joint Forum of Financial Markets Regulators The Joint Forum of Financial Market Regulators includes representatives of the Canadian Securities Administrators ( CSA ) , the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators ( CCIR ) and the Canadian Association of Pension Supervisory Authorities ( CAPSA ) . The mandate of the Joint Forum is to coordinate and streamline the regulation of products and services in the Canadian financial markets . One of the latest Joint Forum initiatives is the development of the Point of Sale Framework . International CSA members participate and collaborate actively with the following international organizations : North American Securities Administrators Association ( NASAA ) The North American Securities Administrators Association is an international organization devoted to investor protection . It is a voluntary association whose membership consists of state , provincial , and territorial securities administrators in the United States , Puerto Rico , Canada , and Mexico . In the United States , NASAA is the voice of the state securities agencies responsible for efficient capital formation and investor protection . Council of Securities Regulators of the Americas ( COSRA ) COSRA was established in 1992 as a forum for securities regulators in North , South and Central America , as well as the Caribbean . Like IOSCO , COSRA focuses on subjects such as investor protection , the maintenance of market integrity , regulatory cooperation and information - sharing . Because COSRA brings together in a regional forum regulators from developed and developing countries , COSRA is also particularly interested in promoting reforms to strengthen capital markets and enhance investor protection in the Americas . International Organization of Securities Commissions ( IOSCO ) The members of the International Organization of Securities Commissions have resolved to : - cooperate together to promote high standards of regulation in order to maintain just , efficient and sound markets - exchange information on their respective experiences in order to promote the development of domestic markets - unite their efforts to establish standards and an effective surveillance of international securities transactions - provide mutual assistance to promote the integrity of the markets by a rigorous application of the standards and by effective enforcement against offenses International Joint Forum The Joint Forum was established in 1996 under the aegis of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ( BCBS ) , the International Organization of Securities Commissions ( IOSCO ) and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors ( IAIS ) to deal with issues common to the banking , securities and insurance sectors , including the regulation of financial conglomerates . The Joint Forum is comprised of an equal number of senior bank , insurance and securities supervisors representing each supervisory constituency .","annotations":[{"text":"of the regulatory framework for securities","span":[206,247],"token_span":[31,36],"role":"Project","label":"Project","role_definition":"The object or idea that undergoes change due to the efforts of the Agent."},{"text":"CSA members","span":[88,98],"token_span":[14,15],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The individual that brings about the development of the Project."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-1123-861-frame-Cause_to_make_progress","frame":"Cause_to_make_progress","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Agent works on a Project so that it reaches a more advanced and desirable state.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"In the 2014 Japanese general elections , he won Okinawa 's 1st district .

Luckily for the project , the major storm that struck the east coast during the last weekend in August did not cause any damage to the theater project , Santini said . Of the new concrete footing , Santini called it a \u201c big step closer to getting out of the ' basement . ' \u201d The project is currently nearly 13 feet deep into the ground , where much of the dressing rooms , green room ( performer 's lounge ) and orchestra pit will be located . \u201c The next step for us is putting in the anchor bolts , then putting up the steel walls , \u201d Santini said . Anchor bolts are a screw - like type of equipment that connects a piece of material or a structure to pre-existing concrete . In this case , the anchor belts will connect the steel walls to the concrete footing . \u201c We 'll have new steel walls around the two sides and front of the building , \u201d Santini said . In the back of the theater , Santini expects subcontractors to be setting the steel \u201c skeleton \u201d of the stage area sometime next week . \u201c We 'll hopefully be getting that in , then setting in the concrete for that portion of the building , \u201d Santini said .

The potential for apprehensive or aggressive behaviour should be considered in the handling of dogs emerging from sedation , especially those animals who are likely to be in pain . Information on use of atipamezole with concurrent drugs is inadequate , therefore caution should be exercised when administering multiple drugs . Animals should be monitored closely , particularly for persistent hypothermia , bradycardia , and depressed respiration , until they have recovered completely . Caution should be used in administration of anesthetic agents to elderly or debilitated animals . While atipamezole does reverse the clinical signs associated with dexmedetomidine or medetomidine sedation , complete physiologic return to pretreatment status may not be immediate and should be monitored . Ataject has not been evaluated in breeding animals ; therefore , the drug is not recommended for use in pregnant or lactating animals , or in animals intended for breeding . NOTE TO USERS : Care should be taken to assure that Ataject is not inadvertently ingested , as safety studies have indicated that the drug is absorbed when administered orally . As with all injectable drugs causing profound physiological effects , routine precautions should be employed when handling and using filled syringes , including washing eye and skin areas affected by accidental spillage . In case of accidental human exposure , a physician should be contacted . Warnings Keep out of reach of children . Side Effects Occasional vomiting may occur . Rarely , a brief state of excitement or apprehensiveness may be seen in treated dogs . Other potential side effects of \u03b1 2 - antagonists include hypersalivation , diarrhea , and tremors . OVERDOSAGE : Atipamezole was tolerated in healthy dogs receiving doses 10 - fold the recommended dose and in dogs receiving repeated doses at 1 - , 3 - , and 5 - fold doses , in the absence of an \u03b1 2 - antagonist . Signs seen at elevated doses included excitement , panting , trembling , vomiting , soft or liquid feces or vasodilation ( injection ) of the sclera . Some localized skeletal muscle injury was seen at the injection site ; but no associated clinical signs or complications were observed . Dogs receiving the proper dose in the absence of dexmedetomidine or medetomidine , or 3 - fold overdose after dexmedetomidine or medetomidine sedation , exhibited no significant clinical signs . Clinical Pharmacology Activation of peripheral and central \u03b1 2 - adrenergic receptors is known to induce a pattern of pharmacological responses including sedation , reduction of anxiety , analgesia , bradycardia , and transient hypertension with subsequently reduced blood pressure . Atipamezole is a potent \u03b1 2 - antagonist which selectively and competitively inhibits \u03b1 2 - adrenergic receptors . The result of atipamezole administration in the dog is the rapid recovery from the sedation and other clinical effects produced by the \u03b1 2 - adrenergic agonists , dexmedetomidine and medetomidine . Atipamezole is not expected to reverse the effects of other classes of sedatives , anesthetics , or analgesics . Rapid absorption occurs following intramuscular injection , with a maximum serum concentration reached in approximately 10 minutes . Onset of arousal is usually apparent within 5 to 10 minutes of injection , depending on the depth and duration of dexmedetomidine - or medetomidine - induced sedation . Elimination half - life from serum is less than 3 hours . Atipamezole undergoes extensive hepatic biotransformation , with excretion of metabolites primarily in urine . A transient , approximately 10 % , decrease in systolic blood pressure occurs immediately after administration of atipamezole to dexmedetomidine - or medetomidine - sedated dogs , followed by an increase in pressure within 10 minutes to the pre-atipamezole level . This is the opposite of the response to \u03b1 2 - agonist therapy , and is probably due to peripheral vasodilatation . Atipamezole will produce a rapid improvement in dexmedetomidine - or medetomidine - induced bradycardia . An increase in heart rate is usually apparent within approximately 3 minutes of injection , but approximately 40 % of dogs are not expected to immediately return to presedative rate . Some dogs may experience brief heart rate elevations above baseline . Respiratory rate also increases following atipamezole injection . Storage Store at 15-30\u00b0C . Keep from freezing . Discard any remaining product after 28 days . PRESENTATION : Ataject is supplied in cartons of one 10 ml clear glass vial . Date of preparation : July 2019 \u2122 Grey Wolf Animal Health Inc.

The potential for apprehensive or aggressive behaviour should be considered in the handling of dogs emerging from sedation , especially those animals who are likely to be in pain . Information on use of atipamezole with concurrent drugs is inadequate , therefore caution should be exercised when administering multiple drugs . Animals should be monitored closely , particularly for persistent hypothermia , bradycardia , and depressed respiration , until they have recovered completely . Caution should be used in administration of anesthetic agents to elderly or debilitated animals . While atipamezole does reverse the clinical signs associated with dexmedetomidine or medetomidine sedation , complete physiologic return to pretreatment status may not be immediate and should be monitored . Ataject has not been evaluated in breeding animals ; therefore , the drug is not recommended for use in pregnant or lactating animals , or in animals intended for breeding . NOTE TO USERS : Care should be taken to assure that Ataject is not inadvertently ingested , as safety studies have indicated that the drug is absorbed when administered orally . As with all injectable drugs causing profound physiological effects , routine precautions should be employed when handling and using filled syringes , including washing eye and skin areas affected by accidental spillage . In case of accidental human exposure , a physician should be contacted . Warnings Keep out of reach of children . Side Effects Occasional vomiting may occur . Rarely , a brief state of excitement or apprehensiveness may be seen in treated dogs . Other potential side effects of \u03b1 2 - antagonists include hypersalivation , diarrhea , and tremors . OVERDOSAGE : Atipamezole was tolerated in healthy dogs receiving doses 10 - fold the recommended dose and in dogs receiving repeated doses at 1 - , 3 - , and 5 - fold doses , in the absence of an \u03b1 2 - antagonist . Signs seen at elevated doses included excitement , panting , trembling , vomiting , soft or liquid feces or vasodilation ( injection ) of the sclera . Some localized skeletal muscle injury was seen at the injection site ; but no associated clinical signs or complications were observed . Dogs receiving the proper dose in the absence of dexmedetomidine or medetomidine , or 3 - fold overdose after dexmedetomidine or medetomidine sedation , exhibited no significant clinical signs . Clinical Pharmacology Activation of peripheral and central \u03b1 2 - adrenergic receptors is known to induce a pattern of pharmacological responses including sedation , reduction of anxiety , analgesia , bradycardia , and transient hypertension with subsequently reduced blood pressure . Atipamezole is a potent \u03b1 2 - antagonist which selectively and competitively inhibits \u03b1 2 - adrenergic receptors . The result of atipamezole administration in the dog is the rapid recovery from the sedation and other clinical effects produced by the \u03b1 2 - adrenergic agonists , dexmedetomidine and medetomidine . Atipamezole is not expected to reverse the effects of other classes of sedatives , anesthetics , or analgesics . Rapid absorption occurs following intramuscular injection , with a maximum serum concentration reached in approximately 10 minutes . Onset of arousal is usually apparent within 5 to 10 minutes of injection , depending on the depth and duration of dexmedetomidine - or medetomidine - induced sedation . Elimination half - life from serum is less than 3 hours . Atipamezole undergoes extensive hepatic biotransformation , with excretion of metabolites primarily in urine . A transient , approximately 10 % , decrease in systolic blood pressure occurs immediately after administration of atipamezole to dexmedetomidine - or medetomidine - sedated dogs , followed by an increase in pressure within 10 minutes to the pre-atipamezole level . This is the opposite of the response to \u03b1 2 - agonist therapy , and is probably due to peripheral vasodilatation . Atipamezole will produce a rapid improvement in dexmedetomidine - or medetomidine - induced bradycardia . An increase in heart rate is usually apparent within approximately 3 minutes of injection , but approximately 40 % of dogs are not expected to immediately return to presedative rate . Some dogs may experience brief heart rate elevations above baseline . Respiratory rate also increases following atipamezole injection . Storage Store at 15-30\u00b0C . Keep from freezing . Discard any remaining product after 28 days . PRESENTATION : Ataject is supplied in cartons of one 10 ml clear glass vial . Date of preparation : July 2019 \u2122 Grey Wolf Animal Health Inc.

The end of it has been entirely lost , for the fifth folio of eight sheets is missing from Regius , the gap coming after the first line of stanza 29 of this poem . That stanza has been completed , and eight more have been added , from much later paper manuscripts , but even so the conclusion of the poem is in obscurity . Properly speaking , however , the strange conglomeration of stanzas which the compiler of the collection has left for us , and which , in much the same general form , seems to have lain before the authors of the Volsungasaga , in which eighteen of its stanzas are quoted , is not a poem at all . Even its customary title is an absurd error . The mistake made by the annotator in thinking that the epithet \" sigrdrifa , \" rightly applied to Brynhild as a \" bringer of victory , \" was a proper name has already been explained and commented on ( note on Fafnismol , 44 ) . Even if the collection of stanzas were in any real sense a poem , which it emphatically is not , it is certainly not the \" Ballad of Sigrdrifa \" which it is commonly called . \" Ballad of Brynhild \" would be a sufficiently suitable title , and I have here brought the established name \" Sigrdrifumol \" into accord with this by translating the epithet instead of treating it as a proper name . Even apart from the title , however , the Sigrdrifumol has little claim to be regarded as a distinct poem , nor is there any indication that the compiler did so regard it . Handicapped as we are by the loss of the concluding section , and of the material which followed it on those missing pages , we can yet see that the process which began with the prose Fra Dautha Sinfjotla , and which , interrupted by the insertion of the Gripisspo , went on through the Reginsmol and the Fafnismol , continued through as much of the Sigrdrifumol as is left to us . In other words , the compiler told the story of Sigurth in mixed prose and verse , using whatever verse he could find without much questioning as to its origin , and filling in the gaps with hii own prose . Fra p. 387 Dautha Sinfjotla , Reginsmol , Fafnismol , and Sigrdrifumol are essentially a coherent unit , but one of the compiler 's making only ; they represent neither one poem nor three distinct poems , and the divisions and titles which have been almost universally adopted by editors are both arbitrary and misleading . The Sigrdrifumol section as we now have it is an extraordinary piece of patchwork . It is most unlikely that the compiler himself brought all these fragments together for the first time ; little by little , through a process of accretion and also , unluckily , through one of elimination , the material grew into its present shape . Certainly the basis of it is a poem dealing with the finding of Brynhild by Sigurth , but of this original poem only five stanzas ( 2 - 4 and 20 - 21 ) can be identified with any degree of confidence . To these five stanzas should probably , however , be added some , if not all , of the passage ( stanzas 6 - 12 ) in which Brynhild teaches Sigurth the magic runes . These stanzas of rune - lore attracted sundry similar passages from other sources , including stanza 5 , in which a magic draught is administered ( not necessarily by Brynhild or to Sigurth ) , the curious rune - chant in stanzas 15 - 17 , and stanzas 13 - 14 and 18 - 19 . Beginning with stanza 22 , and running to the end of the fragment ( stanza 37 ) , is a set of numbered counsels closely resembling the Loddfafnismol ( Hovamol , stanzas 111 - 138 ) , which manifestly has nothing whatever to do with Brynhild . Even in this passage there are probably interpolations ( stanzas 25 , 27 , 30 , 54 , and 36 ) . Finally , and bespeaking the existence at some earlier time of another Sigurth - Brynhild poem , is stanza 1 , sharply distinguished by its metrical form from stanzas 2 - 4 and 20 - 21 . Many critics argue that stanzas 6 - 10 of Helreith Brynildar belonged originally to the same poem as stanza 1 of the Sigrdrifumol . The Sigrdrifumol , then , must be regarded simply as a collection of fragments , most of them originally having no relation to the main subject . All of the story , the dialogue and the characterization are embodied in stanzas 1 - 4 and 20 - 21 and in the prose notes accompanying the first four stanzas ; all of the rest might equally well ( or better ) be transferred to the Hovamol , where its character entitles it to a place . Yet stanzas 2 - 4 are as fine as anything in Old Norse poetry , and it is out of the scanty material of these three stanzas that Wagner constructed much of the third act of \" Siegfried . \" p. 388 The Sigrdrifumol represents almost exclusively the contributions of the North to the Sigurth tradition ( cf. introductory note to the Gripisspo ) . Brynhild , here disguised by the annotator as \" Sigrdrifa , \" appears simply as a battle - maid and supernatural dispenser of wisdom ; there is no trace of the daughter of Buthli and the rival of Guthrun . There is , however , so little of the \" poem \" which can definitely be assigned to the Sigurth cycle that it is impossible to trace back any of the underlying narrative substance . The nature and condition of the material have made editorial conjectures and emendations very numerous , and as most of the guesses are neither conclusive nor particularly important , only a few of their are mentioned in the notes . __________________ Sigurth rode up on Hindarfjoll and turned southward toward the land of the Franks . On the mountain he saw a great light , as if fire were burning , and the glow reached up to heaven . And when he came thither , there stood a tower of shields , and above it was a banner . Sigurth went into the shield - tower , and saw that a man lay there sleeping with all his war-weapons . First he took the helm from his head , and then he saw that it was a woman . The mail - coat was as fast as if it had grown to the flesh . Then he cut the mail - coat from the [ Prose . The introductory prose follows without break the prose concluding the Fafnismol , the point of division being arbitrary and not agreed upon by all editors . Hindarfjoll : cf. Fafnismol , 42 and note . Franks : this does not necessarily mean that Sigurth was on his way to the Gjukungs ' home , for Sigmund had a kingdom in the land of the Franks ( cf. Fra Dautha Sinfjotla ) . Shields : the annotator probably drew the notion of the shield - tower from the reference in Helreith Brynhildar , 9 . The flame - girt tower was not uncommon ; cf. Mengloth 's hall in Svipdagsmol . ] p. 389 head - opening downward , and out to both the arm-holes . Then he took the mail - coat from her , and she awoke , and sat up and saw Sigurth , and said : 1 . \" What bit through the byrnie ? | how was broken my sleep ? Who made me free | of the fetters pale ? \" He answered : \" Sigmund 's son , | with Sigurth 's sword , That late with flesh | hath fed the ravens . \" Sigurth sat beside her and asked her name . She took a horn full of mead and gave him a memory -draught . 2 . \" Hail , day ! | Hail , sons of day ! And night and her daughter now ! Look on us here | with loving eyes , That waiting we victory win . [ 1 .

Sigrdrifa , slew Hjalmgunnar in the battle , and Othin pricked her with the sleep - thorn in punishment for this , and said that she should never thereafter win victory in battle , but that she should be wedded . \" And I said to him that I had made a vow in my turn , that I would [ Prose ( after stanza 4 ) .

Here the list of runes breaks off , though the manuscript indicates no gap , and three short passages of a different type , though all dealing with runes , follow . 13 . Stanzas 13 - 14 appear to have come from a passage regarding Othin 's getting of the runes similar to Hovamol , 139 - 146 . Editors have tried various combinations of the lines in stanzas 12 - 14 . Hropt : Othin ; cf. Voluspo , 62 . The draught , etc. : apparently the reference is to the head of Mim , from which Othin derived his wisdom in magic ( cf.

Stanzas 20 - 21 are all that remains of the dialogue between Brynhild and Sigurth from the poem to which stanzas 2 - 4 belong ; cf. Introductory Note . In the intervening lost stanzas Brynhild has evidently warned Sigurth of the perils that will follow if he swears loyalty to her ; hence the choice to which she here refers . Tree , etc. : warrior . The manuscript does not indicate the speaker of either this or the following stanza ; the Volsungasaga names Sigurth before stanza 21 . 21 . It is quite possible that the original poem concluded with two stanzas after this , paraphrased thus in the Volsungasaga : \" Sigurth said : ' Nowhere is to be found any one wiser than thou , and this I swear , that I shall have thee for mine , and that thou art after my heart 's desire . ' She answered : ' I would rather have thee though I might choose among all men . ' And this they bound between them with oaths . \" Stanzas 22 - 37 , which the Volsungasaga paraphrases , may have been introduced at a relatively early time , but can hardly have formed part of the original poem . ] p. 397 Thy loving word | for mine will I win , As long as I shall live . \" 22 . Then first I rede thee , | that free of guilt Toward kinsmen ever thou art ; No vengeance have , | though they work thee harm , Reward after death thou shalt win . 23 .

With this stanza begins the list of numbered counsels , closely resembling the Loddfafnismol ( Hovamol , 111 - 138 ) , here attributed to Brynhild . That the section originally had anything to do with Brynhild is more than improbable . 23 . Wolf of his word : oath - destroyer , oath -breaker . 25 . This chaotic and obscure jumble of lines has been unsuccessfully \" improved \" by various editors .

Probably another interpolation . 28 . Silver of kinship : the passage is doubtful , but apparently it means the \" marriage - price \" for which a bride was \" bought . \" 29 . Line 1 comes at the end of the thirty - second leaf of Regius , and whatever further was contained in that manuscript has vanished [ fp. 399 ] with the lost eight - leaf folio ( cf. Introductory Note ) .

Perhaps they formed part of the stanza of warning which evidently preceded Brynhild 's speech in stanza 20 .

The end of it has been entirely lost , for the fifth folio of eight sheets is missing from Regius , the gap coming after the first line of stanza 29 of this poem . That stanza has been completed , and eight more have been added , from much later paper manuscripts , but even so the conclusion of the poem is in obscurity . Properly speaking , however , the strange conglomeration of stanzas which the compiler of the collection has left for us , and which , in much the same general form , seems to have lain before the authors of the Volsungasaga , in which eighteen of its stanzas are quoted , is not a poem at all . Even its customary title is an absurd error . The mistake made by the annotator in thinking that the epithet \" sigrdrifa , \" rightly applied to Brynhild as a \" bringer of victory , \" was a proper name has already been explained and commented on ( note on Fafnismol , 44 ) . Even if the collection of stanzas were in any real sense a poem , which it emphatically is not , it is certainly not the \" Ballad of Sigrdrifa \" which it is commonly called . \" Ballad of Brynhild \" would be a sufficiently suitable title , and I have here brought the established name \" Sigrdrifumol \" into accord with this by translating the epithet instead of treating it as a proper name . Even apart from the title , however , the Sigrdrifumol has little claim to be regarded as a distinct poem , nor is there any indication that the compiler did so regard it . Handicapped as we are by the loss of the concluding section , and of the material which followed it on those missing pages , we can yet see that the process which began with the prose Fra Dautha Sinfjotla , and which , interrupted by the insertion of the Gripisspo , went on through the Reginsmol and the Fafnismol , continued through as much of the Sigrdrifumol as is left to us . In other words , the compiler told the story of Sigurth in mixed prose and verse , using whatever verse he could find without much questioning as to its origin , and filling in the gaps with hii own prose . Fra p. 387 Dautha Sinfjotla , Reginsmol , Fafnismol , and Sigrdrifumol are essentially a coherent unit , but one of the compiler 's making only ; they represent neither one poem nor three distinct poems , and the divisions and titles which have been almost universally adopted by editors are both arbitrary and misleading . The Sigrdrifumol section as we now have it is an extraordinary piece of patchwork . It is most unlikely that the compiler himself brought all these fragments together for the first time ; little by little , through a process of accretion and also , unluckily , through one of elimination , the material grew into its present shape . Certainly the basis of it is a poem dealing with the finding of Brynhild by Sigurth , but of this original poem only five stanzas ( 2 - 4 and 20 - 21 ) can be identified with any degree of confidence . To these five stanzas should probably , however , be added some , if not all , of the passage ( stanzas 6 - 12 ) in which Brynhild teaches Sigurth the magic runes . These stanzas of rune - lore attracted sundry similar passages from other sources , including stanza 5 , in which a magic draught is administered ( not necessarily by Brynhild or to Sigurth ) , the curious rune - chant in stanzas 15 - 17 , and stanzas 13 - 14 and 18 - 19 . Beginning with stanza 22 , and running to the end of the fragment ( stanza 37 ) , is a set of numbered counsels closely resembling the Loddfafnismol ( Hovamol , stanzas 111 - 138 ) , which manifestly has nothing whatever to do with Brynhild . Even in this passage there are probably interpolations ( stanzas 25 , 27 , 30 , 54 , and 36 ) . Finally , and bespeaking the existence at some earlier time of another Sigurth - Brynhild poem , is stanza 1 , sharply distinguished by its metrical form from stanzas 2 - 4 and 20 - 21 . Many critics argue that stanzas 6 - 10 of Helreith Brynildar belonged originally to the same poem as stanza 1 of the Sigrdrifumol . The Sigrdrifumol , then , must be regarded simply as a collection of fragments , most of them originally having no relation to the main subject . All of the story , the dialogue and the characterization are embodied in stanzas 1 - 4 and 20 - 21 and in the prose notes accompanying the first four stanzas ; all of the rest might equally well ( or better ) be transferred to the Hovamol , where its character entitles it to a place . Yet stanzas 2 - 4 are as fine as anything in Old Norse poetry , and it is out of the scanty material of these three stanzas that Wagner constructed much of the third act of \" Siegfried . \" p. 388 The Sigrdrifumol represents almost exclusively the contributions of the North to the Sigurth tradition ( cf. introductory note to the Gripisspo ) . Brynhild , here disguised by the annotator as \" Sigrdrifa , \" appears simply as a battle - maid and supernatural dispenser of wisdom ; there is no trace of the daughter of Buthli and the rival of Guthrun . There is , however , so little of the \" poem \" which can definitely be assigned to the Sigurth cycle that it is impossible to trace back any of the underlying narrative substance . The nature and condition of the material have made editorial conjectures and emendations very numerous , and as most of the guesses are neither conclusive nor particularly important , only a few of their are mentioned in the notes . __________________ Sigurth rode up on Hindarfjoll and turned southward toward the land of the Franks . On the mountain he saw a great light , as if fire were burning , and the glow reached up to heaven . And when he came thither , there stood a tower of shields , and above it was a banner . Sigurth went into the shield - tower , and saw that a man lay there sleeping with all his war-weapons . First he took the helm from his head , and then he saw that it was a woman . The mail - coat was as fast as if it had grown to the flesh . Then he cut the mail - coat from the [ Prose . The introductory prose follows without break the prose concluding the Fafnismol , the point of division being arbitrary and not agreed upon by all editors . Hindarfjoll : cf. Fafnismol , 42 and note . Franks : this does not necessarily mean that Sigurth was on his way to the Gjukungs ' home , for Sigmund had a kingdom in the land of the Franks ( cf.

Then he took the mail - coat from her , and she awoke , and sat up and saw Sigurth , and said : 1 . \" What bit through the byrnie ? | how was broken my sleep ? Who made me free | of the fetters pale ? \" He answered : \" Sigmund 's son , | with Sigurth 's sword , That late with flesh | hath fed the ravens . \" Sigurth sat beside her and asked her name .

Sigrdrifa , slew Hjalmgunnar in the battle , and Othin pricked her with the sleep - thorn in punishment for this , and said that she should never thereafter win victory in battle , but that she should be wedded . \" And I said to him that I had made a vow in my turn , that I would [ Prose ( after stanza 4 ) .

Here the list of runes breaks off , though the manuscript indicates no gap , and three short passages of a different type , though all dealing with runes , follow . 13 . Stanzas 13 - 14 appear to have come from a passage regarding Othin 's getting of the runes similar to Hovamol , 139 - 146 . Editors have tried various combinations of the lines in stanzas 12 - 14 . Hropt : Othin ; cf. Voluspo , 62 . The draught , etc. : apparently the reference is to the head of Mim , from which Othin derived his wisdom in magic ( cf.

Stanzas 20 - 21 are all that remains of the dialogue between Brynhild and Sigurth from the poem to which stanzas 2 - 4 belong ; cf. Introductory Note . In the intervening lost stanzas Brynhild has evidently warned Sigurth of the perils that will follow if he swears loyalty to her ; hence the choice to which she here refers . Tree , etc. : warrior . The manuscript does not indicate the speaker of either this or the following stanza ; the Volsungasaga names Sigurth before stanza 21 . 21 . It is quite possible that the original poem concluded with two stanzas after this , paraphrased thus in the Volsungasaga : \" Sigurth said : ' Nowhere is to be found any one wiser than thou , and this I swear , that I shall have thee for mine , and that thou art after my heart 's desire . ' She answered : ' I would rather have thee though I might choose among all men . ' And this they bound between them with oaths . \" Stanzas 22 - 37 , which the Volsungasaga paraphrases , may have been introduced at a relatively early time , but can hardly have formed part of the original poem . ] p. 397 Thy loving word | for mine will I win , As long as I shall live . \" 22 . Then first I rede thee , | that free of guilt Toward kinsmen ever thou art ; No vengeance have , | though they work thee harm , Reward after death thou shalt win . 23 .

With this stanza begins the list of numbered counsels , closely resembling the Loddfafnismol ( Hovamol , 111 - 138 ) , here attributed to Brynhild . That the section originally had anything to do with Brynhild is more than improbable . 23 . Wolf of his word : oath - destroyer , oath -breaker . 25 . This chaotic and obscure jumble of lines has been unsuccessfully \" improved \" by various editors .
