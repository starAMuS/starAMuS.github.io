Chol 's viral YouTube hit , ' Take U to Da Movies ' featured on The Tonight Show 's ' Do Not Play ' segment and was mocked by host and narrator Steve Higgins . The track fuelled global discussion , but why ? Was Fallon simply making fun of a Sudanese migrant for poorly mirroring US culture ? Or is it possible Ur Boy is at the beginning of the next movement in art history ? ' Take U to Da Movies ' went viral in 2009 , and like many other YouTube hits it briefly pushed its creator into the public eye . The video launched a kind of fad music career for Chol , with the rapper even performing at the 2010 Melbourne Big Day Out . The track is confusing from an artistic standpoint , as it parodies US gangsta rap culture while looking like a serious attempt at creating rap music . ' Take U to Da Movies ' upholds the egocentric rap aesthetic , yet the subject ( Ur Boy taking a girl to the movies , paying for the popcorn and so on ) is endearing and oddly polite . The lyricism along with the absurdity of the video ( Bangs performs in front of green-screened JPEG images of city skylines , expensive cars , Australian cash and so on ) could be the reason for its traction online . However , it is difficult to discern exactly what factors are pushing the clip repeatedly into the limelight . Most of Chol 's other music videos appear to be less outwardly ironic . For example , ' Better Place ' is about the reputation of Sudanese people in Australia , and ' I 'm Going to the Ghetto ' examines Chol 's experience living in this country : Let me tell you the truth , but do n't get me wrong I 'm not happy in this country at all I want to go back to where I 'm from , which is my home I do n't know why I 'm here These tracks are more serious , though they share same raw production values as ' Take You to Da Movies . The Sudanese - Australian videographer Ez Eldin Deng shot many of them . The two met in 2004 at the Western English Language School in Braybrook , Victoria , and have been collaborating since . Like many other viral videos , the success of ' Take U to Da Movies ' had an accidental element . Deng explained , ' It was an experiment ; I wanted to work out how green screen [ also known as chroma key compositing , a post-production filmmaking technique ] worked , and Bangs had the idea for the images . I did n't know anything about YouTube . ' Deng felt the popularity of ' Take U to Da Movies ' was due to its simplicity . ' There is no technology where I come from and I wanted to do something simple , something people could relate to . Some people find it funny and some just try to work out how we did it . ' ' Take U to Da Movies ' appearing on The Tonight Show created something of media frenzy in Australia and online . In the days following , Chol released a response in the form of a diss track entitled , ' Ur Boy Bangz \u2013 Response to Jimmy Fallon \u2013 Do Not Watch ' . It is difficult to tell if Chol is actually offended or if it 's an elaborate joke at Fallon 's expense . Following the online release of the diss track , Chol then participated in a number of radio and television appearances , including interviews with ABC Radio National , Ten 's Studio 10 and SBS Radio . These appearances and countless online articles were supportive of the rapper 's encounter with The Tonight Show , though were also extremely patronising . The public reaction makes you wonder if this is just another example of humanity 's inherent cruelty when it comes rejoicing the perceived failure of others . And , for the record , the other side of the Fallon 's mean-spirited coin is the condescending praise given by so many media outlets ; ABC RN Drive 's Patricia Karvelas was kind to Chol , but at times it appeared as if she was talking to a child . The media reception is indicative of an outdated thinking on the way art is created \u2013 that is , if it does n't share the qualities of something known to be successful , critically or otherwise , then it is trivial and not worthy of respect . Are the reactions of Fallon and the media just an extension of angry white male syndrome , a kind of nostalgia for the past when everything made sense and a community understood why something was being discussed and shared around ? The truth is that it does n't matter if you think ' Take U to Da Movies ' is a good example of rap music or not . It does n't matter if it was intended as a parody or if it was meant to be serious ( or somehow both ) . There is no longer a point in discerning the intention of a creator in the post-postmodern world . What is important is working out why one music video speaks to a global audience and countless others fall through the cracks . It is not arbitrary . My guess is that what Ajak Chol and Ez Eldin Deng are doing resonated because it represents a new honesty in art , a realness that 's far from the egotistical laughter of a talk show host that modern culture is likely to leave behind . There are now audiences for artworks that would usually be rejected due to dated notions on what art is . An example is the art / music style , Vaporwave , which emerged early this decade . Vaporwave is characterised by a preoccupation with an 80s and 90s yuppie aesthetic . The music typically involves extensive sampling of lounge and muzak from the 1970s onwards . In a sarcastic video ' How To Make Vaporwave ' , YouTuber Frank Jav Cee describes the music as ' basically 80s elevator / infomercial music digitally slowed down with effects . ' Vaporwave appears almost exclusively on the internet and functions as both a critique and embrace of consumer capitalism . It epitomises post-irony and ambivalence in modern culture , and it rejects most of the technical standards of traditional and contemporary art . Irrespective of how this music is being formally reviewed , it has a wide , growing audience online \u2013 and like Ur Boy Bangs , it warrants acknowledgement of its being more than just a failed artistic attempt . ' In that moment , poetry will be made by everyone , and there will be emus in the zone , ' says Chris Marker in his complex video-essay , Sans Soleil . The film is pieced together from decades of travel videography , where each shot functions as a memory or an unconscious moment in time . Marker 's film was created in a way that appeared both intentional and accidental . ' Take U to Da Movies ' lacks the technical expertise of traditional and mainstream art ; however , it captures a vulnerability that 's almost impossible to recreate in traditional art forms . Like Sans Soleil , ' Take U to Da Movies ' achieved this both consciously and by mistake . The YouTube hit was , in the truest creative spirit , an experiment by two Sudanese - Australians to learn about new technology and online platforms .

One of the great things about any immersive theatre experience is that it immediately throws you into a situation where your senses are heightened and every experience is suddenly called into question \u2014 is that part of the show ? Is that an actor ? Is that supposed to be happening ? This Is Not a Theatre Company 's ( TINATC ) new production , Versailles 2015 , does exactly this in a delightful and provocative manner . 24 hours prior to the performance , audience members are emailed the address to an apartment where we are to attend a party hosted by TINATC 's founder and co-artistic director Erin B. Mee ( played by Mee herself ) . It seems as if the party is an opportunity to view TINATC 's commission of a bathtub dance piece , also entitled Versailles 2015 , by choreographer - dancer Jonathan Matthews ( the incredibly agile , focused , goofy and death-defying \u2014 bathtubs are slippery , after all \u2014 Matthews , playing himself ) . Greeted in the lobby by Erin 's \u201c niece , \u201d Judy ( Caitlin Goldie ) , the rules of the party are explained \u2014 only a few party - goers at a time will be able to fit into her aunt 's bathroom to watch the dance piece , but there are some snacks and beverages to nosh on while we wait our turn ; shoes will be left at the door ( hospital fabric booties are provided for anyone who 'd like them ) ; and this is not Sleep No More , so please refrain from opening up any drawers or rifling through her aunt 's stuff . We are then brought up in an elevator and , after shedding our shoes , enter the apartment where the party is already in progress . It 's a huge credit to all involved how effective this first \u201c scene \u201d is . While some audience members may be gung - ho to jump into any type of experience , many may be resistant and nervous and , from the moment we enter , we are made to feel welcome and comfortable . Though I was fully aware of the artifice of the party , it genuinely felt like many NYC parties I 've attended and I found myself , as did the other audience members , relaxing into the situation and making the usual get-to -know - you small talk , unsure of whether or not I was talking to a genuine guest or an actor playing a guest . In fact , I actually was duped and had a lovely conversation with a guest that I did not realize until later was actually an actress in the piece . But the fact that this amused rather than annoyed me speaks directly to the ingratiating tone of the overall piece itself . As we wait to be brought into the bathroom , we are also masterfully spirited away and divided into smaller groups of 4 or 5 to witness additional moments in the other rooms of the apartment : a rant on the unifying powers of gourmet food ( in the kitchen ) ; a discussion about the history of the neighborhood where the apartment sits as well as the preponderance of plays set in living rooms ( knowingly and ironically taking place in the living room ) ; a saga of the near death of an English bulldog ( in the bedroom ) . Simultaneously , videographer Stefan Hartmann 's collected footage of global crises streams unobtrusively on a TV or i Pad screen casually left on in the various rooms . This juxtaposition of images of struggling refugees and angry demonstrations alongside the innocuous minutiae that the characters obsess over points to the overall theme of the evening ( as does the play 's and the performance - piece - within - the - play 's title , directly referencing the opulence of Louis XIV and a life of excess ) . But Charles Mee and Jessie Bear 's script does not go the obvious route of simply mocking these partygoers and their 1 % lives \u2014 we are meant to connect with them , for it is very recognizably our lives as well ( the play 's final argument is that anyone working in the arts or able to take the time to spend an evening seeing theatre is living a privileged life \u2026 and we are ) . The text runs a seamless line between the exquisite poetry and mind - numbing humdrumness of our often devastatingly mundane lives and is often so heavy - handed in its heavy - handedness that it lulls rather than grates . Ms. Mee 's cast of charming young actors appealingly rides this line beautifully . They effortlessly deliver the moments of heightened language while making it appear improvisational and natural . They all seem like people I know . It 's a credit to the direction and performances that as much as we may want to roll our eyes at their superficiality , we do n't . We smile and recognize them . They work seamlessly as an ensemble , even when performing solo in a kitchen or bathroom , and are so at ease in the contradiction of their roles as party - goers and actors that I half expected them to continue exiting with us as we descended back in the elevator and out into the lobby at the play 's end .

Courts in some states of the UAE regularly order floggings , for women as well as men , particularly but not exclusively for moral offences under Islamic law such as adultery and drinking alcohol . JCP has allegedly been abolished in Dubai but remains on the statute book in at least five of the other six Emirates . As far as can be ascertained , the normal practice is to apply a leather whip to the offender 's upper back , though the use of straps and canes has been reported in some cases . Some reports refer to the shirt being removed in the case of men , while female recipients remain fully dressed . According to one anecdotal account in Dec 2000 , prisoners in the UAE may also be flogged with a cane for internal prison infractions such as smuggling cigarettes . However , this report appeared in a not particularly reliable tabloid newspaper , and I have not yet seen this claim corroborated elsewhere . It is not clear whether floggings are still administered in public in the UAE . In 1977 it was reported that a man was given 100 lashes for rape in the central market of Abu Dhabi . This was said to be the first such case \" since Muslim religious courts took over jurisdiction of criminal cases \" . An Amnesty International report in 1989 ( not on line ) stated that two youths aged 16 and 18 were sentenced to 550 lashes each for theft . \" The sentences were carried out in public with the youths receiving approximately 40 lashes every Friday for three months . \" Reuters reported in 1995 that the Emirate of Ras al - Khaimah had extended the scope of flogging to include the not notably Koranic offence of dangerous driving . It was later claimed that this had been successful in reducing the road accident rate . A not altogether clear June 2006 news report stated that the penalty was no longer to be applied for petty crimes . In December 2006 the law was changed so that non- Muslims could no longer be flogged . It is possible that this was in part a response to embarrassing international publicity when an Estonian soldier , serving with a UN peacekeeping force in Afghanistan , was sentenced to be lashed for drinking alcohol during a stopover at Sharjah airport -- having been sold the drink by the airport 's own duty - free shop . He was eventually freed without being flogged ( Agence France Presse , 11 Apr 2006 ; Middle East Times , 19 Apr 2006 ) . This Feb 2007 news item clarifies that the punishment is to be carried out \" moderately and not with force or with a thick whip \" and that it is not supposed to cause bleeding . The best-known flogging case in the UAE is that of a teenage Filipina maid , Sarah Balabagan , originally sentenced in 1994 to death for killing her employer who had tried to rape her . Following an international outcry , this was commuted to a year in prison plus 100 lashes . She was duly flogged in 1996 with 20 lashes at a time on five separate days , privately in prison . EXTERNAL LINKS : ( these will open in a new window ) US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 1993 Here it is claimed that in 1993 the Federal Supreme Court ruled that Shari'a punishments such as flogging should not be imposed on non-Muslims , as they had been previously . ( But see next item . ) US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 1994 This report described floggings of Muslims by Islamic courts in the UAE as \" frequent \" , especially for adultery , prostitution and drunkenness , with sentences ranging from 80 to 200 lashes . The 1993 court ruling ( see previous item ) was clarified as meaning that non- Muslims are not required to be flogged , not that they must not be flogged . However , the report says that , although several non- Muslims had received JCP sentences , there was no indication that any of them had been carried out . US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 1995 According to this , flogging in the UAE is administered in such a way as to prevent injury : \" The individual administering the lashing traditionally holds a Koran under the arm and swings the whip using the forearm only \" . The document refers to certain individual cases , including floggings of non-Muslims , and in particular that of Sarah Balabagan ( see main text above ) . US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 1996 This report notes that there is no JCP in Dubai . It says a few floggings of non- Muslims were carried out in some other parts of the federation . ( The reports for 1997 to 2000 inclusive repeat the same information . ) Imprisonment and Flogging for Marriage Across Faiths 1997 Amnesty report on a case in which a 30 - year - old Christian man was sentenced to 39 lashes for marrying a Muslim woman . Amnesty International Report 1997 Several flogging cases are mentioned . Amnesty International Report 1998 Notes that JCP was extended to cover traffic offences in Ras al - Khaimah and also reportedly to begging . Several flogging sentences are discussed .

Courts in some states of the UAE regularly order floggings , for women as well as men , particularly but not exclusively for moral offences under Islamic law such as adultery and drinking alcohol . JCP has allegedly been abolished in Dubai but remains on the statute book in at least five of the other six Emirates . As far as can be ascertained , the normal practice is to apply a leather whip to the offender 's upper back , though the use of straps and canes has been reported in some cases . Some reports refer to the shirt being removed in the case of men , while female recipients remain fully dressed . According to one anecdotal account in Dec 2000 , prisoners in the UAE may also be flogged with a cane for internal prison infractions such as smuggling cigarettes . However , this report appeared in a not particularly reliable tabloid newspaper , and I have not yet seen this claim corroborated elsewhere . It is not clear whether floggings are still administered in public in the UAE . In 1977 it was reported that a man was given 100 lashes for rape in the central market of Abu Dhabi . This was said to be the first such case \" since Muslim religious courts took over jurisdiction of criminal cases \" . An Amnesty International report in 1989 ( not on line ) stated that two youths aged 16 and 18 were sentenced to 550 lashes each for theft . \" The sentences were carried out in public with the youths receiving approximately 40 lashes every Friday for three months . \" Reuters reported in 1995 that the Emirate of Ras al - Khaimah had extended the scope of flogging to include the not notably Koranic offence of dangerous driving . It was later claimed that this had been successful in reducing the road accident rate . A not altogether clear June 2006 news report stated that the penalty was no longer to be applied for petty crimes . In December 2006 the law was changed so that non- Muslims could no longer be flogged . It is possible that this was in part a response to embarrassing international publicity when an Estonian soldier , serving with a UN peacekeeping force in Afghanistan , was sentenced to be lashed for drinking alcohol during a stopover at Sharjah airport -- having been sold the drink by the airport 's own duty - free shop . He was eventually freed without being flogged ( Agence France Presse , 11 Apr 2006 ; Middle East Times , 19 Apr 2006 ) . This Feb 2007 news item clarifies that the punishment is to be carried out \" moderately and not with force or with a thick whip \" and that it is not supposed to cause bleeding . The best-known flogging case in the UAE is that of a teenage Filipina maid , Sarah Balabagan , originally sentenced in 1994 to death for killing her employer who had tried to rape her . Following an international outcry , this was commuted to a year in prison plus 100 lashes . She was duly flogged in 1996 with 20 lashes at a time on five separate days , privately in prison . EXTERNAL LINKS : ( these will open in a new window ) US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 1993 Here it is claimed that in 1993 the Federal Supreme Court ruled that Shari'a punishments such as flogging should not be imposed on non-Muslims , as they had been previously . ( But see next item . ) US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 1994 This report described floggings of Muslims by Islamic courts in the UAE as \" frequent \" , especially for adultery , prostitution and drunkenness , with sentences ranging from 80 to 200 lashes . The 1993 court ruling ( see previous item ) was clarified as meaning that non- Muslims are not required to be flogged , not that they must not be flogged . However , the report says that , although several non- Muslims had received JCP sentences , there was no indication that any of them had been carried out . US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 1995 According to this , flogging in the UAE is administered in such a way as to prevent injury : \" The individual administering the lashing traditionally holds a Koran under the arm and swings the whip using the forearm only \" . The document refers to certain individual cases , including floggings of non-Muslims , and in particular that of Sarah Balabagan ( see main text above ) . US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 1996 This report notes that there is no JCP in Dubai . It says a few floggings of non- Muslims were carried out in some other parts of the federation .

The interrogators etched the Chinese characters for \" Fight the Chinese Communists , Oppose the Soviet Union \" into Zhang 's left arm . During his incarceration , Zhang witnessed U.S. military police killing his comrades during a POW uprising on the island of Cheju . But after the war , Zhang -- who dug the offending words from his arm with a knife , leaving a long , white , numb trench -- was not welcomed home . For 30 years , he and thousands of other returning POWs were looked upon as traitors for failing to fight to the death and because of their close contact with Americans in POW camps . During the Cultural Revolution of 1966 - 76 , Zhang was the subject of a nationwide manhunt because he was considered an American spy . It was not until 1980 that China 's government acknowledged mistreatment of former POWs in an ambiguously worded explanation called Document 74 . But like the Korean War in the United States , what is officially called the \" War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea \" has remained very much a forgotten conflict here , with China 's role largely unexamined . Zhang and other veterans say it 's time for that to change . Fifty years after the eruption of the Korean War , a sensitive and significant debate is beginning in China . Spurred in part by the rapprochement between North and South Korea and improving ties between the United States and its old enemy in Pyongyang , Chinese scholars are for the first time posing difficult questions about the decision to send more than 1 million troops over the Yalu River into North Korea . Should China have entered the war ? Who started the war ? Were China 's losses and expenses -- estimated at almost 1 million killed or wounded and $ 10 billion -- worth it ? Why does n't China 's military code give its soldiers the right to surrender ? And , even , did China fight on the right side ? \" We were told that the war was to protect China , \" said Zhang Zeshi , another POW from the 180th Division , who is not related to Zhang Da . \" But later we discovered we were n't really fighting for China . We were fighting for [ North Korean leader ] Kim Il Sung . Then we discovered he was a feudal lord . And that he started the war . If North Korea had turned out like South Korea , rich and democratic , then it would have been worth it . But that 's not what happened . \" China officially marked the 50th anniversary of its entry into the conflict on Wednesday with documentaries and celebrations emphasizing its victory and the righteousness of its cause . But in Internet chat rooms and in several magazines , Chinese are for the first time publicly mulling over questions that the United States , South Korea and Russia have been discussing for years . Only the Stalinist government in North Korea remains closed more tightly than China on these matters . Although subdued , the debate marks the first public criticism of the foreign policy of Mao Zedong , the dictator who steered China into the conflict . Everything else Mao did -- from his disastrous economic policies to his political campaigns that ruined millions of lives -- has been the subject of faultfinding by the Chinese . But Mao 's geopolitical strategy , which kept China at loggerheads with the West for decades after the Communist victory in 1949 , has remained untouchable until now . The first stone thrown in the debate came late last year in an article in Suibi , an obscure magazine published in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou . For the first time in China , a writer argued that Kim Il Sung started the war , that the United States had no intention of crossing the Yalu River and attacking China , and that China 's losses far outweighed its gains . The article , written by Yuan Xi , a reporter for the People 's Daily , the mouthpiece of the Communist Party , acknowledged that the war helped the Communist government consolidate its power . But it argued that the conflict also kept China out of the United Nations for more than two decades and retarded its economic and social development . The war also helped turn Japan , China 's main Asian rival , into an economic power and greatly benefited the Soviet Union , the article contended . Citing both Western research and internal reports , the article challenged Chinese official statistics , arguing that 900,000 Chinese were killed or wounded instead of the 740,000 acknowledged by China . It said that China spent $ 10 billion fighting the war , not $ 3.5 billion . It also complained that the \" free \" support promised by Joseph Stalin never arrived . China ended up owing Moscow $ 1.34 billion for \" used weaponry from World War II , \" it said . Finally , the article suggested something that Chinese scholars have discussed for years but that no one has dared to print : that Mao 's decision to enter the Korean War prevented China from recovering Taiwan . Reunification with the island remains a Holy Grail for China 's aging Communist leadership . \" Did China do right ? \" the article asked . \" Did China have a better choice ? Should the Chinese people have a new perspective about this war ? And from the lessons of this experience should we get a new understanding and appropriately confront the challenges of the future ? \" Last month , the article was attacked in the journal of the Academy of Military Science , the leading research arm of the People 's Liberation Army . Senior Col. Qi Dexue , a Korean War scholar , defended the decision to enter the conflict , arguing that doing so stymied U.S. plots to destabilize China . The war firmly placed China in the camp of the \" anti-imperialists , \" and protected China from further U.S. plots by establishing a buffer zone in North Korea , Qi wrote . \" In today 's society , there is definitely a tendency to find fault with , unveil the scars of , look for the dark side and even totally negate the history of the Communist Party , \" Qi wrote . In the murky world of Chinese politics , the debate about Korea is seen as an indirect way of questioning China 's current foreign policy . Beijing 's leadership remains wary of the West ; in recent years it has again started to lean toward Russia , from which it buys more than $ 1 billion of weapons a year . China continues to back regimes at odds with the West , such as those of ousted president Slobodan Milosevic in Yugoslavia and Saddam Hussein in Iraq , as well as those in Libya and Burma . Chinese strategists have spent years proving that the Korean War showed how China could take on powers stronger than itself , especially the United States . The army has used this as the basis of its policy of military modernization , which is aimed at conquering Taiwan and keeping the United States at bay . \" If the Korean War is shown to have been a mistake , then it calls into question the wisdom of taking on the United States over Taiwan , \" said Thomas Christensen , an expert on modern Chinese history at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . \" It raises doubts about the military 's belief that force can solve the Taiwan issue . There is really little that is more sensitive than that in China 's strategic thinking . \" In his article , Qi argued that the defeat of the 180th Division was not caused by the army 's senior officers , but by mistakes by lower - ranking soldiers . Their persecution upon returning to China was justified , he said . China 's military code does not permit its soldiers to surrender . Unlike such countries as the United States or France , where such former POWs as Arizona Sen . John McCain and the late French president Francois Mitterrand have become leading politicians , being a POW in China marks one as a traitor . For Zhang Zeshi , a Communist Party member , the criticism was even more severe . \" A revolutionary soldier is not permitted to surrender , especially a party member , \" Zhang said . \" But I think that 's a feudal idea . \" Zhang was stripped of his party membership in 1954 and , despite having a degree from prestigious Qinghua University , was forced to take a job as a high school teacher .

The interrogators etched the Chinese characters for \" Fight the Chinese Communists , Oppose the Soviet Union \" into Zhang 's left arm . During his incarceration , Zhang witnessed U.S. military police killing his comrades during a POW uprising on the island of Cheju . But after the war , Zhang -- who dug the offending words from his arm with a knife , leaving a long , white , numb trench -- was not welcomed home . For 30 years , he and thousands of other returning POWs were looked upon as traitors for failing to fight to the death and because of their close contact with Americans in POW camps . During the Cultural Revolution of 1966 - 76 , Zhang was the subject of a nationwide manhunt because he was considered an American spy . It was not until 1980 that China 's government acknowledged mistreatment of former POWs in an ambiguously worded explanation called Document 74 . But like the Korean War in the United States , what is officially called the \" War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea \" has remained very much a forgotten conflict here , with China 's role largely unexamined . Zhang and other veterans say it 's time for that to change . Fifty years after the eruption of the Korean War , a sensitive and significant debate is beginning in China . Spurred in part by the rapprochement between North and South Korea and improving ties between the United States and its old enemy in Pyongyang , Chinese scholars are for the first time posing difficult questions about the decision to send more than 1 million troops over the Yalu River into North Korea . Should China have entered the war ? Who started the war ? Were China 's losses and expenses -- estimated at almost 1 million killed or wounded and $ 10 billion -- worth it ? Why does n't China 's military code give its soldiers the right to surrender ? And , even , did China fight on the right side ? \" We were told that the war was to protect China , \" said Zhang Zeshi , another POW from the 180th Division , who is not related to Zhang Da . \" But later we discovered we were n't really fighting for China . We were fighting for [ North Korean leader ] Kim Il Sung . Then we discovered he was a feudal lord . And that he started the war . If North Korea had turned out like South Korea , rich and democratic , then it would have been worth it . But that 's not what happened . \" China officially marked the 50th anniversary of its entry into the conflict on Wednesday with documentaries and celebrations emphasizing its victory and the righteousness of its cause . But in Internet chat rooms and in several magazines , Chinese are for the first time publicly mulling over questions that the United States , South Korea and Russia have been discussing for years . Only the Stalinist government in North Korea remains closed more tightly than China on these matters . Although subdued , the debate marks the first public criticism of the foreign policy of Mao Zedong , the dictator who steered China into the conflict . Everything else Mao did -- from his disastrous economic policies to his political campaigns that ruined millions of lives -- has been the subject of faultfinding by the Chinese . But Mao 's geopolitical strategy , which kept China at loggerheads with the West for decades after the Communist victory in 1949 , has remained untouchable until now . The first stone thrown in the debate came late last year in an article in Suibi , an obscure magazine published in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou . For the first time in China , a writer argued that Kim Il Sung started the war , that the United States had no intention of crossing the Yalu River and attacking China , and that China 's losses far outweighed its gains . The article , written by Yuan Xi , a reporter for the People 's Daily , the mouthpiece of the Communist Party , acknowledged that the war helped the Communist government consolidate its power . But it argued that the conflict also kept China out of the United Nations for more than two decades and retarded its economic and social development . The war also helped turn Japan , China 's main Asian rival , into an economic power and greatly benefited the Soviet Union , the article contended . Citing both Western research and internal reports , the article challenged Chinese official statistics , arguing that 900,000 Chinese were killed or wounded instead of the 740,000 acknowledged by China . It said that China spent $ 10 billion fighting the war , not $ 3.5 billion . It also complained that the \" free \" support promised by Joseph Stalin never arrived . China ended up owing Moscow $ 1.34 billion for \" used weaponry from World War II , \" it said . Finally , the article suggested something that Chinese scholars have discussed for years but that no one has dared to print : that Mao 's decision to enter the Korean War prevented China from recovering Taiwan . Reunification with the island remains a Holy Grail for China 's aging Communist leadership . \" Did China do right ? \" the article asked . \" Did China have a better choice ? Should the Chinese people have a new perspective about this war ? And from the lessons of this experience should we get a new understanding and appropriately confront the challenges of the future ? \" Last month , the article was attacked in the journal of the Academy of Military Science , the leading research arm of the People 's Liberation Army . Senior Col. Qi Dexue , a Korean War scholar , defended the decision to enter the conflict , arguing that doing so stymied U.S. plots to destabilize China . The war firmly placed China in the camp of the \" anti-imperialists , \" and protected China from further U.S. plots by establishing a buffer zone in North Korea , Qi wrote . \" In today 's society , there is definitely a tendency to find fault with , unveil the scars of , look for the dark side and even totally negate the history of the Communist Party , \" Qi wrote . In the murky world of Chinese politics , the debate about Korea is seen as an indirect way of questioning China 's current foreign policy . Beijing 's leadership remains wary of the West ; in recent years it has again started to lean toward Russia , from which it buys more than $ 1 billion of weapons a year . China continues to back regimes at odds with the West , such as those of ousted president Slobodan Milosevic in Yugoslavia and Saddam Hussein in Iraq , as well as those in Libya and Burma . Chinese strategists have spent years proving that the Korean War showed how China could take on powers stronger than itself , especially the United States . The army has used this as the basis of its policy of military modernization , which is aimed at conquering Taiwan and keeping the United States at bay . \" If the Korean War is shown to have been a mistake , then it calls into question the wisdom of taking on the United States over Taiwan , \" said Thomas Christensen , an expert on modern Chinese history at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . \" It raises doubts about the military 's belief that force can solve the Taiwan issue . There is really little that is more sensitive than that in China 's strategic thinking . \" In his article , Qi argued that the defeat of the 180th Division was not caused by the army 's senior officers , but by mistakes by lower - ranking soldiers . Their persecution upon returning to China was justified , he said . China 's military code does not permit its soldiers to surrender . Unlike such countries as the United States or France , where such former POWs as Arizona Sen . John McCain and the late French president Francois Mitterrand have become leading politicians , being a POW in China marks one as a traitor . For Zhang Zeshi , a Communist Party member , the criticism was even more severe . \" A revolutionary soldier is not permitted to surrender , especially a party member , \" Zhang said . \" But I think that 's a feudal idea . \" Zhang was stripped of his party membership in 1954 and , despite having a degree from prestigious Qinghua University , was forced to take a job as a high school teacher . A party official forced Zhang 's fiancee to denounce him ; the official then took her as his bride . Zhang was dispatched to the countryside for almost 10 years . During the Cultural Revolution , his students placed a dunce cap on his head and called him a traitor and a spy . He was jailed and lived in a cowshed . After the Cultural Revolution , Zhang fought to restore the reputation of POWs and the fighters of the 180th Division . Backed by Gen. He Min , who persuaded Zhang and his comrades to return to China following the war , Zhang and others ultimately persuaded party leaders to issue Document 74 . That document had a direct effect on Zhang Da 's life . He came out of hiding and in the mid-1980s embraced China 's economic reforms , opening a successful Sichuanese restaurant in Beijing . \" I 'm lucky , \" said Zhang , who as a wounded POW almost lost his leg to an American surgeon 's knife . \" I've lived through it all .

EoE is a rare , chronic , inflammatory disease that occurs when eosinophils , a type of white blood cell , accumulate in the oesophagus causing injury and inflammation . 1 The FDA grants ODD status to medicines and potential new medicines intended for the treatment , diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the US . Mene Pangalos , Executive Vice President , BioPharmaceuticals R&D , said : \u201c Eosinophilic oesophagitis is an allergic inflammatory disease that can affect children and adults , and typically patients experience a range of debilitating symptoms including severe pain and difficulty swallowing food . Currently there are no FDA - approved treatments for eosinophilic oesophagitis . Because Fasenra depletes eosinophils in blood and tissue , it could become a potential new medicine to treat patients with this rare disease . \u201d Fasenra is AstraZeneca 's first respiratory biologic medicine and is currently approved as an add - on maintenance treatment for severe , eosinophilic asthma in the US , EU , Japan and other countries . In November 2018 , the FDA granted ODD for Fasenra for the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis ( EGPA ) , and also granted ODD for the treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome ( HES ) in February 2019 . About EoE EoE is a rare , chronic , inflammatory disease of the oesophagus characterised by the accumulation of eosinophils , a type of white blood cell that are a normal part of the immune system , in the oesophageal lining tissue . The disease results in injury , fibrosis and dysfunction that if not effectively treated can make eating difficult or uncomfortable , potentially leading to chronic pain , difficulty swallowing , poor growth , malnutrition and weight loss . 1 The most common symptoms of EoE include reflux that does not respond to medication , difficulty swallowing , food becoming stuck in the oesophagus , nausea and vomiting , abdominal or chest pain , poor appetite and difficulty sleeping . 1 Patients are often treated with corticosteroids to manage inflammation . Currently there are no FDA - approved treatments for EoE.1 About Fasenra Fasenra ( benralizumab ) is a monoclonal antibody that binds directly to the IL - 5 receptor alpha on eosinophils and attracts natural killer cells to induce rapid and near-complete depletion of eosinophils via apoptosis ( programmed cell death ) . 2,3 Fasenra is AstraZeneca 's first respiratory biologic , now approved as an add - on maintenance treatment in severe eosinophilic asthma in the US , EU , Japan and other countries , with further regulatory reviews ongoing . In June 2019 , the European Medicines Agency 's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) issued a positive opinion for Fasenra self - administration and the Fasenra pen , a new auto-injector delivery device . Fasenra is in development for severe nasal polyposis , eosinophilic oesophagitis , eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis , hypereosinophilic syndrome and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Fasenra was developed by AstraZeneca and is in - licensed from BioWa , Inc. , a wholly - owned subsidiary of Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. , Ltd. , Japan .

EoE is a rare , chronic , inflammatory disease that occurs when eosinophils , a type of white blood cell , accumulate in the oesophagus causing injury and inflammation . 1 The FDA grants ODD status to medicines and potential new medicines intended for the treatment , diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the US . Mene Pangalos , Executive Vice President , BioPharmaceuticals R&D , said : \u201c Eosinophilic oesophagitis is an allergic inflammatory disease that can affect children and adults , and typically patients experience a range of debilitating symptoms including severe pain and difficulty swallowing food . Currently there are no FDA - approved treatments for eosinophilic oesophagitis . Because Fasenra depletes eosinophils in blood and tissue , it could become a potential new medicine to treat patients with this rare disease . \u201d Fasenra is AstraZeneca 's first respiratory biologic medicine and is currently approved as an add - on maintenance treatment for severe , eosinophilic asthma in the US , EU , Japan and other countries . In November 2018 , the FDA granted ODD for Fasenra for the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis ( EGPA ) , and also granted ODD for the treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome ( HES ) in February 2019 . About EoE EoE is a rare , chronic , inflammatory disease of the oesophagus characterised by the accumulation of eosinophils , a type of white blood cell that are a normal part of the immune system , in the oesophageal lining tissue . The disease results in injury , fibrosis and dysfunction that if not effectively treated can make eating difficult or uncomfortable , potentially leading to chronic pain , difficulty swallowing , poor growth , malnutrition and weight loss . 1 The most common symptoms of EoE include reflux that does not respond to medication , difficulty swallowing , food becoming stuck in the oesophagus , nausea and vomiting , abdominal or chest pain , poor appetite and difficulty sleeping . 1 Patients are often treated with corticosteroids to manage inflammation . Currently there are no FDA - approved treatments for EoE.1 About Fasenra Fasenra ( benralizumab ) is a monoclonal antibody that binds directly to the IL - 5 receptor alpha on eosinophils and attracts natural killer cells to induce rapid and near-complete depletion of eosinophils via apoptosis ( programmed cell death ) . 2,3 Fasenra is AstraZeneca 's first respiratory biologic , now approved as an add - on maintenance treatment in severe eosinophilic asthma in the US , EU , Japan and other countries , with further regulatory reviews ongoing . In June 2019 , the European Medicines Agency 's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) issued a positive opinion for Fasenra self - administration and the Fasenra pen , a new auto-injector delivery device . Fasenra is in development for severe nasal polyposis , eosinophilic oesophagitis , eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis , hypereosinophilic syndrome and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Fasenra was developed by AstraZeneca and is in - licensed from BioWa , Inc. , a wholly - owned subsidiary of Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. , Ltd. , Japan .

Was there some element of their natural environment that encouraged them to experiment with an embouchure to create whistling sounds and steady tones ? This page presents some ideas on \u201c proto-flutes \u201d \u2014 natural artifacts that might have inspired the first human explorations with the basic elements of a flute : resonating air columns , creating sound using embouchure , and possibly finger holes . Note that proto-flute theories are centered mostly on creating standing waves in sound chambers using embouchures , not the crafting of stalk flutes themselves . This is a working page , in the sense that it is a collection of related items in a line of inquiry , not a complete presentation . If you have any thoughts , ideas , information , or items to contribute , please contact me . This page of Flutopedia is the combined work of Christine Oravec and Clint Goss . Items were contributed by Michael Graham Allen and Keith Stanford , as noted below . Background Work in the direction of proto-flutes was inspired by some artifacts collected by Michael Graham Allen ( a.k.a. Coyote Oldman ) \u2014 dried yucca flower stalks , hollow inside , with holes that were beautifully bored by some natural agent . I photographed them in November 2012 .

The Magic Flute In 2013 , I received a copy of The Magic Flute by Kaye Feather Robinson , now published on this site and also available as a PDF file ( [ Robinson - KW 2012 ] ) . It tells the story of an afternoon journey in October 2006 to a petroglyph site in Utah by Feather , Peter Phippen , Jan Seiden , and Cecelia Turbyville . Here 's are some excerpts : After I finished the stories , I noticed a yucca stalk on the floor . \u2026 I told Peter that the teachings were over and it was time to give an offering of Flute Music . \u2026 He saw what others did not see . He saw six small holes that tiny critters had left in the old hollow stick . \u2026 \u201c I think I can play the stick . \u201d Peter surprised everyone with this statement . I thought I knew plants and plants usages . But this was new to me . He picked up the stick and so began the music of the Yucca . With spiffy suit and shiny shoes , Peter crawled up into the circular place below the Great Teacher and began the haunting music . Time stopped . Peter forgot to look at his watch . The need to get back to the reception was no more . The World stood still and the music of the ancient ones blended with the music of today . The Ancient Flute Players came alive through Peter\u00e2s breath . Plant united with Man. Past united with Present . The Center Place was vibrating with new life . The hum of the Universe was heard once again . We were one . In June 2015 I found this description by Peter Phippen of this potential origin for the embouchure hole , the earliest mention of which I am aware . From [ Crawford 1999 b ] : I live in Wis [ consin ] and in my backyard there is a cane - like plant that bugs burrow into to hibernate for the Winter . One Spring I noticed a flute - like sound coming from one of these stalks . Upon investigating , I found that a bug had left a small hole in the side of the stalk , making a flute - like sound when the wind blew . Could early man have stumbled onto something like this ? If so , the cane or bamboo flute would have come first . Perhaps the earliest flutes were one - or two - note flutes with no holes , with the second note and possibly a few overtones ( depending on the length of the instrument ) being achieved by over blowing . Yucca and related plants The group of plants that might be considered for proto-flutes includes yucca , sotol , and agave . An excellent primer on these plants can be found on The Agaves and Nolinas page of the Saguaro - Juniper web site . | | | | Yucca plant with inflorescense . Photo courtesy of Keith Stanford These plants produce an inflorescense \u2014 a cluster of flowers arranged on a stem . The stem can be composed of a main branch or a complex arrangement of branches . The photo at the left , courtesy of Keith Stanford ( Kieta [ key - eh - tah ] ) of Cherry Cows Flutes shows a small yucca plant with two inflorescense stalks - an old , dried stalk and a new stalk emerging . Kieth describes this picture : Here are a couple of pictures I took last week down on my ranch by Tombstone , AZ . You can see the old stalk on top of this small Yucca , and the ' new ' stalk just starting to come out . These stalks grown at an unbelievable rate of about two feet per month . Ethnobotany These excerpts from [ Gibbs 2003 ] ( pages 2 - 1 and 6 - 7 ) and gives some background on the ethno-botany of yucca and related plants in the San Andres National Wildlife Refuge , New Mexico : The San Andres Mountains contain five general plant communities , including desert shrub , desert riparian , grass - shrub , mountain shrub and pi\u00c3\u00b1on juniper . Vegetation found within the San Andres National Wildlife Refuge includes needle and thread grass ( Stipa comata ) , gramma grass ( Boteuloua spp. ) , mountain mahogany ( Cercocarpus montanus ) , prickly pear cactus ( Opuntia spp. ) , agave ( Agave spp. ) , Yucca ( Yucca spp. ) , and ocotillo ( Fouquieria splendens ) . Higher elevations contain stands of pi\u00c3\u00b1on pine ( Pinus edulis ) and juniper ( Juniperus monosperma ) . Desert willow ( Chilopsis linearis ) and apache plume ( Fallugia paradoxa ) are found around springs and major drainages ( [ RMC 1998 ] ) . While still speculative , several studies of the Apache Indians can be valuable in understanding prehistoric subsistence patterns . Basehart\u00e2s ( 1973 ) study ( [ Basehart 1973 ] ) , for example , based on ethnographic research , examines water gathering , agriculture , and place names with territorial references . The study provides a long list of usable stone , animal , and plant resources in semi-desert brush , grassland , woodland , and forest ecozones . His study strongly indicates that almost every plant was of some subsistence , medicinal , or architectural value . The four wild food crops that proved most important , primarily for food storage purposes , were mescal , datil fruit from Yucca bacatta , pi\u00c3\u00b1on nuts , and mesquite beans ( [ Basehart 1973 ] ) . The majority of all the wild foods utilized by the Mescalero are known to exist within 2 km of the bajada slope ( [ Johnson - M 1991 ] ) . Who drilled the holes ? What creatures made those holes in the yucca stalks ? Several citations from ethno-botanists provide some clues . From [ Castetter 1938 ] , page 51 \u00b6 2 : Small quantities of honey , the product of large wild carpenter bees , were occasionally obtained from agave flower stalks by the Maricopa ( [ Spier 1933 ] , page 73 \u00b6 3 \u2014 see below ) , while in Havasupai territory wild carpenter bees had their hives in flower stalks of dead agave ( [ Spier 1928 ] , page 108 \u00b6 3 \u2014 see below ) . From [ Spier 1933 ] , page 73 \u00b6 3 : Honey was occasionally obtained form the flower stalks of mescal , but these contained very little . This was the product of large bees ( m \u00c5spo'kw \u00c4ni'ly \u00c8\u00a7 , \" black bee \" ) . This classification of \" bees \" is rather interesting : working bees were called flies ( xaly\u00c8\u00a7smo''kw\u00c4ly\u00c8\u00a7vi'na ) ; another bee with a yellow back ( not a hornet ) was m \u00c5spo'cilyam\u00c5'kk\u00c8\u00a7kw\u00c4's \u00c4c ; a fourth variety , resembling a was was m \u00c5spo'kw \u00c4s\u00c4 'c , \" yellow bee . \" The nests of working bees were found and the insects killed individually , but their honey was not eaten . From [ Spier 1928 ] , page 73 \u00b6 3 : Wild bees hive in dead logs and the flower stalks of dead mescal . According to Brad Young of 4 Wind Flutes , ( information he provided in an open forum for flute makers on May 4 , 2013 ) : In the desert , carpenter bee females nest in sotol and various yucca and agave bloom stalks , or they may take up residence in dead tree trunks and limbs , firewood or wooden structures . Beginning in the spring , a female , like a miniature carpenter , will burrow a half - inch - diameter horizontal tunnel so perfectly circular that it could have been produced by a power drill . She leaves , in her wake , a small pile of sawdust beneath her construction site . Within her tunnel , which extends perhaps six to 10 inches deep into wood , she excavates a gallery where she deposits her eggs . Here is a photo of a nest , or \u201c gallery \u201d , created by carpenter bees in a 2 \u00d74 piece of wood : | | | | Carpenter bee nest ( gallery ) in a 2\u00d74 piece of wood . Photo April 25 , 2011 by Wikimedia user Belchergb Here is a photo provided by Keith Stanford from his Native Yucca Stalk Flute Making Manual ( [ Stanford 2012 ] ) showing \u201c a perfect , insect - made bore , except that it is too narrow for what I wanted , so I gouged it out wider .

Photo courtesy of Keith Stanford Keith Stanford Flute maker Keith Stanford ( Kieta [ key - eh - tah ] ) of CherryCows Flutes provided a first - person experience with sotol plants and their inhabitants . From an email on May 3 , 2013 : Last summer , I harvested about a dozen Yucca - stalks and was driving down the Interstate back to Tucson . I looked in the rearview mirror and saw what appeared to be a black bat hovering near my ear . After trying to control the resulting swerve across both lanes of the highway , I was able to get my SUV stopped and I bailed out of my vehicle . Now remember , there are cars speeding by at 75 MPH and it is about 105 degrees in the shade \u2026 I was in the sun \u2026 and I am running around the vehicle like a madman trying to open all the doors . Out flew about a half dozen MONSTER - sized black bumble bees ! They came out of those large holes in the Yucca-stalks . Interesting side note , when I got back to Tucson I laid these Yucca - stalks on my work bench outside , and for about two weeks I had two black bumble bees hovering around \u2026 even after I moved the Yucca-stalks to a different location away from my house . | | | | Bee photographed by Keith Stanford Later in 2013 , Keith captured one of the critters on his cell phone . From an email on October 28 , 2013 : I was out harvesting Sotol-stalks and after I got the batch home I commenced to cutting them all to the proper length for flutes . While I was doing this , I noticed my dog , who was standing next to me , started twisting her head the way dogs do when they hear something that is ' odd ' to them . So I turned off the band - saw to see if I could hear what was of interest to her , and out popped a bee from one of the holes on the Sotol-stalk and landed on my book . ( It was buzzing quite loudly on it 's exit from the stalk , but once it exited it was quite lethargic and did n't fly off . Just sort of crawled around for a while . I think it had already passed its usefulness as an insect and was about ready to call it quits . ) I grabbed my cell phone and snapped this picture for y'all . You now have an actual picture and a bona fide witness for Flutopedia of a real live insect that made the holes in these stalks ! Evidence for Yucca Flutes in the Archaeological Literature This section is an analysis by Christine Oravec , version 3 dated April 2 , 2014 . Published reports of flutes made of yucca stalks may be found in the work of archaeologist Walter Hough . In 1901 and 1905 he accompanied expeditions to the Mogollon area of west central New Mexico . Two organizations sponsored the expeditions . The first was a group of private individuals that later founded the Southwest Museum of the Archaeological Institute of America , at that time located near Pasadena CA . The second was the United States National Museum , a division of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , DC . The artifacts collected during the expeditions were distributed between the two organizations . After the 1905 expedition Hough returned to the USNM . He eventually became head curator of anthropology and spent the rest of his career documenting the Smithsonian\u00e2s vast collection of Native American artifacts ( [ Pavesic 1999 ] , page 140 ) . Hough published two reports mentioning yucca flutes unearthed during the expeditions . The first report included only a brief statement about the instruments themselves : \u201c Music was also a pastime of these ancients , who used flutes of reed and yucca stalks \u201d ( [ Hough 1907 ] , page 27 ) . Nevertheless his identification of the artifacts as made of yucca was credible . Hough was an ethnobotanist as well as an archaeologist , and he published several articles on succulents and their use among such Southwestern native tribes as the Hopi ( [ Judd 1936 ] , page 477 ) . In 1914 Hough published another report for the Smithsonian ( [ Hough 1914 ] ) that commented upon and illustrated artifacts of flutes . These were specifically identified as excavated at the Tularosa and Bear Cave sites in the Mogollon region . Under the title \u201c Flute Pahos \u201d he included detailed descriptions and pictures of flutes made of cane , reed , yucca slats and yucca fibers . In particular , the illustration shown in Figure 330 represented a flute paho made of a single hollowed - out yucca stalk with no identifiable breath or finger holes . Note : In this section of the report Hough frequently used the term \u201c paho . \u201d Otherwise known as \u201c prayer sticks , \u201d pahos were solid pieces of wood or vegetal fiber decorated with feathers , twine and paint . They were primarily used as ceremonial objects . The Hopis , for example , inserted small sticks made of willow or cottonwood topped with feathers into the ground in front of altars during the Flute Ceremony . These sticks functioned as symbolic flutes ( [ Payne 1993 ] , pages 19 and 55 \u2013 56 ) . Apparently Hough distinguished pahos representing flutes from other kinds of pahos by their length ( from 9.25 to 12.5 inches ) , their straight shape , and the fact that they were bored from end to end . As for their functionality as musical instruments , Hough did not require that a hollow stick should display identifiable breath and finger holes to qualify as a conventional flute ( Figure 327 ) . He appeared however to be more confident when a stick did display such holes ( Figure 328 ) . Hough\u00e2s criteria evoke the possibility that some ancient Southwestern rim-blown overtone flutes may have required neither breath holes nor finger holes , in part because of their ceremonial significance . In 1950 , Paul S. Martin conducted another excavation of the Tularosa cave complex and confirmed the presence of flutes made of cane . See The Tularosa Cave Flutes . More information might be obtained from Walter Hough 's original Field Notes ( [ Hough 1905 ] ) .

This image of a rock art panel near the San Juan River , near Bluff , Utah was published in [ Manning - SJ 1992 ] , figure 20 . Manning states that the plant image \u201c resembles \u201d yucca . It was also analyzed in [ Slifer 1994 ] , figure 148 , who state ( pages 89\u201390 ) that : [ O ] ne interesting petroglyph panel portrays a row of figures : five fluteplayers to the right and four fluteplayers to the left of a centrally placed plant form ( yucca in bloom ? ) . All nine fluteplayers are phallic and wear and unusual variety of head - dresses ; one is humpbacked . Christine Oravec notes that \u201c From my personal experience , it is difficult but not impossible to distinguish rock art depictions of plants according to species . Most are corn . Having seen well - defined corn depictions , however , and noting the sheer number of flower and leaf stalks in this depiction and their relative directions with relationship to the main stalk , I think Slifer and Duffield made a pretty good guess . \u201d | | | | Nine flute players facing a central plant form .

Here are six narratives in the Origin of the Native American flute section of the Narratives page on this site , and a very brief summary of the source of the flute : - Comanche Flute Origin ( [ Bee 2006 ] ) : \u201c a man who had suffered greatly \u2026 had a dream \u2026 old cedar trees \u2026 dead branches in which the woodpeckers had drilled holes \u2026 wind blew , creating a sweet and soothing sound \u201d . - The Sound of Flutes ( [ Erdoes 1976 ] , [ Wapp 1984 ] ) : \u201c a young hunter \u2026 meat was scarce \u2026 redheaded woodpecker \u2026 alighted on a cedar tree and began tapping and hammering on a dead branch \u2026 a gust of wind \u2026 the hunter heard that beautiful sound right \u201d . - The Origin of the Courting Flute ( [ Deloria 1961 ] , [ Wapp 1984 ] ) : \u201c a youth who \u2026 loved only one maiden \u2026 heard human voices coming from a grove of trees \u2026 two \u2026 unsurpassably handsome young men \u2026 their bodies seemed to emit glimmering light \u2026 had with them a long flute and one began to play \u2026 from the mouth of this flute , which was made like that of the gar , came a sweet , piercing sound \u201d . - The Origin of the Flageolet ( [ Densmore 1923 ] , pages 80 \u2013 84 ) : \u201c Old Granny ( a.k.a. the Old Woman Who Never Dies ) \u2026 went into the field and got a large sunflower stalk .

Was there some element of their natural environment that encouraged them to experiment with an embouchure to create whistling sounds and steady tones ? This page presents some ideas on \u201c proto-flutes \u201d \u2014 natural artifacts that might have inspired the first human explorations with the basic elements of a flute : resonating air columns , creating sound using embouchure , and possibly finger holes . Note that proto-flute theories are centered mostly on creating standing waves in sound chambers using embouchures , not the crafting of stalk flutes themselves . This is a working page , in the sense that it is a collection of related items in a line of inquiry , not a complete presentation . If you have any thoughts , ideas , information , or items to contribute , please contact me . This page of Flutopedia is the combined work of Christine Oravec and Clint Goss . Items were contributed by Michael Graham Allen and Keith Stanford , as noted below . Background Work in the direction of proto-flutes was inspired by some artifacts collected by Michael Graham Allen ( a.k.a. Coyote Oldman ) \u2014 dried yucca flower stalks , hollow inside , with holes that were beautifully bored by some natural agent . I photographed them in November 2012 .

The Magic Flute In 2013 , I received a copy of The Magic Flute by Kaye Feather Robinson , now published on this site and also available as a PDF file ( [ Robinson - KW 2012 ] ) . It tells the story of an afternoon journey in October 2006 to a petroglyph site in Utah by Feather , Peter Phippen , Jan Seiden , and Cecelia Turbyville . Here 's are some excerpts : After I finished the stories , I noticed a yucca stalk on the floor . \u2026 I told Peter that the teachings were over and it was time to give an offering of Flute Music . \u2026 He saw what others did not see . He saw six small holes that tiny critters had left in the old hollow stick . \u2026 \u201c I think I can play the stick . \u201d Peter surprised everyone with this statement . I thought I knew plants and plants usages . But this was new to me . He picked up the stick and so began the music of the Yucca . With spiffy suit and shiny shoes , Peter crawled up into the circular place below the Great Teacher and began the haunting music . Time stopped . Peter forgot to look at his watch . The need to get back to the reception was no more . The World stood still and the music of the ancient ones blended with the music of today . The Ancient Flute Players came alive through Peter\u00e2s breath . Plant united with Man. Past united with Present . The Center Place was vibrating with new life . The hum of the Universe was heard once again . We were one . In June 2015 I found this description by Peter Phippen of this potential origin for the embouchure hole , the earliest mention of which I am aware . From [ Crawford 1999 b ] : I live in Wis [ consin ] and in my backyard there is a cane - like plant that bugs burrow into to hibernate for the Winter . One Spring I noticed a flute - like sound coming from one of these stalks . Upon investigating , I found that a bug had left a small hole in the side of the stalk , making a flute - like sound when the wind blew . Could early man have stumbled onto something like this ? If so , the cane or bamboo flute would have come first . Perhaps the earliest flutes were one - or two - note flutes with no holes , with the second note and possibly a few overtones ( depending on the length of the instrument ) being achieved by over blowing . Yucca and related plants The group of plants that might be considered for proto-flutes includes yucca , sotol , and agave . An excellent primer on these plants can be found on The Agaves and Nolinas page of the Saguaro - Juniper web site . | | | | Yucca plant with inflorescense . Photo courtesy of Keith Stanford These plants produce an inflorescense \u2014 a cluster of flowers arranged on a stem . The stem can be composed of a main branch or a complex arrangement of branches . The photo at the left , courtesy of Keith Stanford ( Kieta [ key - eh - tah ] ) of Cherry Cows Flutes shows a small yucca plant with two inflorescense stalks - an old , dried stalk and a new stalk emerging . Kieth describes this picture : Here are a couple of pictures I took last week down on my ranch by Tombstone , AZ . You can see the old stalk on top of this small Yucca , and the ' new ' stalk just starting to come out . These stalks grown at an unbelievable rate of about two feet per month . Ethnobotany These excerpts from [ Gibbs 2003 ] ( pages 2 - 1 and 6 - 7 ) and gives some background on the ethno-botany of yucca and related plants in the San Andres National Wildlife Refuge , New Mexico : The San Andres Mountains contain five general plant communities , including desert shrub , desert riparian , grass - shrub , mountain shrub and pi\u00c3\u00b1on juniper . Vegetation found within the San Andres National Wildlife Refuge includes needle and thread grass ( Stipa comata ) , gramma grass ( Boteuloua spp. ) , mountain mahogany ( Cercocarpus montanus ) , prickly pear cactus ( Opuntia spp. ) , agave ( Agave spp. ) , Yucca ( Yucca spp. ) , and ocotillo ( Fouquieria splendens ) . Higher elevations contain stands of pi\u00c3\u00b1on pine ( Pinus edulis ) and juniper ( Juniperus monosperma ) . Desert willow ( Chilopsis linearis ) and apache plume ( Fallugia paradoxa ) are found around springs and major drainages ( [ RMC 1998 ] ) . While still speculative , several studies of the Apache Indians can be valuable in understanding prehistoric subsistence patterns . Basehart\u00e2s ( 1973 ) study ( [ Basehart 1973 ] ) , for example , based on ethnographic research , examines water gathering , agriculture , and place names with territorial references . The study provides a long list of usable stone , animal , and plant resources in semi-desert brush , grassland , woodland , and forest ecozones . His study strongly indicates that almost every plant was of some subsistence , medicinal , or architectural value . The four wild food crops that proved most important , primarily for food storage purposes , were mescal , datil fruit from Yucca bacatta , pi\u00c3\u00b1on nuts , and mesquite beans ( [ Basehart 1973 ] ) . The majority of all the wild foods utilized by the Mescalero are known to exist within 2 km of the bajada slope ( [ Johnson - M 1991 ] ) . Who drilled the holes ? What creatures made those holes in the yucca stalks ? Several citations from ethno-botanists provide some clues . From [ Castetter 1938 ] , page 51 \u00b6 2 : Small quantities of honey , the product of large wild carpenter bees , were occasionally obtained from agave flower stalks by the Maricopa ( [ Spier 1933 ] , page 73 \u00b6 3 \u2014 see below ) , while in Havasupai territory wild carpenter bees had their hives in flower stalks of dead agave ( [ Spier 1928 ] , page 108 \u00b6 3 \u2014 see below ) . From [ Spier 1933 ] , page 73 \u00b6 3 : Honey was occasionally obtained form the flower stalks of mescal , but these contained very little . This was the product of large bees ( m \u00c5spo'kw \u00c4ni'ly \u00c8\u00a7 , \" black bee \" ) . This classification of \" bees \" is rather interesting : working bees were called flies ( xaly\u00c8\u00a7smo''kw\u00c4ly\u00c8\u00a7vi'na ) ; another bee with a yellow back ( not a hornet ) was m \u00c5spo'cilyam\u00c5'kk\u00c8\u00a7kw\u00c4's \u00c4c ; a fourth variety , resembling a was was m \u00c5spo'kw \u00c4s\u00c4 'c , \" yellow bee . \" The nests of working bees were found and the insects killed individually , but their honey was not eaten . From [ Spier 1928 ] , page 73 \u00b6 3 : Wild bees hive in dead logs and the flower stalks of dead mescal . According to Brad Young of 4 Wind Flutes , ( information he provided in an open forum for flute makers on May 4 , 2013 ) : In the desert , carpenter bee females nest in sotol and various yucca and agave bloom stalks , or they may take up residence in dead tree trunks and limbs , firewood or wooden structures . Beginning in the spring , a female , like a miniature carpenter , will burrow a half - inch - diameter horizontal tunnel so perfectly circular that it could have been produced by a power drill . She leaves , in her wake , a small pile of sawdust beneath her construction site . Within her tunnel , which extends perhaps six to 10 inches deep into wood , she excavates a gallery where she deposits her eggs . Here is a photo of a nest , or \u201c gallery \u201d , created by carpenter bees in a 2 \u00d74 piece of wood : | | | | Carpenter bee nest ( gallery ) in a 2\u00d74 piece of wood . Photo April 25 , 2011 by Wikimedia user Belchergb Here is a photo provided by Keith Stanford from his Native Yucca Stalk Flute Making Manual ( [ Stanford 2012 ] ) showing \u201c a perfect , insect - made bore , except that it is too narrow for what I wanted , so I gouged it out wider .

Photo courtesy of Keith Stanford Keith Stanford Flute maker Keith Stanford ( Kieta [ key - eh - tah ] ) of CherryCows Flutes provided a first - person experience with sotol plants and their inhabitants . From an email on May 3 , 2013 : Last summer , I harvested about a dozen Yucca - stalks and was driving down the Interstate back to Tucson . I looked in the rearview mirror and saw what appeared to be a black bat hovering near my ear . After trying to control the resulting swerve across both lanes of the highway , I was able to get my SUV stopped and I bailed out of my vehicle . Now remember , there are cars speeding by at 75 MPH and it is about 105 degrees in the shade \u2026 I was in the sun \u2026 and I am running around the vehicle like a madman trying to open all the doors . Out flew about a half dozen MONSTER - sized black bumble bees ! They came out of those large holes in the Yucca-stalks . Interesting side note , when I got back to Tucson I laid these Yucca - stalks on my work bench outside , and for about two weeks I had two black bumble bees hovering around \u2026 even after I moved the Yucca-stalks to a different location away from my house . | | | | Bee photographed by Keith Stanford Later in 2013 , Keith captured one of the critters on his cell phone . From an email on October 28 , 2013 : I was out harvesting Sotol-stalks and after I got the batch home I commenced to cutting them all to the proper length for flutes . While I was doing this , I noticed my dog , who was standing next to me , started twisting her head the way dogs do when they hear something that is ' odd ' to them . So I turned off the band - saw to see if I could hear what was of interest to her , and out popped a bee from one of the holes on the Sotol-stalk and landed on my book . ( It was buzzing quite loudly on it 's exit from the stalk , but once it exited it was quite lethargic and did n't fly off . Just sort of crawled around for a while . I think it had already passed its usefulness as an insect and was about ready to call it quits . ) I grabbed my cell phone and snapped this picture for y'all . You now have an actual picture and a bona fide witness for Flutopedia of a real live insect that made the holes in these stalks ! Evidence for Yucca Flutes in the Archaeological Literature This section is an analysis by Christine Oravec , version 3 dated April 2 , 2014 . Published reports of flutes made of yucca stalks may be found in the work of archaeologist Walter Hough . In 1901 and 1905 he accompanied expeditions to the Mogollon area of west central New Mexico . Two organizations sponsored the expeditions . The first was a group of private individuals that later founded the Southwest Museum of the Archaeological Institute of America , at that time located near Pasadena CA . The second was the United States National Museum , a division of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , DC . The artifacts collected during the expeditions were distributed between the two organizations . After the 1905 expedition Hough returned to the USNM . He eventually became head curator of anthropology and spent the rest of his career documenting the Smithsonian\u00e2s vast collection of Native American artifacts ( [ Pavesic 1999 ] , page 140 ) . Hough published two reports mentioning yucca flutes unearthed during the expeditions . The first report included only a brief statement about the instruments themselves : \u201c Music was also a pastime of these ancients , who used flutes of reed and yucca stalks \u201d ( [ Hough 1907 ] , page 27 ) . Nevertheless his identification of the artifacts as made of yucca was credible . Hough was an ethnobotanist as well as an archaeologist , and he published several articles on succulents and their use among such Southwestern native tribes as the Hopi ( [ Judd 1936 ] , page 477 ) . In 1914 Hough published another report for the Smithsonian ( [ Hough 1914 ] ) that commented upon and illustrated artifacts of flutes . These were specifically identified as excavated at the Tularosa and Bear Cave sites in the Mogollon region . Under the title \u201c Flute Pahos \u201d he included detailed descriptions and pictures of flutes made of cane , reed , yucca slats and yucca fibers . In particular , the illustration shown in Figure 330 represented a flute paho made of a single hollowed - out yucca stalk with no identifiable breath or finger holes . Note : In this section of the report Hough frequently used the term \u201c paho . \u201d Otherwise known as \u201c prayer sticks , \u201d pahos were solid pieces of wood or vegetal fiber decorated with feathers , twine and paint . They were primarily used as ceremonial objects . The Hopis , for example , inserted small sticks made of willow or cottonwood topped with feathers into the ground in front of altars during the Flute Ceremony . These sticks functioned as symbolic flutes ( [ Payne 1993 ] , pages 19 and 55 \u2013 56 ) . Apparently Hough distinguished pahos representing flutes from other kinds of pahos by their length ( from 9.25 to 12.5 inches ) , their straight shape , and the fact that they were bored from end to end . As for their functionality as musical instruments , Hough did not require that a hollow stick should display identifiable breath and finger holes to qualify as a conventional flute ( Figure 327 ) . He appeared however to be more confident when a stick did display such holes ( Figure 328 ) . Hough\u00e2s criteria evoke the possibility that some ancient Southwestern rim-blown overtone flutes may have required neither breath holes nor finger holes , in part because of their ceremonial significance . In 1950 , Paul S. Martin conducted another excavation of the Tularosa cave complex and confirmed the presence of flutes made of cane . See The Tularosa Cave Flutes . More information might be obtained from Walter Hough 's original Field Notes ( [ Hough 1905 ] ) .

This image of a rock art panel near the San Juan River , near Bluff , Utah was published in [ Manning - SJ 1992 ] , figure 20 . Manning states that the plant image \u201c resembles \u201d yucca . It was also analyzed in [ Slifer 1994 ] , figure 148 , who state ( pages 89\u201390 ) that : [ O ] ne interesting petroglyph panel portrays a row of figures : five fluteplayers to the right and four fluteplayers to the left of a centrally placed plant form ( yucca in bloom ? ) . All nine fluteplayers are phallic and wear and unusual variety of head - dresses ; one is humpbacked . Christine Oravec notes that \u201c From my personal experience , it is difficult but not impossible to distinguish rock art depictions of plants according to species . Most are corn . Having seen well - defined corn depictions , however , and noting the sheer number of flower and leaf stalks in this depiction and their relative directions with relationship to the main stalk , I think Slifer and Duffield made a pretty good guess . \u201d | | | | Nine flute players facing a central plant form .

Here are six narratives in the Origin of the Native American flute section of the Narratives page on this site , and a very brief summary of the source of the flute : - Comanche Flute Origin ( [ Bee 2006 ] ) : \u201c a man who had suffered greatly \u2026 had a dream \u2026 old cedar trees \u2026 dead branches in which the woodpeckers had drilled holes \u2026 wind blew , creating a sweet and soothing sound \u201d . - The Sound of Flutes ( [ Erdoes 1976 ] , [ Wapp 1984 ] ) : \u201c a young hunter \u2026 meat was scarce \u2026 redheaded woodpecker \u2026 alighted on a cedar tree and began tapping and hammering on a dead branch \u2026 a gust of wind \u2026 the hunter heard that beautiful sound right \u201d . - The Origin of the Courting Flute ( [ Deloria 1961 ] , [ Wapp 1984 ] ) : \u201c a youth who \u2026 loved only one maiden \u2026 heard human voices coming from a grove of trees \u2026 two \u2026 unsurpassably handsome young men \u2026 their bodies seemed to emit glimmering light \u2026 had with them a long flute and one began to play \u2026 from the mouth of this flute , which was made like that of the gar , came a sweet , piercing sound \u201d . - The Origin of the Flageolet ( [ Densmore 1923 ] , pages 80 \u2013 84 ) : \u201c Old Granny ( a.k.a. the Old Woman Who Never Dies ) \u2026 went into the field and got a large sunflower stalk .

At the time my production company Xenomania was having a lot of success , and I remember I brought this song into one of our production meetings and played it to everyone , saying that we had been \" beaten \" . In many ways it encapsulated everything we were trying to achieve : it was aggressive but catchy , very witty but also deep and believable .

Clumsy use of the mysterious nerve agent caused the deaths of at least 115 hostages in addition to disabling most of the 50 Chechen hostage - takers . The antidote being used is for the group of nerve agents related to the gas BZ , developed by the US military in the 1970s . BZ is a \" glycolate \" which attacks the central nervous system . It was developed by the US Department of Defence and is considered non-lethal if applied correctly . Russian authorities initially refused to name the gas that killed the hostages , leading to complaints that it was making their job of treating patients with antidotes much harder . Yet chemical warfare experts told the Guardian that Moscow doctors had been given an antidote by the Russian military for a rare nerve agent developed by the US military , called BZ . Professor Steven Rose , of the Open University , said a Russian counterpart had told him that doctors had been supplied the antidote from a military stockpile . \" All nerve agents , like Sarin gas and those that the Iraqis use , block the transmissions between nerve and muscle \" , said Professor Rose . \" These would produce the memory deficits that hostages have talked about . \" The symptoms usually caused by BZ match those of the hostages carried out of the building . It causes skin to be drained of colour , sweating , victims to appear concussed , possibly have respiratory problems . Victims can also experience hallucinations and huge anxiety attacks . Prof Rose said he had been in contact yesterday with a Russian counterpart , Professor Konstantin Anokhin at the Institute of Normal Physiology in Moscow , who shared his suspicions about the identity of the gas . Prof Anokhin said he had spoken to doctors treating the hostages who had been supplied by the Russian military with an antidote for general class of substances to which BZ belonged . \" BZ is a muscarnic cholinergic blocker , \" said Prof Rose . \" It affects a special type of nerve , known as a muscarnic receptor , in the brain . When it is released into the atmosphere , it gets into the lungs . It then passes through the blood stream and through the entire brain . \" Prof Rose said the agent affected the chemical acetylcholine , which carries messages from one nerve cell to another . \" BZ interacts with this and stops the message getting across \" , he added . \" It 's like turning the volume up on a radio , and stopping any changes in the signal , so the message loses all its meaning . \" The agent works on the brain and paralyses its ability to interpret what is going on . \" It turns off the lights , and destroys the body 's headquarters . \" Prof Rose added that the people least likely to be affected by the gas were the terrorists themselves as they are the healthiest and the most prepared for such a situation . \" It will affect the young and the old more than the fit , \" he said . There were many young women among the casualties carried from the theatre . \" Obviously in this case it was used in grossly high concentrations , \" he said . \" The victims appear to be the very young and old , which you would expect if it was used in a confined space . \" The gas has never been used before , Prof Rose said , except perhaps in secret , or in a US propaganda film in the 1970s , by the US Department of Defence . \" It was stockpiled and never used in the west . \" Prof Rose said he had experimented with the gas - which originally comes as a white powder mixed with a propellant , in a laboratory , but never on humans . He was not aware if the Soviet Union had obtained the gas . \" It is bound to be lethal in high concentrations , \" said Prof Rose . \" It would shut down the brain and if this happens for long enough the body stops getting oxygen and the brain itself dies . \" The use of chemical agents , whether BZ or other similar agents which attack the central nervous system , had two major implications , according to Dr Malcolm Dando , professor of international security at Bradford University 's school of peace studies , who also advises the UN .

Texas is now ours . Already , before these words are written , her Convention has undoubtedly ratified the acceptance , by her Congress , of our proffered invitation into the Union ; and made the requisite changes in her already republican form of constitution to adapt it to its future federal relations . Her star and her stripe may already be said to have taken their place in the glorious blazon of our common nationality ; and the sweep of our eagle 's wing already includes within its circuit the wide extent of her fair and fertile land . She is no longer to us a mere geographical space --a certain combination of coast , plain , mountain , valley , forest and stream . She is no longer to us a mere country on the map .

There has been enough of all this . It has had its fitting day during the period when , in common with every other possible question of practical policy that can arise , it unfortunately became one of the leading topics of party division , of presidential electioneering . But that period has passed , and with it let its prejudices and its passions , its discords and its denunciations , pass away too .

Ill betide those foul birds that delight to file their own nest , and disgust the ear with perpetual discord of ill-omened croak . Why , were other reasoning wanting , in favor of now elevating this question of the reception of Texas into the Union , out of the lower region of our past party dissensions , up to its proper level of a high and broad nationality , it surely is to be found , found abundantly , in the manner in which other nations have undertaken to intrude themselves into it , between us and the proper parties to the case , in a spirit of hostile interference against us , for the avowed object of thwarting our policy and hampering our power , limiting our greatness and checking the fulfillment of our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions . This we have seen done by England , our old rival and enemy ; and by France , strangely coupled with her against us , under the influence of the Anglicism strongly tinging the policy of her present prime minister , Guizot . The zealous activity with which this effort to defeat us was pushed by the representatives of those governments , together with the character of intrigue accompanying it , fully constituted that case of foreign interference , which Mr. Clay himself declared should , and would unite us all in maintaining the common cause of our country against foreigner and the foe . We are only astonished that this effect has not been more fully and strongly produced , and that the burst of indignation against this unauthorized , insolent and hostile interference against us , has not been more general even among the party before opposed to Annexation , and has not rallied the national spirit and national pride unanimously upon that policy . We are very sure that if Mr. Clay himself were now to add another letter to his former Texas correspondence , he would express this sentiment , and carry out the idea already strongly stated in one of them , in a manner which would tax all the powers of blushing belonging to some of his party adherents . It is wholly untrue , and unjust to ourselves , the pretence that the Annexation has been a measure of spoliation , unrightful and unrighteous -- of military conquest under forms of peace and law -- of territorial aggrandizement at the expense of justice , and justice due by a double sanctity to the weak . This view of the question is wholly unfounded , and has been before so amply refuted in these pages , as well as in a thousand other modes , that we shall not again dwell upon it . The independence of Texas was complete and absolute . It was an independence , not only in fact , but of right . No obligation of duty towards Mexico tended in the least degree to restrain our right to effect the desired recovery of the fair province once our own -- whatever motives of policy might have prompted a more deferential consideration of her feelings and her pride , as involved in the question . If Texas became peopled with an American population ; it was by no contrivance of our government , but on the express invitation of that of Mexico herself ; accompanied with such guaranties of State independence , and the maintenance of a federal system analogous to our own , as constituted a compact fully justifying the strongest measures of redress on the part of those afterwards deceived in this guaranty , and sought to be enslaved under the yoke imposed by its violation . She was released , rightfully and absolutely released , from all Mexican allegiance , or duty of cohesion to the Mexican political body , by the acts and fault of Mexico herself , and Mexico alone . There never was a clearer case . It was not revolution ; it was resistance to revolution : and resistance under such circumstances as left independence the necessary resulting state , caused by the abandonment of those with whom her former federal association had existed . What then can be more preposterous than all this clamor by Mexico and the Mexican interest , against Annexation , as a violation of any rights of hers , any duties of ours ? We would not be understood as approving in all its features the expediency or propriety of the mode in which the measure , rightful and wise as it is in itself , has been carried into effect . Its history has been a sad tissue of diplomatic blundering . How much better it might have been managed -- how much more smoothly , satisfactorily , and successfully ! Instead of our present relations with Mexico -- instead of the serious risks which have been run , and those plausibilities of opprobrium which we have had to combat , not without great difficulty , nor with entire success -- instead of the difficulties which now throng the path to a satisfactory settlement of all our unsettled questions with Mexico -- Texas might , by a more judicious and conciliatory diplomacy , have been as securely in the Union as she is now -- her boundaries defined -- California probably ours -- and Mexico and ourselves united by closer ties than ever ; of mutual friendship and mutual support in resistance to the intrusion of European interference in the affairs of the American republics . All this might have been , we little doubt , already secured , had counsels less violent , less rude , less one - sided , less eager in precipitation from motives widely foreign to the national question , presided over the earlier stages of its history . We cannot too deeply regret the mismanagement which has disfigured the history of this question ; and especially the neglect of the means which would have been so easy of satisfying even the unreasonable pretensions and the excited pride and passion of Mexico . The singular result has been produced , that while our neighbor has , in truth , no real right to blame or complain -- when all the wrong is on her side , and there has been on ours a degree of delay and forbearance , in deference to her pretensions , which is to be paralleled by few precedents in the history of other nations -- we have yet laid ourselves open to a great deal of denunciation hard to repel , and impossible to silence ; and all history will carry it down as a certain fact , that Mexico would have declared war against us , and would have waged it seriously , if she had not been prevented by that very weakness which should have constituted her best defence . We plead guilty to a degree of sensitive annoyance -- for the sake of the honor of our country , and its estimation in the public opinion of the world -- which does not find even in satisfied conscience full consolation for the very necessity of seeking consolation there . And it is for this state of things that we hold responsible that gratuitous mismanagement - wholly apart from the main substantial rights and merits of the question , to which alone it is to be ascribed ; and which had its origin in its earlier stages , before the accession of Mr. Calhoun to the department of State . California probably , next fall away from the loose adhesion which , in such a country as Mexico , holds a remote province in a slight equivocal kind of dependence on the metropolis . Imbecile and distracted , Mexico never can exert any real governmental authority over such a country . The impotence of the one and the distance of the other , must make the relation one of virtual independence ; unless , by stunting the province of all natural growth , and forbidding that immigration which can alone develop its capabilities and fulfil the purposes of its creation , tyranny may retain a military dominion , which is no government in the , legitimate sense of the term . In the case of California this is now impossible . The Anglo - Saxon foot is already on its borders . Already the advance guard of the irresistible army of Anglo - Saxon emigration has begun to pour down upon it , armed with the plough and the rifle , and marking its trail with schools and colleges , courts and representative halls , mills and meeting - houses . A population will soon be in actual occupation of California , over which it will be idle for Mexico to dream of dominion . They will necessarily become independent . All this without agency of our government , without responsibility of our people -- in the natural flow of events , the spontaneous working of principles , and the adaptation of the tendencies and wants of the human race to the elemental circumstances in the midst of which they find themselves placed . And they will have a right to independence -- to self - government -- to the possession of the homes conquered from the wilderness by their own labors and dangers , sufferings and sacrifices -a better and a truer right than the artificial tide of sovereignty in Mexico , a thousand miles distant , inheriting from Spain a title good only against those who have none better . Their right to independence will be the natural right of self - government belonging to any community strong enough to maintain it -- distinct in position , origin and character , and free from any mutual obligations of membership of a common political body , binding it to others by the duty of loyalty and compact of public faith . This will be their title to independence ; and by this title , there can be no doubt that the population now fast streaming down upon California win both assert and maintain that independence . Whether they will then attach themselves to our Union or not , is not to be predicted with any certainty . Unless the projected railroad across the continent to the Pacific be carried into effect , perhaps they may not ; though even in that case , the day is not distant when the Empires of the Atlantic and Pacific would again flow together into one , as soon as their inland border should approach each other . But that great work , colossal as appears the plan on its first suggestion , cannot remain long unbuilt . Its necessity for this very purpose of binding and holding together in its iron clasp our fast-settling Pacific region with that of the Mississippi valley -- the natural facility of the route -- the ease with which any amount of labor for the construction can be drawn in from the overcrowded populations of Europe , to be paid in die lands made valuable by the progress of the work itself -- and its immense utility to the commerce of the world with the whole eastern Asia , alone almost sufficient for the support of such a road -- these coast of considerations give assurance that the day cannot be distant which shall witness the conveyance of the representatives from Oregon and California to Washington within less time than a few years ago was devoted to a similar journey by those from Ohio ; while the magnetic telegraph will enable the editors of the \" San Francisco Union , \" the \" Astoria Evening Post , \" or the \" Nootka Morning News , \" to set up in type the first half of the President 's Inaugural before the echoes of the latter half shall have died away beneath the lofty porch of the Capitol , as spoken from his lips .

The massive explosion , thought to be caused by a fire that broke out at a storage facility containing explosive materials at the port of Beirut , has decimated large parts of the city , including many of the Beirut 's galleries , museums , and art centers . Gallery director Gaia Foudolian and prominent architect Jean - Marc Bonfils both died in the blast . The explosion flattened much of the port district and sent shockwaves that shattered windows and ceilings of buildings across the city . Beirut 's city governor Marwan Abboud said that up to 300,000 people have lost their homes because of the devastation . Lebanon 's President Michel Aoun said that a fire detonated 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate , a chemical component used in fertilizers and bombs . The chemical had been stored at the port unsafely since 2014 , according to officials . The explosion is now under investigation .

The massive explosion , thought to be caused by a fire that broke out at a storage facility containing explosive materials at the port of Beirut , has decimated large parts of the city , including many of the Beirut 's galleries , museums , and art centers . Gallery director Gaia Foudolian and prominent architect Jean - Marc Bonfils both died in the blast . The explosion flattened much of the port district and sent shockwaves that shattered windows and ceilings of buildings across the city . Beirut 's city governor Marwan Abboud said that up to 300,000 people have lost their homes because of the devastation . Lebanon 's President Michel Aoun said that a fire detonated 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate , a chemical component used in fertilizers and bombs . The chemical had been stored at the port unsafely since 2014 , according to officials . The explosion is now under investigation .

Class 221 Voyager diesels were to have covered all the Holyhead - London workings ; four of these had been built as four - car sets rather than five - car for this purpose and allocated to the Virgin West Coast franchise , all other 221s being Virgin CrossCountry stock . It had become a railway tradition to refer to locos stationed around the network for rescue purposes ' Thunderbirds ' after the famous TV show , and Virgin took this one step further by arranging for the 57/3s to be named for characters in the series . Cleverly , the first five have the final digit of their numbers the same as the relevant character 's transport in the stories . 57 301 is Scott Tracy , who piloted Thunderbird 1 , etc. 57 307 Lady Penelope has pink- backed nameplates to match the colour of the lady 's Rolls - Royce . Our picture shows 57 311 Tin Tin fresh out of the Brush works at Loughborough . In Summer 2003 , during the process of creation of the 57/3s , a change of plan occurred ; legend has it that this was brought about by the desire of North Wales MPs for a full breakfast service when travelling to London , something that the small Class 221 galley could not offer . Two weekday return workings to London would therefore be Pendolinos , hauled by Class 57 / 3s between Holyhead and Crewe . The original order for locos was increased from 12 to 16 , and the fitting of a ' Dellner ' automatic coupler to the locos was hastily designed , so that the coupling and uncoupling at Crewe could be done more quickly than by using the 390 's emergency screw - coupling as had originally been envisaged for ' dragging ' and diversion work . After 12 locos , there were no Thunderbirds characters left to use for names , so places and things from the show were resorted to for the final four . By January 2004 we were reporting that the couplers were in process of fitting , and work was under way to modify the exhaust system of the locos to prevent diesel fumes entering the 390 's air - conditioning . At one time it was thought that the 57/3 might have to push the train , but eventually this was resolved . Then the whole plan nearly foundered as it was discovered that a Pendolino , with its pantograph in the lowered position , was too high for the ' structure gauge ' in North Wales , and Network Rail had to do some work to allow them to run . But after all these problems were overcome , Pendolino service did begin in Spring 2005 . The weekday turns were , at various times , supplemented by summer weekend operations to release Class 221s to relieve overcrowding elsewhere in Britain . The two weekday trains , and some weekend workings , continued as Pendolinos until the December 2008 timetable change , after which only a single Saturday - only Pendolino return working remained . This was suspended for a while , but from May 2009 began running again , to maintain staff familairity with the procedure . By 2008 Virgin Trains had found that they had too many locos for their requirements , even though they were already hiring them out for use on timber trains to Chirk . Arriva Trains Wales were being asked by the Welsh Assembly Government to provide a loco - hauled express from North Wales to Cardiff , and Virgin Trains successfully bid to supply the locos , to be driven by ATW drivers , who were given a referesher course , as ATW had used the ' Thunderbirds ' for a while a couple of years before . The last four locos , 313 - 316 were chosen , perhaps because their ' vehicle ' names ( Tracy Island , Firefly , The Mole , FAB 1 ) not match the ' character ' names of the other twelve . 57 314 and 57 315 were de-named and re-liveried in a new version of Arriva Trains Wales colours for use on the Monday - Friday express from Holyhead to Cardiff and return , which commenced on 15 December 2008 . 57 313 and 57 316 appeared shortly afterwards , de-named , in a so-called ' neutral ' livery - the same blue but minus the lighter parts , and the logos - and are supposedly used ' when the branded locos are unavailable ' ( although in practice they appeared just as often as the branded ones ) . The Arriva service was taken over by DB Schenker Class 67s from the evening working of 26 March 2012 . In 2010 57s were replaced by Colas Rail Class 66s on timber traffic to Chirk ; from December 2009 on they could be seen on First Great Western loco - hauled trains in south - west England , but were soon removed from this duty due to unreliability . In August 2011 , six of the locos were given up by Virgin for further use by Network Rail , and were repainted in NR 's all - yellow livery . Changes were made to their couplers to allow them to haul various types of electric railcars used in the south - east . The nameplates were removed for sale in a charity auction . In March 2012 three more locos were de-branded , this time for transfer to DRS , and received DRS blue livery . In 2014 , Network Rail decided to give up its locos , and all six have passed to DRS and gained its livery . As for the four Arriva blue ones 313 - 316 , at the start of 2013 they were sold to charter train operator West Coast Railway Company and when repainted have appeared in maroon livery ; they make occasional forays to North Wales on excursions . Farewell to North Wales At the December 2012 timetable change , marking the end of Virgin 's franchse term ( although an abnormal extension was awarded to the company following much - publicised fisaco relating to the award of the next franchise ) the story of Class 57s and Pendolinos come to an end as far as the normal working of the North Wales line is concerned . It was planned to replace the solitary Saturday train with a pair of Class 221 Voyagers after the workings of 8 December , but in view of a series of problems in previous weeks , culminating in a failure to establish a control connection between loco and train on 1 December resulting in passengers being transferred to a Voyager at Crewe , it was decided to begin Voyager service a week early on 8 December , to the dismay of railfans who had hoped for a last ride . The three 57/3 locos which remained allocated to Virgin and in their livery ( 307 , 308 , 311 ) transferred to the DRS fleet , and ceased to be the maintenance responsibilty of Alstom 's Manchester Longsight depot . All are expected to receive DRS livery . By 7 December it was reported that 57 307 had already been sent to Eastleigh Works . Interestingly when it emerged in DRS blue livery the pink ' Lady Penelope ' nameplates were retained - a nice gesture by DRS . In spring 2013 57 311 was re-named simply as ' Thunderbird ' with a standard style nameplate . In future provide the Class 57/3 locomotives for ' rescue ' duty are hired by Virgin from DRS , although staffed by Virgin drivers , and will normally be located at Euston , Rugby , Crewe , Preston and Carlisle stations . DRS locos are also likely to appear from time to time on passenger charter trains in North Wales and elsewhere .

Skip to Comments Topics : Environment , Nuclear Weapons , Science Driving south on Christmas Island 's lone north- south road , Tonga Fou and I are heading to the spot where , 50 years ago , the British military detonated a couple of thermonuclear weapons . Fou , 81 , smokes USA Gold Full Flavor 100 cigarettes . As he runs a leathery hand across his forehead , he recalls his experience during one of the test explosions . Crowded onto a military vessel in case of an emergency evacuation , Fou huddled with his wife and two children . The blast shook the boat , as if it had been shoved by a deity , and everyone winced as their ears popped . About a minute after the detonation , Fou wandered on deck , looked up and thought the world was coming to an end . \u201c It was just terrible , \u201d he says . \u201c The mushroom cloud was beginning to come up , with these bright colors , like breaking waves of fire , going up , bigger and bigger , until the sky was all red . \u201d Between 1957 and 1962 , this former British colony in the equatorial Pacific played involuntary host to 30 nuclear explosions conducted by the British and U.S. militaries . Code-named Operation Grapple , Britain 's tests at Christmas ( also known as Kiritimati ) and neighboring Malden Island ranged from a 3,000 - kiloton explosion 8,200 feet in the air and far out to sea , to a 24- kiloton \u201c balloon - suspended air burst over land . \u201d ( For comparison , the bomb dropped at Hiroshima had about a 15 - kiloton yield . ) With thousands of troops , weekly DDT spraying to keep fly populations at bay , and a steady stream of boats and airplanes delivering ever more provisions , it 's safe to say that the Cold War 's tenure on Christmas Island did n't exactly follow the mindful traveler 's dictum : Take only pictures , leave only footprints . But things change , even in places where WMD have inflicted their catastrophic toll . The Partial Test Ban Treaty , signed in 1963 , brought an end to U.S. and British testing in the region . In the ' 70s , the British government followed up at Christmas with Operation Hard Look , investigating whether radioactive fallout might be found on the island and , if so , determining what to do with it . They did n't find any , although there was no shortage of trash \u2014 abandoned vehicles and drums , mostly , decaying rapidly in the humid climate . In 1975 , American surveyors drew the same conclusion about lingering radioactivity . Still , for goodwill , to avoid future liability , or both , the British recently carried out a cleanup operation on Christmas , carting away tons of decades - old debris , most of which had been concentrated in a junkyard next to the village of Banana and totaled more than 30,000 cubic yards of material . Last May , the final shipment of waste was loaded onto a vessel bound for the U.K. Fou is the last living person on Christmas Island who was here when the nukes , nuke scientists and soldiers came to town . Now only fragments of that era remain : old truck tires stacked as a makeshift fence between village huts , concrete platforms where buildings once stood , a rotted wooden backboard on a metal pole \u2014 what was once a basketball hoop for recreating servicemen \u2014 and a crumbling church constructed of dead coral and concrete . What can be found in abundance , however , is nature . In the intervening decades since the era of nuclear - weapons testing , the natural world has quietly rebounded . Today , Christmas Island , Bikini Atoll and other Cold War proving grounds , like Monte Bello north of Perth , Australia , constitute some of the most ecologically intact corners of the world , emitting not radiation but a peculiar allure ; it 's atomic tourism with a naturalist spin . Marine biologists diving at Bikini have returned with glowing reports . Inspecting a mile - wide crater left by a hydrogen bomb that exploded with a force 1,000 times greater than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima , researchers recently found the lagoon to be 80 percent covered by thriving corals , with some species growing into huge , treelike formations . Karen Koltes , a coral specialist with the U.S. Department of the Interior , says reefs around places like Bikini \u201c are among the few examples left in the world of what an ecosystem looks like absent human presence and exploitation . \u201d ( Unintentionally pouring on the irony , scientists will sometimes employ the word \u201c pristine . \u201d ) This nature - despite - nukes contrast can be seen at other former test sites , such as the waters surrounding Alaska 's Amchitka Island where , 40 years ago , the U.S. conducted three underground explosions . The same is true of the desolate dunes of a former French test site in Algeria , and even the scrublands inside the fence at the Nevada Test Site . Radioactive materials are long - lasting , which is what makes them both scary and misunderstood . The smoke detectors in your home likely contain a radionuclide called americium . But the reason to worry about them has nothing to do with radioactive material and everything to do with whether the detector 's battery is working . Contrary to popular belief , previously bombed geographies are not transformed into lifeless , poisoned landscapes for the next 50,000 years . Hiroshima and Nagasaki look just like every other bustling Japanese city , and crawling around in the grass of a city park there is no different than doing so in Seattle or Milan , Italy , or Auckland , New Zealand , at least as far as radiation hazard is concerned . But that 's not to say everything is peachy with former nuke test sites . Radioactive fallout , and the dizzyingly complex study of it , depends on factors such as microclimates , local geography , wind , altitude of detonation , size of the bomb and environmental conditions on the ground like soils , rock type and vegetation . There are places in the Pacific you do n't want to go and probably ca n't \u2014 that 's why they 're off limits . The same is true for parts of the Nevada Test Site and other detonation locations . On or around once - pummeled Pacific Islands , the matter of harmful radiation depends on where you go and whom you ask . Christmas Island , as far as anyone can tell , was always safe from radioactivity , thanks to winds that carried fallout out to sea . And in the ocean \u2014 not just around Christmas but anywhere \u2014 radioactive materials dilute quickly , rendering them essentially harmless . It 's when they 're concentrated that they can be dangerous . At places like Bikini and Rongelap Atolls in the Marshall Islands , the picture gets murkier . In the 1950s , the locals on Rongelap watched fallout , delivered on the wind , sprinkle down from above like snow . ( And this from a people who had never seen snow . ) The islanders were evacuated , only to return and then evacuate again years later because of renewed fears about perceived radiation hazards . Today , the people of Rongelap are planning to resettle their homeland yet again . The government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands wants the U.S. to cough up money and medical support for cancers caused and damage done during the era of nuclear testing . The U.S. says a previous settlement of $ 150 million should have done the trick , and this conflict remains a contentious one , at least for the Marshallese . As for existing radiation hazard , U.S. and independent scientists say there is none , although you would n't want to dine month after month on certain local plants that accumulate radioactive material . Still , it 's one thing to accept government reports declaring that a place once used for thermonuclear target practice is fallout - free and not hazardous to one 's health . It 's quite another thing to travel there on vacation . Geiger counter in hand , I hopped off the skiff and onto the coral beach at the tiny island of Motu Tabu , inside the lagoon at Christmas Island . Rain showers gave way to a mix of billowing clouds and hammering equatorial sunshine . The cacophony from the seabird colony intensified as I approached , but the thousands of noddy and sooty terns did not leave their posts , standing guard over black - speckled eggs . Encountering animals so unaccustomed to human visitors , I thought of Darwin in the Galapagos . I switched on the Geiger counter and squinted at the digital display . The readings were minuscule \u2014 0.008 , 0.003 , 0.006 milli-Roentgens per hour \u2014 numbers indicating nothing more than background radiation from the sun , and noticeably lower than the background radiation levels one would find in a typical American city . For an unconventional island adventure away from it all , Bikini may have the name recognition , but Christmas is easier for most Americans to get to \u2014 just a three - hour flight from Honolulu . The largest coral atoll on the planet , Christmas is 124 square miles of land , set in the shape of a globular crucifix , with two spits at the northern end enclosing a lagoon . ( The island first became known to the Western world when Capt. James Cook discovered it on Christmas Eve , 1777 . ) The island is perfectly \u2014 no , ridiculously \u2014 flat . The highest point is a 35 - foot-high mound , Joe 's Hill , erected by a British serviceman who was bulldozing coral and tar sands to construct the road that runs the length of the island . According to one account , he made the miniature hill as a perch for camping , preferring the seaside solitude to the military barracks . The rest of the island setting is made up of palm trees , a ubiquitous plant called saltbush , inedible crabs skittering everywhere , and sun that will burn you through a T-shirt . In 1979 , the British ceded possession of the island , and Christmas became the easternmost outpost of the scattered island nation of Kiribati . Straddling the international dateline , the country covers an area of the Pacific Ocean equal to that of the continental U.S. , even though the tiny islands together total 311 square miles . The island 's 5,000 residents subsist on international aid , tropical fish exports and scarce tourist dollars . They live in tiny villages composed of huts and yards patched together with tin , palm -thatched roofs and pigs roaming streets littered with rusting corned beef cans . The splendor of this place is out on , and in , the water . Fly- fishing enthusiasts who come to Christmas are on a pilgrimage to stalk the elusive , torpedo - fast and deceptively strong bonefish . Christmas is home to the largest bonefishing flats in the world , shallow waters in which the fish feed on tiny shrimp , sometimes revealing their whereabouts by nosing into the sand and extending their sparkling silvery tails above the waterline . When I called one fly - fishing expert who had been to Christmas to ask for a few travel tips , he said , \u201c If you go there without a fishing rod , you should be shot . \u201d Vacationing anglers , decked out in $ 100 UV - protective shirts , long - billed hats and polarized sunglasses , carrying in their rod setup and tackle cases another $ 1,500 worth of gear , spend upward of 10 hours a day wading in the calf - deep waters of the lagoon , casting shrimp - shaped flies toward their prey . The visiting sport-fishermen are so essential to the barely extant island economy that locals are , at least on paper , forbidden from eating the bonefish . ( Inedible in the eyes of most Westerners , bonefish are part of the islanders ' regular menu . ) But some non-fishing - obsessed travelers do manage to make their way to Christmas . One morning , paddling kayaks on the far side of the lagoon , Garry and Kerry Phillips of Brisbane , Australia , were delighted to spend an afternoon in a place where they did n't see another soul for hours \u2014 only manta rays gliding through the shallows . Having traveled and scuba-dived throughout the Pacific and points beyond , they were stunned by the quality of what they saw on the island of nuclear detonations . \u201c When we were looking into this trip , I did consider the weapons , \u201d recalls Garry . \u201c I wondered if it might look like a concrete wasteland or something . \u201d But after a week spent kayaking in the aquamarine flats , snorkeling among kaleidoscopic reef fish , and then , at the seabird colony , appreciating the chance to spot rare bird species such as the phoenix petrel and red-footed booby , Phillips laughed at his pre-trip preconceptions . \u201c The contrast of it is amazing . I mean , the hydrogen bomb is the most powerful and destructive thing there is , right ? Yet out here , this place , and the reefs we saw yesterday \u2014 it 's just gorgeous . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"Christmas Island","span":[54,69],"token_span":[10,11],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the place where the Agent detonates the Explosive."},{"text":"the British military","span":[311,330],"token_span":[58,60],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent detonates the Explosive."},{"text":"Between 1957 and 1962","span":[1085,1105],"token_span":[216,219],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the Agent detonates the Explosive."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"thumb |upright |8 November 1957 Round C1 \u2013 the first successful British hydrogen bomb test \u2013 detonates over Kiritimati's South East Point .

The wily predators attacked and killed two surfers and injured a third off beaches north of town , all within a month beginning in mid-May . It was a rare phenomenon that subsided after the sharks dispersed . This spring in Zihuatanejo , the sleepy neighbor of Ixtapa , surfers planning spring and summer trips will again be mindful of sharks . But they might also be concerned about Mexico 's drug war and ruthless cartel enforcers . Tourists are not likely to be affected by either of these notorious predators but anything is possible , and the drug war is not going away anytime soon . Locals wo n't soon forget the late - February grenade attack on Zihuatanejo police headquarters , followed a few days later by a highway ambush that killed four cops . This week I e-mailed longtime resident and fly-fishing guide Ed Kunze to see how things were , and he said they 're fine for tourists but a bloody mess on the drug war front .

The wily predators attacked and killed two surfers and injured a third off beaches north of town , all within a month beginning in mid-May . It was a rare phenomenon that subsided after the sharks dispersed . This spring in Zihuatanejo , the sleepy neighbor of Ixtapa , surfers planning spring and summer trips will again be mindful of sharks . But they might also be concerned about Mexico 's drug war and ruthless cartel enforcers . Tourists are not likely to be affected by either of these notorious predators but anything is possible , and the drug war is not going away anytime soon . Locals wo n't soon forget the late - February grenade attack on Zihuatanejo police headquarters , followed a few days later by a highway ambush that killed four cops . This week I e-mailed longtime resident and fly-fishing guide Ed Kunze to see how things were , and he said they 're fine for tourists but a bloody mess on the drug war front . Kunze said during the past month at least 15 people were killed in drug war violence . A police commander killed in a grenade attack was related to Kunze 's wife , Rebecca , whose mother witnessed the gunning down of a policeman as he was leaving his house . Kunze said the main route through the area , Highway 200 , is \" the only route that the narcos can take their product overland to get to the north \" and that some of that product , marijuana and opium poppies , are grown in Guerrero 's mountain villages . \" A cartel needs to have exclusive rights to a crop of a village , and it needs to be able to get it moved north , \" Kunze added .

( AP ) -- Patrick White showed there 's more to West Virginia 's offense than just handing off to Steve Slaton . White threw for a personal - best 216 yards and two touchdowns and ran for another score , and the No. 4 Mountaineers overcame Slaton 's least - productive game of the season and pulled away late in a 27 - 10 victory over East Carolina on Saturday night . \" I guess we can throw it around a little bit , \" White said . \" They did a good job of defending the run .

But coach Skip Holtz 's Pirates refused to allow the Mountaineers to run wild , leaving it up to White to make the big plays . West Virginia led just 17 - 10 early in the fourth quarter when White flipped a pass to Reynaud , who zigzagged 60 yards back across the field and through the Pirates ' defense for the clinching touchdown . \" That was a good gut check for us , \" Rodriguez said . Reynaud finished with five catches for 110 yards and became the first West Virginia player with more than 100 yards receiving since November 2004 , when Chris Henry had 118 against Boston College . West Virginia needed big passing numbers because East Carolina derailed the Mountaineers ' ground game for the second straight year . \" We probably pressed a little bit too much , \" Rodriguez said . The Mountaineers had just 153 yards rushing -- 197 fewer than its nation - leading average of 350 ; a year ago , East Carolina held West Virginia to just 127 yards rushing . James Pinkney was 20 - of - 40 for 247 yards with a touchdown for the Pirates ( 1 - 3 ) , and Aundrae Allison had four catches for 54 yards and a touchdown . But East Carolina could n't get its ground game going , either -- Brandon Fractious led the Pirates with 13 yards rushing , and the Pirates finished with 41 yards on the ground . \" We have to start running the ball to win games , \" Holtz said . \" We ca n't put the quarterback back there and have everyone know what we 're doing and let him continue to take the shots he 's taking . \" West Virginia dominated the first half , holding three - touchdown underdog East Carolina to 2 yards rushing and gaining 221 yards to the Pirates ' 87 , but led just 14 - 7 at halftime largely because of two interceptions thrown by White in the end zone . White capped West Virginia 's opening drive with a 5 - yard touchdown run , then flipped his scoring pass to Schmitt early in the second quarter to snap a 7 - all tie . Pinkney found his favorite target -- Allison -- behind the West Virginia defense for a 47 - yard touchdown pass midway through the first , tying it 7 - 7 . Pat McAfee had field goals of 26 and 29 yards in the second half for West Virginia . The Pirates closed to seven points early in the fourth on Robert Lee 's 27 - yard field goal . \" It 's frustrating to watch a team play that hard and improve as much as they have in some areas but continue to come up short , \" Holtz said .

Reynaud finished with five catches for 110 yards and became the first West Virginia player with more than 100 yards receiving since November 2004 , when Chris Henry had 118 against Boston College . West Virginia needed big passing numbers because East Carolina derailed the Mountaineers ' ground game for the second straight year . \" We probably pressed a little bit too much , \" Rodriguez said . The Mountaineers had just 153 yards rushing -- 197 fewer than its nation - leading average of 350 ; a year ago , East Carolina held West Virginia to just 127 yards rushing . James Pinkney was 20 - of - 40 for 247 yards with a touchdown for the Pirates ( 1 - 3 ) , and Aundrae Allison had four catches for 54 yards and a touchdown . But East Carolina could n't get its ground game going , either -- Brandon Fractious led the Pirates with 13 yards rushing , and the Pirates finished with 41 yards on the ground . \" We have to start running the ball to win games , \" Holtz said . \" We ca n't put the quarterback back there and have everyone know what we 're doing and let him continue to take the shots he 's taking . \" West Virginia dominated the first half , holding three - touchdown underdog East Carolina to 2 yards rushing and gaining 221 yards to the Pirates ' 87 , but led just 14 - 7 at halftime largely because of two interceptions thrown by White in the end zone . White capped West Virginia 's opening drive with a 5 - yard touchdown run , then flipped his scoring pass to Schmitt early in the second quarter to snap a 7 - all tie . Pinkney found his favorite target -- Allison -- behind the West Virginia defense for a 47 - yard touchdown pass midway through the first , tying it 7 - 7 . Pat McAfee had field goals of 26 and 29 yards in the second half for West Virginia . The Pirates closed to seven points early in the fourth on Robert Lee 's 27 - yard field goal . \" It 's frustrating to watch a team play that hard and improve as much as they have in some areas but continue to come up short , \" Holtz said .

Developed by the Museum , this exhibit showcases the important role Kiffin Rockwell and the French Foreign Legion 's Lafayette Escadrille played in the advancement of the early days of military aviation . Kiffin Yates Rockwell , born September 20 , 1892 , in Newport , Tennessee , moved to Asheville with his widowed mother , older brother , and younger sister in 1906 . As a young child , he attended the Orange Street School . Always considered handsome , intelligent , and adventurous by those who knew him , he was well educated , attending Virginia Military Institute and Washington and Lee University before leaving his educational career behind , along with his brother Paul , for a career in advertising in Atlanta . But adventure was calling , and the family 's French roots had always intrigued the brothers . So , when France found itself fighting for its very existence in World War I - prior to the United States ' entry into the war - both Kiffin and Paul volunteered for the French Foreign Legion ( the legendary French Foreign Legion , still active today , accepts foreign nationals in military service for France ) . Following service in the trenches with the infantry - during which both Paul and Kiffin received gunshot injuries that required extended recovery - Kiffin , along with six other Americans , formed the Escadrille Americaine , an airplane fighter unit that was later expanded to include thirty - one American aces and renamed the Lafayette Escadrille . Kiffin Rockwell became an overnight international sensation when he became the first American pilot to shoot down a German airplane in a dogfight in the skies over Alsace , France , on May 18 , 1916 , only five days after the unit flew its first mission . For his actions , Rockwell was awarded the Medaille Militaire and the Croix de Guirre . Rockwell was dogged in his pursuit of German enemy planes - in spite of being wounded in the face with an explosive bullet from an enemy airplane on May 26 , 1916 , he refused treatment in a French hospital and continued to fly . Unfortunately , Rockwell 's remaining days of heroism were few . On September 23 , 1916 , only four short months after his first enemy engagement , Rockwell was shot and killed over France , only two miles from where he had scored his first enemy kill . He was buried in France two days later with full military honors . He was awarded posthumously the Cross of the Legion of Honor . He was only 24 at the time of his death .

She was signed to a major record label the day after moving to Los Angeles a few years ago , but left that behind because the label did n't see her full artistic vision . The rocker , who glams it up with her platinum blond and black hairstyle and skin-tight outfits , previously landed on Virgin Records but has crafted her debut album on Universal Republic . The 25- year- old worked alongside RedOne , who 's worked with the likes of Lady Gaga and Kat DeLuna , on the effort . Black , a Detroit native , has already hit stadiums around the country on the sold - out I Am Music II tour with Lil 'Wayne , Nicki Minaj and Rick Ross . You recently wrapped up a sold - out run with Lil Wayne . What 's it like to be back home after being on the road for so long ? It feels so good . I was so excited to lay on my bed ! It 's been nice . I 'm getting to see all my friends again . Not to sound like a stalker here , but you just tweeted a picture of your bed . Tell me about some of the things hanging on your wall . I have this friend that does artwork and he did the photo of me with a gas mask and the Ol' Dirty Bastard one . I have this weird painting of a cow and a silver horse head with a Barbie riding it . I just have all sorts of weird , random stuff . My whole apartment is randomly out of control . Tell me what you 're like on stage . I noticed you tour with a full band . How 's that going over live ? I 've got a full band and two back - up dancers . We 've been getting a great reaction from people . I 'm excited . People are getting into it and they 're not really familiar with the music yet . Is life on the road something that 's easy for you to get used to ? It 's a lot of fun . Everybody on the whole tour is like family . It 's like one big party \u2013 hanging out with everybody , getting dressed up , playing shows and doing what we love to do . I 'm into it . Getting to see the country is interesting . I 'll tell you a secret here . Most people think of me as a metalhead or the rocker guy , but I quietly own every Britney Spears CD . When I first saw you and heard the single I thought , \u201c Holy shit ! It 's about time I heard something like this ! \u201d The attitude is through the roof ! Tell me a little about yourself and how Porcelain Black came to be . I 've been working in music for a while . I had a deal with Virgin Records originally and that ended up not working out . That project was called Porcelain and the Tramps . They did n't understand the vision of what we were going for . I 've had this vision for a long time . I 've always said if Britney Spears and Marilyn Manson fucked and had a kid then it would be me ! I tried to explain that to the people at Virgin and they just did n't get it . They wanted me to do an Avril Lavigne pop thing . I 'm doing music I love and this is the kind of music I love to write . I ended up meeting Red One and we started working on the record . We clicked right away and he totally got the vision . He was into it . We went in the studio and the first song we did was \u201c This Is What Rock N Roll Looks Like . \u201d Red is a total metalhead at heart , too . He used to have long hair and play in metal bands and stuff . After watching the video for \u201c This Is What Rock N Roll Looks Like , \u201d I 'm just curious what you were like in high school . Did you carry this same attitude with you then ? I only went to high school until I was 15 . I got kicked out of two high schools in three months . I faked being home schooled online until I was 16 because you ca n't legally drop out until then . My hair was always crazy , different colors . I 'm pretty much the same now . I had a mohawk . It was black and blue , then it was red . I do n't think I 've changed too much . I 've always known who I was from the beginning . I 'm still that way !

My daughter is such a psycho ! \u201d ( laughs ) Your dad was a hairdresser so he at least got to help you color your hair , right ? Yeah , yeah ! It 's funny because my mom is super-straight and is an accountant for a living . My dad was a hairdresser and played in a band and was super rock 'n roll . I know you want to hit as many people as you can with your music but what audience is going to grab onto it first ? There are so many directions it could go . I do n't know . Hopefully all different kinds of people dig it . I guess we 'll just have to wait and see . Hopefully rockers and metalheads will like it and the pop kids will like it , too . Do you do your own songwriting ? I did every song on the record with Red One except for one song called \u201c How Do You Love Someone \u201d that I did with Billy Steinberg . I write all my own stuff . I do n't understand artists that do n't write their own songs . I 'm thankful for artists like Britney , but I do n't understand how you ca n't write your own music . It 's such a personal way of expressing yourself . You 're fresh off the road now . Who are some people you 'd like to tour with ? I would like to tour with Britney . I think touring with Marilyn Manson would be dope . I think it would be fun to tour with New Kids On The Block . I would love to tour with AC / DC . That would be tight ! I love them . Rock 'n roll to me is about having a good time , being with your friends \u2013 a very positive thing . How do you see rock 'n roll ? It 's about being a badass and still being a good person . I feel like there is a lot of miscommunication when it comes to rock 'n roll . You do n't have to have that \u201c fuck you \u201d attitude . It should n't be like that . Rock 'n roll is about embracing everybody and having fun . The more the merrier and the better the party is going to be ! Rock 'n roll is about being casual and not giving a fuck . When you start giving a fuck and thinking you 're too good for people \u2013 that 's just wack .","annotations":[{"text":"I","span":[4847,4847],"token_span":[1071,1071],"role":"Experiencer","label":"Experiencer","role_definition":"The Experiencer is the person or sentient entity that experiences or feels the emotions."},{"text":"artists like Britney","span":[4929,4948],"token_span":[1088,1090],"role":"Topic","label":"Topic","role_definition":"The Topic is the general area in which the emotion occurs.

The package is designed to avoid an independent QC inquiry that the Premier League were prepared to launch to find a resolution . Watford were fifth in the Premier League when Silva was allegedly ' tapped up ' by the Toffees with regards to taking the vacancy left by Ronald Koeman 's departure . Thus followed a run of one win in 11 matches that took the Hornets to five points outside the relegation zone resulting in Silva 's sacking . Watford had placed a formal complaint with the league over Everton 's ' illegal approach ' , suggesting that Everton had turned the head of Silva whilst in charge of the Hornets and destabilised their season . The now Everton manager was said to have been interested in the job at the Merseyside club and lost the support of his players , causing a downturn in results . In a club statement confirming the sacking of Silva , Watford stated : \u201c The Club is convinced the appointment of Silva was the right one and had it not been for the unwarranted approach by a Premier League rival for his services we would have continued to prosper under his leadership . \u201c The catalyst for this decision is that unwarranted approach , something which the Board believes has seen a significant deterioration in both focus and results to the point where the long - term future of Watford FC has been jeopardised . \u201d Watford currently sit one place above Everton in eighth .

The package is designed to avoid an independent QC inquiry that the Premier League were prepared to launch to find a resolution . Watford were fifth in the Premier League when Silva was allegedly ' tapped up ' by the Toffees with regards to taking the vacancy left by Ronald Koeman 's departure . Thus followed a run of one win in 11 matches that took the Hornets to five points outside the relegation zone resulting in Silva 's sacking . Watford had placed a formal complaint with the league over Everton 's ' illegal approach ' , suggesting that Everton had turned the head of Silva whilst in charge of the Hornets and destabilised their season . The now Everton manager was said to have been interested in the job at the Merseyside club and lost the support of his players , causing a downturn in results . In a club statement confirming the sacking of Silva , Watford stated : \u201c The Club is convinced the appointment of Silva was the right one and had it not been for the unwarranted approach by a Premier League rival for his services we would have continued to prosper under his leadership . \u201c The catalyst for this decision is that unwarranted approach , something which the Board believes has seen a significant deterioration in both focus and results to the point where the long - term future of Watford FC has been jeopardised . \u201d Watford currently sit one place above Everton in eighth .

Their construction was put to a halt for the projects , most of them hydro - or thermal power plants , failed to have an environmental impact assessment according to law . All would have obvious environmental consequences if no measure is taken to curb their possible hazardous impact , so an advanced assessment on their environmental impact is necessary according to law . However , construction of these projects was launched without proper environmental assessment before hand . Hailed by media and the public as \" an environmental storm , \" SEPA 's act to halt their construction marked a departure from its old image as a rubberstamp of such wrongdoings . \" We are determination to investigate and punish any violations of environmental laws and environmental assessment is never a rubber stamp , \" says Pan Yue , deputy -director of SEPA . Interestingly , the top three on the \" black list \" were all hydro - power plants under China 's Three Gorges Project Company , which claims millions yuan of government input as key projects to alleviate the country 's energy plight and hinges on the same administrative level with SEPA . So the unprecedented campaign certainly incurred great pressure on SEPA . Yet the move won the praise from Premier Wen Jiabao , who openly applauded SEPA 's campaign at a State Council conference . Also backing the move were more than 50 environmental non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , which have enthusiastically responded by co-signing a public letter to welcome the act . Although one month later , most of the 30 halted projects resumed their construction , reportedly having passed the environmental assessment , the act that these key projects ' construction was ever suspended made a history , says an official of SEPA . SEPA alone can never guarantee the full enforcement of environmental laws and regulations , observes Prof . Wang Canfa , director of the center to help environmental victims at China University of Political Sciences and Law . In fact , according to Wang , the rate of China 's environmental laws and regulations that are actually enforced is estimated to be barely 10 percent . For instance , he notes , China 's criminal law that includes clear stipulations on crimes of serious environmental accidents took effect in 1997 . In the following five years the country recorded at least 50 serious environmental accidents a year based on official estimation , but to date no more than 20 people have been held accountable . \" This is what happens with the enforcement of criminal law that deals with the most serious cases of environmental accidents in the legal system , and you can imagine what happens to other environmental laws , \" laments Prof . Wang . A joint investigation by SEPA and Ministry of Land and Resources in 2004 shows that 30 to 40 percent of the mining construction projects went through the procedure of environment impact assessment as required , while in some areas only 6 to 7 percent did so . This partly explains why China has witnessed so many mining accidents in recent years . Wang and his colleagues started to offer legal assistance to the victims of environmental accidents five years ago , and the biggest obstacle remains in the \" environment \" to enforce law . Last year , Wang recalls , he tried to help a local fisherman in southwestern China 's Chongqing , who went bankrupt as his fish farm was poisoned by the waste water discharged into the river from a local chemical plant . The fisherman sued the chemical plant with help from Wang . But a judge from the county court told Wang matter - of - factly that a county leader had made phone calls asking favor for the chemical plant , which set the tone of verdict even before the trial . The reason was simple : the chemical plant turns is a major contributor to the local revenue . China 's central government has embraced the \" scientific approach to development , \" which emphasizes the balance between economic development and environmental sustainability . But some local officials still prioritize GDP growth over environmental protection , partly due to the current evaluation system of political performance , says a senior official from SEPA on condition of anonymity . The evaluation system is being re-structured by introducing the new concept of green GDP , which would calculate the environmental and ecological cost along with the economic growth , and the achievements may be offset if the cost is too dear . SEPA and the Organizational Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China , which is in charge of Party officials ' promotion , are studying how to incorporate environmental parameters into evaluating an official 's performance , such as overall environmental quality based on public survey , quality of air and drinking water , forest coverage and so on . While the \" economy - goes - first \" mentality lingers on the minds of many local officials , environmental departments are expected to be watchdogs to form some counter - balance . But this is not easy to realize in reality , as local environmental protection bureaus remain part of the local government , which controls their budget and staff , instead of reporting directly to SEPA . \" When you are opposed to a project out of environmental concerns , you have to think of the possible consequence , as your boss is certainly not in favor of your objection , \" says the SEPA official . To change this situation , reforms in power structure have been started on a trial basis . For two years the provincial environmental protection administration of Shaanxi in northwestern China has required the local environmental bureaus at city and county levels to directly report to the provincial administration instead of local governments , so as to guarantee their independence to enforce environmental laws and regulations despite local administrative interventions . Similar experiments have been carried out for the past ten years in dozens of large and medium - sized cities nationwide , such as Dalian , Ningbo and Xiamen . Further steps are being considered for SEPA , the theoretically highest body to enforce environmental laws and regulations , to set up monitoring mechanism directly at major sites of significant ecological or geographical values , lest local bureaus fail to function as they should . An encouraging progress in China 's enforcement of environmental laws lies in the greater public participation , evidenced by the emergence of environmental NGOs as among the most active players in China 's growing civil society . Domestic organizations like Friends of Nature have successfully launched high - profile environmental awareness campaigns among the general public for years , while international activist groups like Greenpeace have been whistle - blowing about grave environmental damages caused by multi-national companies in China . On the individual level , more and more victims have resorted to law thanks to help from professionals like Prof . Wang and his colleagues . The fisherman from Chongqing remains unbeaten even though the local judge would not support him . \" I 'm going to appeal my case to the highest court in Beijing if local courts fail to do me justice , \" he claims . \" If Beijing also fails me , I 'm going to bring my case to the United Nations ' Environment Program ! \"","annotations":[{"text":"the State Environmental Protection Administration ( SEPA )","span":[174,231],"token_span":[31,38],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent, often an institution, governmental organization, or arm thereof, puts into effect (i.e., enforces) a Rule."},{"text":"in December 2004","span":[233,248],"token_span":[39,41],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The Time at which the Agent enforces the Rule."},{"text":"China","span":[252,256],"token_span":[43,43],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place at which the Rule is or is not enforced."},{"text":"environmental laws","span":[304,321],"token_span":[52,53],"role":"Rule","label":"Rule","role_definition":"The Rule is the set of constrants on behavior that the Agent implements (i.e., forces others to obey or face consequences)."},{"text":"SEPA 's act to halt their construction","span":[871,908],"token_span":[147,153],"role":"Medium","label":"Medium","role_definition":"This role describes the medium through which the rule was enforced.

In 1097 , together with his brothers , Kim Pusik qualified in the government entrance examination on the Book of Documents . In 1115 Kim was appointed to a junior position in the Office of Remonstrance . He held positions of gradually increasing responsibility until 1124 , when he was made fourth secretary of the Board of Rites . Two years later he rose to the position of assistant inspector general . Late in 1126 Kim was dispatched as an envoy to Sung China , which was under great pressure from the J\u00fcrchen troops of Wu-ch'i-mai , the second ruler of the newly founded state of Chin in Manchuria . The Chin had superseded the Khitan Liao as the power in Manchuria and were succeeding in devasting the northern areas of Sung when envoys from Sung arrived to request Kory\u00f3 aid in dealing with the usurpers . Kim was entrusted with the task of evaluating the true situation before Kory\u00f3 would make a firm commitment ; however , when Kim 's mission reached Ming-chou , they were forced to turn back by the J\u00fcrchen . Eventually Kory\u00f3 was forced to accept nominal Chin suzerainty instead of the normal tributary relationship with Sung . Upon his return Kim was made third minister of finance and then chancellor of the National Academy in 1128 . In 1134 Kim was made field marshal and put in charge of the nation 's armies to put down a rebellion in P'y\u00f3ngyang led by the monk Myo Ch'ong , who had declared himself emperor . After putting down the rebels and restoring the Kory\u00f3 authority , Kim was rewarded for his service with grandiose titles and lands . Late in 1136 his younger brother Puch '\u00f3l , who had fought with him against the rebels , died . In 1145 Kim finished the work on his History of the Three Kingdoms ( Samguk sagi ) , which was the earliest Korean official history . In 1148 he was enfeoffed as \" Marquis - Who-Established - Loyang \" ( Nangnang ) , and he retired from public service a short time later . Kim died , 3 years after his retirement , at the age of 76 . He was given the posthumous title of Muny\u00f3l ( Grand Word ) .

Representing P'y\u00f3ngyang interests , he tried to persuade King Injong to move the capital from Songdo ( Kaes\u00f3ng ) to P'y\u00f3ngyang . He argued that the geomantic considerations involved were so propitious that the King would surely be enabled to become the ruler over all Manchuria and perhaps China as well from his new capital . Kim and his brothers were in the forefront of those who vehemently opposed Myo Ch'ong 's power play . When it became evident that he would not gain his concessions , Myo Ch'ong returned to P'y\u00f3ngyang and , together with Cho Kwang and others , he rebelled against Injong and declared himself emperor of Tawi . Kim Pusik and his brother Puch'\u00f3l , a general , were dispatched to punish the rebels .

The section of chronologies is contained in volumes 29 to 31 , and treatises on subjects such as music , geography , and officials are included in chapters 32 to 40 . The final 10 chapters constitute the section of biographies .

This Article Covers Provisioning and configuration Software developers have embraced the value of virtualization technology and are incorporating hypervisor capabilities into some software products . Nested VMMs , however , place performance - draining demands on system hardware . As hardware developers look for ways to meet these new hardware demands , VMCS shadowing has emerged to extend the capabilities of Intel - VT and provide additional flexibility in the way that system resources are virtualized and shared . Virtualization typically requires the use of one virtual machine monitor -- a hypervisor -- in order to abstract and manage the system 's computing resources . The single VMM approach works well , but continued software development is fostering a new generation of applications that effectively utilize a unique virtual machine monitor ( VMM ) that is not associated with the primary hypervisor 's VMM . This multiple - VMM environment can , however , present serious performance issues for the underlying system . Processor developers , such as Intel , are addressing this emerging problem with the introduction of a new feature called virtual machine control structure ( VMCS ) shadowing . What is VMCS and why do I need VMCS shadowing ? A virtual machine monitor is the core of a hypervisor , responsible for handling the system 's virtualized computing resources . In a typical computing environment , a system hosts a single VMM , which supports each guest virtual machine . When software such as McAfee Deep Defender incorporates a unique VMM , however , it does not share the system equally with the hypervisor 's VMM . Instead , the primary hypervisor forms a root VMM , and the VMM features of other software tools -- guest VMMs -- sit on top of the hypervisor and communicate with the system hardware through the hypervisor . Thus , the guest VMM is nested in the root VMM . Software currently controls nested VMM switching . As you might imagine , forcing a guest VMM to run through the root VMM can introduce latencies that impair the performance of workloads dependent on the guest VMM . As you introduce new software that uses additional VMMs , you need a new means of switching control between VMMs . The VMCS tracks the state of the host and guest VMs as control is handed between them . This feature of Intel - VT helps to accelerate VM switching and improve virtual server performance . Unfortunately , guest VMMs must take the time to access the root VMM and its VMCS . To overcome the performance penalties of nested VMMs , the VMCS is shadowed in hardware , which allows the guest VMM to access a VMCS directly without disrupting the root VMM . VMCS shadow access is almost as fast as a non-nested VMM environment . How is VMCS shadowing implemented on a virtualized server ? Current VMCS features are implemented on the processor as part of the Intel - VT architecture . Multi-VMM support will require the addition of VMCS shadowing , which is also implemented on the processor as part of the CPU 's virtualization capabilities . Intel currently deploys VMCS shadowing in certain fourth - generation Intel Core vPro processors , such as i5 v Pro and i7 v Pro , used in desktop and notebook systems , as well as the Xeon E5- 2600 , E5- 1600 and E3- 1200 processor families for enterprise servers . The technology should eventually appear across a wider range of enterprise processors . For multiple - VMM support , you should only require a system with a processor that has VMCS shadowing enabled in properly developed firmware . If you do not deploy software with its own VMM on the hardware platform , then the VMCS shadowing feature will not enable . Aside from VMCS shadowing , is there another method for VMM nesting ? If the system processors do not support VMCS shadowing , then the system will use software emulation instead . Unfortunately , software emulation forces the guest VMM to operate through the host VMM . In an emulation scenario , the guest VMM will take control of the system from the host VMM in order to perform a read / write task , and the guest VMM will access the VMCS used by the host VMM . When the guest VMM completes the task , it hands control back to the host VMM . An active guest VMM can disrupt the host VMM 's operation and cause significant performance degradation . VMCS shadowing creates a second ( shadow ) VMCS that the guest VMM accesses independently of the host VMM 's VMCS . Thus the guest VM does not disrupt the host VMM , which improves system performance . You must only periodically synchronize the shadow VMCS with the primary VMCS .

For multiple - VMM support , you should only require a system with a processor that has VMCS shadowing enabled in properly developed firmware . If you do not deploy software with its own VMM on the hardware platform , then the VMCS shadowing feature will not enable . Aside from VMCS shadowing , is there another method for VMM nesting ? If the system processors do not support VMCS shadowing , then the system will use software emulation instead . Unfortunately , software emulation forces the guest VMM to operate through the host VMM . In an emulation scenario , the guest VMM will take control of the system from the host VMM in order to perform a read / write task , and the guest VMM will access the VMCS used by the host VMM . When the guest VMM completes the task , it hands control back to the host VMM . An active guest VMM can disrupt the host VMM 's operation and cause significant performance degradation . VMCS shadowing creates a second ( shadow ) VMCS that the guest VMM accesses independently of the host VMM 's VMCS . Thus the guest VM does not disrupt the host VMM , which improves system performance . You must only periodically synchronize the shadow VMCS with the primary VMCS .

After climbing into the car 's back seat , he ordered Gregsten to drive off . They covered about 30 miles before the gunman ordered Gregsten to pull into a lay - by on the A6 at Clophill at around 01:30 am . Deadman 's Hill on the A6 Left for dead The man said he wanted to sleep and that he would have to tie them up . The man tied Storie 's hands behind her back with Gregsten 's tie and then saw a bag in the rear of the car with some rope . He told Gregsten to pass the bag but , as Gregsten moved , there were two shots . Gregsten was hit twice in the head and died instantly . According to Storie 's testimony , when she asked the gunman why he had shot Gregsten he replied that Gregsten had frightened him by turning too quickly . The gunman then raped Valerie Storie before shooting her five times , and leaving her for dead . She was discovered by farm labourer , Sydney Burton , at 06:45 later that morning . He ran down the road and came across John Kerr , a student occupied with taking a road census . Kerr flagged down two cars , shouting at them to get an ambulance . Investigation An identikit picture was constructed from Storie 's description , but as this differed from other descriptions provided by other witnesses , two pictures were issued . Meanwhile , the police discovered two .38 cartridge cases from a hotel room occupied on the night before the murder by Mr J Ryan ( an alias later known to be used by James Hanratty ) .

Hanratty 's initial defence was that he was in Liverpool on the day of the murder , but then , halfway through the trial , changed part of his story , claiming that he was in fact in Rhyl in North Wales , 200 miles away from the crime scene in Bedfordshire . At that time there was no conclusive forensic evidence to connect Hanratty with the car or the murder scene . Although he was a professional thief , he had no known convictions for violence , and had never owned a gun . Moreover , according to Valerie Storie , the murderer drove badly , whereas Hanratty was an experienced car thief . Hanratty did not know either of the two victims , and did not appear to have any logical motive to commit the murder .

Most of what passes for \u201c old school strength training \u201d advice \u2014 for instance here , there , or there \u2014 amounts to multi-joint barbell movements like squats , bench press , and deadlifts , a lot of volume , and fairly heavy weights . That 's pretty solid advice but calling it \u201c old school \u201d is hardly more than a term of endearment . As Jamie Lewis reminds us in Destroy the Opposition the bench press has been around for less than a century . And squats ( as we know them ) are not that much older . Since barbells appeared sometimes in the middle of the 19th century ( [ 1 ] , p.10 ) , deadlifts are not that old , either . Long before barbells , there were stones and tree trunks , but we do n't need to go that far back . Ancient Rome will do . But why should anyone care about the Romans ? The short answer is \u201c science \u201d . The details will have to wait for a sequel because I 'm already going to break my usual 1.500 - word count just to tell the story , but I promise that it will be worth it . For now , let 's get the Greeks out of the way . How the Greeks almost figured it out Ancient Greeks invented the first sport-specific piece of gym equipment . They called them halteres . [ EDIT : I incorrectly wrote halteroi in a previous version , having mistaken the article ' oi ' for the plural , which speaks volumes for my Ancient Greek skills . Thanks to Antti Ij\u00e4s for spotting the mistake . ] That 's where the French word for dumbbells ( halt\u00e8res ) comes from . They came in a variety of shapes but all had the common characteristic of being weights with handles . Ancient Greeks also seem to have understood progressive overload . The principle is illustrated in the story of Milo of Croton , a 6th century BCE wrestler who was said to have trained himself to carry a bull , beginning with carrying a calf . ( I'd rather assume that you are familiar with progressive overload . If you are not , shame on you . Still , it 's nothing that ca n't be fixed . Visit a library and shuffle through the first chapter of Pr. Zatsiorsky ' Science and Practice of Strength Training . You can also read it online but I 'm unsure about how legal it is . And there 's a Wikipedia page . Finally , if you are in a lazy mood , you can watch Chad Wesley Smith talking about it on YouTube but he 's making it more complicated than it actually is , and the background music is annoying . ) So , why not credit the Greeks ? For two reasons : - dumbbell training was mostly developed by Romans , and : - Milo 's story may not reflect a scientific understanding of progressive overload . As for ( 1 ) , halteres were used in Greece primarily as counterweights for jump training . The most common were of the shape depicted in the right - hand picture and held at arm 's length to gain momentum in the long jump . Now , there is some textual evidence that other models were used for a handful of accessory exercises , like curls , lunges , and some sort of swing ( [ 1 ] , p. 1 ) . Since function usually dictates form , swinging halteres may have looked like modern kettlebells ( where modern means \u201c 16th century and onward \u201d and not \u201c after Pavel Tsatsouline defected to the West \u201d ) . Still , it was not until the 2nd century CE that Roman physician Galen compiled halteres exercises for the whole body . Galen 's interest in physical culture continued a long history of Roman concern for physical fitness as a civic virtue ( I'll come back to that ) . Moreover , Galen 's treatises on hygiene \u2014 in particular , De Sanitate Tuenda ( \u201c On the preservation of health \u201d ) \u2014 were still being used as strength training textbooks well into the 19th century , when barbells gradually supplanted dumbbells , and new exercises were developed . As for ( 2 ) , the origin of the notion that the Greeks understood progressive overload is that stories agree that it took about 4 years to Milo to develop the strength to carry a bull . But we know that the calf - to - bull story is most likely a fabrication aimed at comparing Milo with Hercules whose author never knew Milo . The time frame was probably dictated by the internal logic of the tale , something like : \u201c Milo could carry a bull just like Hercules , but he was not a demigod . It must have taken a few years to develop the strength . How long does it take for a calf to grow into a bull already ? \u201d So , exit the Greeks . Let 's jump to 107 BCE , one of the most important years in the history Rome and ( for much of the same reason ) in the history of fitness . ' The Year of the Consulship of Ravilla and Marius ' In 107 BCE , Rome is the only superpower left in the Mediterranean . Forty - odd years earlier ( 146 BCE ) Rome has dealt once and for all with its archenemy Carthage , putting an end to centuries of political , economic and military rivalry . The same year , Roman legions sacked Corinth and added the Peloponnese to the Roman province of Macedonia , putting an end to centuries of inferiority complex towards the Greeks . And yet , Roman legions are embroiled in a low-intensity conflict against rebel forces led by Jugurtha in Numidia ( still nominally an ally of Rome ) and are playing hide - and - seek with German invaders in Transalpine Gaul ( a Roman province ) . The body count is nowhere near what it used to be during the Carthaginian wars , but the operations have been dragging for years , fueling sourpuss conversations in the motherland . Gaius Marius , one of the two consuls elected for this year , has promised to put a swift end to the Numidian war . A military genius who has served under Metellus , commander of the legions in Numidia , Marius has run on a simple electoral platform : crush the enemy , see them driven before him , and hear the lamentation of their women get the boys back home . On the campaign trail , Marius implied ( with good reason ) that high - ranking Roman officers were not above taking bribes not to attack the enemy . This , he said , would explain the protracted war in Numidia . Marius is not a conspiracy - theory - loving populist and his half - veiled accusations hide a deeper concern ( I'll come to that soon ) . But the Senate did not like them and has retaliated in its usual passive - aggressive manner , nitpicking on the legal details to avoid transferring the imperium over the Numidian legions from Metellus to Marius . While Marius and his allies are trying to get around the Senate , word comes of a possible barbarian invasion of Cisalpine Gaul . The fear of a barbarian invasion is just what Marius needed . Roman fitness is about to change forever . Fitness , a forgotten civic duty Until 107 BCE , Roman levies depended on the wealth - based census , essentially because Roman soldiers had to purchase their own equipment . There was no formal military training , boot camp , or the like . Getting in fighting shape and learning the basics of martial arts was a civic duty . Mastery would come with field experience . And for those citizens who could afford their equipment and were eligible for military duty , field experience had never been in short supply . Since its foundation , Rome had conducted almost non-stop military business against enemy foreign and domestic , on its own or on behalf of allies . Consequently , citizens from census classes eligible for levies had been almost guaranteed to be part of a legion once in their life . Furthermore , an impeccable military record had become a condition to run for the lucrative offices of the Republic , and a reputation of heroism was always welcome \u2014 something that Marius knew well . Thus , generation after generation of wealthy Romans had had powerful incentives to get and stay in fighting shape : survive wars first in order to line their pocket with tax money later serve the Republic in both war and peace . But the victory against Carthage has changed it all . General officers could now capitalize on Rome 's reputation without going into battle too often ( \u201c How much would you pay me not to level your city like Scipio did to Carthago ? \u201d ) . The rank- and - file of the legions was beginning to lack of field experience . And citizens eligible for duty do not see the point of spending as much time and money for martial training as they once had . Soon , Romans citizens will be too out - of - shape to be of real military value . Marius ' mules Fear of a barbarian invasion in Italy gave Marius the opportunity he needed to recruit the first ever professional army in the history of Rome . Census classes eligible for military duty had been depleted by the Numidian and Gallic operations . With no wealthy Romans to send against Barbarians , Marius convinced the Senate to lift the census requirement and let him recruit professional soldiers . This required a huge investment in equipment and food , but Marius placated the cheeseparing Senate by agreeing that soldiers would repay their equipment and food with their wages . Marius then set to enlist the capite censi ( literally : the \u201c head count \u201d ) whose numbers had swelled in the last hundred years or so , following an unprecedented job crisis created by an influx of cheap slaves . These Romans were nominally citizens but did not own property worth registering in the census , and were \u201c counted by the head \u201d rather than ranked by the wealth . They were not allowed to vote , let alone run for office , and had no prospect whatsoever of upward social mobility . Given the right incentive , they would rush to enroll . And thus Marius ' supporters in the Senate passed a law guaranteeing that after completing a 16 - year engagement , veterans would receive a pension and a plot of land in the province they had helped pacifying . In other words , surviving veterans were guaranteed to make it into the census ( with all its collaterals ) . This gave the disenfranchised masses the same incentives to serve the Republic as wealthier Romans . But the capite censi was underfed , lived in unsanitary conditions , and was overall badly out of shape . All of which Marius had anticipated . Marius had designed a military fitness curriculum to whip the lowly plebs recruits into fighting shape . He had based it on his vision of a new army ( mobile , self - reliant and tireless ) , and had even poached from the private sector the toughest drill instructors he could find ( gladiatorial school trainers ) . By the end of Marius ' basic training , Roman legionaries could wake up at dawn , break camp in an orderly fashion , walk all day at an average of 5.3 km / hr [ 2 ] while carrying 25 kilograms ( 55 lbs ) of equipment ( including food rations ) , set a fortified camp with protective ditch and earth-and - timber wall , cook and eat porridge for dinner , sleep , wake up at dawn and go kick barbarian ass . Day-in , day out . As fresh as if they had just returned from R&R in Campania . Wealthy Romans were all too happy to leave the increasingly tiresome military business to the penniless masses . They would later mock the new breed of professional soldiers , calling them muli mariani , \u201c Marius ' mules \u201d ( Note to Latin buffs : mulus also means \u201c stupid \u201d . The translation \u201c Marius ' ass \u201d would thus convey the same kind of connotation as mulus marianus . ) To be continued The Cisalpine invasion never came and Marius concluded the Numidian affair without raising new legions . He outmaneuvered the Senate , took command of the legions already in Numidia , and he terminated the war using back - channel negotiations of the very kind he had campaigned against . But the law was in place . Three years later , after one of the worst military disaster in Roman history , the Senate would call upon Marius again to end the terror cimbricus ( \u201c Cimbric terror \u201d ) in Transalpine Gaul . Marius ' professionally - trained soldiers would prevail against the enemy , and survive battle after battle . Less than a century later , so many veterans had retired in good a shape that there was not enough land to grant them in the provinces . The Republic was forced to transfer executive powers to generals such as Gaius Julius Caesar , Mark Antony , and Octavian , who would undertake expansion wars ( in all but name ) in order to solve the \u201c veteran crisis \u201d . One could well say that Marius ' training regimen was a contributing factor to the end of the Republic and the beginning of the Empire . This should be no surprise : the training regimen of the Roman legion was pretty much what the latest science would recommend for forging elite fitness . This will be the topic of a follow - up , someday . But I can already tell you that it did not look like Cross*it .

Most of what passes for \u201c old school strength training \u201d advice \u2014 for instance here , there , or there \u2014 amounts to multi-joint barbell movements like squats , bench press , and deadlifts , a lot of volume , and fairly heavy weights . That 's pretty solid advice but calling it \u201c old school \u201d is hardly more than a term of endearment . As Jamie Lewis reminds us in Destroy the Opposition the bench press has been around for less than a century . And squats ( as we know them ) are not that much older . Since barbells appeared sometimes in the middle of the 19th century ( [ 1 ] , p.10 ) , deadlifts are not that old , either . Long before barbells , there were stones and tree trunks , but we do n't need to go that far back . Ancient Rome will do . But why should anyone care about the Romans ? The short answer is \u201c science \u201d . The details will have to wait for a sequel because I 'm already going to break my usual 1.500 - word count just to tell the story , but I promise that it will be worth it . For now , let 's get the Greeks out of the way . How the Greeks almost figured it out Ancient Greeks invented the first sport-specific piece of gym equipment . They called them halteres . [ EDIT : I incorrectly wrote halteroi in a previous version , having mistaken the article ' oi ' for the plural , which speaks volumes for my Ancient Greek skills . Thanks to Antti Ij\u00e4s for spotting the mistake . ] That 's where the French word for dumbbells ( halt\u00e8res ) comes from . They came in a variety of shapes but all had the common characteristic of being weights with handles . Ancient Greeks also seem to have understood progressive overload . The principle is illustrated in the story of Milo of Croton , a 6th century BCE wrestler who was said to have trained himself to carry a bull , beginning with carrying a calf . ( I'd rather assume that you are familiar with progressive overload . If you are not , shame on you . Still , it 's nothing that ca n't be fixed . Visit a library and shuffle through the first chapter of Pr. Zatsiorsky ' Science and Practice of Strength Training . You can also read it online but I 'm unsure about how legal it is . And there 's a Wikipedia page . Finally , if you are in a lazy mood , you can watch Chad Wesley Smith talking about it on YouTube but he 's making it more complicated than it actually is , and the background music is annoying . ) So , why not credit the Greeks ? For two reasons : - dumbbell training was mostly developed by Romans , and : - Milo 's story may not reflect a scientific understanding of progressive overload . As for ( 1 ) , halteres were used in Greece primarily as counterweights for jump training . The most common were of the shape depicted in the right - hand picture and held at arm 's length to gain momentum in the long jump . Now , there is some textual evidence that other models were used for a handful of accessory exercises , like curls , lunges , and some sort of swing ( [ 1 ] , p. 1 ) . Since function usually dictates form , swinging halteres may have looked like modern kettlebells ( where modern means \u201c 16th century and onward \u201d and not \u201c after Pavel Tsatsouline defected to the West \u201d ) . Still , it was not until the 2nd century CE that Roman physician Galen compiled halteres exercises for the whole body . Galen 's interest in physical culture continued a long history of Roman concern for physical fitness as a civic virtue ( I'll come back to that ) . Moreover , Galen 's treatises on hygiene \u2014 in particular , De Sanitate Tuenda ( \u201c On the preservation of health \u201d ) \u2014 were still being used as strength training textbooks well into the 19th century , when barbells gradually supplanted dumbbells , and new exercises were developed . As for ( 2 ) , the origin of the notion that the Greeks understood progressive overload is that stories agree that it took about 4 years to Milo to develop the strength to carry a bull . But we know that the calf - to - bull story is most likely a fabrication aimed at comparing Milo with Hercules whose author never knew Milo . The time frame was probably dictated by the internal logic of the tale , something like : \u201c Milo could carry a bull just like Hercules , but he was not a demigod . It must have taken a few years to develop the strength . How long does it take for a calf to grow into a bull already ? \u201d So , exit the Greeks . Let 's jump to 107 BCE , one of the most important years in the history Rome and ( for much of the same reason ) in the history of fitness . ' The Year of the Consulship of Ravilla and Marius ' In 107 BCE , Rome is the only superpower left in the Mediterranean . Forty - odd years earlier ( 146 BCE ) Rome has dealt once and for all with its archenemy Carthage , putting an end to centuries of political , economic and military rivalry . The same year , Roman legions sacked Corinth and added the Peloponnese to the Roman province of Macedonia , putting an end to centuries of inferiority complex towards the Greeks . And yet , Roman legions are embroiled in a low-intensity conflict against rebel forces led by Jugurtha in Numidia ( still nominally an ally of Rome ) and are playing hide - and - seek with German invaders in Transalpine Gaul ( a Roman province ) . The body count is nowhere near what it used to be during the Carthaginian wars , but the operations have been dragging for years , fueling sourpuss conversations in the motherland . Gaius Marius , one of the two consuls elected for this year , has promised to put a swift end to the Numidian war . A military genius who has served under Metellus , commander of the legions in Numidia , Marius has run on a simple electoral platform : crush the enemy , see them driven before him , and hear the lamentation of their women get the boys back home . On the campaign trail , Marius implied ( with good reason ) that high - ranking Roman officers were not above taking bribes not to attack the enemy . This , he said , would explain the protracted war in Numidia . Marius is not a conspiracy - theory - loving populist and his half - veiled accusations hide a deeper concern ( I'll come to that soon ) . But the Senate did not like them and has retaliated in its usual passive - aggressive manner , nitpicking on the legal details to avoid transferring the imperium over the Numidian legions from Metellus to Marius . While Marius and his allies are trying to get around the Senate , word comes of a possible barbarian invasion of Cisalpine Gaul . The fear of a barbarian invasion is just what Marius needed . Roman fitness is about to change forever . Fitness , a forgotten civic duty Until 107 BCE , Roman levies depended on the wealth - based census , essentially because Roman soldiers had to purchase their own equipment . There was no formal military training , boot camp , or the like . Getting in fighting shape and learning the basics of martial arts was a civic duty . Mastery would come with field experience . And for those citizens who could afford their equipment and were eligible for military duty , field experience had never been in short supply . Since its foundation , Rome had conducted almost non-stop military business against enemy foreign and domestic , on its own or on behalf of allies . Consequently , citizens from census classes eligible for levies had been almost guaranteed to be part of a legion once in their life . Furthermore , an impeccable military record had become a condition to run for the lucrative offices of the Republic , and a reputation of heroism was always welcome \u2014 something that Marius knew well . Thus , generation after generation of wealthy Romans had had powerful incentives to get and stay in fighting shape : survive wars first in order to line their pocket with tax money later serve the Republic in both war and peace . But the victory against Carthage has changed it all . General officers could now capitalize on Rome 's reputation without going into battle too often ( \u201c How much would you pay me not to level your city like Scipio did to Carthago ? \u201d ) . The rank- and - file of the legions was beginning to lack of field experience . And citizens eligible for duty do not see the point of spending as much time and money for martial training as they once had . Soon , Romans citizens will be too out - of - shape to be of real military value . Marius ' mules Fear of a barbarian invasion in Italy gave Marius the opportunity he needed to recruit the first ever professional army in the history of Rome . Census classes eligible for military duty had been depleted by the Numidian and Gallic operations . With no wealthy Romans to send against Barbarians , Marius convinced the Senate to lift the census requirement and let him recruit professional soldiers . This required a huge investment in equipment and food , but Marius placated the cheeseparing Senate by agreeing that soldiers would repay their equipment and food with their wages . Marius then set to enlist the capite censi ( literally : the \u201c head count \u201d ) whose numbers had swelled in the last hundred years or so , following an unprecedented job crisis created by an influx of cheap slaves . These Romans were nominally citizens but did not own property worth registering in the census , and were \u201c counted by the head \u201d rather than ranked by the wealth . They were not allowed to vote , let alone run for office , and had no prospect whatsoever of upward social mobility . Given the right incentive , they would rush to enroll . And thus Marius ' supporters in the Senate passed a law guaranteeing that after completing a 16 - year engagement , veterans would receive a pension and a plot of land in the province they had helped pacifying . In other words , surviving veterans were guaranteed to make it into the census ( with all its collaterals ) . This gave the disenfranchised masses the same incentives to serve the Republic as wealthier Romans . But the capite censi was underfed , lived in unsanitary conditions , and was overall badly out of shape . All of which Marius had anticipated . Marius had designed a military fitness curriculum to whip the lowly plebs recruits into fighting shape . He had based it on his vision of a new army ( mobile , self - reliant and tireless ) , and had even poached from the private sector the toughest drill instructors he could find ( gladiatorial school trainers ) . By the end of Marius ' basic training , Roman legionaries could wake up at dawn , break camp in an orderly fashion , walk all day at an average of 5.3 km / hr [ 2 ] while carrying 25 kilograms ( 55 lbs ) of equipment ( including food rations ) , set a fortified camp with protective ditch and earth-and - timber wall , cook and eat porridge for dinner , sleep , wake up at dawn and go kick barbarian ass . Day-in , day out . As fresh as if they had just returned from R&R in Campania . Wealthy Romans were all too happy to leave the increasingly tiresome military business to the penniless masses . They would later mock the new breed of professional soldiers , calling them muli mariani , \u201c Marius ' mules \u201d ( Note to Latin buffs : mulus also means \u201c stupid \u201d . The translation \u201c Marius ' ass \u201d would thus convey the same kind of connotation as mulus marianus . ) To be continued The Cisalpine invasion never came and Marius concluded the Numidian affair without raising new legions . He outmaneuvered the Senate , took command of the legions already in Numidia , and he terminated the war using back - channel negotiations of the very kind he had campaigned against . But the law was in place . Three years later , after one of the worst military disaster in Roman history , the Senate would call upon Marius again to end the terror cimbricus ( \u201c Cimbric terror \u201d ) in Transalpine Gaul . Marius ' professionally - trained soldiers would prevail against the enemy , and survive battle after battle . Less than a century later , so many veterans had retired in good a shape that there was not enough land to grant them in the provinces . The Republic was forced to transfer executive powers to generals such as Gaius Julius Caesar , Mark Antony , and Octavian , who would undertake expansion wars ( in all but name ) in order to solve the \u201c veteran crisis \u201d . One could well say that Marius ' training regimen was a contributing factor to the end of the Republic and the beginning of the Empire . This should be no surprise : the training regimen of the Roman legion was pretty much what the latest science would recommend for forging elite fitness . This will be the topic of a follow - up , someday . But I can already tell you that it did not look like Cross*it .

His extradition was , however , not to proceed smoothly as Pinochet applied to have the arrest warrant quashed on the grounds that as a former Head of State he enjoyed immunity from criminal proceedings . By a decision of 25 November 1998 , the House of Lords in a 3:2 majority held that Pinochet was not entitled to immunity from criminal proceedings and could therefore be extradited . back to top Procedural history On 16 October 1998 , a Spanish judge issued an international arrest warrant for the Respondent , Augusto Pinochet Ugarte . In order to respond to the need to execute the international arrest warrant as the Respondent was at the time in England on a medical visit and due to depart to Chile the following day , a Metropolitan Magistrate issued a provisional arrest warrant on the grounds that between 1973 and 1983 he murdered Spanish citizens in Chile . This arrest warrant was deficient as the offence on which it was based was not an extraditable offence . Consequently , on 18 October 1998 , the Spanish judge issued a second international arrest warrant for the Respondent ( see here in Spanish only ) . That same day , a second provisional arrest warrant was issued by another Metropolitan Magistrate on the grounds that between 1988 and 1992 the Respondent committed , inter alia , acts of torture and hostage taking . On 23 October 1998 , the Respondent was arrested in England . On 22 and 26 October , the Respondent applied to quash the first and second provisional arrest warrants respectively . On 28 October 1998 , the High Court granted the Respondent leave to apply for a writ of certiorari . At the same time , the first arrest warrant was quashed . The quashing of the second arrest warrant was stayed pending an appeal to the House of Lords , the highest court in England . Hearings before the House of Lords were heard on 4 , 5 and 9 to 12 November 1998 . back to top Related developments Pinochet petitioned the House of Lords to set aside its decision of 25 November 1998 on the grounds of an appearance of bias between one of the members of the Appellate Committee , Lord Hoffmann , and Amnesty International , the human rights organisation who was admitted as intervener in the appeal . By a decision of 17 December 1998 , the decision of 25 November 1998 was set aside ( see also ' The Law Lords and the General ' , The Economist , 17 December 1998 ) . Pinochet was therefore entitled to a new hearing on his original immunity claim . By a decision of 24 March 1999 , the House of Lords held that Pinochet does not enjoy immunity in respect of acts of torture committed after the entry into force of the 1984 Torture Convention for the UK , that is after 8 December 1988 . In response to questions about the Respondent 's allegedly fragile state of health , the Home Secretary ruled in January 2000 that the Respondent should not be extradited . Accordingly , by a decision of 2 March 2000 , the Home Secretary ordered the release of the Respondent who returned to Chile ( see ' Pinochet Set Free ' , BBC News , 2 March 2000 ) . On 8 August 2000 , the Supreme Court of Chile voted to strip Pinochet of the immunity he enjoyed by virtue of his parliamentary position . On 1 December 2000 , Pinochet was indicted for the kidnapping of 75 political opponents ( see ' Pinochet Charged with Kidnapping ' , BBC News , 1 December 2000 On 11 December 2000 , the Court of Appeal of Santiago halted the proceedings for medical reasons . On 30 January 2001 , the judge reissued the arrest warrant for Pinochet but proceedings were again halted for medical reasons . In July 2002 , the Supreme Court of Chile dismissed Pinochet 's indictment in the various cases against him for medical reasons ( see ' Pinochet Arrest Ordered ' , BBC News , 30 January 2001 ) . Shortly after the decision , Pinochet resigned from the Senate but continued to enjoy immunity from prosecution by virtue of a constitutional amendment that was brought about in 2000 . On 8 September 2006 , the Supreme Court of Chile stripped Pinochet of his immunity ( see ' Court Lifts Pinochet Immunity ' , BBC News , 8 September 2006 ) . On 30 October 2006 , Pinochet was charged with 36 counts of kidnapping , 23 counts of torture , and one of murder for the torture and disappearance of opponents of his regime at Villa Grimaldi ( see Human Rights Watch , ' Chile : Pinochet Finally Faces Torture Charges ' ) . On 28 November 2006 , Pinochet was placed under house arrest ; he died twelve days later , on 10 December 2006 . back to top Legally relevant facts On 11 September 1973 , General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte assumed power in Chile after a military coup . He was appointed president of the governing military junta on the same day . On 22 September 1973 , the new regime was recognised by the British government . By a decree of 11 December 1974 , General Pinochet assumed the title of President of the Republic . Following democratic elections in December 1989 , General Pinochet handed over power to President Aylwin on 11 March 1990 ( p. 24 ) . back to top Core legal questions back to top - Is the Respondent entitled to immunity either by virtue of State immunity or Head of State immunity ?

Court 's holding and analysis It is necessary to distinguish between three different principles . First , State immunity , as codified in Part I of 1978 State Immunity Act. Second , personal immunity of Heads of State , codified in Part II of the same Act . Third , the act of State doctrine , which remains a common law matter ( p. 43 ) . Although State immunity under Part I extends to Heads of State , it does not apply in respect of criminal proceedings ( p. 44 ) . The act of State doctrine is inapplicable in the present instance as Parliament has shown that the conduct with which the Respondent is charged is a justiciable matter before the English courts by enacting section 134 ( 1 ) of the 1988 Criminal Justice Act defining torture and section 1 ( 1 ) of the 1982 Taking Hostages Act ( p. 45 ) . With respect to personal immunity , section 20 of the 1978 State Immunity Act confers immunity from criminal proceedings upon Heads of State . Following an interpretation of Article 39 ( 2 ) of 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations , incorporated by reference , this immunity extends to former Heads of State in respect of official acts ( p. 46 ) . Official acts are those recognised by international law as functions of a Head of State , irrespective of the terms of individual 's domestic constitution . Accordingly , acts of torture and hostage taking are not functions of a Head of State and therefore no immunity can attach to them in respect of criminal proceedings ( p. 47 ) .

On the east the Barlik ranges rose to an altitude of 9,500 ft. , and , far away in the dim distance , the loftier snows of the Ala-tau lifted themselves into the blue ; but , separating us from them , was a break in the mountain - wall , -a deep - cut depression dividing the Siberian plains from the Dzungarian deserts , and lying between the ramparts of the Ala-tau on the west and those of the Barlik on the east . We had frequently heard of the terrors , dangers , and winds of the Dzungarian Gate . We had read the records of such early travellers as Carpini and Rubruck , both of whom mentioned that \u201c there blows nearly continuously such a wind through this valley , that persons cross it with great danger , lest the wind should carry them into the sea . \u201d We therefore approached this remarkable geological phenomenon both with interest and a certain amount of anxiety , for the weather was unusually unsettled , snow - clouds were threatening us , and we were unwilling our caravan should be \u201c blown away into the sea . \" Even at a distance , with the Dzungarian Gate lying before us \u2014 unseen , we instinctively became aware of its presence ; for when we came within sight of Ala Kul , whilst crossing the open foot -hills of the Barlik Range 1 The Barlik proper overlooks the Dzungarian Gate on the east . We found the natives using Barlik for the whole mountain - group to the oast . I use the term , therefore , to include the Chagan-oba , the Dzusau , and the Maili ranges . some twenty miles from the lake - shore and some 2,000 ft . above it , we were in absolute stillness ; and yet , strangely enough , the waters of Ala Kul were tossed into waves the white crests being clearly seen with a glass , while even with the naked eye breakers could be distinguished dashing on to the southern shore of an island in the middle of the lake . Although we were becalmed , there was evidently a gale blowing through the \u201c Gate , \" and as we approached nearer we became at every step more keenly alive to the action of this wind - trough . At night we heard a distant roar as the imprisoned winds of the Dzungarian deserts escaped through this narrow defile . The only night we camped on the very shore of the straits , the wind increased to such a violence that our tents , though well protected in a valley , were by the morning all blown away , for the wind swept in great gusts over the hills , and the back eddies tore them down ; the noise was terrific , and sleep out of the question . This wind came from the south , but threatening storm - clouds to the north made us far more uneasy . Fortunately we succeeded in crossing the depression in a nine hours ' trek without mishap , a strong head - wind being the only cause for annoyance . Had there been rain or snow falling , travelling would have been impossible , but the wind was luckily from the south and comparatively warm , the temperature at night only just touching freezing - point . Only just in time did we escape from this home of the winds , for the day after crossing the valley , \u2014 when travelling southwards along its western flanks , \u2014 the wind swung round to the north and swept cruelly through the gap , bringing with it hail and frozen snow . Had we then been journeying north wards the making of any headway would have been out of the question , for neither man nor beast could have faced the elements ; travelling as we were \u2014 with the wind \u2014 we endured the cold and congratulated ourselves on our fortunate escape . A bleak , inhospitable landscape now surrounded us , mountains , clad in fresh snow , showed up here and there through breaks in the blurred atmosphere , and great cloud - banks swept through the straits , \" as if rushing through some gigantic funnel . We enjoyed no rest until we were safely ensconced in the broken and wind - worn granite range lying to the north - west of Ebi Nor .

On the east the Barlik ranges rose to an altitude of 9,500 ft. , and , far away in the dim distance , the loftier snows of the Ala-tau lifted themselves into the blue ; but , separating us from them , was a break in the mountain - wall , -a deep - cut depression dividing the Siberian plains from the Dzungarian deserts , and lying between the ramparts of the Ala-tau on the west and those of the Barlik on the east . We had frequently heard of the terrors , dangers , and winds of the Dzungarian Gate . We had read the records of such early travellers as Carpini and Rubruck , both of whom mentioned that \u201c there blows nearly continuously such a wind through this valley , that persons cross it with great danger , lest the wind should carry them into the sea . \u201d We therefore approached this remarkable geological phenomenon both with interest and a certain amount of anxiety , for the weather was unusually unsettled , snow - clouds were threatening us , and we were unwilling our caravan should be \u201c blown away into the sea . \" Even at a distance , with the Dzungarian Gate lying before us \u2014 unseen , we instinctively became aware of its presence ; for when we came within sight of Ala Kul , whilst crossing the open foot -hills of the Barlik Range 1 The Barlik proper overlooks the Dzungarian Gate on the east . We found the natives using Barlik for the whole mountain - group to the oast . I use the term , therefore , to include the Chagan-oba , the Dzusau , and the Maili ranges . some twenty miles from the lake - shore and some 2,000 ft . above it , we were in absolute stillness ; and yet , strangely enough , the waters of Ala Kul were tossed into waves the white crests being clearly seen with a glass , while even with the naked eye breakers could be distinguished dashing on to the southern shore of an island in the middle of the lake . Although we were becalmed , there was evidently a gale blowing through the \u201c Gate , \" and as we approached nearer we became at every step more keenly alive to the action of this wind - trough . At night we heard a distant roar as the imprisoned winds of the Dzungarian deserts escaped through this narrow defile . The only night we camped on the very shore of the straits , the wind increased to such a violence that our tents , though well protected in a valley , were by the morning all blown away , for the wind swept in great gusts over the hills , and the back eddies tore them down ; the noise was terrific , and sleep out of the question . This wind came from the south , but threatening storm - clouds to the north made us far more uneasy . Fortunately we succeeded in crossing the depression in a nine hours ' trek without mishap , a strong head - wind being the only cause for annoyance . Had there been rain or snow falling , travelling would have been impossible , but the wind was luckily from the south and comparatively warm , the temperature at night only just touching freezing - point . Only just in time did we escape from this home of the winds , for the day after crossing the valley , \u2014 when travelling southwards along its western flanks , \u2014 the wind swung round to the north and swept cruelly through the gap , bringing with it hail and frozen snow . Had we then been journeying north wards the making of any headway would have been out of the question , for neither man nor beast could have faced the elements ; travelling as we were \u2014 with the wind \u2014 we endured the cold and congratulated ourselves on our fortunate escape . A bleak , inhospitable landscape now surrounded us , mountains , clad in fresh snow , showed up here and there through breaks in the blurred atmosphere , and great cloud - banks swept through the straits , \" as if rushing through some gigantic funnel . We enjoyed no rest until we were safely ensconced in the broken and wind - worn granite range lying to the north - west of Ebi Nor .

On the face of it , the practice of dyeing or \" painting \" the fish seems fairly innocuous and the artificially dyed specimens are certainly very eye-catching in their various \" day-glo \" colours . So why push for a voluntary ban on selling them ? Our investigations have revealed the truth behind the dyed fish saga . Disco fish Our first encounter with dyed fish was back in the late 1980's . Thousands of artificially coloured glassfish , Parambassis ranga ( formerly Chanda ranga ) were imported into the UK . The glassfish , so named because of its naturally semi-transparent body , obviously makes it an ideal subject for \" painting \" . They were seen with fluorescent shades of either blue , purple , red , yellow , orange or green produced by dyes . They were ( and still are ) imported under the names \" painted glassfish \" or \" disco fish \" ( presumably because their almost fluorescent colours resemble discotheque lights ) . How is the dye applied ? Intrigued as to how the dye was applied we decided to carry out a little research . A few coloured glassfish were sedated in MS222 anaesthetic and observed under a binocular microscope . It became apparent that the dye is not on the surface of the fish , but lay under the epidermis . Furthermore , the dye appeared fluid and could be moved slightly by gently squeezing the coloured area . This suggested that it must have been injected into the fish at various sites over the body in order to form the distinctive colour patterns . Our fears were confirmed a few years later when we were shown photographs of the colouring process , revealing that each fish is individually injected using a syringe and needle . The practice of dye injection is undertaken by fish farmers in some regions of Asia ( but not Singapore as far as we know ) . Clearly , the common name \" painted glassfish \" is a cruelly misleading description . If one considers the relative bore size of the injection needle with that of a glassfish , it would be the equivalent of us receiving several jabs using a needle of pencil-sized diameter - not a pleasant thought . As experienced fish scientists , we would never dream of injecting fish of such small size . No wonder the injection process is alleged to cause high mortalities . Increasing the risk of disease ... A survey which we carried out in the south of England revealed that over 40 % of painted glassfish appeared to be suffering from lymphocystis virus . This disease manifests itself as a small whitish growths on the fish 's body and fins . An examination of the white growths under the powerful electron microscope confirmed our diagnosis . In contrast , less than 10 % of the natural ( unpainted ) glassfish had lymphocystis . It is possible that the injection process increases the risk of this disease , perhaps by transmitting the virus from fish to fish via the needle ( the same needle is used to inject tens or even hundreds of fish ) . Alternatively , the stress of being injected with the dye may lower the fish 's natural immunity to lymphocystis . It must be said that , in our experience , those glassfish which survive the injection process go on to live fairly normal lives , despite the gaudy dyes present within their bodies . In time , the dye fades . Moral issue Many people believe that fish do not feel pain and so injecting them with dyes is perfectly acceptable . In fact , increasing scientific evidence suggests that fish are indeed capable of feeling pain , though we have no way of telling whether they perceive painful events in the same way as we do . So dye injection is likely to be a painful experience for the poor glassfish . In fairness , many traders and hobbyists were mislead , just as we first were , into thinking that these fish were simply painted with the dye . Now that the truth is out , it 's time to stop this cruel practice , once and for all .

We have observed the following artificially coloured fish in the UK , and suspect there may be others .

Compare Aesch . Seven 1005 ff . A different version of the story is told by Hyginus , Fab. 72 . According to him , when Antigone was caught in the act of performing funeral rites for her brother Polynices , Creon handed her over for execution to his son Haemon , to whom she had been betrothed . But Haemon , while he pretended to put her to death , smuggled her out of the way , married her , and had a son by her . In time the son grew up and came to Thebes , where Creon detected him by the bodily mark which all descendants of the Sparti or Dragon - men bore on their bodies . In vain Herakles interceded for Haemon with his angry father . Creon was inexorable ; so Haemon killed himself and his wife Antigone . Some have thought that in this narrative Hyginus followed Euripides , who wrote a tragedy Antigone , of which a few fragments survive . See TGF ( Nauck 2nd ed. ) , pp. 404ff . 2 As to the flight of Adrastus to Athens , and the intervention of the Athenians on his behalf see Isoc. 4.54 - 58 ; Isoc. 12.168-174 ; Paus. 1.39.2 ; Plut. Thes. 29 ; Statius , Theb. xii.464ff. , \uff08 who substitutes Argive matrons as suppliants instead of Adrastus\uff09 . The story is treated by Euripides in his extant play The Suppliants , which , on the whole , Apollodorus follows . But whereas Apollodorus , like Statius , lays the scene of the supplication at the altar of Mercy in Athens , Euripides lays it at the altar of Demeter in Eleusis \uff08 Eur. Supp. 1 ff.\uff09. In favour of the latter version it may be said that the graves of the fallen leaders were shown at Eleusis , near the Flowery Well \uff08 Paus. 1.39.1 ff . ; Plut . Thes. 29 \uff09 ; while the graves of the common soldiers were at Eleutherae , which is on the borders of Attica and Boeotia , on the direct road from Eleusis to Thebes \uff08 Eur. Supp. 756 ff . ; Plut . Thes. 29 \uff09 . Tradition varied also on the question how the Athenians obtained the permission of the Thebans to bury the Argive dead . Some said that Theseus led an army to Thebes , defeated the Thebans , and compelled them to give up the dead Argives for burial . This was the version adopted by Euripides , Statius , and Apollodorus . Others said that Theseus sent an embassy and by negotiations obtained the voluntary consent of the Thebans to his carrying off the dead . This version , as the less discreditable to the Thebans , was very naturally adopted by them \uff08 Paus. 1.39.2 \uff09 and by the patriotic Boeotian Plutarch , who expressly rejects Euripides 's account of the Theban defeat . Isocrates , with almost incredible fatuity , adopts both versions in different passages of his writings and defends himself for so doing \uff08 Isoc. 12.168 -174 \uff09 . Lysias , without expressly mentioning the flight of Adrastus to Athens , says that the Athenians first sent heralds to the Thebans with a request for leave to bury the Argive dead , and that when the request was refused , they marched against the Thebans , defeated them in battle , and carrying off the Argive dead buried them at Eleusis . See Lys. 2.7-10 . 3 As to the altar of Mercy at Athens see above Apollod . 2.8.1 ; Paus. 1.17.1 , with my note \uff08vol . ii. pp. 143ff.\uff09 ; Diod. 13.22.7 ; Statius , Theb. xii.481-505 . It is mentioned in a late Greek inscription found at Athens \uff08 Corpus Inscriptionum Atticarum , iii .170 ; G. Kaibel , Epigrammata Graeca ex lapidibus conlecta 792 \uff09 . The altar , though not mentioned by early writers , was in later times one of the most famous spots in Athens . Philostratus says that the Athenians built an altar of Mercy as the thirteenth of the gods , and that they poured libations on it , not of wine , but of tears \uff08 Philostratus , Epist. 39 \uff09 . In this fancy he perhaps copied Statius , Theb. xii.488 , \u201c lacrymis altaria sudant \u201d . 4 The branch of olive which a suppliant laid on the altar of a god in token that he sought the divine protection . See Andoc. 1.110 ff . ; Jebb on Sophocles , OT 3 . 5 For the death of Evadne on the pyre of her husband Capaneus , see Eur. Supp. 1034 ff . ; Zenobius , Cent. i.30 ; Prop. i.15.21 ff . ; Ovid , Tristia v.14.38 ; Ovid , Pont. iii.1.111 ff . ; Hyginus , Fab. 243 ; Statius , Theb. xii.800ff. , with the note of Lactantius Placidus on Statius , Theb. v. 801 ; Martial iv . 75.5 . Capaneus had been killed by a thunderbolt as he was mounting a ladder at the siege of Thebes . See Apollod . 3.6.7 . Hence his body was deemed sacred and should have been buried , not burned , and the grave fenced off ; whereas the other bodies were all consumed on a single pyre . See Eur. Supp. 934-938 , where \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03ae\u03be\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf \u03bd refers to the fencing in of the grave . So the tomb of Semele , who was also killed by lightning , seems to have stood within a sacred enclosure . See Eur. Ba. 6 - 11 . Yet , inconsistently with the foregoing passage , Euripides appears afterwards to assume that the body of Capaneus was burnt on a pyre \uff08 Eur. Supp. 1000 ff .\uff09. The rule that a person killed by a thunderbolt should be buried , not burnt , is stated by Pliny , Nat. Hist. ii.145 and alluded to by Tertullian , Apologeticus 48 . An ancient Roman law , attributed to Numa , forbade the celebration of the usual obsequies for a man who had been killed by lightning . See Festus , s.v. \u201c Occisum , \u201d p. 178 , ed. C. O. M\u00fcller . It is true that these passages refer to the Roman usage , but the words of Eur. Supp. 934-938 seem to imply that the Greek practice was similar , and this is confirmed by Artemidorus , who says that the bodies of persons killed by lightning were not removed but buried on the spot \uff08 Artemidorus , Onirocrit. ii.9 \uff09. The same writer tells us that a man struck by lightning was not deemed to be disgraced , nay , he was honoured as a god ; even slaves killed by lightning were approached with respect , as honoured by Zeus , and their dead bodies were wrapt in fine garments . Such customs are to some extent explained by the belief that Zeus himself descended in the flash of lightning ; hence whatever the lightning struck was naturally regarded as holy . Places struck by lightning were sacred to Zeus the Descender \uff08 \u0396\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \uff09 and were enclosed by a fence . Inscriptions marking such spots have been found in various parts of Greece . See Pollux ix.41 ; Paus. 5.14.10 , with \uff08 Frazer , Paus. vol. iii. p. 565 , vol. v. p. 614 \uff09 . Compare E. Rohde , Psyche ( 3 ) , i.320 ff . ; H. Useher , \u201c Keraunos , \u201d Kleine Schriften , iv.477 ff . , \uff08 who quotes from Clemens Romanus and Cyrillus more evidence of the worship of persons killed by lightning \uff09 ; Chr. Blinkenberg , The Thunder-weapon in Religion and Folklore \uff08 Cambridge , 1911 \uff09 , pp. 110 ff . Among the Ossetes of the Caucasus a man who has been killed by lightning is deemed very lucky , for they believe that he has been taken by St. Elias to himself . So the survivors raise cries of joy and sing and dance about him .

Compare Aesch . Seven 1005 ff . A different version of the story is told by Hyginus , Fab. 72 . According to him , when Antigone was caught in the act of performing funeral rites for her brother Polynices , Creon handed her over for execution to his son Haemon , to whom she had been betrothed . But Haemon , while he pretended to put her to death , smuggled her out of the way , married her , and had a son by her . In time the son grew up and came to Thebes , where Creon detected him by the bodily mark which all descendants of the Sparti or Dragon - men bore on their bodies . In vain Herakles interceded for Haemon with his angry father . Creon was inexorable ; so Haemon killed himself and his wife Antigone . Some have thought that in this narrative Hyginus followed Euripides , who wrote a tragedy Antigone , of which a few fragments survive . See TGF ( Nauck 2nd ed. ) , pp. 404ff . 2 As to the flight of Adrastus to Athens , and the intervention of the Athenians on his behalf see Isoc. 4.54 - 58 ; Isoc. 12.168-174 ; Paus. 1.39.2 ; Plut. Thes. 29 ; Statius , Theb. xii.464ff. , \uff08 who substitutes Argive matrons as suppliants instead of Adrastus\uff09 . The story is treated by Euripides in his extant play The Suppliants , which , on the whole , Apollodorus follows . But whereas Apollodorus , like Statius , lays the scene of the supplication at the altar of Mercy in Athens , Euripides lays it at the altar of Demeter in Eleusis \uff08 Eur. Supp. 1 ff.\uff09. In favour of the latter version it may be said that the graves of the fallen leaders were shown at Eleusis , near the Flowery Well \uff08 Paus. 1.39.1 ff . ; Plut . Thes. 29 \uff09 ; while the graves of the common soldiers were at Eleutherae , which is on the borders of Attica and Boeotia , on the direct road from Eleusis to Thebes \uff08 Eur. Supp. 756 ff . ; Plut . Thes. 29 \uff09 . Tradition varied also on the question how the Athenians obtained the permission of the Thebans to bury the Argive dead . Some said that Theseus led an army to Thebes , defeated the Thebans , and compelled them to give up the dead Argives for burial . This was the version adopted by Euripides , Statius , and Apollodorus . Others said that Theseus sent an embassy and by negotiations obtained the voluntary consent of the Thebans to his carrying off the dead . This version , as the less discreditable to the Thebans , was very naturally adopted by them \uff08 Paus. 1.39.2 \uff09 and by the patriotic Boeotian Plutarch , who expressly rejects Euripides 's account of the Theban defeat . Isocrates , with almost incredible fatuity , adopts both versions in different passages of his writings and defends himself for so doing \uff08 Isoc. 12.168 -174 \uff09 . Lysias , without expressly mentioning the flight of Adrastus to Athens , says that the Athenians first sent heralds to the Thebans with a request for leave to bury the Argive dead , and that when the request was refused , they marched against the Thebans , defeated them in battle , and carrying off the Argive dead buried them at Eleusis . See Lys. 2.7-10 . 3 As to the altar of Mercy at Athens see above Apollod . 2.8.1 ; Paus. 1.17.1 , with my note \uff08vol . ii. pp. 143ff.\uff09 ; Diod. 13.22.7 ; Statius , Theb. xii.481-505 . It is mentioned in a late Greek inscription found at Athens \uff08 Corpus Inscriptionum Atticarum , iii .170 ; G. Kaibel , Epigrammata Graeca ex lapidibus conlecta 792 \uff09 . The altar , though not mentioned by early writers , was in later times one of the most famous spots in Athens . Philostratus says that the Athenians built an altar of Mercy as the thirteenth of the gods , and that they poured libations on it , not of wine , but of tears \uff08 Philostratus , Epist. 39 \uff09 . In this fancy he perhaps copied Statius , Theb. xii.488 , \u201c lacrymis altaria sudant \u201d . 4 The branch of olive which a suppliant laid on the altar of a god in token that he sought the divine protection . See Andoc. 1.110 ff . ; Jebb on Sophocles , OT 3 . 5 For the death of Evadne on the pyre of her husband Capaneus , see Eur. Supp. 1034 ff . ; Zenobius , Cent. i.30 ; Prop. i.15.21 ff . ; Ovid , Tristia v.14.38 ; Ovid , Pont. iii.1.111 ff . ; Hyginus , Fab. 243 ; Statius , Theb. xii.800ff. , with the note of Lactantius Placidus on Statius , Theb. v. 801 ; Martial iv . 75.5 . Capaneus had been killed by a thunderbolt as he was mounting a ladder at the siege of Thebes . See Apollod . 3.6.7 . Hence his body was deemed sacred and should have been buried , not burned , and the grave fenced off ; whereas the other bodies were all consumed on a single pyre . See Eur. Supp. 934-938 , where \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03ae\u03be\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf \u03bd refers to the fencing in of the grave . So the tomb of Semele , who was also killed by lightning , seems to have stood within a sacred enclosure . See Eur. Ba. 6 - 11 . Yet , inconsistently with the foregoing passage , Euripides appears afterwards to assume that the body of Capaneus was burnt on a pyre \uff08 Eur. Supp. 1000 ff .\uff09. The rule that a person killed by a thunderbolt should be buried , not burnt , is stated by Pliny , Nat. Hist. ii.145 and alluded to by Tertullian , Apologeticus 48 . An ancient Roman law , attributed to Numa , forbade the celebration of the usual obsequies for a man who had been killed by lightning . See Festus , s.v. \u201c Occisum , \u201d p. 178 , ed. C. O. M\u00fcller . It is true that these passages refer to the Roman usage , but the words of Eur. Supp. 934-938 seem to imply that the Greek practice was similar , and this is confirmed by Artemidorus , who says that the bodies of persons killed by lightning were not removed but buried on the spot \uff08 Artemidorus , Onirocrit. ii.9 \uff09. The same writer tells us that a man struck by lightning was not deemed to be disgraced , nay , he was honoured as a god ; even slaves killed by lightning were approached with respect , as honoured by Zeus , and their dead bodies were wrapt in fine garments . Such customs are to some extent explained by the belief that Zeus himself descended in the flash of lightning ; hence whatever the lightning struck was naturally regarded as holy . Places struck by lightning were sacred to Zeus the Descender \uff08 \u0396\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \uff09 and were enclosed by a fence . Inscriptions marking such spots have been found in various parts of Greece . See Pollux ix.41 ; Paus. 5.14.10 , with \uff08 Frazer , Paus. vol. iii. p. 565 , vol. v. p. 614 \uff09 . Compare E. Rohde , Psyche ( 3 ) , i.320 ff . ; H. Useher , \u201c Keraunos , \u201d Kleine Schriften , iv.477 ff . , \uff08 who quotes from Clemens Romanus and Cyrillus more evidence of the worship of persons killed by lightning \uff09 ; Chr. Blinkenberg , The Thunder-weapon in Religion and Folklore \uff08 Cambridge , 1911 \uff09 , pp. 110 ff . Among the Ossetes of the Caucasus a man who has been killed by lightning is deemed very lucky , for they believe that he has been taken by St. Elias to himself . So the survivors raise cries of joy and sing and dance about him . His relations think it their duty to join in these dances and rejoicings , for any appearance of sorrow would be regarded as a sin against St. Elias and therefore punishable . The festival lasts eight days . The deceased is dressed in new clothes and laid on a pillow in the exact attitude in which he was struck and in the same place where he died . At the end of the celebrations he is buried with much festivity and feasting , a high cairn is erected on his grave , and beside it they set up a tall pole with the skin of a black he-goat attached to it , and another pole , on which hang the best clothes of the deceased .

He was lucky to have all the major competition surgically removed by a combination of the stewards and a fast-starting Villeneuve , but pulled away steadily until his stop on lap 34 . The race changed complexion for everyone as rain started to fall , but Schumacher reacted quickest and pitted for rain tyres - to the cost of his team mate , who pitted the same lap to find no tyres out for him . An incident on lap 47 , where he understeered off the racetrack and skated over the grass - only to recover unabated - was the only real drama , the result of a slight brake niggle . \" Because of the problems at the back we had guessed what to do about it and put the brake balance completely to the front and I locked up going into turn one , \" explained Schumacher . \" The car went sliding straight into the gravel trap so I decided it was such an easy gravel area I would carry on going through it rather that spin the car . But it was n't really a worry . \" The Ferrari star led away from the start , to be followed by David Coulthard . The Scot was left solely to challenge Schumacher in the early stages of the race , but a storm was already brewing - in more ways than one . An incident before the race even started was to prove Coulthard 's downfall . Unbeknown to the championship second - place man , the stewards were preparing to bring him in for a ten second stop- and - go - penalty . Coulthard had discovered , to his anguish , that his clutch had developed a fault as the cars sat on the grid before the parade lap . He signalled to his crew , and as the thirty - second signal sounded , the crew were attempting to rectify the fault . The problem was solved just as the signal sounded , but Coulthard had already become a victim of the rule book . Any competitor who experiences trouble as the fifteen second signal sounds must raise his arm and wait until the cars have left the grid before receiving assistance , according the regulations . This was unequivocally breached by the team , and so Coulthard would be set to drop from hero - second - to zero - ninth - in the space of a lap . \" I do not want to criticise anyone because the rules are the rules but the FIA should allow the stewards to show some common sense if someone does not gain an advantage , \" said Coulthard . \" This is what turns people off the sport . They were deprived of a race . \" The Scot was deprived of more than just a race , as six points went begging . His complaints came to no avail , and he later admitted that he had , in fact , stalled the car . The race changed complexion for everyone as rain started to fall , which it threatened to do on lap 22 , and then did in earnest 22 laps later . Further back , Jacques Villeneuve got a blinder of a getaway and leapt into fourth by the first turn . As Barrichello and Hakkinen argued over third into the first hairpin , the Canadian grabbed his opportunity , dived down the inside , and took third . Barrichello sheepishly followed him past Hakkinen , leaving a trail of cars bottled up behind the BAR . Villeneuve was driving his heart out at his home circuit , but his position meant that Schumacher was now twenty seconds ahead of the second placed man , and no - one would be able to match his pace until they got past the BAR Honda . The BAR star was clearly becoming a hindrance to Barrichello and Hakkinen , but proving why he is rated so highly among team managers along the pitlane . By lap 24 , the car beneath him would allow him to stay ahead no longer . Barrichello got a run at the BAR at the first chicane , but Villeneuve forced the Brazilian to do the hard work and held his line to put Barrichello on the outside for the second part of the corner . Through the second chicane , both Ferrari and BAR were side by side , neither giving an inch . It was the kind of racing that F1 fans have experienced only sporadically for many years , and Villeneuve could uphold his honour as one of the sport 's top dogs . Barrichello , though , held his nerve , and dived down the inside into the Casino hairpin . This time , there was nothing the ' 97 Champion could do , and was forced to cede . The early moves were being made by the Arrows drivers - light on fuel and enjoying good handling . Pedro de la Rosa took sixth from Heinz Harald Frentzen at the hairpin , then set about chasing Hakkinen 's McLaren , but prodigious though the Supertec-powered Arrows is , the Spaniard could not work it close enough on the straight to challenge . The Arrows were performing well in the early stages of the race , and Jos Verstappen echoed his team - mate 's performance by taking tenth from Giancarlo Fisichella 's Benetton . The car was obviously well balanced and allowed the drivers to exploit its capabilities , as Verstappen 's charge continued unabated even as the rain started to fall . Indeed , the Dutchman appeared to be in his element . De La Rosa , who was the first driver to stop , on lap 20 , had a little more trouble adjusting to the conditions and was off the road several times . He was off the road for good , and in the biggest possible way , when Pedro Diniz 's Sauber simply drove him into the barriers along the back straight as his namesake tried to pass . It was a worrying incident , and one that the stewards were considering action over as the race ended . Verstappen , on the other hand , kept on getting better the wetter the conditions got . With ten laps to go , he had shaken out in eighth place . After a tussle with Ralf Schumacher , the Dutchman latched onto the group of lower points - scoring places . Quickly he caught and passed Alexander Wurz 's Benetton , and set about chasing down Jarno Trulli in the Jordan . Within a couple of laps he was right with the Italian , and pulled ahead with a demon move from way back , into the third chicane on lap 59 . He held fifth until the end to score his first points of the year . Barrichello , releasedafter passing Villeneuve , darted away and by lap 31 was lapping at the same pace as his team - mate . On lap 31 he had surpassed it , setting the fastest lap of the race thus far . He took the lead when Schumacher pitted , and pulled slowly away , his lighter fuel load working to good effect . The Brazilian pitted on lap 43 , but lost the chance of a win in doing so . The following lap , Schumacher was in for wets , and had the Ferrari pit crew fitted these on Barrichello 's scheduled stop , he would have been uncatchable . It was not to be , however , and the precedence of his team mate within Ferrari played against him again . When he himself pited for wet tyres on th following tour , the pits were not ready for him , having just waved Schumacher away . He was forced to wait while , agonizingly , tyres were brought out of the garage and the warmers removed . He recovered to finish a strong second , having caught Schumacher in the final stages . He set fastest of the wet part of the race , and was clearly at one with the car and conditions . Another podium and six points was the reward . Biggest beneficiary of the rain was Giancarlo Fisichella , who jumped out of nowhere - the lower reaches of the top ten , to be precise - to take third . Hakkinen was , in contrast the biggest loser , as he had just passed the pit entrance as the rain began to fall . In consequence , he had to crawl round a lap on slicks , and ended the race behind Fisichella , in fourth .. The World Championship has thus swung back in favour of Schumacher and Ferrari . He now has a 22 point lead over Coulthard , and 24 points over Hakkinen . For full results , click here . To see the autosport.com lap-by-lap coverage , click here .

I 'm Ira Flatow . If you 're a regular listener to our show , you know that we like to find unusual creatures , even charismatic ones . And lots of those are creepy crawly things or real jumpers . Think leaping leafhopper or a springy cricket . Well , this week , we found another one for your consideration \u2013 a common beetle that you can find in a dead tree on your lawn , whose larva are able to jump in a way that had n't been described before . This work was published this week in the journal PLOS One . Joining me now is Dr. Matt Bertone , an entomologist at NC State University and one of the authors of the report . Welcome to Science Friday . MATT BERTONE : Oh , thank you for having me . IRA FLATOW : OK , tell us about this beetle . What is it , and where does it live ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so it 's a little , fairly nondescript beetle . And what we described was the actual larval stage , behaviors of the larval stage . But this species is common throughout Eastern North America , fairly small , and kind of obscure typically , so people do n't usually see it . The adults are small brown beetles with a very flattened body and two spots on the body . And the larvae are just small worm - like critters that crawl around under the bark of dead trees . IRA FLATOW : And you found this one actually on the bark on campus , right ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , that 's correct . There was a standing dead oak tree that was developing some fungus on it right outside of our building . And of course , because I pass it every day , I had to just collect some insects from it , especially for the specimens and my photography . And that 's\u2013 IRA FLATOW : This is what you do . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , yeah , this is what I do , so regular day for me . IRA FLATOW : Let 's talk about what makes this beetle and the larva so different from other jumping insects . MATT BERTONE : So , many adult insects jump . You think of crickets and grasshoppers . Even adult beetles , there are many species that jump . And they usually have large hind legs , and they just kind of launch off the surface . What this larva does , though , is very interesting . In fact , it builds up energy in its body and latches onto the ground with its claws . And as its body builds up energy , it releases those claws . And this causes the insect to somersault into the air a short distance . IRA FLATOW : And there 's nothing weird about the claws then . MATT BERTONE : Nope , they 're fairly typical larval claws . Nothing special really about them . IRA FLATOW : Well , if they live under the bark , why do they need to be able to jump ? They 're not going to be jumping any place under that bark , are they ? MATT BERTONE : Yes , so that 's a great question . And we 've been trying to figure out exactly why . The logic will be that since it 's under bark , it does n't need to jump , of course . So part of what we thought was maybe this is some artifact of a behavior they do under the bark . There are other larvae that are known to wedge push , so they kind of bump up a little bit under the bark to give it more space to crawl under . But we did n't think that was really the case . Why develop that behavior if you 're under bark most of the time ? Other beetles that have kind of jumping larvae often do that to escape predators or parasites . But we noticed that these larvae , you put them down on the ground , they crawl a little bit , and then they 'd hop on their own . You would n't have to kind of touch them or do anything to make them jump . So it came down to us thinking about their lifestyle . And my ideas and our thoughts were that this source , rotting wood and trees that are standing with bark that 's kind of falling off , could easily expose these larvae . And they 're light - colored . They 're on a dark surface . They could easily be picked off by predators . So one of my hypotheses is that they do this to get away from their sites , either when exposed or just because they want to . And it 's more energy effective to do that than to crawl . IRA FLATOW : Now you mentioned before that they 're not\u2013 how shall we say\u2013 great jumpers . And so the height of their jumping and their jumping ability , their talent for jumping is not what interests you , but it 's the way that they jump that interests you , right ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so they 're definitely not record setters . They 're definitely not even super impressive . They are when you see them with the naked eye because it 's fairly quick . But when we actually went to record the distance and the heights , they were not jumping very far , really . But beetle larvae jumping are really rare . And beetles are a huge group of insects . There are over 350,000 described species on Earth . And so you would think you would find it more commonly , but it 's actually fairly rare in beetles . And then the second aspect was the way they jumped using this latching mechanism with the ground is very unique . IRA FLATOW : And they do this pretty quickly because I was watching a video of your colleagues showing us how they jump , and you had to use a really high speed camera to see the details . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so Dr. Adrian Smith at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences downtown in Raleigh , one of his specialties is filming high speed videos of insects . And so this was a great collaboration . So when you see the jump with the naked eye , it 's very quick . When we showed it at 3,500 frames per second , we could see the basics of it . But he actually went to a special lab to get filming of 60,000 frames per second , in which we were able to see even more details . IRA FLATOW : Wow . Now does it matter what surface they are on ? If they have to use their claws to sort of set the spring in their body , right , does it matter that they 're on a slippery surface ? MATT BERTONE : So that 's actually one of the lines of evidence we used to show that this is actually a latching mechanism . Adrian did film some on Plexiglas and glass surfaces , and they were unable to jump . So that leads us to believe that they really do need something to latch on with their claws . IRA FLATOW : Do you get the impression that this is a talent that , evolutionarily speaking , they had to develop a little bit later in their evolution because they just do n't have the jumping body style that the other big jumpers have ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , this seems to be \u2013 I 'm not sure when they developed it , but it does seem to be a fairly simplistic way to do it if you think about it because most insects have claws . And they 're crawling on the surface . They can grab down . So it really did n't require any specialized anatomy that in many insects that do have those special organs to latch and jump , they did n't have to evolve those . IRA FLATOW : I kind of find it interesting that after the jump is finished , they sort of curl up into a little ring and then bounce around on as they land . It 's like a tire . It reminded me of a tire , right ? MATT BERTONE : Exactly , I love the little bounces when they hit the ground . I do n't know how they feel when they 're doing that . Luckily , they 're pretty light animals , and they can resist it . And yeah , it 's pretty erratic , their jumping . They do n't really aim somewhere . They 're not trying to get somewhere special , but we think that it helps kind of introduce different areas for them to explore . IRA FLATOW : Do you have any feeling about what actually makes them jump\u2013 loud noises ? Do you have to poke them ? What 's the stimulus there ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so they seemed to just jump when they were kind of exposed out in the open , crawling around . That was what led us to believe that it was n't so much them directly responding to some kind of predator or parasite . You could grab them with the soft forceps or touch them with a paintbrush , and they 'd crawl along and jump . But even if they were put out on the surface alone with no kind of stimulation like that , they would crawl around for a bit and then jump . And so that 's what we were able to observe with the specimens we had . But unfortunately , we do n't have a lot of live specimens to experiment with . So a lot of that stuff is still a mystery . IRA FLATOW : And to bring that up , to take that one step further , I noticed that when you posted this behavior online , other folks had seen it , too , in their species . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , that \u2013 IRA FLATOW : So you found other comrades . MATT BERTONE : That was one of the greatest things about this . Actually , in fact , it was really interesting . So we talk about these jumping larvae . Under the same bark with these larvae , there were also fly maggots . And many maggots are known to jump . And what they do is they latch their mouth parts onto their rear end and then stretch their body and then releasing that energy . So they use a body - to - body latch . But at the end of a video that Adrian produced about those jumping maggots , he alluded to and showed a clip of this beetle larva jumping just as a teaser . And out of the blue , he got a message from a Japanese researcher , Takehiro Yoshida . And he is a world expert on this group of beetles . And because he collects them , he had noticed one of his larvae doing the same thing . And this was actually from a different genus across the world in Japan . So it 's really interesting that it evolved at least twice in these beetles . IRA FLATOW : So it 's possible that this is more common than you know about . MATT BERTONE : Yes , and that would be great to find out how common . But again , these are very obscure , little critters that not a lot of people pay attention to . IRA FLATOW : Well , we have a big audience . So if people are listening , and they want to do some of their own research , can they look for these under the bark of their own trees ? MATT BERTONE : They could . These beetles are associated with kind of micro fungi that are under dead and dying trees , the bark of them . They can be found under the bark of logs on the ground , things like that . They 're not uncommon , and there 's other groups of beetle larvae and insect larvae that would be associated with those fungi . So you 're going to find a lot of different things to observe . If you do that , I would just make sure to be careful to leave some habitat left and to replace bark and things like that to just make sure that the insects and other arthropods have a good home . IRA FLATOW : Do they have a jumping signature that if I peeled up the bark and I looked and I saw there were a lot of other insects and larvae under there , that I would say , hey , look , it 's jumping in a certain way . That 's the one . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so I 'd be interested to see , opening up the bark and seeing a bunch of larvae , if you could just sit back and watch and see if they jump . We as scientists would always want to collect those specimens then and get them identified for sure , which was actually the first step of the process , was finding out what type of larva it was , because we actually did DNA work to link it to the adults , and we got confirmation through identification keys . It was really exciting to know that we had seen something possibly the first time and definitely reported for the first time . IRA FLATOW : You mean the reporting the jumping of it . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , exactly . So we do n't know without publications whether people have seen it before . Somebody could have just been tearing up a box , saw a little beetle , a little larva or grub jumping around , and thought , ah , well , whatever . But recognizing the importance is really a part of it . IRA FLATOW : Now I noticed in the video I was watching that you guys went through great trouble to scan the larva , to look at , poke it , see in every direction that you can . Is there still something you do n't know about it that you would like to know ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , I think we would definitely like to have or would have liked to have more specimens to kind of do some more experiments , like manipulating them on different surfaces or doing different experiments to see what might cause them to do this jumping behavior . Again , they 're very ephemeral . It 's hard to pinpoint where they 're going to be and collect a number of the specimens to experiment on . It 's not like a pest species that 's so common or something that we keep in colonies . So that 's where one of the difficulties comes about . IRA FLATOW : So you do n't want our listeners sending you their samples that they 're collecting \u2013 MATT BERTONE : I mean \u2013 IRA FLATOW : \u2013from their trees . MATT BERTONE : I 'd love to see some . I mean , I love seeing the diversity of all the things under there .

But there are a lot of different ones under the bark , so you may get confused . IRA FLATOW : OK , well , there you go . There 's the challenge to all of you .

I 'm Ira Flatow . If you 're a regular listener to our show , you know that we like to find unusual creatures , even charismatic ones . And lots of those are creepy crawly things or real jumpers . Think leaping leafhopper or a springy cricket . Well , this week , we found another one for your consideration \u2013 a common beetle that you can find in a dead tree on your lawn , whose larva are able to jump in a way that had n't been described before . This work was published this week in the journal PLOS One . Joining me now is Dr. Matt Bertone , an entomologist at NC State University and one of the authors of the report . Welcome to Science Friday . MATT BERTONE : Oh , thank you for having me . IRA FLATOW : OK , tell us about this beetle . What is it , and where does it live ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so it 's a little , fairly nondescript beetle . And what we described was the actual larval stage , behaviors of the larval stage . But this species is common throughout Eastern North America , fairly small , and kind of obscure typically , so people do n't usually see it . The adults are small brown beetles with a very flattened body and two spots on the body . And the larvae are just small worm - like critters that crawl around under the bark of dead trees . IRA FLATOW : And you found this one actually on the bark on campus , right ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , that 's correct . There was a standing dead oak tree that was developing some fungus on it right outside of our building . And of course , because I pass it every day , I had to just collect some insects from it , especially for the specimens and my photography . And that 's\u2013 IRA FLATOW : This is what you do . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , yeah , this is what I do , so regular day for me . IRA FLATOW : Let 's talk about what makes this beetle and the larva so different from other jumping insects . MATT BERTONE : So , many adult insects jump . You think of crickets and grasshoppers . Even adult beetles , there are many species that jump . And they usually have large hind legs , and they just kind of launch off the surface . What this larva does , though , is very interesting . In fact , it builds up energy in its body and latches onto the ground with its claws . And as its body builds up energy , it releases those claws . And this causes the insect to somersault into the air a short distance . IRA FLATOW : And there 's nothing weird about the claws then . MATT BERTONE : Nope , they 're fairly typical larval claws . Nothing special really about them . IRA FLATOW : Well , if they live under the bark , why do they need to be able to jump ? They 're not going to be jumping any place under that bark , are they ? MATT BERTONE : Yes , so that 's a great question . And we 've been trying to figure out exactly why . The logic will be that since it 's under bark , it does n't need to jump , of course . So part of what we thought was maybe this is some artifact of a behavior they do under the bark . There are other larvae that are known to wedge push , so they kind of bump up a little bit under the bark to give it more space to crawl under . But we did n't think that was really the case . Why develop that behavior if you 're under bark most of the time ? Other beetles that have kind of jumping larvae often do that to escape predators or parasites . But we noticed that these larvae , you put them down on the ground , they crawl a little bit , and then they 'd hop on their own . You would n't have to kind of touch them or do anything to make them jump . So it came down to us thinking about their lifestyle . And my ideas and our thoughts were that this source , rotting wood and trees that are standing with bark that 's kind of falling off , could easily expose these larvae . And they 're light - colored . They 're on a dark surface . They could easily be picked off by predators . So one of my hypotheses is that they do this to get away from their sites , either when exposed or just because they want to . And it 's more energy effective to do that than to crawl . IRA FLATOW : Now you mentioned before that they 're not\u2013 how shall we say\u2013 great jumpers . And so the height of their jumping and their jumping ability , their talent for jumping is not what interests you , but it 's the way that they jump that interests you , right ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so they 're definitely not record setters . They 're definitely not even super impressive . They are when you see them with the naked eye because it 's fairly quick . But when we actually went to record the distance and the heights , they were not jumping very far , really . But beetle larvae jumping are really rare . And beetles are a huge group of insects . There are over 350,000 described species on Earth . And so you would think you would find it more commonly , but it 's actually fairly rare in beetles . And then the second aspect was the way they jumped using this latching mechanism with the ground is very unique . IRA FLATOW : And they do this pretty quickly because I was watching a video of your colleagues showing us how they jump , and you had to use a really high speed camera to see the details . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so Dr. Adrian Smith at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences downtown in Raleigh , one of his specialties is filming high speed videos of insects . And so this was a great collaboration . So when you see the jump with the naked eye , it 's very quick . When we showed it at 3,500 frames per second , we could see the basics of it . But he actually went to a special lab to get filming of 60,000 frames per second , in which we were able to see even more details . IRA FLATOW : Wow . Now does it matter what surface they are on ? If they have to use their claws to sort of set the spring in their body , right , does it matter that they 're on a slippery surface ? MATT BERTONE : So that 's actually one of the lines of evidence we used to show that this is actually a latching mechanism . Adrian did film some on Plexiglas and glass surfaces , and they were unable to jump . So that leads us to believe that they really do need something to latch on with their claws . IRA FLATOW : Do you get the impression that this is a talent that , evolutionarily speaking , they had to develop a little bit later in their evolution because they just do n't have the jumping body style that the other big jumpers have ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , this seems to be \u2013 I 'm not sure when they developed it , but it does seem to be a fairly simplistic way to do it if you think about it because most insects have claws . And they 're crawling on the surface . They can grab down . So it really did n't require any specialized anatomy that in many insects that do have those special organs to latch and jump , they did n't have to evolve those . IRA FLATOW : I kind of find it interesting that after the jump is finished , they sort of curl up into a little ring and then bounce around on as they land . It 's like a tire . It reminded me of a tire , right ? MATT BERTONE : Exactly , I love the little bounces when they hit the ground . I do n't know how they feel when they 're doing that . Luckily , they 're pretty light animals , and they can resist it . And yeah , it 's pretty erratic , their jumping . They do n't really aim somewhere . They 're not trying to get somewhere special , but we think that it helps kind of introduce different areas for them to explore . IRA FLATOW : Do you have any feeling about what actually makes them jump\u2013 loud noises ? Do you have to poke them ? What 's the stimulus there ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so they seemed to just jump when they were kind of exposed out in the open , crawling around . That was what led us to believe that it was n't so much them directly responding to some kind of predator or parasite . You could grab them with the soft forceps or touch them with a paintbrush , and they 'd crawl along and jump . But even if they were put out on the surface alone with no kind of stimulation like that , they would crawl around for a bit and then jump . And so that 's what we were able to observe with the specimens we had . But unfortunately , we do n't have a lot of live specimens to experiment with . So a lot of that stuff is still a mystery . IRA FLATOW : And to bring that up , to take that one step further , I noticed that when you posted this behavior online , other folks had seen it , too , in their species . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , that \u2013 IRA FLATOW : So you found other comrades . MATT BERTONE : That was one of the greatest things about this . Actually , in fact , it was really interesting . So we talk about these jumping larvae . Under the same bark with these larvae , there were also fly maggots . And many maggots are known to jump . And what they do is they latch their mouth parts onto their rear end and then stretch their body and then releasing that energy . So they use a body - to - body latch . But at the end of a video that Adrian produced about those jumping maggots , he alluded to and showed a clip of this beetle larva jumping just as a teaser . And out of the blue , he got a message from a Japanese researcher , Takehiro Yoshida . And he is a world expert on this group of beetles . And because he collects them , he had noticed one of his larvae doing the same thing . And this was actually from a different genus across the world in Japan . So it 's really interesting that it evolved at least twice in these beetles . IRA FLATOW : So it 's possible that this is more common than you know about . MATT BERTONE : Yes , and that would be great to find out how common . But again , these are very obscure , little critters that not a lot of people pay attention to . IRA FLATOW : Well , we have a big audience . So if people are listening , and they want to do some of their own research , can they look for these under the bark of their own trees ? MATT BERTONE : They could . These beetles are associated with kind of micro fungi that are under dead and dying trees , the bark of them . They can be found under the bark of logs on the ground , things like that . They 're not uncommon , and there 's other groups of beetle larvae and insect larvae that would be associated with those fungi . So you 're going to find a lot of different things to observe . If you do that , I would just make sure to be careful to leave some habitat left and to replace bark and things like that to just make sure that the insects and other arthropods have a good home . IRA FLATOW : Do they have a jumping signature that if I peeled up the bark and I looked and I saw there were a lot of other insects and larvae under there , that I would say , hey , look , it 's jumping in a certain way . That 's the one . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so I 'd be interested to see , opening up the bark and seeing a bunch of larvae , if you could just sit back and watch and see if they jump . We as scientists would always want to collect those specimens then and get them identified for sure , which was actually the first step of the process , was finding out what type of larva it was , because we actually did DNA work to link it to the adults , and we got confirmation through identification keys . It was really exciting to know that we had seen something possibly the first time and definitely reported for the first time . IRA FLATOW : You mean the reporting the jumping of it . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , exactly . So we do n't know without publications whether people have seen it before . Somebody could have just been tearing up a box , saw a little beetle , a little larva or grub jumping around , and thought , ah , well , whatever . But recognizing the importance is really a part of it . IRA FLATOW : Now I noticed in the video I was watching that you guys went through great trouble to scan the larva , to look at , poke it , see in every direction that you can . Is there still something you do n't know about it that you would like to know ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , I think we would definitely like to have or would have liked to have more specimens to kind of do some more experiments , like manipulating them on different surfaces or doing different experiments to see what might cause them to do this jumping behavior . Again , they 're very ephemeral . It 's hard to pinpoint where they 're going to be and collect a number of the specimens to experiment on . It 's not like a pest species that 's so common or something that we keep in colonies . So that 's where one of the difficulties comes about . IRA FLATOW : So you do n't want our listeners sending you their samples that they 're collecting \u2013 MATT BERTONE : I mean \u2013 IRA FLATOW : \u2013from their trees . MATT BERTONE : I 'd love to see some . I mean , I love seeing the diversity of all the things under there .

It was 2009 . Two young female goalies Griffin knew had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Griffin , associate head coach for the University of Washington 's women 's soccer team , had started to visit the women and other athletes in local hospitals , helping them pass the time during chemo with war stories from her three decades of coaching . That day , the nurse looked down at the woman Griffin was sitting with and said , \" Do n't tell me you guys are goalkeepers . You 're the fourth goalkeeper I 've hooked up this week . \" Later , the young woman with the chemo needle in her arm would say , \u201c I just have a feeling it has something to do with those black dots . \u201d Artificial turf fields are now everywhere in the United States , from high schools to multi-million - dollar athletic complexes . As any parent or player who has been on them can testify , the tiny black rubber crumbs of which the fields are made -- chunks of old tires -- get everywhere . In players ' uniforms , in their hair , in their cleats . But for goalkeepers , whose bodies are in constant contact with the turf , it can be far worse . In practices and games , they make hundreds of dives , and each plunge sends a black cloud of tire pellets into the air . The granules get into their cuts and scrapes , and into their mouths . Griffin wondered if those crumbs \u2013 which have been known to contain carcinogens and chemicals \u2013 were making players sick . \u201c I've coached for 26 , 27 years , \u201d she said . \u201c My first 15 years , I never heard anything about this . All of a sudden it seems to be a stream of kids . \u201d Since then , Griffin has compiled a list of 38 American soccer players -- 34 of them goalies \u2013 who have been diagnosed with cancer . At least a dozen played in Washington , but the geographic spread is nationwide . Blood cancers like lymphoma and leukemia dominate the list . No research has linked cancer to artificial turf . Griffin collected names through personal experience with sick players , and acknowledges that her list is not a scientific data set . But it 's enough to make her ask whether crumb rubber artificial turf , a product that has been rolled out in tens of thousands of parks , playgrounds , schools and stadiums in the U.S. , is safe for the athletes and kids who play on it . Others across the country are raising similar questions , arguing that the now-ubiquitous material , made out of synthetic fibers and scrap tire -- which can contain benzene , carbon black and lead , among other substances -- has not been adequately tested . Few studies have measured the risk of ingesting crumb rubber orally , for example . NBC 's own extensive investigation , which included a review of the relevant studies and interviews with scientists and industry professionals , was unable to find any agreement over whether crumb turf had ill effects on young athletes , or even whether the product had been sufficiently tested . The Synthetic Turf Council , an industry group , says that the evidence collected so far by scientists and state and federal agencies proves that artificial turf is safe . \u201c We 've got 14 studies on our website that says we can find no negative health effects , \u201d said Dr. Davis Lee , a Turf Council board member . While those studies are n't \u201c absolutely conclusive , \u201d he added , \u201c There 's certainly a preponderance of evidence to this point that says , in fact , it is safe . \u201d Do You or Your Kids Play on Synthetic Fields ? Share Your Story Environmental advocates want the Environmental Protection Agency and the Consumer Product Safety Commission to take a closer look . While both the CPSC and the EPA performed studies over five years ago , both agencies recently backtracked on their assurances the material was safe , calling their studies \u201c limited . \u201d But while the EPA told NBC News in a statement that \u201c more testing needs to be done , \u201d the agency also said it considered artificial turf to be a \u201c state and local decision , \u201d and would not be commissioning further research . \u201c There 's a host of concerns that are being raised , \u201d said Jeff Ruch , executive director of PEER , an environmental watchdog group . PEER has lodged complaints against both agencies . \u201c None have risen to the level of regulatory interest . \u201d The EPA refused multiple requests from NBC News for an interview , and declined to expand on their statement that \u201c more testing needs to be done . \u201d From ' Chemgrass ' to crumb rubber Invented in 1964 by Monsanto , the first iterations of artificial turf were little more than synthetic ' grass ' laid on top of concrete . First called \u201c ChemGrass , \u201d the product became famous as \u201c AstroTurf \u201d after it was installed in Houston 's Astrodome in 1966 . Some athletes , however , complained that the thin , synthetic surface made for hard landings . By the early 2000s , a better form of artificial turf had emerged . Called styrene butadiene rubber , or \u201c crumb rubber , \u201d the new turf contained tiny black crumbs made from pulverized car tires , poured in between the fake grass blades . The rubber infill gave the field more bounce , cushioned the impact for athletes , and helped prevent serious injuries like concussions . Since then , the material has become increasingly popular . Municipalities across the country have floated multi-million - dollar bonds to pay for new fields . Local leaders , some facility managers and companies say that turf costs less than natural grass to maintain , and can withstand heavy use year - round . \u201c There are benefits here . The potential risk , as we know it today , is extremely low . \u201d Today , according to figures from the Synthetic Turf Council , more than 11,000 synthetic turf sports fields are in use in the U.S. Most of them are crumb rubber . Crumb rubber infill is also used in children 's playgrounds across the country . Crumb rubber is an \u201c environmental success story , \u201d said Dan Zielinski , spokesperson for the Rubber Manufacturers Association . Not only have turf fields diverted millions of tires from landfills , said Zielinski , but they do n't require fertilizer or pesticides , and can save municipalities hundreds of thousands of gallons of water each year . \u201c There are benefits here , \u201d Zielinski said . \u201c The potential risk , as we know it today , is extremely low . \u201d ' Turf Bugs ' Jordan Swarthout , 22 , started playing soccer when she was 4 . She became a goalie at 9 , already addicted to the \u201c adrenaline rush \u201d that comes each time the ball hurtles toward the net . By 11 , Swarthout , who grew up in Sumner , Washington , about 45 minutes south of Seattle , was playing almost entirely on crumb rubber turf . When she and her team asked what was in the turf , \u201c old tires \u201d was the best answer she got . \u201c We always wondered what was underneath it , \u201d she said . \u201c What we could n't see . \u201d But the smell that hangs over crumb rubber fields \u2013 the scent of tires baking in the sun -- became as familiar to Swarthout as her endless goalie drills . She even got used to the \u201c turf bugs , \u201d as she and her teammates called them . During high school , she played on multiple teams at once , with two - hour practices five days a week , and games at least twice a week . Every day , she tried to clean the black rubber pellets , the \u201c turf bugs , \u201d out of the abrasions and burns she suffered as a goalkeeper on turf . Every day , to the chagrin of her mother , she shook them from her clothes and cleats onto the laundry room floor . She brushed them out of her hair , and spit them out of her mouth . \" The little black beads , \" she said . \" In the games and practices they 'd get in my eyes , they 'd get in my mouth , they 'd get in my nose . My mom would get so mad at me because I 'd go to the bathroom to take a shower , and the turf bugs would be everywhere . \u201d Jordan 's mother , Suzie Swarthout , said her daughter probably swallowed hundreds of tire crumbs a year . Yet neither Jordan nor Suzie worried much about it . \u201c We all had the confidence that the proper steps had been taken , the research had been done , that it had been proved to be safe , \u201d said Suzie . \u201c We all know how bad tires are , \u201d said Jordan . \u201c You do n't eat tires . Yet we were . You 'd get it in your mouth and you would n't think about it . \u201d In 2013 , after more than a year of mysterious thyroid problems , a biopsy determined that the star athlete had stage three Hodgkin lymphoma . It was one night this past May , months after doctors declared her daughter to be in remission , when Suzie Swarthout saw Amy Griffin 's story on a local news broadcast . \u201c I immediately after the newscast emailed [ Amy ] and said , \u201c You could add another subject to your statistics , ' \u201d recalled Suzie . Griffin said that since she first started collecting names of goalies with cancer and other diseases , she 's had people like the Swarthouts contact her , and her list has grown . Griffin and the Swarthouts said that they know it 's nearly impossible to figure out the origin of a disease like cancer , and that young people are exposed to hundreds of carcinogens . But , said Jordan Swarthout , \u201c If we have it available to us to research this , why should n't we ? Why ca n't we ? \" ' Every tire is different ' One of the problems with researching the potential health hazards of crumb rubber fields is the sheer variety of materials used in the product . Tens of thousands of different tires from different brands may be used in one field . According to the EPA , mercury , lead , benzene , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , and arsenic , among several other chemicals , heavy metals , and carcinogens , have been found in tires . Darren Gill , vice president of marketing for FieldTurf , a prominent turf company , said that those ingredients might worry consumers , but the manufacturing process ensures that their product is safe . \u201c If you look at the ingredients that go into a car tire , some people take those ingredients and turn them into health concerns , \u201d Gill said . \u201c But after the vulcanization process , those ingredients are inert . \u201d Industry leaders say while they encourage additional research , studies have shown that the substances found in crumb rubber are not at levels high enough to be at risk to children or athletes . \u201c There are certainly chemicals in small amounts [ in turf ] as in many other things , \u201d said Lee , of the Synthetic Turf Council . \u201c You could evaluate most any material out there and you 're going to find at some level , some chemical that might cause concern . \u201d \u201c The levels as they exist in tires , ground up tires , are very , very low , \u201d he added . \u201c The EPA has not found adverse health effect . Several state organizations have investigated it quite thoroughly . \u201d Existing research has attempted to measure the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals through the inhalation of gasses and particulate matter , as well as skin contact . Studies have found that crumb rubber fields emit gases that can be inhaled . Turf fields can become very hot -- 10 to 15 degrees hotter than the ambient temperature \u2013 increasing the chances that volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) and chemicals can \u201c off - gas , \u201d or leach into the air . One study performed by the state of Connecticut measured the concentrations of VOCs and chemicals in the air over fields . In addition to VOCs such as benzene and methylene chloride , researchers identified various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) . The report concluded that \u201c the use of outdoor and indoor artificial turf fields is not associated with elevated health risks , \u201d but that more research was needed to better understand chemical exposures on outdoor fields during hot weekends and in indoor facilities , which showed higher levels of chemicals in the air .

But researchers identified lead in the turf tested , including a \u201c large concentration \u201d of lead and chromium in one sample . \u201c As the turf material degrades from weathering the lead could be released , potentially exposing young children , \u201d the report states . According to Dr. Joel Forman , associate professor of pediatrics and preventive medicine at New York 's Mt. Sinai Hospital , in all these studies , data gaps make it difficult to draw firm conclusions . \u201c None of [ the studies ] are long term , they rarely involve very young children and they only look for concentrations of chemicals and compare it to some sort of standard for what 's considered acceptable , \u201d said Dr. Forman . \u201c That does n't really take into account subclinical effects , long - term effects , the developing brain and developing kids . \u201d Forman said that it is known that some of the compounds found in tires , \u201c even in chronic lower exposures \u201d can be associated with subtle neurodevelopmental issues in children . \u201c Those are always suspect , \u201d he said . \u201c If you never study anything , \u201d said Dr. Forman , \u201c you can always say , ' Well there 's no evidence that 's a problem , ' but that 's because you have n't looked . To look is hard . \u201d \u201c I would like to see some more research , \u201d he concluded . ' Not an Issue ' It is unlikely , however , that further research will be conducted by federal agencies . In 2008 , tests performed by New Jersey found lead on three artificial turf fields . The results spurred media coverage and concern across the country . The Consumer Product Safety Commission , the federal agency in charge of regulating consumer products , tested turf samples . While the tests detected lead in the synthetic grass blades , the agency announced that turf was safe to play on . That same year , an official from a regional EPA office wrote to three agency offices in D.C. , including the Office of Children 's Health Protection , and recommended that the EPA undertake extensive testing , according to documents obtained by the watchdog group PEER . \u201c My staff has reviewed the published research on the safety of tire crumb , \u201d wrote the official , \u201c and has found information suggesting that children 's chronic , repeated exposure to tire crumb could present health hazards . However , sufficient data to quantify toxicological risks from tire crumb exposure are not available . \u201d Shortly after , the EPA tested samples from two artificial turf fields and one playground . The concentrations of VOCs and other chemicals researchers found presented a \u201c low level of concern , \u201d the agency reported , but it declared that due to the \u201c very limited nature \u201d of the study and the diversity of crumb material , it was \u201c not possible to reach any more comprehensive conclusions without the consideration of additional data . \u201d While the industry cites both studies as evidence that rubber crumb is safe , in response to complaints filed by PEER , both the CPSC and the EPA declared last year that their studies were limited in scope . In its press release , the CPSC wrote , \u201c The exposure assessment did not include chemicals or other toxic metals , beyond lead . \u201d Since its initial tests , according to the CPSC , the agency has worked with the industry to develop voluntary standards for lead content . The EPA refused repeated requests from NBC News for an interview . It said in a statement that the agency \u201c does not believe that the field monitoring data collected provides evidence of an elevated health risk resulting from the use of recycled tire crumb in playgrounds or in synthetic turf athletic fields . \u201d \u201c The agency believes that more testing needs to be done , \u201d said the agency in a separate statement , \u201c but , currently , the decision to use tire crumb remains a state and local decision . \u201d When NBC News first contacted the EPA in 2013 , Enesta Jones , an agency spokesperson said that in 2010 , after a meeting with state and federal officials , \u201c EPA determined that this is not an issue . \u201d The agency does not have plans to conduct further studies , but is currently working on a \u201c summary \u201d of available research . New Controversy Others across the country say their questions about crumb rubber turf remain unanswered . Some cities have elected to scrap crumb rubber turf in favor of alternative infill . The New York City Parks Department stopped installing crumb rubber turf in 2008 followed the next year by the Los Angeles Unified School District . In Maryland , a group called the Safe Healthy Playing Fields Coalition has been organizing against a bill that would allocate state funds to build artificial turf fields . The group has also been trying to advance legislation that would require warning signs to be placed around artificial turf fields . For at least four years , citizens and advocacy groups concerned about crumb rubber turf have been fighting against the installation of artificial fields in San Francisco 's Golden Gate Park . Early this year , a judge dismissed a suit against the city that alleged the environmental impact report conducted by the city violated California law by failing to disclose the risks associated with turf . The case is currently being appealed . Two turf - related propositions are on the ballot for the city 's upcoming elections . One would bar the city from installing the fields in Golden Gate Park , and the other would give wider latitude to the city 's Parks and Recreation department to install similar projects . Those concerned about turf suggest using alternative in - fill for artificial fields , such as coconut fiber and cork , or prohibiting toddlers or other young children from using fields and playgrounds with crumb rubber . An environmental group called the Center for Environmental Health ( CEH ) led litigation against several artificial turf companies in California for violations of Proposition 65 , a state law that prohibits companies from knowingly exposing consumers to specific chemicals and heavy metals , such as lead , without clear warning . In a series of settlements , the companies agreed to reduce the amount of lead in their products sold in California and agreed to replace fields under certain conditions . Caroline Cox , research director for CEH , said that while studies have n't definitively established that crumb rubber turf is harmful , the surface contains chemicals known to be hazardous . \u201c We know they 're there , \u201d said Cox . \u201c The point is , let 's go with better alternatives instead of spending years and millions of dollars establishing harm . If there 's a better way to do this , let 's just do it . \u201d Follow NBC News Investigations on Twitter and Facebook . \u201c Turf fields come with a number of real risks and a number of real benefits , \u201d said Dr. Joel Forman . \u201c And every community \u2026 has to kind of weigh the different risks and benefits . \u201d Looking for answers When Amy Griffin first started using turf -- her team practices on it throughout the year -- she thought it was a \u201c win - win . \u201d Now , her team collects paper cups of crumb rubber on each field they play on , handing them off to her so she can ship the granules to a lab to be tested . \u201c I 'm looking for answers , because I 'm not smart enough to come up with them on my own , \u201d Griffin said . \u201c I would love someone to say , ' We 've done some tests and we 've covered all of our bases . \u2026 And yes , it 's safe .

It was 2009 . Two young female goalies Griffin knew had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Griffin , associate head coach for the University of Washington 's women 's soccer team , had started to visit the women and other athletes in local hospitals , helping them pass the time during chemo with war stories from her three decades of coaching . That day , the nurse looked down at the woman Griffin was sitting with and said , \" Do n't tell me you guys are goalkeepers . You 're the fourth goalkeeper I 've hooked up this week . \" Later , the young woman with the chemo needle in her arm would say , \u201c I just have a feeling it has something to do with those black dots . \u201d Artificial turf fields are now everywhere in the United States , from high schools to multi-million - dollar athletic complexes . As any parent or player who has been on them can testify , the tiny black rubber crumbs of which the fields are made -- chunks of old tires -- get everywhere . In players ' uniforms , in their hair , in their cleats . But for goalkeepers , whose bodies are in constant contact with the turf , it can be far worse . In practices and games , they make hundreds of dives , and each plunge sends a black cloud of tire pellets into the air . The granules get into their cuts and scrapes , and into their mouths . Griffin wondered if those crumbs \u2013 which have been known to contain carcinogens and chemicals \u2013 were making players sick . \u201c I've coached for 26 , 27 years , \u201d she said . \u201c My first 15 years , I never heard anything about this . All of a sudden it seems to be a stream of kids . \u201d Since then , Griffin has compiled a list of 38 American soccer players -- 34 of them goalies \u2013 who have been diagnosed with cancer . At least a dozen played in Washington , but the geographic spread is nationwide . Blood cancers like lymphoma and leukemia dominate the list . No research has linked cancer to artificial turf . Griffin collected names through personal experience with sick players , and acknowledges that her list is not a scientific data set . But it 's enough to make her ask whether crumb rubber artificial turf , a product that has been rolled out in tens of thousands of parks , playgrounds , schools and stadiums in the U.S. , is safe for the athletes and kids who play on it . Others across the country are raising similar questions , arguing that the now-ubiquitous material , made out of synthetic fibers and scrap tire -- which can contain benzene , carbon black and lead , among other substances -- has not been adequately tested . Few studies have measured the risk of ingesting crumb rubber orally , for example . NBC 's own extensive investigation , which included a review of the relevant studies and interviews with scientists and industry professionals , was unable to find any agreement over whether crumb turf had ill effects on young athletes , or even whether the product had been sufficiently tested . The Synthetic Turf Council , an industry group , says that the evidence collected so far by scientists and state and federal agencies proves that artificial turf is safe . \u201c We 've got 14 studies on our website that says we can find no negative health effects , \u201d said Dr. Davis Lee , a Turf Council board member . While those studies are n't \u201c absolutely conclusive , \u201d he added , \u201c There 's certainly a preponderance of evidence to this point that says , in fact , it is safe . \u201d Do You or Your Kids Play on Synthetic Fields ? Share Your Story Environmental advocates want the Environmental Protection Agency and the Consumer Product Safety Commission to take a closer look . While both the CPSC and the EPA performed studies over five years ago , both agencies recently backtracked on their assurances the material was safe , calling their studies \u201c limited . \u201d But while the EPA told NBC News in a statement that \u201c more testing needs to be done , \u201d the agency also said it considered artificial turf to be a \u201c state and local decision , \u201d and would not be commissioning further research . \u201c There 's a host of concerns that are being raised , \u201d said Jeff Ruch , executive director of PEER , an environmental watchdog group . PEER has lodged complaints against both agencies . \u201c None have risen to the level of regulatory interest . \u201d The EPA refused multiple requests from NBC News for an interview , and declined to expand on their statement that \u201c more testing needs to be done . \u201d From ' Chemgrass ' to crumb rubber Invented in 1964 by Monsanto , the first iterations of artificial turf were little more than synthetic ' grass ' laid on top of concrete . First called \u201c ChemGrass , \u201d the product became famous as \u201c AstroTurf \u201d after it was installed in Houston 's Astrodome in 1966 . Some athletes , however , complained that the thin , synthetic surface made for hard landings . By the early 2000s , a better form of artificial turf had emerged . Called styrene butadiene rubber , or \u201c crumb rubber , \u201d the new turf contained tiny black crumbs made from pulverized car tires , poured in between the fake grass blades . The rubber infill gave the field more bounce , cushioned the impact for athletes , and helped prevent serious injuries like concussions . Since then , the material has become increasingly popular . Municipalities across the country have floated multi-million - dollar bonds to pay for new fields . Local leaders , some facility managers and companies say that turf costs less than natural grass to maintain , and can withstand heavy use year - round . \u201c There are benefits here . The potential risk , as we know it today , is extremely low . \u201d Today , according to figures from the Synthetic Turf Council , more than 11,000 synthetic turf sports fields are in use in the U.S. Most of them are crumb rubber . Crumb rubber infill is also used in children 's playgrounds across the country . Crumb rubber is an \u201c environmental success story , \u201d said Dan Zielinski , spokesperson for the Rubber Manufacturers Association . Not only have turf fields diverted millions of tires from landfills , said Zielinski , but they do n't require fertilizer or pesticides , and can save municipalities hundreds of thousands of gallons of water each year . \u201c There are benefits here , \u201d Zielinski said . \u201c The potential risk , as we know it today , is extremely low . \u201d ' Turf Bugs ' Jordan Swarthout , 22 , started playing soccer when she was 4 . She became a goalie at 9 , already addicted to the \u201c adrenaline rush \u201d that comes each time the ball hurtles toward the net . By 11 , Swarthout , who grew up in Sumner , Washington , about 45 minutes south of Seattle , was playing almost entirely on crumb rubber turf . When she and her team asked what was in the turf , \u201c old tires \u201d was the best answer she got . \u201c We always wondered what was underneath it , \u201d she said . \u201c What we could n't see . \u201d But the smell that hangs over crumb rubber fields \u2013 the scent of tires baking in the sun -- became as familiar to Swarthout as her endless goalie drills . She even got used to the \u201c turf bugs , \u201d as she and her teammates called them . During high school , she played on multiple teams at once , with two - hour practices five days a week , and games at least twice a week . Every day , she tried to clean the black rubber pellets , the \u201c turf bugs , \u201d out of the abrasions and burns she suffered as a goalkeeper on turf . Every day , to the chagrin of her mother , she shook them from her clothes and cleats onto the laundry room floor . She brushed them out of her hair , and spit them out of her mouth . \" The little black beads , \" she said . \" In the games and practices they 'd get in my eyes , they 'd get in my mouth , they 'd get in my nose . My mom would get so mad at me because I 'd go to the bathroom to take a shower , and the turf bugs would be everywhere . \u201d Jordan 's mother , Suzie Swarthout , said her daughter probably swallowed hundreds of tire crumbs a year . Yet neither Jordan nor Suzie worried much about it . \u201c We all had the confidence that the proper steps had been taken , the research had been done , that it had been proved to be safe , \u201d said Suzie . \u201c We all know how bad tires are , \u201d said Jordan . \u201c You do n't eat tires . Yet we were . You 'd get it in your mouth and you would n't think about it . \u201d In 2013 , after more than a year of mysterious thyroid problems , a biopsy determined that the star athlete had stage three Hodgkin lymphoma . It was one night this past May , months after doctors declared her daughter to be in remission , when Suzie Swarthout saw Amy Griffin 's story on a local news broadcast . \u201c I immediately after the newscast emailed [ Amy ] and said , \u201c You could add another subject to your statistics , ' \u201d recalled Suzie . Griffin said that since she first started collecting names of goalies with cancer and other diseases , she 's had people like the Swarthouts contact her , and her list has grown . Griffin and the Swarthouts said that they know it 's nearly impossible to figure out the origin of a disease like cancer , and that young people are exposed to hundreds of carcinogens . But , said Jordan Swarthout , \u201c If we have it available to us to research this , why should n't we ? Why ca n't we ? \" ' Every tire is different ' One of the problems with researching the potential health hazards of crumb rubber fields is the sheer variety of materials used in the product . Tens of thousands of different tires from different brands may be used in one field . According to the EPA , mercury , lead , benzene , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , and arsenic , among several other chemicals , heavy metals , and carcinogens , have been found in tires . Darren Gill , vice president of marketing for FieldTurf , a prominent turf company , said that those ingredients might worry consumers , but the manufacturing process ensures that their product is safe . \u201c If you look at the ingredients that go into a car tire , some people take those ingredients and turn them into health concerns , \u201d Gill said . \u201c But after the vulcanization process , those ingredients are inert . \u201d Industry leaders say while they encourage additional research , studies have shown that the substances found in crumb rubber are not at levels high enough to be at risk to children or athletes . \u201c There are certainly chemicals in small amounts [ in turf ] as in many other things , \u201d said Lee , of the Synthetic Turf Council . \u201c You could evaluate most any material out there and you 're going to find at some level , some chemical that might cause concern . \u201d \u201c The levels as they exist in tires , ground up tires , are very , very low , \u201d he added . \u201c The EPA has not found adverse health effect . Several state organizations have investigated it quite thoroughly . \u201d Existing research has attempted to measure the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals through the inhalation of gasses and particulate matter , as well as skin contact . Studies have found that crumb rubber fields emit gases that can be inhaled . Turf fields can become very hot -- 10 to 15 degrees hotter than the ambient temperature \u2013 increasing the chances that volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) and chemicals can \u201c off - gas , \u201d or leach into the air . One study performed by the state of Connecticut measured the concentrations of VOCs and chemicals in the air over fields . In addition to VOCs such as benzene and methylene chloride , researchers identified various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) . The report concluded that \u201c the use of outdoor and indoor artificial turf fields is not associated with elevated health risks , \u201d but that more research was needed to better understand chemical exposures on outdoor fields during hot weekends and in indoor facilities , which showed higher levels of chemicals in the air .

CDC recommends washing hands with soap and water whenever possible because handwashing reduces the amounts of all types of germs and chemicals on hands . But if soap and water are not available , using a hand sanitizer with at least 60 % alcohol can help you avoid getting sick and spreading germs to others . The guidance for effective handwashing and use of hand sanitizer in community settings was developed based on data from a number of studies . Why ? Soap and water are more effective than hand sanitizers at removing certain kinds of germs , like Cryptosporidium , norovirus , and Clostridium difficile 1 - 5 . Although alcohol - based hand sanitizers can inactivate many types of microbes very effectively when used correctly 1 - 15 , people may not use a large enough volume of the sanitizers or may wipe it off before it has dried 14 . Why ? Many studies show that hand sanitizers work well in clinical settings like hospitals , where hands come into contact with germs but generally are not heavily soiled or greasy 16 . Some data also show that hand sanitizers may work well against certain types of germs on slightly soiled hands 17,18 . However , hands may become very greasy or soiled in community settings , such as after people handle food , play sports , work in the garden , or go camping or fishing . When hands are heavily soiled or greasy , hand sanitizers may not work well 3,7,16 . Handwashing with soap and water is recommended in such circumstances . Why ? Although few studies have been conducted , hand sanitizers probably cannot remove or inactivate many types of harmful chemicals . In one study , people who reported using hand sanitizer to clean hands had increased levels of pesticides in their bodies 19 . If hands have touched harmful chemicals , wash carefully with soap and water ( or as directed by a poison control center ) . Why ? Many studies have found that sanitizers with an alcohol concentration between 60\u201395 % are more effective at killing germs than those with a lower alcohol concentration or non-alcohol - based hand sanitizers 16,20 . Hand sanitizers without 60 - 95 % alcohol 1 ) may not work equally well for many types of germs ; and 2 ) merely reduce the growth of germs rather than kill them outright . Why ? The steps for hand sanitizer use are based on a simplified procedure recommended by CDC 21 . Instructing people to cover all surfaces of both hands with hand sanitizer has been found to provide similar disinfection effectiveness as providing detailed steps for rubbing - in hand sanitizer 22 . Why ? Ethyl alcohol ( ethanol ) - based hand sanitizers are safe when used as directed , 23 but they can cause alcohol poisoning if a person swallows more than a couple of mouthfuls 24 . From 2011 \u2013 2015 , U.S. poison control centers received nearly 85,000 calls about hand sanitizer exposures among children 25 . Children may be particularly likely to swallow hand sanitizers that are scented , brightly colored , or attractively packaged . Hand sanitizers should be stored out of the reach of young children and should be used with adult supervision . Child - resistant caps could also help reduce hand sanitizer - related poisonings among young children 24 .

Zinedine Zidane , who watched on from the touchline in Cardiff , volleyed in an all - time great final goal way back in 2002 - but how does Mandzukic 's stand up ? Great games are often graced by great moments but few , if any , have seen a goal as good as Mario Mandzukic 's against Real Madrid . After Cristiano Ronaldo had given the Spanish champions the lead early Juventus were dragged back on level terms by a goal of supreme quality from Croatian Mandzukic . After a cross - field ball to Alex Sandro was crossed back into Gonzalo Higuain whose chested pass was brought down with precision before being fired , over his shoulder into the net by Mandzukic leaving Keylor Navas in the Real goal with no chance . Zinedine Zidane , who watched on from the touchline in Cardiff , volleyed in an all - time great final goal way back in 2002 while Lionel Messi 's 2011 effort was another spectacular piece of individual brilliance . So where does Mandzukic 's effort rank ? Our writers have their say : Miguel Delaney A goal made in the air , and above it only sky ? This was a level above in so many ways . It was also fitting that Mario Mandzukic 's 27th - minute goal came against Zinedine Zidane , because the instant question was whether it betters the Real Madrid manager 's famous strike from 2002 against Bayer Leverkesen . It was that good , and has that kind of claim . One way it was certainly better than Zidane 's was in the build - up . While that 2002 volley came from a deflected cross , this was from the most supreme and vaunted game of heads and volleys that has ever been seen . Leo Bonucci pinged the ball to Alex Sandro , he sent it across for Gonzalo Higuain , who chested it and teed it up for Mandzukic . Three players , four touches , and not a single touch of the ground until the ball hit the net . As regards how it got to the net , Mandzukic 's arched overhead was exquisite , but probably did n't quite have the purity of strike of Zidane 's volley , that was technically harder to pull off and keep down . It is also open to debate whether Keylor Navas - or simply a taller goalkeeper , like say David De Gea - should have saved it . So , while this was a better team goal , Zidane 's was maybe a better single strike . From there , it comes down to preference . Ed Malyon Start with Leo Bonucci 's raking ball , and Alex Sandro volleying it back across . Gonzalo Higuain had lots of work to do , but he chested it , keeping it close , and he looped it into the path of Mario Mandzukic . Mario , formerly of Atletico Madrid , then executed a bicycle kick of ludicrous technical excellence , looping over Keylor Navas and levelling the Champions League final . Zinedine Zidane 's volley was one hit . A sensational one but just one hit . This was a move where the ball did n't even bounce in Real Madrid 's half . It was a team goal of barely believable touch and technique . It was exquisite . It was the best . Luke Brown Zinedine Zidane 's goal against Bayer Leverkusen in the 2002 final was world - class , but he had so much time to adjust his body position and wait for the ball to drop , with Leverkusen 's defence nowhere to be seen by the time he had volleyed the ball into the back of the net . Mandzukic did n't have that luxury . With two defenders bearing down on him , and with his body awkwardly twisted away from goal , his was a purely instinctive finish .

Zinedine Zidane , who watched on from the touchline in Cardiff , volleyed in an all - time great final goal way back in 2002 - but how does Mandzukic 's stand up ? Great games are often graced by great moments but few , if any , have seen a goal as good as Mario Mandzukic 's against Real Madrid . After Cristiano Ronaldo had given the Spanish champions the lead early Juventus were dragged back on level terms by a goal of supreme quality from Croatian Mandzukic . After a cross - field ball to Alex Sandro was crossed back into Gonzalo Higuain whose chested pass was brought down with precision before being fired , over his shoulder into the net by Mandzukic leaving Keylor Navas in the Real goal with no chance . Zinedine Zidane , who watched on from the touchline in Cardiff , volleyed in an all - time great final goal way back in 2002 while Lionel Messi 's 2011 effort was another spectacular piece of individual brilliance . So where does Mandzukic 's effort rank ? Our writers have their say : Miguel Delaney A goal made in the air , and above it only sky ? This was a level above in so many ways . It was also fitting that Mario Mandzukic 's 27th - minute goal came against Zinedine Zidane , because the instant question was whether it betters the Real Madrid manager 's famous strike from 2002 against Bayer Leverkesen . It was that good , and has that kind of claim . One way it was certainly better than Zidane 's was in the build - up . While that 2002 volley came from a deflected cross , this was from the most supreme and vaunted game of heads and volleys that has ever been seen . Leo Bonucci pinged the ball to Alex Sandro , he sent it across for Gonzalo Higuain , who chested it and teed it up for Mandzukic . Three players , four touches , and not a single touch of the ground until the ball hit the net . As regards how it got to the net , Mandzukic 's arched overhead was exquisite , but probably did n't quite have the purity of strike of Zidane 's volley , that was technically harder to pull off and keep down . It is also open to debate whether Keylor Navas - or simply a taller goalkeeper , like say David De Gea - should have saved it . So , while this was a better team goal , Zidane 's was maybe a better single strike . From there , it comes down to preference . Ed Malyon Start with Leo Bonucci 's raking ball , and Alex Sandro volleying it back across . Gonzalo Higuain had lots of work to do , but he chested it , keeping it close , and he looped it into the path of Mario Mandzukic . Mario , formerly of Atletico Madrid , then executed a bicycle kick of ludicrous technical excellence , looping over Keylor Navas and levelling the Champions League final . Zinedine Zidane 's volley was one hit . A sensational one but just one hit . This was a move where the ball did n't even bounce in Real Madrid 's half . It was a team goal of barely believable touch and technique . It was exquisite . It was the best . Luke Brown Zinedine Zidane 's goal against Bayer Leverkusen in the 2002 final was world - class , but he had so much time to adjust his body position and wait for the ball to drop , with Leverkusen 's defence nowhere to be seen by the time he had volleyed the ball into the back of the net . Mandzukic did n't have that luxury . With two defenders bearing down on him , and with his body awkwardly twisted away from goal , his was a purely instinctive finish . And then there was the build - up play leading up to the finish : Bonucci 's fine long - ball forward , Alex Sandro 's perfectly weighted cutback , Higuain 's control under pressure \u2026 An outrageous goal that will be remembered for years to come . Ben Burrows Cometh the hour , cometh the man and I wo n't argue strongly that Mandzukic 's sublime effort here is n't the best goal we 've ever seen on such a stage .

Springs Memorial Endowed Scholarship that will help eligible Porter-Billups Leadership Academy ( PBLA ) alumni attend Regis University . PBLA was established in 1996 by Regis University head men 's basketball coach Lonnie Porter to help at-risk students graduate from high school and attend college . He was joined in 2006 by NBA star Chauncey Billups with a goal to provide students that qualify for admittance to Regis University , scholarships for tuition and fees . Walter Springs was enrolled in Regis College in 1939 and had to take scholarships and work two part-time jobs to pay for his education . \u201c He was curious about Catholicism , \u201d said his niece Meredith Springs - Levert . \u201c What got him interested in Regis was his affiliation with Sacred Heart Church and the priests there . \u201d In 1938 , Denver native Walter Springs , a Black man , enrolled in to Regis College as a freshman . The youngest of eleven children , he was the first in his family to go to college . Springs was known for his kindness and sense of humor -- he also boxed and played fullback on the football team for Regis College . \u201c The fact that he even went to Regis and worked two jobs tells you what kind of sacrifice it meant , \u201d said his niece . Springs converted to Catholicism and was even voted the school 's \u201c Most Popular Student \u201d in 1941 . A few months later , he left college to serve his country in a segregated US Army during World War II . \u201c He believed it was his patriotic duty , \u201d Springs - Levert said . \u201c There was a widely held thought at that period that Black people , if you served your country , you were a good upright citizen . \u201d Like most young men who fought in World War II , Springs never came back . But his death did n't happen overseas , he lost his life before he even left the country . On December 17 , 1942 , Sgt.

Springs Memorial Endowed Scholarship that will help eligible Porter-Billups Leadership Academy ( PBLA ) alumni attend Regis University . PBLA was established in 1996 by Regis University head men 's basketball coach Lonnie Porter to help at-risk students graduate from high school and attend college . He was joined in 2006 by NBA star Chauncey Billups with a goal to provide students that qualify for admittance to Regis University , scholarships for tuition and fees . Walter Springs was enrolled in Regis College in 1939 and had to take scholarships and work two part-time jobs to pay for his education . \u201c He was curious about Catholicism , \u201d said his niece Meredith Springs - Levert . \u201c What got him interested in Regis was his affiliation with Sacred Heart Church and the priests there . \u201d In 1938 , Denver native Walter Springs , a Black man , enrolled in to Regis College as a freshman . The youngest of eleven children , he was the first in his family to go to college . Springs was known for his kindness and sense of humor -- he also boxed and played fullback on the football team for Regis College . \u201c The fact that he even went to Regis and worked two jobs tells you what kind of sacrifice it meant , \u201d said his niece . Springs converted to Catholicism and was even voted the school 's \u201c Most Popular Student \u201d in 1941 . A few months later , he left college to serve his country in a segregated US Army during World War II . \u201c He believed it was his patriotic duty , \u201d Springs - Levert said . \u201c There was a widely held thought at that period that Black people , if you served your country , you were a good upright citizen . \u201d Like most young men who fought in World War II , Springs never came back . But his death did n't happen overseas , he lost his life before he even left the country . On December 17 , 1942 , Sgt. Walter Springs was shot and killed by a white military police officer in a Texas caf\u00e9 , a few miles from the Army base where he was about to report for officer training . \u201c He gets off the train an goes into the caf\u00e9 , \u201d Springs - Levert said . \u201c MP 's asked him about a pass , and he said ' Yes , I have a pass but address me according to my rank ' .

Lamberto Leoni ( Mario Andretti ) What ? Ensign-Cosworth N177 ( Lotus -Cosworth 78 ) Where ? Long Beach When ? 1978 US West GP ( qualifying on 1 April 1978 ) Why ? With his single GP start Lamberto Leoni achieved more than he managed as a Formula One team owner ! His final try in the spring of 1978 , here pictured at Long Beach during practice , led to another DNQ and the end of a very short Grand Prix career . A decade later , Leoni was back on the brink of F1 , now proudly presenting his First F1 car to the press . Its lines , penned by respected Brazilian designer Richard Divila , looked promising . But although it was tested at the hands of Gabriele Tarquini , the car never raced . Or did it ? In its First life the car remained stillborn , but it got an unexpected second , erm , Life . After Leoni's F1 plans were scuppered he sought ways to cut his losses . Soon he found his victim in the shape of one Ernesto Vita , the Italian businessman who had already been fooled by veteran ex- Ferrari engineer Franco Rocchi , who had been involved with the Scuderia since 1949 . The man had some fame for having a part in the great Ferrari flat - 12 , which must have meant to Vita that he had talent to throw away . Which was exactly what he did when coming up with his latest dream engine . Rocchi had convinced Vita to create Life Racing Engines as a vehicle for his aircraft - style W12 motor , which used a peculiar 4 - 4 - 4 configuration . Initially intended as test bed , the First 189 , now rechristened Life F190 , was extensively rebuilt to conform to FIA 's latest crash test regulations and could thus be promoted to race car . The idea of using such an outdated design to debut its revolutionary engine did n't seem a bright idea to followers at the time . Still , the 12 - team restriction being years away from entering the Concorde agreement , anyone could enter F1 and around 1990 the common feeling looked to be the more , the merrier indeed . Life 's subsequent disgrace as the worst modern - era Grand Prix team is fairly well documented , as the car was so hugely off the pace and unreliable at that , that we had to go back to Al Pease 's overambitious entry into F1 to find an effort that was similarly out of place . The engine reportedly produced a mere 360 bhp while McLaren 's Honda engine had about 800 bhp ! ' Nuff said Sticking a Judd V8 in the back - the engine the First was originally designed for - did n't help and the outfit folded before having to spend lashes of lire on the two Asia - Pacific long - haul events . Quickly , Leoni returned to his well - oiled F3000 enterprise and just as rival F3000 team DAMS never made it to F1 . Lamberto had started his association with the F1 junior category as a driver , though . In the series ' debut year , Leoni teamed up with the PMC outfit to form a driver pairing with Belgium 's Thierry Tassin . Like the Barron Racing team , which fielded Tyrrell 012s for Roberto Moreno and Claudio Langes , and Roger Cowman entering a sole Arrows A6 for Slim Borgudd , the two used the transitional rule that DFV - engined F1 cars were also eligible for the championship and thus ran a pair of Williams FW08Cs . It proved a disastrous decision as the pukka F3000 machinery such as the March 85 C or Ralt RT20 completely outclassed the ageing F1 cars . Tassin and Leoni always managed to finish but usually were several laps down , as last of the classified runners - that is , in case they managed to get classified at all . After the opening two British rounds the team wisely decided to skip Estoril . Tassin moved over to Eddie Jordan 's team , while Lamberto had to sit out the event . He returned with PMC for his home race at Vallelunga , but got involved in a tangle with Ivan Capelli 's Genoa March after just four laps . Then at Pau , there was a sudden upturn in fortunes , as Lamberto survived the usual Pau carnage at the infamous Foch Square to finish 3rd of the five remaining runners , while also finishing on the leader 's lap , ahead of Olivier Grouillard no less . PMC 's podium finish was the highest - ever finishing position for an F1 chassis during any F3000 event . But soon the team were back to its old ways . Spa saw another retirement while at Dijon Leoni was making up the rear as usual . After that , enough was enough and Lamberto grabbed the opportunity to replace Alain Fert\u00e9 in the Corbari Italia team , which was running Marches . At Enna , he took over the Frenchman 's seat but retired in the Sicilian heat waves . Then the F3000 circus moved to the \u00d6sterreichring and there Leoni equalled his best result , taking a fighting third right behind Ivan Capelli and John Nielsen 's Ralt . Again , it was reason for temporary happiness , as Leoni left Zandvoort with nothing to show for and showed similar lacklustre form at the final event at Donington . In 1986 , the quantity ( and quality ! ) of the F3000 field almost doubled compared to 1985 , Leoni decided to go his own way and entered a March 86 C as driver / team owner . The International Trophy at Silverstone , now part of the F3000 championship , was the first time First Racing entered a race . Leoni finished an undistinguished 11th . In the following races , the new combination only attracted attention by falling off at Vallelunga and in Belgium , and at Mugello Lamberto even faced the ignominy of not qualifying , with a repeat embarrassment at Zeltweg after crashing out during the warm - up session . It was a big hit and car nor driver were ready to enter the first Birmingham Superprix , nor were they present at the final two events at Le Mans and Jarama . Leoni was undeterred . For 1987 , he created a three - car Italian superteam which March - Mader 87 Bs for himself , Aldo Bertuzzi and star driver Gabriele Tarquini . Still in the first part of the season , a 6th for Leoni at Pau was the only reward , as the hapless Bertuzzi DNQ 'ed his heart out and Tarquini was found crashing his car at several events . Suddenly , at Enna , the disappointing Gabriele turned his form around and produced a podium finish for First , with Leoni taking 5th . Strangely , Tarquini was soon back to his habit of finishing last in a season dominated by Stefano Modena . But then Gabriele found new form as Modena won again at Imola . There the First team took its best result of the season , Tarquini finishing second and Leoni fourth . Even Bertuzzi managed to qualify and finish the race , albeit in last position . On a roll , Leoni and Tarquini took fourth and fifth at Le Mans -Bugatti , with the team boss taking another fourth at Jarama , where Claudio Langes replaced Bertuzzi . In the championship table , Leoni and his main man Tarquini finished equal 8th with 12 points each . 1988 was supposed to be Johnny Herbert 's year , as JH comfortably took the opening race at Jerez . Meanwhile , Leoni had decided to step down from his driving duties and managed to win a classy driving pairing for his March - Judd 88 Bs . Both Pierluigi Martini - two-timing with F1 after his mid-season return to Minardi - and Marco Apicella were hot title favourites and expectations ran high . After two strike - outs the season got underway for Martini with third at Pau , breathing down the neck of Jean Alesi . The team hen had to wait until Monza for Marco Apicella to put himself on the scoreboard , finishing runner - up to Bromley 's later champion Moreno . A couple of weeks later , at Enna , Martini won First 's first race , while at Brands he took second to Martin Donnelly and in Birmingham snatched the final podium spot . His F1 schedule clashing with the F3000 calendar , Martini chose to go to Estoril with Minardi , while Alain Fert\u00e9 subbed at the mini-sized Le Mans -Bugatti track . His return for the two final races went nowhere in the way of results . And so another season of high expectations had gone by without the success to show for it . Granted , the team had taken its first win but the mercurial Martini could - and should - have been a major detractor to Roberto Moreno 's title aspirations . As it was , he took a distant fourth in the championship . Thus it was not without surprise that Leoni launched his plan to move up to F1 . During the time the car was drawn , built and put through its first motions by Gabriele Tarquini , First had its usual F3000 business to take care of , and this was n't a job to be taken lightheartedly , as Leoni again decided to go for a three - car team , new team leader Apicella being joined by Fabrizio Giovanardi and later FIRST boss Jean - D\u00e9nis D\u00e9l\u00e9traz . Incidentally , Leoni's First squad should not mixed up with the French FIRST sportscar outfit formed by Fabien Giroix and D\u00e9l\u00e9traz some years ago Ironically , 1989 was to be First 's most successful season in F3000 , as young Giovanardi took a surprise victory in just his second race for the team while Apicella took several podiums to take fourth in the championship . If it had n't been for those quick and ultra-professional DAMS Lolas of Bernard and Comas and of course that man Jean Alesi Still , Marco had been in the thick of it during most of the races and looked like real championship material for 1990 . And so the F1 project was set aside to give Apicella a real shot at the title , supported by the same drivers as in 1989 , although D\u00e9l\u00e9traz was replaced by Marco Greco during the year . Also standing in the way of First 's F1 ambitions was F3000 chassis supplier March , which had just given First a semi-works status and was going from strength to strength themselves with their Adrian Newey -penned 881 . It is rumoured March more or less prohibited First to continue their F1 operation on the sanction of the Bicester factory withholding its support for Apicella 's title bid . All the more sadly that in the end it was n't to be , not by a long - shot . The 1990 season was all about the singularly efficient DAMS team , their Lolas only breaking under the hands of Allan McNish , while Erik Comas strolled to the championship , seemingly unperturbed . Apicella duly followed the DAMS cars home on many occasions but also had to contend with opposition from Forti's Gianni Morbidelli , Eddie Irvine in Jordan 's Camel Reynard and GA 's Eric van de Poele , who took three wins . While Van de Poele was easily Comas 's best opponent , Apicella 's form tailed off at the end of the season , hitting a low point with disqualification at Brands Hatch . Having lost Apicella 's services to Paul Stewart Racing for 1991 , First started all over with Reynard 91D chassis , Mader-tuned Cosworths , the returning D\u00e9l\u00e9traz , the promising Giovanni Bonanno and French hotshoe \u00c9ric H\u00e9lary , now an Opel DTM regular . The young Frenchman showed his speed on many occasions , but was unlucky to score just a third at Pau . While the season unfolded into a Zanardi / Fittipaldi benefit , the First team 's first shake - up came at the same classic track , where Bonanno - who later returned with a self - run Reynard - was released in favour of Steffi Graf 's boyfriend , Michael Bartels . A second blow followed when after Jerez D\u00e9l\u00e9traz left the team for the second time . He was not replaced . Then Bartels and H\u00e9lary failed to show up at Enna for the Gran Premio del Mediterraneo . It was the end of the line for First Racing , which came close to the championship on two occasions , only to have its foolhardy F1 ambition get in the way . By then the mantle of leading Italian F3000 team had long been taking over by Forti , Crypton and the lusciously named Il Barone Rampante , before F3000 domination also passed over to British teams . Having abandoned his F3000 outfit , Leoni followed in Didier Pironi 's footsteps in going for the ultimate modern - day danger ride : powerboat racing . This venture became rather more of a success , Lamberto taking many wins and almost taking the World Championship in 1993 . It would be cruel to say that Lamberto Leoni 's seven - year association with Formula 3000 left him with nothing . His team took just two wins but had been a front -runner at best and a mainstay at the least during its stay in the category . Last year , while still competing in offshore powerboat racing , Leoni even made a return to the junior formula , this time fielding a two - car entry under the Monaco Motorsport banner . Main drivers Thomas Biagi and Cyrille Sauvage seldomly starred and the outfit was relegated to Italian F3000 . Still , it was more than could be said of Leoni 's involvement in Formula One . Lamberto 's initial road to F1 was very similar to that of many of his countrymen , particularly that of Siegfried Stohr . Taking a Formula Italia title into F3 , Leoni regularly produced steady drives to some podium positions , but he never set the world alight with a particular performance . Then , after a slow start in a Ralt RT1 , Leoni signed to drive Scuderia Everest 's curious Ferrari V6-engined Chevron in the European F2 Championship . With this car he then proceeded to win the Adriatic GP at Misano on aggregate . Before that , he had n't scored a single top-six finish ! And he was n't in the remainder of the season A one - off rent -a-drive for Surtees in his 1977 home race preceded Leoni 's real F1 break . This came through Ensign 's Mo Nunn losing the services of Clay Regazzoni to Shadow . Two races into the season more woe followed for the little team as lead driver Danny Ongais quit , taking along his Interscope dollars to get himself a private Shadow . At Kyalami , Lamberto was thus promoted to the No.22 seat , the team now reduced to a single - car outfit . But with two more DNQs following - pictured is his last qualifying attempt - there was little chance of his staying with the team , especially now Nunn was able to lure the able Jacky Ickx into his pretty competent design - at least it was so the year before , as Ickx was about to find out , although the Belgian 's young replacement Derek Daly managed to grab a point with it in Canada . And what about Leoni ? For the next couple of years he was in and out of Formula 2 , a 6th at the 1983 International Trophy on board a March - BMW 832 his best result . Only when F3000 was introduced Lamberto 's interest was rekindled and , as is proven above , he became one of the category 's staunchest supporters . Reader 's Why by Don Capps It looks like Mario Andretti is trying to pass someone . The car is carrying the number 22 and wearing Tissot sponsorship . So that narrows it to the Ensign . And looking at the background , it says , \" Long Beach ! \" That means this must be Andretti coming up to pass Lamberto Leoni during practice for the 1978 race . Leoni is one of those shooting stars that flashes through the firmament and is soon over the horizon . A good , competent F3 driver , Leoni moved into F2 and was never quite there in the placings at the end of the race that one would expect . He did manage to win an F2 race , the 1977 Misano race , driving a Chevron -Ferrari . His win was at the expense of Eddie Cheever who spent most of the weekend overcoming some sort of adversity - although he did win the first heat after an amazing race from deep on the grid . However , Leoni won the second heat and beat Cheever on the aggregate . Leoni immediately parlayed this into an F1 drive , getting enough lire to hire a Surtees at the Italian GP . He then did a deal that saw him in the Ensign for 1978 . Although he did make the grid for the Argentine race , he retired when the engine let go . At Brasil he had a driveshaft break during the warmup and he failed to start the race . He then failed to qualify in south Africa and at Long Beach and was then dumped by the team . He did the odd F2 and F3000 races , but a serious accident while racing F3000 in Austria led him to found an F3000 team - FIRST - and work that side of the bargain . Ensign was the Mo Nunn marque that always seemed to be well - done despite restricted budgets and not standing in the correct line when luck was being handed out . The original Ensign was helped along with money from Ricky von Opel and later Teddy Yip . The N177 cars were wonderful machines that certainly deserved better . They are among the best looking cars from this era and in 1977 with Regazzoni in the works car and Patrick Tambay in the Yip car , they did very well indeed and one can only imagine what could have been should they had some serious sponsorship . However , these cars soldiered into the 1978 and 1979 seasons and struggled to qualify much less compete for placings although the potential was clearly there even when the \" wing - car \" revolution hit .","annotations":[{"text":"Marco Apicella","span":[92,105],"token_span":[17,18],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The object that undergoes change."},{"text":"the end of the season","span":[10597,10617],"token_span":[2048,2052],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the improvement occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"The team underperformed , but in 1989 , again with FIRST ( who had made a change to Reynard Motorsport cars ) , Apicella achieved several podium finishes on his way to finishing fourth overall in the Drivers ' Championship .

Still , the 12 - team restriction being years away from entering the Concorde agreement , anyone could enter F1 and around 1990 the common feeling looked to be the more , the merrier indeed . Life 's subsequent disgrace as the worst modern - era Grand Prix team is fairly well documented , as the car was so hugely off the pace and unreliable at that , that we had to go back to Al Pease 's overambitious entry into F1 to find an effort that was similarly out of place . The engine reportedly produced a mere 360 bhp while McLaren 's Honda engine had about 800 bhp ! ' Nuff said Sticking a Judd V8 in the back - the engine the First was originally designed for - did n't help and the outfit folded before having to spend lashes of lire on the two Asia - Pacific long - haul events . Quickly , Leoni returned to his well - oiled F3000 enterprise and just as rival F3000 team DAMS never made it to F1 . Lamberto had started his association with the F1 junior category as a driver , though . In the series ' debut year , Leoni teamed up with the PMC outfit to form a driver pairing with Belgium 's Thierry Tassin . Like the Barron Racing team , which fielded Tyrrell 012s for Roberto Moreno and Claudio Langes , and Roger Cowman entering a sole Arrows A6 for Slim Borgudd , the two used the transitional rule that DFV - engined F1 cars were also eligible for the championship and thus ran a pair of Williams FW08Cs . It proved a disastrous decision as the pukka F3000 machinery such as the March 85 C or Ralt RT20 completely outclassed the ageing F1 cars . Tassin and Leoni always managed to finish but usually were several laps down , as last of the classified runners - that is , in case they managed to get classified at all . After the opening two British rounds the team wisely decided to skip Estoril . Tassin moved over to Eddie Jordan 's team , while Lamberto had to sit out the event . He returned with PMC for his home race at Vallelunga , but got involved in a tangle with Ivan Capelli 's Genoa March after just four laps . Then at Pau , there was a sudden upturn in fortunes , as Lamberto survived the usual Pau carnage at the infamous Foch Square to finish 3rd of the five remaining runners , while also finishing on the leader 's lap , ahead of Olivier Grouillard no less . PMC 's podium finish was the highest - ever finishing position for an F1 chassis during any F3000 event . But soon the team were back to its old ways . Spa saw another retirement while at Dijon Leoni was making up the rear as usual . After that , enough was enough and Lamberto grabbed the opportunity to replace Alain Fert\u00e9 in the Corbari Italia team , which was running Marches . At Enna , he took over the Frenchman 's seat but retired in the Sicilian heat waves . Then the F3000 circus moved to the \u00d6sterreichring and there Leoni equalled his best result , taking a fighting third right behind Ivan Capelli and John Nielsen 's Ralt . Again , it was reason for temporary happiness , as Leoni left Zandvoort with nothing to show for and showed similar lacklustre form at the final event at Donington . In 1986 , the quantity ( and quality ! ) of the F3000 field almost doubled compared to 1985 , Leoni decided to go his own way and entered a March 86 C as driver / team owner . The International Trophy at Silverstone , now part of the F3000 championship , was the first time First Racing entered a race . Leoni finished an undistinguished 11th . In the following races , the new combination only attracted attention by falling off at Vallelunga and in Belgium , and at Mugello Lamberto even faced the ignominy of not qualifying , with a repeat embarrassment at Zeltweg after crashing out during the warm - up session . It was a big hit and car nor driver were ready to enter the first Birmingham Superprix , nor were they present at the final two events at Le Mans and Jarama . Leoni was undeterred . For 1987 , he created a three - car Italian superteam which March - Mader 87 Bs for himself , Aldo Bertuzzi and star driver Gabriele Tarquini . Still in the first part of the season , a 6th for Leoni at Pau was the only reward , as the hapless Bertuzzi DNQ 'ed his heart out and Tarquini was found crashing his car at several events . Suddenly , at Enna , the disappointing Gabriele turned his form around and produced a podium finish for First , with Leoni taking 5th . Strangely , Tarquini was soon back to his habit of finishing last in a season dominated by Stefano Modena . But then Gabriele found new form as Modena won again at Imola . There the First team took its best result of the season , Tarquini finishing second and Leoni fourth . Even Bertuzzi managed to qualify and finish the race , albeit in last position . On a roll , Leoni and Tarquini took fourth and fifth at Le Mans -Bugatti , with the team boss taking another fourth at Jarama , where Claudio Langes replaced Bertuzzi . In the championship table , Leoni and his main man Tarquini finished equal 8th with 12 points each . 1988 was supposed to be Johnny Herbert 's year , as JH comfortably took the opening race at Jerez . Meanwhile , Leoni had decided to step down from his driving duties and managed to win a classy driving pairing for his March - Judd 88 Bs . Both Pierluigi Martini - two-timing with F1 after his mid-season return to Minardi - and Marco Apicella were hot title favourites and expectations ran high . After two strike - outs the season got underway for Martini with third at Pau , breathing down the neck of Jean Alesi . The team hen had to wait until Monza for Marco Apicella to put himself on the scoreboard , finishing runner - up to Bromley 's later champion Moreno . A couple of weeks later , at Enna , Martini won First 's first race , while at Brands he took second to Martin Donnelly and in Birmingham snatched the final podium spot . His F1 schedule clashing with the F3000 calendar , Martini chose to go to Estoril with Minardi , while Alain Fert\u00e9 subbed at the mini-sized Le Mans -Bugatti track . His return for the two final races went nowhere in the way of results . And so another season of high expectations had gone by without the success to show for it . Granted , the team had taken its first win but the mercurial Martini could - and should - have been a major detractor to Roberto Moreno 's title aspirations . As it was , he took a distant fourth in the championship . Thus it was not without surprise that Leoni launched his plan to move up to F1 . During the time the car was drawn , built and put through its first motions by Gabriele Tarquini , First had its usual F3000 business to take care of , and this was n't a job to be taken lightheartedly , as Leoni again decided to go for a three - car team , new team leader Apicella being joined by Fabrizio Giovanardi and later FIRST boss Jean - D\u00e9nis D\u00e9l\u00e9traz . Incidentally , Leoni's First squad should not mixed up with the French FIRST sportscar outfit formed by Fabien Giroix and D\u00e9l\u00e9traz some years ago Ironically , 1989 was to be First 's most successful season in F3000 , as young Giovanardi took a surprise victory in just his second race for the team while Apicella took several podiums to take fourth in the championship . If it had n't been for those quick and ultra-professional DAMS Lolas of Bernard and Comas and of course that man Jean Alesi Still , Marco had been in the thick of it during most of the races and looked like real championship material for 1990 . And so the F1 project was set aside to give Apicella a real shot at the title , supported by the same drivers as in 1989 , although D\u00e9l\u00e9traz was replaced by Marco Greco during the year . Also standing in the way of First 's F1 ambitions was F3000 chassis supplier March , which had just given First a semi-works status and was going from strength to strength themselves with their Adrian Newey -penned 881 . It is rumoured March more or less prohibited First to continue their F1 operation on the sanction of the Bicester factory withholding its support for Apicella 's title bid . All the more sadly that in the end it was n't to be , not by a long - shot . The 1990 season was all about the singularly efficient DAMS team , their Lolas only breaking under the hands of Allan McNish , while Erik Comas strolled to the championship , seemingly unperturbed . Apicella duly followed the DAMS cars home on many occasions but also had to contend with opposition from Forti's Gianni Morbidelli , Eddie Irvine in Jordan 's Camel Reynard and GA 's Eric van de Poele , who took three wins . While Van de Poele was easily Comas 's best opponent , Apicella 's form tailed off at the end of the season , hitting a low point with disqualification at Brands Hatch . Having lost Apicella 's services to Paul Stewart Racing for 1991 , First started all over with Reynard 91D chassis , Mader-tuned Cosworths , the returning D\u00e9l\u00e9traz , the promising Giovanni Bonanno and French hotshoe \u00c9ric H\u00e9lary , now an Opel DTM regular . The young Frenchman showed his speed on many occasions , but was unlucky to score just a third at Pau . While the season unfolded into a Zanardi / Fittipaldi benefit , the First team 's first shake - up came at the same classic track , where Bonanno - who later returned with a self - run Reynard - was released in favour of Steffi Graf 's boyfriend , Michael Bartels . A second blow followed when after Jerez D\u00e9l\u00e9traz left the team for the second time . He was not replaced . Then Bartels and H\u00e9lary failed to show up at Enna for the Gran Premio del Mediterraneo . It was the end of the line for First Racing , which came close to the championship on two occasions , only to have its foolhardy F1 ambition get in the way . By then the mantle of leading Italian F3000 team had long been taking over by Forti , Crypton and the lusciously named Il Barone Rampante , before F3000 domination also passed over to British teams . Having abandoned his F3000 outfit , Leoni followed in Didier Pironi 's footsteps in going for the ultimate modern - day danger ride : powerboat racing . This venture became rather more of a success , Lamberto taking many wins and almost taking the World Championship in 1993 . It would be cruel to say that Lamberto Leoni 's seven - year association with Formula 3000 left him with nothing . His team took just two wins but had been a front -runner at best and a mainstay at the least during its stay in the category . Last year , while still competing in offshore powerboat racing , Leoni even made a return to the junior formula , this time fielding a two - car entry under the Monaco Motorsport banner . Main drivers Thomas Biagi and Cyrille Sauvage seldomly starred and the outfit was relegated to Italian F3000 . Still , it was more than could be said of Leoni 's involvement in Formula One . Lamberto 's initial road to F1 was very similar to that of many of his countrymen , particularly that of Siegfried Stohr . Taking a Formula Italia title into F3 , Leoni regularly produced steady drives to some podium positions , but he never set the world alight with a particular performance . Then , after a slow start in a Ralt RT1 , Leoni signed to drive Scuderia Everest 's curious Ferrari V6-engined Chevron in the European F2 Championship . With this car he then proceeded to win the Adriatic GP at Misano on aggregate . Before that , he had n't scored a single top-six finish ! And he was n't in the remainder of the season A one - off rent -a-drive for Surtees in his 1977 home race preceded Leoni 's real F1 break . This came through Ensign 's Mo Nunn losing the services of Clay Regazzoni to Shadow . Two races into the season more woe followed for the little team as lead driver Danny Ongais quit , taking along his Interscope dollars to get himself a private Shadow . At Kyalami , Lamberto was thus promoted to the No.22 seat , the team now reduced to a single - car outfit . But with two more DNQs following - pictured is his last qualifying attempt - there was little chance of his staying with the team , especially now Nunn was able to lure the able Jacky Ickx into his pretty competent design - at least it was so the year before , as Ickx was about to find out , although the Belgian 's young replacement Derek Daly managed to grab a point with it in Canada . And what about Leoni ? For the next couple of years he was in and out of Formula 2 , a 6th at the 1983 International Trophy on board a March - BMW 832 his best result . Only when F3000 was introduced Lamberto 's interest was rekindled and , as is proven above , he became one of the category 's staunchest supporters . Reader 's Why by Don Capps It looks like Mario Andretti is trying to pass someone . The car is carrying the number 22 and wearing Tissot sponsorship . So that narrows it to the Ensign . And looking at the background , it says , \" Long Beach ! \" That means this must be Andretti coming up to pass Lamberto Leoni during practice for the 1978 race . Leoni is one of those shooting stars that flashes through the firmament and is soon over the horizon . A good , competent F3 driver , Leoni moved into F2 and was never quite there in the placings at the end of the race that one would expect . He did manage to win an F2 race , the 1977 Misano race , driving a Chevron -Ferrari . His win was at the expense of Eddie Cheever who spent most of the weekend overcoming some sort of adversity - although he did win the first heat after an amazing race from deep on the grid . However , Leoni won the second heat and beat Cheever on the aggregate . Leoni immediately parlayed this into an F1 drive , getting enough lire to hire a Surtees at the Italian GP . He then did a deal that saw him in the Ensign for 1978 . Although he did make the grid for the Argentine race , he retired when the engine let go . At Brasil he had a driveshaft break during the warmup and he failed to start the race . He then failed to qualify in south Africa and at Long Beach and was then dumped by the team . He did the odd F2 and F3000 races , but a serious accident while racing F3000 in Austria led him to found an F3000 team - FIRST - and work that side of the bargain . Ensign was the Mo Nunn marque that always seemed to be well - done despite restricted budgets and not standing in the correct line when luck was being handed out . The original Ensign was helped along with money from Ricky von Opel and later Teddy Yip . The N177 cars were wonderful machines that certainly deserved better . They are among the best looking cars from this era and in 1977 with Regazzoni in the works car and Patrick Tambay in the Yip car , they did very well indeed and one can only imagine what could have been should they had some serious sponsorship . However , these cars soldiered into the 1978 and 1979 seasons and struggled to qualify much less compete for placings although the potential was clearly there even when the \" wing - car \" revolution hit .","annotations":[{"text":"Marco Apicella","span":[92,105],"token_span":[17,18],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The object that undergoes change."},{"text":"the end of the season","span":[10597,10617],"token_span":[2048,2052],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the improvement occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"test"},{"instance_id":"EN-0960-122-frame-Ingest_substance","frame":"Ingest_substance","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"In this frame an Ingestor takes a Substance into his or her body.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_act","Event"],"frame_descendants":["Ingestion"],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"When John 's drinking gets out of hand , Siri Lill decides to move back with her parents .

In between world tours with Ultravox and appearances on Live Aid , multi-instrumentalist Midge Ure has somehow found time to write and record an excellent solo album entitled The Gift . We spoke to him at home in his studio where he explained how the album was put together . \" I originally talked about doing a solo album three years ago when I released my first solo single ( a version of the Walker Brothers ' hit No Regrets ) , but I never found the time . It was n't until November ' 84 that I began planning this album and then the Band Aid Christmas single took priority , so I shelved the idea . What had initially started out as a two to three month project eventually turned into a six month one because of my involvement with Band Aid - and that is much longer than I like to take over recording any album . \" The songwriting itself was staggered over a similar period since Midge had no reserve of reject Ultravox songs to fall back on . \" What most solo albums are usually comprised of , \" he explained \" are rejected songs from previous band albums . Ultravox only write the right amount of material for each album we 're working on and we tend to scrap things as we go along ; we do n't ever finish a track and then say it 's not good enough to make the album . \" And that for Midge , meant writing a whole new collection of songs for the project . With The Gift , Midge Ure manages to produce an altogether more convincing music than we 've come to expect from Ultravox of late . Listening to the album , it 's easy to recognise specific elements of the Ultravox group ' sound ' , in particular the famed tiers of synthesized string parts , but as Midge says , \" it 's very difficult to separate the two . What I hear on my solo album as being Ultravox - ish is me ! I ca n't change that fact . That 's how I sound . \" Judged simply as a statement of what he is personally capable of creating outside of the inevitable musical confines of a successful band structure , The Gift is certainly a fine achievement . Stylistically , the album covers a wide range of material from out - and - out instrumental music - the oriental flavoured ' Edo ' ( surely destined to accompany innumerable future TV documentaries on the Far East ) ; to an excellent cover version of a rock classic - Jethro Tull 's ' Living In The Past ' ; then to the powerful , yet sad , social commentary of ' Waste Lands ' . Mixed with these are several instantly memorable tracks ( ' She Cries ' is one ) that would undoubtedly make potential hit singles ( were they released ) , so I asked Midge who was responsible for the choice of the less than obvious first single release ' If I Was ' . \" I chose it \" came the reply . \" I just think it 's a good pop song . I do n't discriminate between pop or rock music , I just believe that a good song should always be well - crafted and , to my mind , that 's true of ' If I Was ' . There 's some better stuff on the album sure , but as an initial single it 's quite a good track . People do n't expect to hear me singing an out - and - out pop song I 'm sure and I felt it was a suitable thing to immediately establish the solo album as different from Ultravox . It was either that or releasing one of the instrumental tracks ... \" With the single nestling in the No.4 slot of the UK charts at the time of writing , it seems the British public firmly agree with his decision . Midge 's appreciation of a well - crafted song is the main reason for including on the album a cover version of ' Living In The Past ' - a Jethro Tull tune that first caught his attention at the ripe old age of fifteen . \" It was around the time when I was forming my first bands back in Scotland , and that song really stood out for me . Probably because it was one of the first ever songs by a bonafide rock band to successfully cross over to the singles market and become a hit . And it has stuck in my mind ever since . \" Midge 's version of the song departs radically from the original recording except for his vocal rendition which emulates the dry , up - front production style so characteristic of Tull 's original . The result , for me , is one of the best Ure vocal performances yet captured on record and , in an age when even the best vocalists are rarely heard without their voice first being processed through expensive ADT and reverb devices , to expose himself like that was a brave move indeed . It only goes to show how surprisingly good a vocalist he actually is . \" I went for a very intimate vocal sound on that track in particular \" he said . \" To achieve it , I had to sing quietly , close - up to the studio microphone which I do n't normally do . I usually stand well back and belt it out , especially when I 'm going for the high notes like on ' Vienna ' . \" The overall arrangement of the song is quite different to Jethro Tull's . The bass part , for example , is newly composed and played by Level 42's Mark King who really has helped add sparkle to the track . How , I asked , did Mark 's involvement in the project come about ? \" I happened to bump into him last year when Ultravox and Level 42 were appearing on the same TV show and whilst having a few drinks at the bar , I asked him whether he 'd kindly play on my solo album if I ever got around to doing something in the future . He accepted , I mainly think because he really enjoys playing different types of music , though people only know him for his slapping funk bass style . He actually played the bass on ' If I Was ' , which is probably the simplest bass line in the world - and you would n't expect Mark King to play anything like that - but it 's very effective on the record . \" A solo record is usually a chance for established recording artists to show their expertise ( or lack of it ) on instruments with which they are not generally associated . Fortunately , Midge was wise enough to recognise his own musical limitations and , instead , enlisted the help of those more able to translate his ideas of how a particular bass or drum part should sound , into a musical reality . A decision that has produced an altogether more enjoyable and certainly less indulgent collection of music . So , apart from Mark King and himself , which other musicians contributed to the recording ? \" They were mainly bass players and drummers . People like Mark Brzezicki of Big Country , who 'd impressed me on a recent Steve Harley session I did ; Nigel Ross -Scott , who plays bass with Reflex , and Lindsay Elliott , who used to drum for Cockney Rebel and who I 've known for some time . \" \" I handled the keyboards , guitars and vocals myself but I did make a conscious effort to get away from the sequenced bass lines that Ultravox are so well known for . I thought the best way of doing that was through the influence of other musicians . A solo album , for me , should always be a solo effort and that 's certainly true of The Gift because every idea on it originated in some way from me . But I see no point , for example , in bringing in a musician of Mark King 's calibre and forcing him to stick rigidly to the notes you 've already composed ! That would be a dreadful waste of his talent . \" \" With the drummers , for example , I already had guideline drums programmed into a Drumtraks purely to give the players an indication of where the build - ups and fills would occur in each song . But they were then totally free to expand on that guide , which they did , and the end result was always more interesting having the benefit of the human touch . \" \" Every song used a pre-recorded click - track to drive sequencers but I did n't want to use only machinery because you can tell it 's just a machine . It would have been too easy to use programmed drums . Half the challenge of making the album was working with the other people . And that was the most exciting part as well . \" The Gift features three instrumental tracks : ' Edo ' , ' Chieftains ' and ' Antibes ' - which was recorded on the Caribbean island of Montserrat using a Casio CZ- 101 ! Hardly what you 'd expect from a musician whose public profile is so closely allied to the role of frontman / vocalist . What comes as even more of a shock to the system is Midge 's revelation that his initial intention was to produce an album that contained five songs and five instrumentals ! Somewhere along the line , however , matters were diluted somewhat but he decided to retain three of the instrumentals , even though he was well aware that \" more often than not , when you get a couple of instrumentals on an album , it means the guy 's run out of ideas ! \" . The reason for their inclusion ? Simple : \" I like instrumental music . I find it very easy to listen to and it allows you to use your imagination in a way that most pop music does n't . It 's refreshing . \" Part of the power and appeal of instrumental music undoubtedly lies in its ability to conjure up images in the mind . Yet it functions superbly too as a reinforcement to the visual image . This is never more prevalent than in the hypnotic television advertising and jingle markets where a good music track is recognised as being a vital element of a successful commercial . \" MIDI I find baffling ... I really do . \" Prime examples of this approach have been the stylish Levi jean commercials that exploded across our television and cinema screens a few years back . Anyone remember the first ' Rivets ' advert featuring an Ultravox - style synthesized soundtrack and filmed explosions in a sun-drenched quarry ? Well , the man responsible for the music was Midge Ure , though that first foray into the advertising business was n't a particularly enjoyable one as he explained . \" I do n't know if I 'd ever do it again . Working with advertising agencies is the pits ... just awful ! You 're usually dealing with half a dozen people who all agree with each other , none of whom have a clue what they 're talking about , musically . Nevertheless , I rattled off the music quickly and was really pleased with it . I think it went very well with the visuals because I was given the finished visuals to write the music to , which is a rare occurrence , so I 'm told . Normally , you 're only given a written outline of what the finished visuals may be like and have to create something to complement them . \" Creatively -speaking , Midge Ure never appears to be stuck for an idea , whether it be for a song or one of the many Ultravox promotional videos he has produced . But what , I asked him , shapes a song 's development ? \" Well , there are a million ways to come up with song ideas . They may be sparked off by a particular riff or chord sequence or simply a mood . But once I 've got a basic idea or a feel for a song , then that starts to dictate how the lyrics are going to follow . I might , for example , have a seed of an idea in the back of my mind but no clue how to go about recording it . So , I begin crafting the music in the studio , working layer by layer until eventually , the lyrics start to form where the verses and chorus will appear . It all becomes apparent as you 're doing it usually - a bit like painting by numbers . \" As the lucky owner of a fully - equipped studio in his back garden , I wondered whether the Ure songwriting method was helped at all by the nature of multi track recording ? \" Very much so . Using my own 24 - track studio as a writing tool is great . I still use a Yamaha keyboard with a built - in drum machine , which I keep at home in my kitchen , purely for coming up with basic song ideas , but nothing ever takes shape until I actually start working in the studio . \" \" I begin by putting down a SMPTE timecode on one track , and recording a very basic snare and bass drum part on tape as a guide . Then with everything I put down after that , I 'm always looking to get a high quality sound on tape as it will potentially be something I keep . \" \" I tend to do a lot of track bouncing - even though there are 24 tracks available - to build up a sound . I may record four or five instruments all playing the same phrase but in various octaves , then do a stereo bounce of the lot , simply to get closer to what I hear in my head . I used to do that a lot on string machine parts with Ultravox but on The Gift I used mainly sampled string sounds from the Emulator 2 . Working that way , you force yourself to make decisions halfway through the recording process of how things will sound in the mix and bounce tracks when required . It 's very good training having your own studio . \" Good training it can be , but it can easily create a whole new set of problems for the musician if not careful . \" Initially , when my studio was built , like everybody else , I thought I 'd do everything in it myself . But you get too involved . Everybody I 've talked to who has a home studio tried at the start to do it all themselves but ended up getting too involved in the technical side of things . Then their playing side goes all to pot ! That 's why I have an engineer come in and help me when I wish to do some real recording . \" Concentrating on the musical aspects of the recording seems to have paid dividends for Midge and listening to the album ( recorded in his Chiswick studio and mixed at Air Studios in Montserrat ) , there 's nothing amiss in the audio quality department either . Taking , as an example , the oriental - sounding instrumental track ' Edo ' from his album , Midge set about explaining just how it was pieced together in the studio . \" It started off as two romantic melodies - the very ' breathy ' sounding one and the one played on a koto in the middle section . At the end of the song the two melodies cross over perfectly and I was very pleased with that effect . But it did n't start to sound Japanese until I started to use a koto on it ( laughs ) ! Although I love the koto sounds you get on a Yamaha DX7 , for instance , I wanted to use a real koto , so you 'd hear the fingers scraping across the strings . If you listen to ' Edo ' on headphones , the track really opens up when the koto comes in because of the ambient way it was miked up . Once it started to sound Japanese , I just followed through the imagery and used Japanese flutes and various instruments which I sampled from a collection of compact discs I had of Japanese tunes . \" Sampled sounds are used tastefully and to great effect on many tracks from The Gift . So what did Midge think of the technique ? \" I find sampling great fun but it 's got a jokey image through people over-using the classic ' Orch 4 ' Fairlight preset which we 've all heard a million times before . I like the idea of sampling odd items like pots and pans to form rhythm tracks . In fact , we recorded my metal garage door being banged and sampled that on the Emulator 2 , then wrote a pattern into the drum machine and used that to trigger the Emulator . It produced this odd Burundi-like rhythm which I used as the basis of another instrumental on the album called ' Chieftain ' . I also sampled the anvil sound on ' The Gift ' using a Powertran MCS - 1 as my Emulator 2 was away having its software updated . \" Something else Midge found himself doing whilst recording the album , was sampling the guitar . \" I 'd record a guitar solo played through a Rockman and break it down into one - or two - note pieces , mainly string bending noises or really fast vibratos . Then I 'd sample those bits I wanted and play them back at half speed from the Emulator keyboard , totally out of context . Then I 'd start constructing the solo again but by playing it from the keyboard , in stereo , using those samples . \" If you 're intrigued to hear this technique in action , take a listen to the guitar solo on the track called ' When The Wind Blows ' from The Gift . It 's quite an arresting sound . As a recording artist , one benefit of owning your own studio is undoubtedly the freedom it brings you to experiment with equipment . And one criticism levelled at people , like Midge Ure , who utilise the latest technological instruments on their albums , is that they often lack imagination when it comes to using such devices to anywhere near their full creative potential . The studio , Midge reckons , certainly helps him overcome that problem : \" It took me over a year to get into the PPG , for example . I really started to hate the thing and it was so complex to use , as ordinarily , you never have the time in someone else 's studio to learn how to use it . But having one around my studio and having time to actually use one , everything just suddenly clicked into place and I began enjoying it and appreciating the sounds it made . \" \" The DX7 , on the other hand , I still think is impossible to programme ! I ca n't be bothered with it . It 's capable of producing some great sounds I admit , but Casio have now come up with some synthesizer that 's just as good I feel - and a lot easier to work . I 'm a great advocate of user-friendly instruments you know ! \" Continuing on the theme of instrumentation , Midge had this strong viewpoint to express : \" Just because there 's a wealth of keyboards , drum machines and samplers on the market does n't automatically mean your guitarist sitting in his bedsit has got to go out , sell his guitar and buy the stuff . He does n't have to use it . It 's there if he wants to use it . \" \" It 's like MIDI . He does n't have to get sucked into it or feel he has to understand it if he does n't want to . MIDI , I find baffling ... I really do . \" ( Well there 's honesty for you ! ) \" It 's too in - depth for me . If it had been around when I bought my first synthesizer then I would have grown up with it . But to start to understand all the aspects and parameters of MIDI now is beyond me . My head is full of musical notes and arrangements , and I should n't have to be worrying whether or not there 's a ten millisecond delay on such and such a MIDI channel . \" Midge Ure may not like being drawn into the technical side of MIDI but , like everyone who relies so heavily on the application of hi-tech instruments in their music , he must come to terms with it . Just as he has had to learn about timecodes and click - tracks in order to run his studio . \" Using drum machine and sequencer codes is an absolute nightmare at times but I find myself unable to avoid getting caught up in that side of things . Even so , it 's still less baffling to me than MIDI ! \" \" Timecodes are a fundamental necessity for synchronisation purposes . Without them , you run in to all kinds of problems . For example , one of the album tracks we recorded without laying down a timecode first , so we could n't sync up the Emulator 's sequencer to play a sampled cello part that I wanted to put on the track . And I could n't physically play the cello part using the Emulator 2 because I 'm not a good enough keyboard player . So we ended up scrapping the whole track and starting again . \" Whatever the problems encountered during the making of the album , The Gift conclusively proves that Midge Ure is a fine songwriter who is not afraid to use whatever tools he has available to realise his ideas . And that is something he can be proud of .

A solo album , for me , should always be a solo effort and that 's certainly true of The Gift because every idea on it originated in some way from me . But I see no point , for example , in bringing in a musician of Mark King 's calibre and forcing him to stick rigidly to the notes you 've already composed ! That would be a dreadful waste of his talent . \" \" With the drummers , for example , I already had guideline drums programmed into a Drumtraks purely to give the players an indication of where the build - ups and fills would occur in each song . But they were then totally free to expand on that guide , which they did , and the end result was always more interesting having the benefit of the human touch . \" \" Every song used a pre-recorded click - track to drive sequencers but I did n't want to use only machinery because you can tell it 's just a machine . It would have been too easy to use programmed drums . Half the challenge of making the album was working with the other people . And that was the most exciting part as well . \" The Gift features three instrumental tracks : ' Edo ' , ' Chieftains ' and ' Antibes ' - which was recorded on the Caribbean island of Montserrat using a Casio CZ- 101 ! Hardly what you 'd expect from a musician whose public profile is so closely allied to the role of frontman / vocalist . What comes as even more of a shock to the system is Midge 's revelation that his initial intention was to produce an album that contained five songs and five instrumentals ! Somewhere along the line , however , matters were diluted somewhat but he decided to retain three of the instrumentals , even though he was well aware that \" more often than not , when you get a couple of instrumentals on an album , it means the guy 's run out of ideas ! \" . The reason for their inclusion ? Simple : \" I like instrumental music . I find it very easy to listen to and it allows you to use your imagination in a way that most pop music does n't . It 's refreshing . \" Part of the power and appeal of instrumental music undoubtedly lies in its ability to conjure up images in the mind . Yet it functions superbly too as a reinforcement to the visual image . This is never more prevalent than in the hypnotic television advertising and jingle markets where a good music track is recognised as being a vital element of a successful commercial . \" MIDI I find baffling ... I really do . \" Prime examples of this approach have been the stylish Levi jean commercials that exploded across our television and cinema screens a few years back . Anyone remember the first ' Rivets ' advert featuring an Ultravox - style synthesized soundtrack and filmed explosions in a sun-drenched quarry ? Well , the man responsible for the music was Midge Ure , though that first foray into the advertising business was n't a particularly enjoyable one as he explained . \" I do n't know if I 'd ever do it again . Working with advertising agencies is the pits ... just awful ! You 're usually dealing with half a dozen people who all agree with each other , none of whom have a clue what they 're talking about , musically . Nevertheless , I rattled off the music quickly and was really pleased with it . I think it went very well with the visuals because I was given the finished visuals to write the music to , which is a rare occurrence , so I 'm told . Normally , you 're only given a written outline of what the finished visuals may be like and have to create something to complement them . \" Creatively -speaking , Midge Ure never appears to be stuck for an idea , whether it be for a song or one of the many Ultravox promotional videos he has produced . But what , I asked him , shapes a song 's development ? \" Well , there are a million ways to come up with song ideas . They may be sparked off by a particular riff or chord sequence or simply a mood . But once I 've got a basic idea or a feel for a song , then that starts to dictate how the lyrics are going to follow . I might , for example , have a seed of an idea in the back of my mind but no clue how to go about recording it . So , I begin crafting the music in the studio , working layer by layer until eventually , the lyrics start to form where the verses and chorus will appear . It all becomes apparent as you 're doing it usually - a bit like painting by numbers . \" As the lucky owner of a fully - equipped studio in his back garden , I wondered whether the Ure songwriting method was helped at all by the nature of multi track recording ? \" Very much so . Using my own 24 - track studio as a writing tool is great . I still use a Yamaha keyboard with a built - in drum machine , which I keep at home in my kitchen , purely for coming up with basic song ideas , but nothing ever takes shape until I actually start working in the studio . \" \" I begin by putting down a SMPTE timecode on one track , and recording a very basic snare and bass drum part on tape as a guide . Then with everything I put down after that , I 'm always looking to get a high quality sound on tape as it will potentially be something I keep . \" \" I tend to do a lot of track bouncing - even though there are 24 tracks available - to build up a sound . I may record four or five instruments all playing the same phrase but in various octaves , then do a stereo bounce of the lot , simply to get closer to what I hear in my head . I used to do that a lot on string machine parts with Ultravox but on The Gift I used mainly sampled string sounds from the Emulator 2 . Working that way , you force yourself to make decisions halfway through the recording process of how things will sound in the mix and bounce tracks when required . It 's very good training having your own studio . \" Good training it can be , but it can easily create a whole new set of problems for the musician if not careful . \" Initially , when my studio was built , like everybody else , I thought I 'd do everything in it myself . But you get too involved . Everybody I 've talked to who has a home studio tried at the start to do it all themselves but ended up getting too involved in the technical side of things . Then their playing side goes all to pot ! That 's why I have an engineer come in and help me when I wish to do some real recording . \" Concentrating on the musical aspects of the recording seems to have paid dividends for Midge and listening to the album ( recorded in his Chiswick studio and mixed at Air Studios in Montserrat ) , there 's nothing amiss in the audio quality department either . Taking , as an example , the oriental - sounding instrumental track ' Edo ' from his album , Midge set about explaining just how it was pieced together in the studio . \" It started off as two romantic melodies - the very ' breathy ' sounding one and the one played on a koto in the middle section . At the end of the song the two melodies cross over perfectly and I was very pleased with that effect . But it did n't start to sound Japanese until I started to use a koto on it ( laughs ) ! Although I love the koto sounds you get on a Yamaha DX7 , for instance , I wanted to use a real koto , so you 'd hear the fingers scraping across the strings . If you listen to ' Edo ' on headphones , the track really opens up when the koto comes in because of the ambient way it was miked up . Once it started to sound Japanese , I just followed through the imagery and used Japanese flutes and various instruments which I sampled from a collection of compact discs I had of Japanese tunes . \" Sampled sounds are used tastefully and to great effect on many tracks from The Gift . So what did Midge think of the technique ? \" I find sampling great fun but it 's got a jokey image through people over-using the classic ' Orch 4 ' Fairlight preset which we 've all heard a million times before . I like the idea of sampling odd items like pots and pans to form rhythm tracks . In fact , we recorded my metal garage door being banged and sampled that on the Emulator 2 , then wrote a pattern into the drum machine and used that to trigger the Emulator . It produced this odd Burundi-like rhythm which I used as the basis of another instrumental on the album called ' Chieftain ' . I also sampled the anvil sound on ' The Gift ' using a Powertran MCS - 1 as my Emulator 2 was away having its software updated . \" Something else Midge found himself doing whilst recording the album , was sampling the guitar . \" I 'd record a guitar solo played through a Rockman and break it down into one - or two - note pieces , mainly string bending noises or really fast vibratos . Then I 'd sample those bits I wanted and play them back at half speed from the Emulator keyboard , totally out of context . Then I 'd start constructing the solo again but by playing it from the keyboard , in stereo , using those samples . \" If you 're intrigued to hear this technique in action , take a listen to the guitar solo on the track called ' When The Wind Blows ' from The Gift . It 's quite an arresting sound . As a recording artist , one benefit of owning your own studio is undoubtedly the freedom it brings you to experiment with equipment . And one criticism levelled at people , like Midge Ure , who utilise the latest technological instruments on their albums , is that they often lack imagination when it comes to using such devices to anywhere near their full creative potential . The studio , Midge reckons , certainly helps him overcome that problem : \" It took me over a year to get into the PPG , for example . I really started to hate the thing and it was so complex to use , as ordinarily , you never have the time in someone else 's studio to learn how to use it . But having one around my studio and having time to actually use one , everything just suddenly clicked into place and I began enjoying it and appreciating the sounds it made . \" \" The DX7 , on the other hand , I still think is impossible to programme ! I ca n't be bothered with it . It 's capable of producing some great sounds I admit , but Casio have now come up with some synthesizer that 's just as good I feel - and a lot easier to work . I 'm a great advocate of user-friendly instruments you know ! \" Continuing on the theme of instrumentation , Midge had this strong viewpoint to express : \" Just because there 's a wealth of keyboards , drum machines and samplers on the market does n't automatically mean your guitarist sitting in his bedsit has got to go out , sell his guitar and buy the stuff . He does n't have to use it . It 's there if he wants to use it . \" \" It 's like MIDI . He does n't have to get sucked into it or feel he has to understand it if he does n't want to . MIDI , I find baffling ... I really do . \" ( Well there 's honesty for you ! ) \" It 's too in - depth for me . If it had been around when I bought my first synthesizer then I would have grown up with it . But to start to understand all the aspects and parameters of MIDI now is beyond me . My head is full of musical notes and arrangements , and I should n't have to be worrying whether or not there 's a ten millisecond delay on such and such a MIDI channel . \" Midge Ure may not like being drawn into the technical side of MIDI but , like everyone who relies so heavily on the application of hi-tech instruments in their music , he must come to terms with it . Just as he has had to learn about timecodes and click - tracks in order to run his studio . \" Using drum machine and sequencer codes is an absolute nightmare at times but I find myself unable to avoid getting caught up in that side of things . Even so , it 's still less baffling to me than MIDI ! \" \" Timecodes are a fundamental necessity for synchronisation purposes . Without them , you run in to all kinds of problems . For example , one of the album tracks we recorded without laying down a timecode first , so we could n't sync up the Emulator 's sequencer to play a sampled cello part that I wanted to put on the track . And I could n't physically play the cello part using the Emulator 2 because I 'm not a good enough keyboard player . So we ended up scrapping the whole track and starting again . \" Whatever the problems encountered during the making of the album , The Gift conclusively proves that Midge Ure is a fine songwriter who is not afraid to use whatever tools he has available to realise his ideas . And that is something he can be proud of .

GCHQ first became aware in late 2015 of suspicious \u201c interactions \u201d between figures connected to Trump and known or suspected Russian agents , a source close to UK intelligence said . This intelligence was passed to the US as part of a routine exchange of information , they added . Over the next six months , until summer 2016 , a number of western agencies shared further information on contacts between Trump 's inner circle and Russians , sources said . The European countries that passed on electronic intelligence \u2013 known as sigint \u2013 included Germany , Estonia and Poland . Australia , a member of the \u201c Five Eyes \u201d spying alliance that also includes the US , UK , Canada and New Zealand , also relayed material , one source said . Another source suggested the Dutch and the French spy agency , the General Directorate for External Security or DGSE , were contributors . It is understood that GCHQ was at no point carrying out a targeted operation against Trump or his team or proactively seeking information . The alleged conversations were picked up by chance as part of routine surveillance of Russian intelligence assets . Over several months , different agencies targeting the same people began to see a pattern of connections that were flagged to intelligence officials in the US . The issue of GCHQ 's role in the FBI 's ongoing investigation into possible cooperation between the Trump campaign and Moscow is highly sensitive . In March Trump tweeted that Barack Obama had illegally \u201c wiretapped \u201d him in Trump Tower . The White House press secretary , Sean Spicer , claimed the \u201c British spying agency \u201d GCHQ had carried out the bugging . Spicer cited an unsubstantiated report on Fox News . Fox later distanced itself from the report . The claims prompted an extremely unusual rebuke from GCHQ , which generally refrains from commenting on all intelligence matters . The agency described the allegations first made by a former judge turned media commentator , Andrew Napolitano , as \u201c nonsense \u201d . \u201c They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored , \u201d a spokesperson for GCHQ said . Instead both US and UK intelligence sources acknowledge that GCHQ played an early , prominent role in kickstarting the FBI 's Trump - Russia investigation , which began in late July 2016 . One source called the British eavesdropping agency the \u201c principal whistleblower \u201d . The Guardian has been told the FBI and the CIA were slow to appreciate the extensive nature of contacts between Trump 's team and Moscow ahead of the US election . This was in part due to US law that prohibits US agencies from examining the private communications of American citizens without warrants . \u201c They are trained not to do this , \u201d the source stressed . \u201c It looks like the [ US ] agencies were asleep , \u201d the source added . \u201c They [ the European agencies ] were saying : ' There are contacts going on between people close to Mr Trump and people we believe are Russian intelligence agents . You should be wary of this . ' \u201c The message was : ' Watch out . There 's something not right here . ' \u201d According to one account , GCHQ 's then head , Robert Hannigan , passed material in summer 2016 to the CIA chief , John Brennan . The matter was deemed so sensitive it was handled at \u201c director level \u201d . After an initially slow start , Brennan used GCHQ information and intelligence from other partners to launch a major inter-agency investigation . In late August and September Brennan gave a series of classified briefings to the Gang of Eight , the top-ranking Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and Senate . He told them the agency had evidence the Kremlin might be trying to help Trump to win the presidency , the New York Times reported . One person familiar with the matter said Brennan did not reveal sources but made reference to the fact that America 's intelligence allies had provided information . Trump subsequently learned of GCHQ 's role , the person said . The person described US intelligence as being \u201c very late to the game \u201d . The FBI 's director , James Comey , altered his position after the election and Trump 's victory , becoming \u201c more affirmative \u201d and with a \u201c higher level of concern \u201d . Comey 's apparent shift may have followed a mid-October decision by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( Fisa ) court to approve a secret surveillance order . The order gave permission for the Department of Justice to investigate two banks suspected of being part of the Kremlin 's undercover influence operation . According to the BBC , the justice department 's request came after a tipoff from an intelligence agency in one of the Baltic states . This is believed to be Estonia . The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the same order covered Carter Page , one of Trump 's associates . It allowed the FBI and the justice department to monitor Page 's communications . Page , a former foreign policy aide , was suspected of being an agent of influence working for Russia , the paper said , citing US officials . The application covered contacts Page allegedly had in 2013 with a Russian foreign intelligence agent , and other undisclosed meetings with Russian operatives , the Post said . Page denies wrongdoing and complained of \u201c unjustified , politically motivated government surveillance \u201d . Late last year Comey threw more FBI resources into what became a far-reaching counter - intelligence investigation . In March he confirmed before the House intelligence committee that the agency was examining possible cooperation between Moscow and members of the Trump campaign to sway the US election . Comey and the NSA director , Admiral Michael Rogers , said there was no basis for the president 's claim that he was a victim of Obama \u201c wiretapping \u201d . Trump had likened the unproved allegation to \u201c McCarthyism \u201d . Britain 's MI6 spy agency played a part in intelligence sharing with the US , one source said . MI6 declined to comment . Its former chief Sir Richard Dearlove described Trump 's wiretapping claim on Thursday as \u201c simply deeply embarrassing for Trump and the administration \u201d . \u201c The only possible explanation is that Trump started tweeting without understanding how the NSA - GCHQ relationship actually works , \u201d Dearlove told Prospect magazine . A GCHQ spokesperson said : \u201c It is longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters \u201d . It is unclear which individuals were picked up by British surveillance . In a report last month the New York Times , citing three US intelligence officials , said warning signs had been building throughout last summer but were far from clear . As WikiLeaks published emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee , US agencies began picking up conversations in which Russians were discussing contacts with Trump associates , the paper said . European allies were supplying information about people close to Trump meeting with Russians in Britain , the Netherlands and in other countries , the Times said . There are now multiple investigations going on in Washington into Trump campaign officials and Russia . They include the FBI - led counter - espionage investigation and probes by both the House and Senate intelligence committees . Adam Schiff , the senior Democrat on the House committee , has expressed an interest in hearing from Christopher Steele , the former MI6 officer whose dossier accuses the president of long - term cooperation with Vladimir Putin 's Moscow . Trump and Putin have both dismissed the dossier as fake . One source suggested the official investigation was making progress . \u201c They now have specific concrete and corroborative evidence of collusion , \u201d the source said . \u201c This is between people in the Trump campaign and agents of [ Russian ] influence relating to the use of hacked material . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"GCHQ","span":[219,222],"token_span":[35,35],"role":"Interceptor","label":"Interceptor","role_definition":"The volitional agent who without authorization of sender or recipient takes control of a Theme that is en route to a destination."},{"text":"in late 2015","span":[243,254],"token_span":[39,41],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time period during which the Interceptor takes control of the Theme."},{"text":"suspicious \u201c interactions \u201d between figures connected to Trump and known or suspected Russian agents","span":[259,358],"token_span":[43,57],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The entity, physical or abstract, construed as traveling from a sender to a goal location, which is taken hold of by the Interceptor without permission."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"On April 12 , 2017 , The Guardian reported that GCHQ and other European intelligence agencies had intercepted communications between members of the Trump campaign team and Russian officials and shared the intelligence with their U.S. counterparts .","annotations":[{"text":"GCHQ","span":[48,51],"token_span":[10,10],"role":"Interceptor","label":"Interceptor","role_definition":"The volitional agent who without authorization of sender or recipient takes control of a Theme that is en route to a destination."},{"text":"other European intelligence agencies","span":[57,92],"token_span":[12,15],"role":"Interceptor","label":"Interceptor","role_definition":"The volitional agent who without authorization of sender or recipient takes control of a Theme that is en route to a destination."},{"text":"communications between members of the Trump campaign team and Russian officials","span":[110,188],"token_span":[18,28],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The entity, physical or abstract, construed as traveling from a sender to a goal location, which is taken hold of by the Interceptor without permission."}],"trigger":{"text":"intercepted","start_char":98,"end_char":108,"start_token":17,"end_token":17,"frame":"Intercepting"}},"source":{"text":"Britain 's spy agencies played a crucial role in alerting their counterparts in Washington to contacts between members of Donald Trump 's campaign team and Russian intelligence operatives , the Guardian has been told .

The agency described the allegations first made by a former judge turned media commentator , Andrew Napolitano , as \u201c nonsense \u201d . \u201c They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored , \u201d a spokesperson for GCHQ said . Instead both US and UK intelligence sources acknowledge that GCHQ played an early , prominent role in kickstarting the FBI 's Trump - Russia investigation , which began in late July 2016 . One source called the British eavesdropping agency the \u201c principal whistleblower \u201d . The Guardian has been told the FBI and the CIA were slow to appreciate the extensive nature of contacts between Trump 's team and Moscow ahead of the US election . This was in part due to US law that prohibits US agencies from examining the private communications of American citizens without warrants . \u201c They are trained not to do this , \u201d the source stressed . \u201c It looks like the [ US ] agencies were asleep , \u201d the source added . \u201c They [ the European agencies ] were saying : ' There are contacts going on between people close to Mr Trump and people we believe are Russian intelligence agents . You should be wary of this . ' \u201c The message was : ' Watch out . There 's something not right here . ' \u201d According to one account , GCHQ 's then head , Robert Hannigan , passed material in summer 2016 to the CIA chief , John Brennan . The matter was deemed so sensitive it was handled at \u201c director level \u201d . After an initially slow start , Brennan used GCHQ information and intelligence from other partners to launch a major inter-agency investigation . In late August and September Brennan gave a series of classified briefings to the Gang of Eight , the top-ranking Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and Senate . He told them the agency had evidence the Kremlin might be trying to help Trump to win the presidency , the New York Times reported . One person familiar with the matter said Brennan did not reveal sources but made reference to the fact that America 's intelligence allies had provided information . Trump subsequently learned of GCHQ 's role , the person said . The person described US intelligence as being \u201c very late to the game \u201d . The FBI 's director , James Comey , altered his position after the election and Trump 's victory , becoming \u201c more affirmative \u201d and with a \u201c higher level of concern \u201d . Comey 's apparent shift may have followed a mid-October decision by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( Fisa ) court to approve a secret surveillance order . The order gave permission for the Department of Justice to investigate two banks suspected of being part of the Kremlin 's undercover influence operation . According to the BBC , the justice department 's request came after a tipoff from an intelligence agency in one of the Baltic states . This is believed to be Estonia . The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the same order covered Carter Page , one of Trump 's associates . It allowed the FBI and the justice department to monitor Page 's communications . Page , a former foreign policy aide , was suspected of being an agent of influence working for Russia , the paper said , citing US officials . The application covered contacts Page allegedly had in 2013 with a Russian foreign intelligence agent , and other undisclosed meetings with Russian operatives , the Post said . Page denies wrongdoing and complained of \u201c unjustified , politically motivated government surveillance \u201d . Late last year Comey threw more FBI resources into what became a far-reaching counter - intelligence investigation . In March he confirmed before the House intelligence committee that the agency was examining possible cooperation between Moscow and members of the Trump campaign to sway the US election . Comey and the NSA director , Admiral Michael Rogers , said there was no basis for the president 's claim that he was a victim of Obama \u201c wiretapping \u201d . Trump had likened the unproved allegation to \u201c McCarthyism \u201d . Britain 's MI6 spy agency played a part in intelligence sharing with the US , one source said . MI6 declined to comment . Its former chief Sir Richard Dearlove described Trump 's wiretapping claim on Thursday as \u201c simply deeply embarrassing for Trump and the administration \u201d . \u201c The only possible explanation is that Trump started tweeting without understanding how the NSA - GCHQ relationship actually works , \u201d Dearlove told Prospect magazine . A GCHQ spokesperson said : \u201c It is longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters \u201d . It is unclear which individuals were picked up by British surveillance . In a report last month the New York Times , citing three US intelligence officials , said warning signs had been building throughout last summer but were far from clear . As WikiLeaks published emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee , US agencies began picking up conversations in which Russians were discussing contacts with Trump associates , the paper said . European allies were supplying information about people close to Trump meeting with Russians in Britain , the Netherlands and in other countries , the Times said . There are now multiple investigations going on in Washington into Trump campaign officials and Russia . They include the FBI - led counter - espionage investigation and probes by both the House and Senate intelligence committees . Adam Schiff , the senior Democrat on the House committee , has expressed an interest in hearing from Christopher Steele , the former MI6 officer whose dossier accuses the president of long - term cooperation with Vladimir Putin 's Moscow . Trump and Putin have both dismissed the dossier as fake . One source suggested the official investigation was making progress . \u201c They now have specific concrete and corroborative evidence of collusion , \u201d the source said . \u201c This is between people in the Trump campaign and agents of [ Russian ] influence relating to the use of hacked material . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"GCHQ","span":[219,222],"token_span":[35,35],"role":"Interceptor","label":"Interceptor","role_definition":"The volitional agent who without authorization of sender or recipient takes control of a Theme that is en route to a destination."},{"text":"suspicious \u201c interactions \u201d between figures connected to Trump and known or suspected Russian agents","span":[259,358],"token_span":[43,57],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The entity, physical or abstract, construed as traveling from a sender to a goal location, which is taken hold of by the Interceptor without permission."},{"text":"late 2015","span":[246,254],"token_span":[40,41],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time period during which the Interceptor takes control of the Theme."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"test"},{"instance_id":"EN-4469-592-frame-Interrupt_process","frame":"Interrupt_process","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Cause (or associated Actor) causes an ongoing Process to temporarily stop.","frame_ancestors":["Transitive_action","Objective_influence","Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"The BBC paid \u00a3 7 million ( $ 10.1 million ) as co-production partner , the most it had ever paid for a bought - in program , and screened it on BBC Two .

In 1968 at the height of the movement against him , young protesters in Karachi and Lahore began describing him as a dog ( Ayub Khan Kutta ! ) . This was a time when politicians and rulers in Pakistan hardly ever used any derogatory language against their opponents , so Ayub was supposedly shocked when he heard that some of his ' children ' ( the term he used to describe his subjects ) , had called him a dog . Ayub had come to power in 1958 on the back of a popular military coup ( Pakistan 's first ) , and had enjoyed a significant run of admiration from a majority of Pakistanis in the first four years of his dictatorship . Vowing to make Pakistan a powerful and influential military - industrial state , Ayub encouraged and facilitated an unprecedented growth in the process of industrialisation in the country . He also initiated the introduction of technical innovations in agriculture and brought Pakistan closer to the United States , thus benefitting from the military and financial aid that came with the enhanced relationship . By 1961 the Ayub regime had largely restored the country 's economy that had begun to weaken from the mid-1950s onwards , mainly due to the political chaos that prevailed in the country , as various factions of Pakistan 's first ruling party , the Muslim League , indulged in constant infighting and intrigues , and were unable to address the growing disenchantment and cynicism exhibited towards politicians by those who were kept out from the political process dominated by the country 's political - bureaucratic elite . Ayub was at the height of his power and popularity when he decided to lift Martial Law in 1962 and restore at least a semblance of political activity by the parties that had been banned in 1958 . He became the president and handpicked an assembly through a complex electoral system that he called ' Basic Democracy ' . After discarding the 1956 Constitution , his assembly passed a brand new constitution that enshrined Ayub 's idea of ' Jinnah 's Pakistan ' . It revolved around the construction of a strong military - industrial state , propped - up by state - backed capitalism , free enterprise , agricultural reforms and a ' progressive interpretation of Islam that was compatible with science , technology and modernity . ' Ayub detested politicians , from both the left as well as the right . His regime came down hard on left - wing parties and then went on to also ban parties such as the Jamat - i-Islami ( JI ) \u2014 though the ban was overturned by the courts . Leftists accused him of encouraging crony capitalism , the exploitation of workers and the suppression of the rights and ethnic-nationalism of the Bengalis ( in East Pakistan ) , Sindhis , the Baloch and the Pakhtun , and of dislodging the Urdu-speaking ( the Mohajirs ) from important state and government institutions that they had helped build after Pakistan 's creation in 1947 . | Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in a crowd of his supporters | The religious right denounced him of being overtly secular and undermining ' Pakistan 's Islamic culture and traditions ' . Ayub easily glided through the many periodical protests that took place against him after 1962 and then won a second term as president in a controversial presidential race in 1965 . Buoyed by his victory and his status as a ' benevolent dictator ' , Ayub then made an uncharacteristic mistake by allowing himself to be convinced by the hawks in his cabinet ( led by his young foreign minister , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto ) , to crown his economic and political achievements with a military triumph against India . India had suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Chinese army in 1964 and Bhutto and his supporters in the cabinet were convinced that the Pakistan army would be able to crush the weakened Indian armed forces . Though the Pakistani armed forces made rapid gains in the initial period of the 1965 war , the conflict soon turned into a stalemate . Ayub settled for a ceasefire , apparently sending Bhutto into a rage . Ayub eased out Bhutto from the government but the damage was done . The war had drained the country 's resources and the economy began to slide . Ayub 's opponents accused him of ' losing the war on the negotiation table ' . Bhutto went on to form the PPP , and along with the already established left-wing groups , such as the National Awami Party ( NAP ) and the National Students Federation ( NSF ) , he became the most prominent face of left - wing opposition in West Pakistan . In East Pakistan , Shiekh Mujeebur Rehman 's Awami League ( AL ) , upped the ante against the regime and accused it of leaving East Pakistan open to an Indian attack during the 1965 war . As the Bengali nationalist movement led by AL and by various militant / Maoist Bengali nationalist groups in East Pakistan gathered pace , in West Pakistan , Ayub was suddenly faced by a spontaneous students ' movement when in October 1968 , a large contingent from the NSF gate - crashed a ceremony being held by the government at Lahore 's Fortress Stadium ( to celebrate the government 's ' Decade of Progress ' ) . The students began to chant anti-Ayub slogans and clashed with the police . They accused the regime of enriching a handful of cronies and letting everyone else suffer unemployment and economic hardship . Then in November 1968 , police opened fire on a left - wing student rally in Rawalpindi , killing three protesters . In response , students formed a Students Action Committee and announced that students across Pakistan would begin a concentrated protest movement against the regime . As the students began their campaign ( with most of the student groups demanding a socialist system and parliamentary democracy ) , Bhutto 's PPP joined the fray along with NAP and their entry brought with it the participation in the movement of the radical trade and labour unions that were associated with these parties . By late 1968 the movement had spread beyond Karachi , Lahore , Rawalpindi and Peshawar and reached the smaller cities and towns of Punjab and Sindh . Meanwhile in East Pakistan , AL and other Bengali nationalist groups began to demand complete provincial autonomy for East Pakistan . Schools , colleges and universities stopped functioning ; workers went on strike and closed down a number of factories , and white - collar professionals refused to attend office , further crippling an already deteriorating political and economic order . After failing to quell the protests ( through police action and wide - scale arrests ) , Ayub invited opposition parties to hold a dialogue with the government . But the PPP and NAP boycotted the negotiations that were largely attended by religious parties and some moderate right - wing parties . However , Mujeeb 's AL did participate , but the talks ultimately broke down . By early 1969 the movement had also been joined by peasant committees and organisations in the country 's rural areas . In March 1969 a group of senior military men advised Ayub to step down , fearing the eruption of a full - scale civil war in East Pakistan and political and social anarchy in the country 's west wing . A weakened and tired Ayub finally decided to throw - in the towel and resigned , handing over power to General Yahya Khan who immediately imposed the country 's second martial law . He promised to hold the country 's first general election based on adult franchise and to relinquish power after introducing parliamentary democracy in Pakistan . With this announcement , the movement came to a halt . Elections were held in 1970 . In East Pakistan the AL won 98 per cent of the allotted national and provincial assembly seats , whereas in West Pakistan , the PPP swept the polls in the region 's two largest provinces , Punjab and Sindh . NAP performed well in the former NWFP and Balochistan . Most of the ' status quo parties ' ( such as the many Muslim League factions ) and most religious outfits ( except Jamiat Ulema Islam ) were decimated . However , a three - way deadlock between AL , PPP and the Yahya regime ( over a power - sharing formula ) regime triggered a crisis that finally saw the feared eruption of a civil war in East Pakistan and then India 's entry into the conflict . After that disastrous conflict , a group of military officers ( most of them Bhutto sympathisers ) , forced Yahya to resign and then invited Bhutto and his party to form the country 's first parliamentary government . Ayub , who had gone into seclusion , died in 1974 .

In 1968 at the height of the movement against him , young protesters in Karachi and Lahore began describing him as a dog ( Ayub Khan Kutta ! ) . This was a time when politicians and rulers in Pakistan hardly ever used any derogatory language against their opponents , so Ayub was supposedly shocked when he heard that some of his ' children ' ( the term he used to describe his subjects ) , had called him a dog . Ayub had come to power in 1958 on the back of a popular military coup ( Pakistan 's first ) , and had enjoyed a significant run of admiration from a majority of Pakistanis in the first four years of his dictatorship . Vowing to make Pakistan a powerful and influential military - industrial state , Ayub encouraged and facilitated an unprecedented growth in the process of industrialisation in the country . He also initiated the introduction of technical innovations in agriculture and brought Pakistan closer to the United States , thus benefitting from the military and financial aid that came with the enhanced relationship . By 1961 the Ayub regime had largely restored the country 's economy that had begun to weaken from the mid-1950s onwards , mainly due to the political chaos that prevailed in the country , as various factions of Pakistan 's first ruling party , the Muslim League , indulged in constant infighting and intrigues , and were unable to address the growing disenchantment and cynicism exhibited towards politicians by those who were kept out from the political process dominated by the country 's political - bureaucratic elite . Ayub was at the height of his power and popularity when he decided to lift Martial Law in 1962 and restore at least a semblance of political activity by the parties that had been banned in 1958 . He became the president and handpicked an assembly through a complex electoral system that he called ' Basic Democracy ' . After discarding the 1956 Constitution , his assembly passed a brand new constitution that enshrined Ayub 's idea of ' Jinnah 's Pakistan ' . It revolved around the construction of a strong military - industrial state , propped - up by state - backed capitalism , free enterprise , agricultural reforms and a ' progressive interpretation of Islam that was compatible with science , technology and modernity . ' Ayub detested politicians , from both the left as well as the right . His regime came down hard on left - wing parties and then went on to also ban parties such as the Jamat - i-Islami ( JI ) \u2014 though the ban was overturned by the courts . Leftists accused him of encouraging crony capitalism , the exploitation of workers and the suppression of the rights and ethnic-nationalism of the Bengalis ( in East Pakistan ) , Sindhis , the Baloch and the Pakhtun , and of dislodging the Urdu-speaking ( the Mohajirs ) from important state and government institutions that they had helped build after Pakistan 's creation in 1947 . | Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in a crowd of his supporters | The religious right denounced him of being overtly secular and undermining ' Pakistan 's Islamic culture and traditions ' . Ayub easily glided through the many periodical protests that took place against him after 1962 and then won a second term as president in a controversial presidential race in 1965 . Buoyed by his victory and his status as a ' benevolent dictator ' , Ayub then made an uncharacteristic mistake by allowing himself to be convinced by the hawks in his cabinet ( led by his young foreign minister , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto ) , to crown his economic and political achievements with a military triumph against India . India had suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Chinese army in 1964 and Bhutto and his supporters in the cabinet were convinced that the Pakistan army would be able to crush the weakened Indian armed forces . Though the Pakistani armed forces made rapid gains in the initial period of the 1965 war , the conflict soon turned into a stalemate . Ayub settled for a ceasefire , apparently sending Bhutto into a rage . Ayub eased out Bhutto from the government but the damage was done . The war had drained the country 's resources and the economy began to slide . Ayub 's opponents accused him of ' losing the war on the negotiation table ' . Bhutto went on to form the PPP , and along with the already established left-wing groups , such as the National Awami Party ( NAP ) and the National Students Federation ( NSF ) , he became the most prominent face of left - wing opposition in West Pakistan . In East Pakistan , Shiekh Mujeebur Rehman 's Awami League ( AL ) , upped the ante against the regime and accused it of leaving East Pakistan open to an Indian attack during the 1965 war . As the Bengali nationalist movement led by AL and by various militant / Maoist Bengali nationalist groups in East Pakistan gathered pace , in West Pakistan , Ayub was suddenly faced by a spontaneous students ' movement when in October 1968 , a large contingent from the NSF gate - crashed a ceremony being held by the government at Lahore 's Fortress Stadium ( to celebrate the government 's ' Decade of Progress ' ) . The students began to chant anti-Ayub slogans and clashed with the police . They accused the regime of enriching a handful of cronies and letting everyone else suffer unemployment and economic hardship . Then in November 1968 , police opened fire on a left - wing student rally in Rawalpindi , killing three protesters . In response , students formed a Students Action Committee and announced that students across Pakistan would begin a concentrated protest movement against the regime . As the students began their campaign ( with most of the student groups demanding a socialist system and parliamentary democracy ) , Bhutto 's PPP joined the fray along with NAP and their entry brought with it the participation in the movement of the radical trade and labour unions that were associated with these parties . By late 1968 the movement had spread beyond Karachi , Lahore , Rawalpindi and Peshawar and reached the smaller cities and towns of Punjab and Sindh . Meanwhile in East Pakistan , AL and other Bengali nationalist groups began to demand complete provincial autonomy for East Pakistan . Schools , colleges and universities stopped functioning ; workers went on strike and closed down a number of factories , and white - collar professionals refused to attend office , further crippling an already deteriorating political and economic order . After failing to quell the protests ( through police action and wide - scale arrests ) , Ayub invited opposition parties to hold a dialogue with the government .

The exhibition is based on research by Andrejs Edvins Feldmanis ( born in 1939 ) , a Latvian cinematographer and board member of the Occupation Museum Foundation . Feldmanis dedicated the exhibition to his father , First Lieutenant Fridrichs Feldmanis of the Latvian Army , who was murdered by U.S.S.R. NKVD units at an army summer training camp in Litene , Latvia , on June 14 , 1941 . Excerpts from the exhibition 's brochure allude to the dangerous political backdrop of Europe in the late 1930s , which portended a bleak future for Latvia . \" The government of Latvia had to pay special attention to its eastern border , because under Stalin the U.S.S.R. actively pursued the idea of ' exporting the Revolution , ' [ with the aim of dominating the world ] in the name of protecting the proletariat . Soviet Special Forces exerted considerable pressure on Latvia 's eastern border in the form of intelligence activities ( with a training center for spies located in the Russian frontier city Ostrov ) , and the activities of members of the outlawed Latvian Communist Party , smugglers , saboteurs , and the like . \" Between the two world wars Latvia 's eastern border was in many ways a dividing line between the East and West in Europe . [ \u2026 ] Contrasting political systems and ideologies [ sparked various countries ' intelligence activities in Latvia ] . Local people and border guards were actively recruited and became involved in these activities . Some local Russian families [ \u2026 ] were pro-communist and supported the Soviet secret service . [ \u2026 ] Some local inhabitants and border guards were double agents \u2026 \" On the night of June 15 the [ Latvian ] border is being guarded by Janis Macitis on patrol and Peteris Cimoska in the blind . Karlis Beizaks and Valdis Grinvalds are in the duty room . The wife of patrol leader Fricis Purins , Hermine , and his son Voldemars are in his apartment . In a house rented by Zanis Krievins , his wife Lida -Julija , his son Arturs , and his daughter Rita , and the children 's guest , 6 - year - old Erika Kalnina , are asleep . \" At around 2:30 a.m. 25 NKVD [ Interior People 's Commissariat ] men cross the Ludza River and surround the Maslenki border guards ' [ patrol ] house and the Krievins ' house . The attackers place hand grenade packets around the guardhouse . Possibly , the initial plan is to capture the patrol , but the attackers are spotted by Macitis . As an exchange of gunfire ensues , the tactics of the NKVD unit turn to destroying the patrol . Macitis is seriously wounded and retreats towards the guardhouse . Cimoska returns the attackers ' automatic rifle fire and , retreating towards the guardhouse , steps on a grenade packet and is torn to shreds in the explosion . \" Grinvalds returns the fire through the guardhouse window , while Beizaks tries to run for help to the 1st Patrol . After running 199 meters , he is gunned down . \" The attackers throw a firebomb into the guardhouse , first setting the interior on fire and then the entire house . Hermine Purina tries to save herself by jumping through the window but is shot 8.5 meters from the guardhouse . Her son Voldemars runs out the door and seeks refuge in a nearby woodpile . He is shot by the attackers in the leg and stomach and dies from his wounds the following day at the hospital in Rezekne . Macitis , too , has been mortally wounded . He is found dear close to the house , with his legs burned . Grinvalds runs unhurt from the burning house and throws himself into the river , where he is captured . \" As the guardhouse is attacked , the NKVD men also storm the Krievins ' house , tossing in hand grenades . These seriously wound Krievins ' wife and she loses consciousness . Krievins and his son sustain lighter wounds and are captured by the attackers . The girls escape by hiding under a bed . \" The NKVD posts an advance guard 250 meters from the Maslenki cordon to prevent possible aid to the Maslenki patrol . Here the leader of the 1st Patrol , Vilis Lazdins , and guards Arvids Polis and Jezups Abrickis are captured as they hasten to the tragic event . \" When the attackers have overcome the guard , they capture some other survivors , including the family of farmer Dmitrijs Maslovs , who lives nearby . Rounding up their own wounded and their casualties , they hastily gather some of the evidence and retreat beyond the border , into Soviet territory . \" \u2026 After the October 5 , 1939 treaty [ which provided for the establishment of ] Soviet army bases on Latvian territory , the Latvian Army [ was ] forced to design a new mobilization and defense plan . This plan [ had ] a single objective : to resist the U.S.S.R. armed forces should they attempt to take over all of Latvia . According to [ Latvian ] historian Edgars Andersons , mobilization was to take place in three days ' time , and two defense lines were to be established in the east . The Daugava , Aiviekste , and Pededze rivers were to form the defense line . \" As is well known , neither the Latvian Border Guard nor the Latvian Army received orders to resist the occupation forces . The government of Latvia and its army [ were ] forced to accept the situation in Europe , when none of the Western powers [ were ] willing or able to help the Baltic States [ defend themselves against the Soviet invasion ] . \" The Soviet invasion of Latvia on June 17 , 1940 , following its ultimatum , interrupted the official investigation of the attack on the Maslenki border post . There had been attacks on other posts . Only after Latvia regained independence in 1991 was the case reopened . The case concluded that Soviet military persons had killed three Latvian border guards - Karlis Beizaks , 25 , Janis Macitis , 27 , and Peteris Cimoska , 26 , and two civilians , Hermine Purins , 44 , and Voldemars Purins , 14 . Three members of the Purins family were wounded . Ten Latvian border guards and 27 civilians in all had been captured . Several small children and one infant were among the captives . Less than a month later , on July 7 , 1940 , all the captives except Dmitrijs Maslovs were returned . Maslovs was later tried by an NKVD court , sentenced to death , and shot in 1942 . Seven-year- old Silvija Smukkalne suffered a nervous breakdown ; she contracted a disease of the nervous system after her release and died .","annotations":[{"text":"First Lieutenant Fridrichs Feldmanis","span":[492,527],"token_span":[90,93],"role":"Victim","label":"Victim","role_definition":"The living entity that dies as a result of the killing."},{"text":"U.S.S.R.

The exhibition is based on research by Andrejs Edvins Feldmanis ( born in 1939 ) , a Latvian cinematographer and board member of the Occupation Museum Foundation . Feldmanis dedicated the exhibition to his father , First Lieutenant Fridrichs Feldmanis of the Latvian Army , who was murdered by U.S.S.R. NKVD units at an army summer training camp in Litene , Latvia , on June 14 , 1941 . Excerpts from the exhibition 's brochure allude to the dangerous political backdrop of Europe in the late 1930s , which portended a bleak future for Latvia . \" The government of Latvia had to pay special attention to its eastern border , because under Stalin the U.S.S.R. actively pursued the idea of ' exporting the Revolution , ' [ with the aim of dominating the world ] in the name of protecting the proletariat . Soviet Special Forces exerted considerable pressure on Latvia 's eastern border in the form of intelligence activities ( with a training center for spies located in the Russian frontier city Ostrov ) , and the activities of members of the outlawed Latvian Communist Party , smugglers , saboteurs , and the like . \" Between the two world wars Latvia 's eastern border was in many ways a dividing line between the East and West in Europe . [ \u2026 ] Contrasting political systems and ideologies [ sparked various countries ' intelligence activities in Latvia ] . Local people and border guards were actively recruited and became involved in these activities . Some local Russian families [ \u2026 ] were pro-communist and supported the Soviet secret service . [ \u2026 ] Some local inhabitants and border guards were double agents \u2026 \" On the night of June 15 the [ Latvian ] border is being guarded by Janis Macitis on patrol and Peteris Cimoska in the blind . Karlis Beizaks and Valdis Grinvalds are in the duty room . The wife of patrol leader Fricis Purins , Hermine , and his son Voldemars are in his apartment . In a house rented by Zanis Krievins , his wife Lida -Julija , his son Arturs , and his daughter Rita , and the children 's guest , 6 - year - old Erika Kalnina , are asleep . \" At around 2:30 a.m. 25 NKVD [ Interior People 's Commissariat ] men cross the Ludza River and surround the Maslenki border guards ' [ patrol ] house and the Krievins ' house . The attackers place hand grenade packets around the guardhouse . Possibly , the initial plan is to capture the patrol , but the attackers are spotted by Macitis . As an exchange of gunfire ensues , the tactics of the NKVD unit turn to destroying the patrol . Macitis is seriously wounded and retreats towards the guardhouse . Cimoska returns the attackers ' automatic rifle fire and , retreating towards the guardhouse , steps on a grenade packet and is torn to shreds in the explosion . \" Grinvalds returns the fire through the guardhouse window , while Beizaks tries to run for help to the 1st Patrol . After running 199 meters , he is gunned down . \" The attackers throw a firebomb into the guardhouse , first setting the interior on fire and then the entire house . Hermine Purina tries to save herself by jumping through the window but is shot 8.5 meters from the guardhouse . Her son Voldemars runs out the door and seeks refuge in a nearby woodpile . He is shot by the attackers in the leg and stomach and dies from his wounds the following day at the hospital in Rezekne . Macitis , too , has been mortally wounded . He is found dear close to the house , with his legs burned . Grinvalds runs unhurt from the burning house and throws himself into the river , where he is captured . \" As the guardhouse is attacked , the NKVD men also storm the Krievins ' house , tossing in hand grenades . These seriously wound Krievins ' wife and she loses consciousness . Krievins and his son sustain lighter wounds and are captured by the attackers . The girls escape by hiding under a bed . \" The NKVD posts an advance guard 250 meters from the Maslenki cordon to prevent possible aid to the Maslenki patrol . Here the leader of the 1st Patrol , Vilis Lazdins , and guards Arvids Polis and Jezups Abrickis are captured as they hasten to the tragic event . \" When the attackers have overcome the guard , they capture some other survivors , including the family of farmer Dmitrijs Maslovs , who lives nearby . Rounding up their own wounded and their casualties , they hastily gather some of the evidence and retreat beyond the border , into Soviet territory . \" \u2026 After the October 5 , 1939 treaty [ which provided for the establishment of ] Soviet army bases on Latvian territory , the Latvian Army [ was ] forced to design a new mobilization and defense plan . This plan [ had ] a single objective : to resist the U.S.S.R. armed forces should they attempt to take over all of Latvia . According to [ Latvian ] historian Edgars Andersons , mobilization was to take place in three days ' time , and two defense lines were to be established in the east . The Daugava , Aiviekste , and Pededze rivers were to form the defense line . \" As is well known , neither the Latvian Border Guard nor the Latvian Army received orders to resist the occupation forces . The government of Latvia and its army [ were ] forced to accept the situation in Europe , when none of the Western powers [ were ] willing or able to help the Baltic States [ defend themselves against the Soviet invasion ] . \" The Soviet invasion of Latvia on June 17 , 1940 , following its ultimatum , interrupted the official investigation of the attack on the Maslenki border post . There had been attacks on other posts . Only after Latvia regained independence in 1991 was the case reopened . The case concluded that Soviet military persons had killed three Latvian border guards - Karlis Beizaks , 25 , Janis Macitis , 27 , and Peteris Cimoska , 26 , and two civilians , Hermine Purins , 44 , and Voldemars Purins , 14 . Three members of the Purins family were wounded . Ten Latvian border guards and 27 civilians in all had been captured . Several small children and one infant were among the captives . Less than a month later , on July 7 , 1940 , all the captives except Dmitrijs Maslovs were returned . Maslovs was later tried by an NKVD court , sentenced to death , and shot in 1942 . Seven-year- old Silvija Smukkalne suffered a nervous breakdown ; she contracted a disease of the nervous system after her release and died .","annotations":[{"text":"U.S.S.R.

The 64-year- old had been questioned previously during a three - and - a- half year probe by detectives from the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation attached to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement ( ODCE ) into alleged financial irregularities at the failed bank . The bankrupt former businessman , with an address at Camaderry , Whitshed Road , Greystones , Co Wicklow , stepped down in December 2008 . Anglo was subsequently nationalised and re-branded the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation ( IBRC ) with its collapse costing Irish taxpayers about \u20ac 30 bn . The dapper former banker had been arrested at Dublin Airport in the early hours of today by arrangement \u2013 and indicated that he understood why \u2013 before he was taken to the Bridewell Garda Station in the city -centre . There , at 8.08 AM , he made \u201c no comment \u201d when he was charged with 16 counts contrary to Section 60 of the Companies Act . The charges allege that before it was nationalised , he permitted the bank to \u201c give unlawful financial assistance \u201d to 16 named individuals for the purpose of or in connection with a purchase by the same people of shares in the then Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Plc . It is claimed the alleged unlawful financial help to buy shares was given between July 10 and July 17 , 2008 to 15 people \u2013 which include the so-called \u201c Maple Ten \u201d group of Irish Investors and several members of Sean Quinn 's family \u2013 and from July 17 until July 30 , of the same year , to Patricia Quinn , the wife of now bankrupt quarry tycoon Sean . Among the names on the charges is Sean Quinn Junior , who was jailed last week by the High Court for contempt of court for hiding \u20ac 500 m of property assets from Anglo , now called the IBRC . Also included in the names of people who allegedly got financial assistance to buy shares in the bank are : Colette Marie Quinn , Aoife Quinn , Ciara Quinn , Brenda Quinn , property developer Patrick McKillen , Seamus Ross , Brian O'Farrell , John McCabe , Gerard Maguire , Patrick Kearney , Gerard Gannon , Gerard Conlon , Sean Reilly and Joseph O'Reilly . State solicitor Jane Farrell told Judge Cormac Dunne at Dublin District Court that the DPP has directed that Mr Fitzpatrick is to face trial on indictment in relation to all the charges . His charges are duplicates of those brought earlier this week against two other former senior executives from the bank , Willie McAteer and Patrick Whelan \u2013 and like them he will face a trial before a judge and jury at Dublin Circuit Court . Looking tanned and dressed in a dark blazer , blue shirt , pink tie and beige trousers , the ex-banker remained seated and silent with his hands on his lap as he looked at the judge who was taking down notes detailing his arrest . He spoke once saying \u201c thank you \u201d after the judge agreed to release him on bail pending the preparation of the book of evidence . His sister Joyce O'Connor stood bail in the sum of \u20ac 10,000 . Once the independent surety was approved , he was let out and ordered to appear again on October 8 next . Mr Fitzpatrick walked from court with a garda escort straight into a media scrum and was surrounded by photographers and camera crews . He was then ushered into a waiting taxi which whisked him away from the courthouse . It had been a busy morning for the ex- Anglo chairman ; he had been arrested at 5.37 am by arrangement at Dublin Airport and from there he was taken to the Bridewell Garda Station . After being charged there , he emerged from the back of the station at 9.12 am with his head looking downwards and a dark coat draped over both his hands . He was the last of three prisoners loaded on a Garda van ; seconds later it pulled out and brought him on the short drive to the Criminal Courts of Justice Complex at Parkgate Street for his hearing .

The 64-year- old had been questioned previously during a three - and - a- half year probe by detectives from the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation attached to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement ( ODCE ) into alleged financial irregularities at the failed bank . The bankrupt former businessman , with an address at Camaderry , Whitshed Road , Greystones , Co Wicklow , stepped down in December 2008 . Anglo was subsequently nationalised and re-branded the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation ( IBRC ) with its collapse costing Irish taxpayers about \u20ac 30 bn . The dapper former banker had been arrested at Dublin Airport in the early hours of today by arrangement \u2013 and indicated that he understood why \u2013 before he was taken to the Bridewell Garda Station in the city -centre . There , at 8.08 AM , he made \u201c no comment \u201d when he was charged with 16 counts contrary to Section 60 of the Companies Act . The charges allege that before it was nationalised , he permitted the bank to \u201c give unlawful financial assistance \u201d to 16 named individuals for the purpose of or in connection with a purchase by the same people of shares in the then Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Plc . It is claimed the alleged unlawful financial help to buy shares was given between July 10 and July 17 , 2008 to 15 people \u2013 which include the so-called \u201c Maple Ten \u201d group of Irish Investors and several members of Sean Quinn 's family \u2013 and from July 17 until July 30 , of the same year , to Patricia Quinn , the wife of now bankrupt quarry tycoon Sean . Among the names on the charges is Sean Quinn Junior , who was jailed last week by the High Court for contempt of court for hiding \u20ac 500 m of property assets from Anglo , now called the IBRC . Also included in the names of people who allegedly got financial assistance to buy shares in the bank are : Colette Marie Quinn , Aoife Quinn , Ciara Quinn , Brenda Quinn , property developer Patrick McKillen , Seamus Ross , Brian O'Farrell , John McCabe , Gerard Maguire , Patrick Kearney , Gerard Gannon , Gerard Conlon , Sean Reilly and Joseph O'Reilly . State solicitor Jane Farrell told Judge Cormac Dunne at Dublin District Court that the DPP has directed that Mr Fitzpatrick is to face trial on indictment in relation to all the charges . His charges are duplicates of those brought earlier this week against two other former senior executives from the bank , Willie McAteer and Patrick Whelan \u2013 and like them he will face a trial before a judge and jury at Dublin Circuit Court . Looking tanned and dressed in a dark blazer , blue shirt , pink tie and beige trousers , the ex-banker remained seated and silent with his hands on his lap as he looked at the judge who was taking down notes detailing his arrest . He spoke once saying \u201c thank you \u201d after the judge agreed to release him on bail pending the preparation of the book of evidence . His sister Joyce O'Connor stood bail in the sum of \u20ac 10,000 . Once the independent surety was approved , he was let out and ordered to appear again on October 8 next . Mr Fitzpatrick walked from court with a garda escort straight into a media scrum and was surrounded by photographers and camera crews . He was then ushered into a waiting taxi which whisked him away from the courthouse . It had been a busy morning for the ex- Anglo chairman ; he had been arrested at 5.37 am by arrangement at Dublin Airport and from there he was taken to the Bridewell Garda Station .

Players can play with a party with the basic Soldier , Pilgrim and Wizard , or experiment with other unusual configurations like three Merchants or Jesters . The Game : Up until Dragon Quest III , the venerable series did have some non-linear aspects . Most of the original game is not really blocked in any way other than by being infested with monsters that can instantly kill an unprepared player . The second and third games have a substantial portion of them taken up in a search for important items scattered throughout their worlds . One interesting thing that separates these Dragon Quest games from many others is the role bridges play in them . Bridges tend to signify a major change in the difficulty of monsters the player encounters . If the player is still struggling with the monsters he 's fighting and sees a bridge , he 'll know not to traipse across it . There are exceptions to this rule , and sometimes monsters improve upon crossing invisible boundaries , but the use of some element of the scenery to indicate to the player that difficulty is going up is an idea that far more RPGs could stand to borrow . While most games use \" hard \" barriers to prevent player access to later areas , Dragon Quest is more likely to use \" soft \" barriers , where the player can go where he wants , maybe after an early section that 's more linear , but it might be unwise to do so because of the strength of the monsters . In an action game player skill can make up for undue numeric difficulty , but in a turn - based combat RPG the numbers and flags that define a monster 's abilities are the challenge , and there 's only so much the player can do to get around them . If you think about it , this poses unique problems when designing a non-linear RPG . To a player with 40 maximum hit points , going from an area where the monsters do 12 hit points of damage to an area where they do 20 is an almost unbearable increase in danger . If the quest path is mostly straight and one - way , then the monster spawn zones can be placed to match . But if the game is n't linear , then the designer has no idea where the player will be going next . The player might stray into areas intended for far hardier characters than he 's had the chance to build , and could get wiped out quickly , causing frustration . I think some frustration is n't necessarily bad in a game , but no one wants to challenge the gods unprepared . But on the other hand , if all the areas have monsters that are a good challenge for characters from the moment they are able to enter them , then growth will be rapid at first and soon the player will cruse through the rest of the game . The Dragon Quest games , to my eyes , solve the problem by taking advantage of an interesting aspect of RPG character growth , the fact that the effective rate of character growth actually decelerates over time . Take 1st and 2nd edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons level growth as an example . Back in those days , a character 's starting hit points were determined by the role of a single die . Upon reaching each additional level , players got to roll another die and add that to their total . The result was , at first level the player 's hit points could be as low as one , but with each additional level gained the law of averages caused HP to trend towards average , making them more generally survivable against foes of equal level . However , the amount of hit points gained with each level remains constant , even though the player is accumulating more and more of them . A first level mage in 2nd Edition AD&D had an average of 2.5 hit points . Gaining an additional level approximately doubles that figure . But a tenth level mage has about 25 hit points , and gaining level 11 still adds on just 2.5 more . The gain relative to what he already has becomes less and less as the character grows . More recent versions of D&D even out the randomness a bit more by giving characters maximum hit points at first level , and JRPGs like Dragon Quest work around this by giving characters some extra HP at the start , by subtly increasing growth rate at higher levels , and sometimes by even starting players at higher levels , but the overall principle still applies . As the player 's party gains levels , they may grow linearly , or even in a steadily accelerating rate , but the effective benefit from those levels decreases . Dragon Quest games never start the player , from first level , in a wholly non-linear part of the game ; that bit only kicks in once he 's gotten some levels under his belt . The result is , that large area with monsters all of about the same level , if made just a little harder than usual , can suffice to provide good challenge for quite some time . A level 21 player may struggle a bit when facing level 26 monsters , but he wo n't be wiped out as a level 1 player would be fighting level 6 foes . Design Lessons : The non-linear sections of the early Dragon Quest games ( IV does not apply ! ) allow the player some freedom in his exploration , but have to be carefully handled to continue to give the player a sense of danger . But it is n't all that bad if the player 's party gets a little strong compared to the opposition during the tail end of these sections . If an RPG couples monster difficulty too closely to PC advancement , then the player never gets the feeling that his wards are really improving . The worst games in this regard are those that multiply by scaling values to directly tie monster difficulty to player level . Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy VIII are two notable games that do this . Oblivion does it too . If monsters are always slightly stronger than the player , then what on Alefgard / Ivalice / Tamriel are experience levels for ? Links : Wikipedia GameFAQs 14 . Ufouria , a.k.a. Hebereke It 's like Metroid meets Hello Kitty , true , but it 's actually rather a cool little game . Developed by Sunsoft . Directed by \" Chow - Mu-Sow \" and Yoshinori Homma Designed by \" Ucchi \" Platform : Famicom , NES ( European , Australian ) Length : Short Of Note : This is a rather quirky open world game that , despite being the subject of an infamous Nintendo Power spread , never made it to the United States . The reasons are possibly related to Sunsoft 's continued disappointment over Blaster Master . It 's actually fairly rare in any territory , and is regarded as a collector 's item . By the way , if you decide to hunt this game up and play it , you should probably be made aware of the primary means of attack . Early in the game , before weapon items have been found , the only way to harm enemies is to jump on them with the down direction held on the control pad . If you jump on them Mario style you 'll just get hurt , but holding down causes the characters to present their feet in order to give the monster a good stomp . Once killed , the enemy usually leaves behind a weird blue face that can be used as a weapon against other monsters . The Game : The game 's map is found early , but is more like the one from Goonies II than Super Metroid , showing the general location of the areas and sometimes it shows the location of objects , but not exits or any detail , and other things only if special detectors are found . This is another game that starts the player out with only very basic maneuvers and makes him find 90 % of the abilities he can eventually have . In this case , some of those abilities come in the form of alternate characters he can control . Unlike Legacy of the Wizard ( see below ) , the player can switch between these guys at any time , which is kind of a weird decision from a design standpoint . Only one character walk on ice and float on water , yet another can sink in water , one can climb walls ( once the appropriate item is found ) , one can destroy bombable walls ( again , with the right item ) ... and another has floaty jumps that let him cover long distances . There is really no good reason all of these abilities ca n't be given to one character , especially since they otherwise have similar abilities and share the same damage meter . But on the other hand , a lot of the game 's charm comes from its animations , and there 'd be a lot less of that to see if the player only had one guy to play . As far as game structure , there are some rather fiendish secret routes in this one , like doors found on platforms surrounded on all sides by air , and which must be sort of lucked onto from above . There 's another place where the ghost character has to jump from cloud to cloud to make it to an important area , but there 's a gap between two clouds that looks too far to jump . It is too far , but if the player tries it , a cloud shoots up from below , just as the player passes it . While the game 's character graphics show an undeniable Sanrio influence , the backgrounds seem a lot more detailed than they have to be . Have a look at the water for example , those animated waves look a lot more realistic than they have any right being in a game like this . Design Lessons : One thing about Ufouria that could possibly be regarded as a negative in how it takes after Metroid is its health system . Both games start the player with a pitiful amount of health , far less than maximum , and when starting a new life they go back to that minimal energy level . In Ufouria the player can eventually get up to 250 health , but every time a life begins , he 's back to 10 . At least in Metroid enemies drop health rather frequently ! Maybe one in eight kills in Ufouria drop a health ball , and those are only worth 2 energy each ! The only realistic way to refill health is to find Medicine or Water of Life somewhere in the game , which refill 50 and all health respectively , but each can only be found once per life , and neither can the player carry more than one of either at a time . While I think we can all agree that this is going too far , there is something to be said for the spirit it adds to a game . It means that the player ca n't ever just bludgeon his way through any areas . Any time he 's going somewhere to fight a boss , even if he 's going through the areas at the very start of the game , he ca n't just rush through and take the hits . Whether the damage taken at any point leading up to a boss , or facing the boss himself , it counts the same . The player must pay attention if he 's going to survive , and classic gamers tend to appreciate that .

Dragon Quest games never start the player , from first level , in a wholly non-linear part of the game ; that bit only kicks in once he 's gotten some levels under his belt . The result is , that large area with monsters all of about the same level , if made just a little harder than usual , can suffice to provide good challenge for quite some time . A level 21 player may struggle a bit when facing level 26 monsters , but he wo n't be wiped out as a level 1 player would be fighting level 6 foes . Design Lessons : The non-linear sections of the early Dragon Quest games ( IV does not apply ! ) allow the player some freedom in his exploration , but have to be carefully handled to continue to give the player a sense of danger . But it is n't all that bad if the player 's party gets a little strong compared to the opposition during the tail end of these sections . If an RPG couples monster difficulty too closely to PC advancement , then the player never gets the feeling that his wards are really improving . The worst games in this regard are those that multiply by scaling values to directly tie monster difficulty to player level . Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy VIII are two notable games that do this . Oblivion does it too . If monsters are always slightly stronger than the player , then what on Alefgard / Ivalice / Tamriel are experience levels for ? Links : Wikipedia GameFAQs 14 . Ufouria , a.k.a. Hebereke It 's like Metroid meets Hello Kitty , true , but it 's actually rather a cool little game . Developed by Sunsoft . Directed by \" Chow - Mu-Sow \" and Yoshinori Homma Designed by \" Ucchi \" Platform : Famicom , NES ( European , Australian ) Length : Short Of Note : This is a rather quirky open world game that , despite being the subject of an infamous Nintendo Power spread , never made it to the United States . The reasons are possibly related to Sunsoft 's continued disappointment over Blaster Master . It 's actually fairly rare in any territory , and is regarded as a collector 's item . By the way , if you decide to hunt this game up and play it , you should probably be made aware of the primary means of attack . Early in the game , before weapon items have been found , the only way to harm enemies is to jump on them with the down direction held on the control pad . If you jump on them Mario style you 'll just get hurt , but holding down causes the characters to present their feet in order to give the monster a good stomp . Once killed , the enemy usually leaves behind a weird blue face that can be used as a weapon against other monsters . The Game : The game 's map is found early , but is more like the one from Goonies II than Super Metroid , showing the general location of the areas and sometimes it shows the location of objects , but not exits or any detail , and other things only if special detectors are found . This is another game that starts the player out with only very basic maneuvers and makes him find 90 % of the abilities he can eventually have . In this case , some of those abilities come in the form of alternate characters he can control . Unlike Legacy of the Wizard ( see below ) , the player can switch between these guys at any time , which is kind of a weird decision from a design standpoint . Only one character walk on ice and float on water , yet another can sink in water , one can climb walls ( once the appropriate item is found ) , one can destroy bombable walls ( again , with the right item ) ... and another has floaty jumps that let him cover long distances . There is really no good reason all of these abilities ca n't be given to one character , especially since they otherwise have similar abilities and share the same damage meter . But on the other hand , a lot of the game 's charm comes from its animations , and there 'd be a lot less of that to see if the player only had one guy to play . As far as game structure , there are some rather fiendish secret routes in this one , like doors found on platforms surrounded on all sides by air , and which must be sort of lucked onto from above . There 's another place where the ghost character has to jump from cloud to cloud to make it to an important area , but there 's a gap between two clouds that looks too far to jump . It is too far , but if the player tries it , a cloud shoots up from below , just as the player passes it . While the game 's character graphics show an undeniable Sanrio influence , the backgrounds seem a lot more detailed than they have to be . Have a look at the water for example , those animated waves look a lot more realistic than they have any right being in a game like this . Design Lessons : One thing about Ufouria that could possibly be regarded as a negative in how it takes after Metroid is its health system . Both games start the player with a pitiful amount of health , far less than maximum , and when starting a new life they go back to that minimal energy level . In Ufouria the player can eventually get up to 250 health , but every time a life begins , he 's back to 10 . At least in Metroid enemies drop health rather frequently ! Maybe one in eight kills in Ufouria drop a health ball , and those are only worth 2 energy each ! The only realistic way to refill health is to find Medicine or Water of Life somewhere in the game , which refill 50 and all health respectively , but each can only be found once per life , and neither can the player carry more than one of either at a time . While I think we can all agree that this is going too far , there is something to be said for the spirit it adds to a game . It means that the player ca n't ever just bludgeon his way through any areas . Any time he 's going somewhere to fight a boss , even if he 's going through the areas at the very start of the game , he ca n't just rush through and take the hits . Whether the damage taken at any point leading up to a boss , or facing the boss himself , it counts the same . The player must pay attention if he 's going to survive , and classic gamers tend to appreciate that .

Correspondence Address : In 1896 , Joseph Babinski , a French neurologist , first described the best known neurologic eponym ' the Babinski sign ' . This sign is characterised by dorsiflexion of the big toe and recruitment of the extensor hallucis longus muscle , on stimulating the sole of the foot . He has emphasised from the outset , the intimate relationship between this sign and the shortening movement in other leg muscles , which form the flexion synergy of the lower limb . The Babinski sign is not a new reflex , rather it is released as a result of breakdown of the harmonious integration of the flexion and extension components of the normal defence reflex mechanism , due to pyramidal tract dysfunction . A pathological Babinski sign should be clearly distinguished from upgoing toes that may not always be a part of the flexion synergy . This article reviews the Babinski sign in detail , focusing on the historical perspectives , role of pyramidal tract dysfunction and art of elicitation and interpretation . The significance of assessing this phenomenon in the entire leg , and the clinical clues that will help to dispel the myths regarding the Babinski sign , have been emphasised . It was on February 22 , 1896 , that Joseph Francois Felix Babinski published his first report on ' reflexe cutane plantaire ' [ cutaneous plantar reflex ] which became the sign that bears his name : ' the Babinski sign ' . [ 1 ] However unknown to Babinski , several painters like Bortticelli , Raphael , Leonardo da Vinci had previously demonstrated this phenomenon in their paintings . [ 2 ] Later , Babinski asserted that if others had described the abnormal reflex before him , they found it fortuitously and did not realize its clinical implication ; while he discovered it by a combination of chance , careful observation and intuition . [ 3 ] Babinski first differentiated between a normal and pathologic plantar response . [ 4 ] Sketch of the Man Joseph Babinski was born in Paris and died at the age of 75 in 1932 [ Figure . 1 ] . Of reticent disposition , he wrote in a very sombre and serious tone , but his gaze , clear and calm , was penetrating and scrutinizing . [ 5 ] He was a devout bachelor and had two passions in his life i.e. work and his brother Henri . His objective was always to find clinical signs that permitted the authentification of the organic nature of the syndrome ; and specify the localisation of the lesion responsible for the same . Babinski 's ambition to establish a department of neurosurgery at the Hospital de la Pitie in Paris , where he did most of his work , was realised shortly after his death . [ 6 ] The Babinski sign This eponym refers to the dorsiflexion of the great toe with or without fanning of the other toes and withdrawal of the leg , on plantar stimulation in patients with pyramidal tract dysfunction . The characteristic response is dorsiflexion of the great toe by recruitment of extensor hallucis longus ( EHL ) muscle . In most mammals the limbs are automatically retracted on painful stimulation as a defence reflex , which is more pronounced in hind limbs . Sherrington called it , the flexion reflex synergy , because activation of all muscles effected shortening of the limb ; the toe extensors forming part of this shortening synergy . Confusion has arisen from the application of the term extensor plantar response to a movement which forms part of a flexion synergy of the lower limbs . The toe ' extensors ' although named extensors by anatomists , are infact flexors in a physiological sense because their action is to shorten the limb and contract reflexly along with other flexor muscles . The Babinski sign may be a normal occurrence in the 1st year of life , due to a brisker flexion synergy , the toes being a part of it . As the nervous system matures and the pyramidal tract gains more control over spinal motor neurons , the flexion synergy becomes less brisk and toe ' extensors ' are no longer a part of it . The toe then often goes down , instead of up , as a result of a segmental reflex involving the small foot muscles and the overlying skin . This is considered to be normal in adults and is termed - flexor plantar response . With lesions of the pyramidal system , structural or functional , this segmental downward response of the toes disappears , the flexion synergy may become disinhibited and the EHL muscle is again recruited into the flexion reflex of the leg producing the sign of ' Babinski ' . [ 7 ] The muscles taking part in a fully developed response include extensor hallucis longus , tibialis anterior , extensor digitorum longus , hamstring group of muscles and tensor faciae latae . The characteristic response is dorsiflexion ( extension ) of the [ big toe ] , which precedes all other movements . It is followed by fanning out and extension of the other toes , dorsiflexion of the ankle and flexion of the hip and knee joint . This response represents ' positive ' Babinski sign . There is no such thing as a ' negative ' Babinski sign . The role of pyramidal tract There seems to be a close association between occurrence of the Babinski sign and impairment of voluntary foot movement . A Babinski sign can appear only if the intraspinal pathways of the flexion reflex synergy are operative , however , severe the motor deficit in the foot . The function of the pyramidal tract may not only be disturbed by structural lesions of myelin sheaths , axons , or both , but also by nonneurological conditions [ Table I ] . The motor neurons of the leg muscles are laminated into separate columns within the anterior horn of the cord , each of which supply proximal or distal muscles , flexor or extensor muscles . In addition , there are important pyramidal tract projections to the intermediate ( interneuronal ) zone . This divergence of pyramidal tract projections allows the following two explanations for the Babinski sign . The Babinski sign might be released by dysfunction of pyramidal tract fibres that project on interneuronal zone , at least on those interneurons that subserve the flexion reflex synergy , of which the Babinski sign is a part . As these interneurons are necessarily interconnected across the segments of the lumbosacral spinal cord , a Babinski sign would always be Types of Babinski sign a) Minimal Babinski sign : Contraction of hamstring muscles and tensor faciae latae . b) True Babinski sign : Includes all the components of the fully developed extensor plantar reflex . c) Pseudo Babinski sign : One may encounter this type of response in sensitive individuals , plantar hyperaesthesia , and choreo-athetosis due to hyperkinesis . True Babinski can be clinically distinguished from the false Babinski by the contraction of hamstring muscles in the former , and failure to inhibit the extensor response by pressure over the base of the great toe . d) Exaggerated Babinski sign : It can either be in the form of ' flexor spasm ' or ' extensor spasm ' , depending upon the muscles i.e. whether flexors or extensors , have excess of tone . Flexor spasms occur in spinal cord disease , bilateral upper motor neuron lesion at a supraspinal level , multiple sclerosis and subacute combined degeneration of the cord , while ' extensor spasm ' occurs in patients with corticospinal tract lesion when the posterior column function is normal . e) Inversion of plantar reflex : If the short flexors of the toe are paralysed or flexor tendons are severed accidentally , an extensor response may be obtained . f) Tonic Babinski reflex : Characterised by slow prolonged contraction of extensors of toe , seen in frontal lobe lesions and extrapyramidal involvement . g) Crossed extensor response / bilateral Babinski sign : Unilateral stimulation produces bilateral Babinski in patients with bilateral cerebral disease and spinal cord disease . h) Spontaneous Babinski : In infants and children following manipulation of the foot , and in patients with extensive pyramidal tract diseases , passive extension of the knee or passive flexion of the hip and the knee , may produce a positive Babinski sign . The art of elicitation The reflexogenic area for the plantar reflex is the first sacral ( S1 ) dermatome with the receptor nerve endings being located in the skin . The afferent nerve is the tibial nerve , the spinal cord segments involved in the reflex arc being 4th and 5th lumbar and 1st and 2nd sacral . Position All the leg muscles should be visible and in a relaxed state . This can be achieved by positioning the patient in a way that the knee is slightly flexed and the thigh is externally rotated . The patient should be warned that the sole is going to be scratched and ask him to try to let his limb remain as floppy as possible . The toes should not be touched at all . Stimulation It is the site of stimulation , the intensity of stimulation , and even the object used for stimulation that has received by far the most attention . Any part of the leg can be stimulated , but the best technique is to stimulate the lateral plantar surface and the transverse arch in a single movement upto the middle metatarsophalangeal joint with a firm applicator lasting 5 to 6 seconds . [ 9 ] Difficulties are bound to arise in certain clinical situations which makes elicitation and interpretation of plantar response inconclusive . It is imperative that one realises these problems and be aware of their solutions in order to arrive at an appropriate clinical conclusion [ Table II ] . Alternate methods The late 19th and early 20th century was abound with disclaimers associated with founders of new reflex movements of the great toe . These movements are known by the term ' Babinski like responses ' . These responses can be elicited by the following techniques , each with its own eponym . By stroking the lateral malleolus ( Chaddock 's sign ) ; squeezing the calf muscle ( Gordon 's sign ) ; applying pressure along the shin of tibia ( Oppenheim sign ) ; pressing the 4th toe downwards and then releasing it with a snap ( Gonda 's sign ) ; vigorous adduction of the little toe followed by its sudden release ( Stransky sign ) ; squeezing the Achilles tendon ( Schaefer 's sign ) , flexion of the toes , on quick percussion of the tips of the patients toes with the finger tip ( Rossolimo 's sign ) ; flexion of the four outer toes induced by tapping the dorsum of the foot in the region of cuboid bone ( Mendal Bechtrew sign ) ; giving multiple pinpricks on dorsolateral surface of the foot ( Bing 's sign ) ; forceful passive plantar flexion of the ankle ( Moniz sign ) ; pressing over the dorsal aspect of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the great toe ( Throckmortan sign ) ; application of forceful pressure over anterior tibial region ( Strumpell sign ) ; scratching the dorsum of the foot along the inner side of the extensor tendon of the great toe ( Cornell sign ) ; plantar flexion and fanning of the toes on tapping the mid plantar region of the foot or base of the heel . Interpretation Incorporation of videotape and electromyography should be welcomed in the interpretation of plantar response . [ 10 ] The following criteria that have emerged from the comparison of clinical data with electromyographic results may be applied for interpreting a pathological Babinski sign . [ 11 ] a) Upward movement of the great toe is pathological only if caused by contraction of the EHL muscle . b) Contraction of the EHL muscle is pathological only if it is occurring synchronously with reflex activity in other flexor muscles . c) A Babinski sign does not necessarily imply that the concurrent activity of the other flexor muscles should be very brisk and vice versa . d) The true Babinski sign is reproducible , unlike voluntary withdrawal of the toes . Fallacies An extensor response may be present when there is no damage to the pyramidal tract . A possible explanation being the excitation of the distal motor neurons and inhibition of the impulses via flexor reflex afferent nerve fibres can be dissociated because they are mediated by different neurons , however closely linked . On the contrary , cases with proven damage to the pyramidal system have had normal plantar response . We should understand that corticospinal fibres not only originate in different parts of the cortex , but also have different terminations . Babinski sign can be expected only when ' leg fibres ' of the pyramidal tract are involved . Plantar areflexia can be noted in cases with loss of sensation of sole due to lesion of the first sacral cutaneous distribution . The same can be observed in paralysis of extensors or long flexors of great toe . In spinal shock , cessation of tonic discharge of spinal neurons by excitatory impulses in descending pathways may explain its non existence . Drugs like parenteral physostigmine in physiological doses may also abolish a plantar response . Despite the continuing controversy and observer bias , clinical utility of Babinski sign remains unchallenged . The role of pyramidal system in the pathophysiology of this sign is quite clear . Pyramidal tract dysfunction releases the flexion reflex synergy , of which contraction of the extensor hallucis longus muscle forms an integral part . The most important and vital question in interpreting the plantar response is not , whether the great toe goes up or not , but is whether an upgoing toe is pathological or not . For an appropriate answer the method of observation is much more important than the method of elicitation . Moreover , videotaping and electromyography could improve the clinical interpretation and help in settling the argument especially if it is an unexpected finding .","annotations":[{"text":"the calf muscle","span":[9927,9941],"token_span":[1760,1762],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The Entity being manipulated often occurs as the direct object of verbs:"}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"Gordon 's sign is a clinical sign in which squeezing the calf muscle elicits an extensor plantar reflex .

Correspondence Address : In 1896 , Joseph Babinski , a French neurologist , first described the best known neurologic eponym ' the Babinski sign ' . This sign is characterised by dorsiflexion of the big toe and recruitment of the extensor hallucis longus muscle , on stimulating the sole of the foot . He has emphasised from the outset , the intimate relationship between this sign and the shortening movement in other leg muscles , which form the flexion synergy of the lower limb . The Babinski sign is not a new reflex , rather it is released as a result of breakdown of the harmonious integration of the flexion and extension components of the normal defence reflex mechanism , due to pyramidal tract dysfunction . A pathological Babinski sign should be clearly distinguished from upgoing toes that may not always be a part of the flexion synergy . This article reviews the Babinski sign in detail , focusing on the historical perspectives , role of pyramidal tract dysfunction and art of elicitation and interpretation . The significance of assessing this phenomenon in the entire leg , and the clinical clues that will help to dispel the myths regarding the Babinski sign , have been emphasised . It was on February 22 , 1896 , that Joseph Francois Felix Babinski published his first report on ' reflexe cutane plantaire ' [ cutaneous plantar reflex ] which became the sign that bears his name : ' the Babinski sign ' . [ 1 ] However unknown to Babinski , several painters like Bortticelli , Raphael , Leonardo da Vinci had previously demonstrated this phenomenon in their paintings . [ 2 ] Later , Babinski asserted that if others had described the abnormal reflex before him , they found it fortuitously and did not realize its clinical implication ; while he discovered it by a combination of chance , careful observation and intuition . [ 3 ] Babinski first differentiated between a normal and pathologic plantar response . [ 4 ] Sketch of the Man Joseph Babinski was born in Paris and died at the age of 75 in 1932 [ Figure . 1 ] . Of reticent disposition , he wrote in a very sombre and serious tone , but his gaze , clear and calm , was penetrating and scrutinizing . [ 5 ] He was a devout bachelor and had two passions in his life i.e. work and his brother Henri . His objective was always to find clinical signs that permitted the authentification of the organic nature of the syndrome ; and specify the localisation of the lesion responsible for the same . Babinski 's ambition to establish a department of neurosurgery at the Hospital de la Pitie in Paris , where he did most of his work , was realised shortly after his death . [ 6 ] The Babinski sign This eponym refers to the dorsiflexion of the great toe with or without fanning of the other toes and withdrawal of the leg , on plantar stimulation in patients with pyramidal tract dysfunction . The characteristic response is dorsiflexion of the great toe by recruitment of extensor hallucis longus ( EHL ) muscle . In most mammals the limbs are automatically retracted on painful stimulation as a defence reflex , which is more pronounced in hind limbs . Sherrington called it , the flexion reflex synergy , because activation of all muscles effected shortening of the limb ; the toe extensors forming part of this shortening synergy . Confusion has arisen from the application of the term extensor plantar response to a movement which forms part of a flexion synergy of the lower limbs . The toe ' extensors ' although named extensors by anatomists , are infact flexors in a physiological sense because their action is to shorten the limb and contract reflexly along with other flexor muscles . The Babinski sign may be a normal occurrence in the 1st year of life , due to a brisker flexion synergy , the toes being a part of it . As the nervous system matures and the pyramidal tract gains more control over spinal motor neurons , the flexion synergy becomes less brisk and toe ' extensors ' are no longer a part of it . The toe then often goes down , instead of up , as a result of a segmental reflex involving the small foot muscles and the overlying skin . This is considered to be normal in adults and is termed - flexor plantar response . With lesions of the pyramidal system , structural or functional , this segmental downward response of the toes disappears , the flexion synergy may become disinhibited and the EHL muscle is again recruited into the flexion reflex of the leg producing the sign of ' Babinski ' . [ 7 ] The muscles taking part in a fully developed response include extensor hallucis longus , tibialis anterior , extensor digitorum longus , hamstring group of muscles and tensor faciae latae . The characteristic response is dorsiflexion ( extension ) of the [ big toe ] , which precedes all other movements . It is followed by fanning out and extension of the other toes , dorsiflexion of the ankle and flexion of the hip and knee joint . This response represents ' positive ' Babinski sign . There is no such thing as a ' negative ' Babinski sign . The role of pyramidal tract There seems to be a close association between occurrence of the Babinski sign and impairment of voluntary foot movement . A Babinski sign can appear only if the intraspinal pathways of the flexion reflex synergy are operative , however , severe the motor deficit in the foot . The function of the pyramidal tract may not only be disturbed by structural lesions of myelin sheaths , axons , or both , but also by nonneurological conditions [ Table I ] . The motor neurons of the leg muscles are laminated into separate columns within the anterior horn of the cord , each of which supply proximal or distal muscles , flexor or extensor muscles . In addition , there are important pyramidal tract projections to the intermediate ( interneuronal ) zone . This divergence of pyramidal tract projections allows the following two explanations for the Babinski sign . The Babinski sign might be released by dysfunction of pyramidal tract fibres that project on interneuronal zone , at least on those interneurons that subserve the flexion reflex synergy , of which the Babinski sign is a part . As these interneurons are necessarily interconnected across the segments of the lumbosacral spinal cord , a Babinski sign would always be Types of Babinski sign a) Minimal Babinski sign : Contraction of hamstring muscles and tensor faciae latae . b) True Babinski sign : Includes all the components of the fully developed extensor plantar reflex . c) Pseudo Babinski sign : One may encounter this type of response in sensitive individuals , plantar hyperaesthesia , and choreo-athetosis due to hyperkinesis . True Babinski can be clinically distinguished from the false Babinski by the contraction of hamstring muscles in the former , and failure to inhibit the extensor response by pressure over the base of the great toe . d) Exaggerated Babinski sign : It can either be in the form of ' flexor spasm ' or ' extensor spasm ' , depending upon the muscles i.e. whether flexors or extensors , have excess of tone . Flexor spasms occur in spinal cord disease , bilateral upper motor neuron lesion at a supraspinal level , multiple sclerosis and subacute combined degeneration of the cord , while ' extensor spasm ' occurs in patients with corticospinal tract lesion when the posterior column function is normal . e) Inversion of plantar reflex : If the short flexors of the toe are paralysed or flexor tendons are severed accidentally , an extensor response may be obtained . f) Tonic Babinski reflex : Characterised by slow prolonged contraction of extensors of toe , seen in frontal lobe lesions and extrapyramidal involvement . g) Crossed extensor response / bilateral Babinski sign : Unilateral stimulation produces bilateral Babinski in patients with bilateral cerebral disease and spinal cord disease . h) Spontaneous Babinski : In infants and children following manipulation of the foot , and in patients with extensive pyramidal tract diseases , passive extension of the knee or passive flexion of the hip and the knee , may produce a positive Babinski sign . The art of elicitation The reflexogenic area for the plantar reflex is the first sacral ( S1 ) dermatome with the receptor nerve endings being located in the skin . The afferent nerve is the tibial nerve , the spinal cord segments involved in the reflex arc being 4th and 5th lumbar and 1st and 2nd sacral .

So slip on your headphones , fall in love and check out my interview with Bear : NL : Clearly , Yellow House is very different from Horn of Plenty . What are the big changes in play ? CB : The biggest change is that we actually became a band . Chris T. , Daniel , and I basically came into Grizzly Bear after Horn of Plenty was already finished . I helped Ed tie up some loose ends with Horn of Plenty , but that record was pretty much all him . Getting together the band for the live show changed things quite a bit , in terms of dynamics and instrumentation used . The songs were quite simple and open ended so it left a lot of room for interpretation , which was great because it allowed us to get a band sound happening and working a very reactionary level . Then Yellow House changed even more because we were working with new songs and reacting in different ways . A lot of the songs are composed by Daniel and the way that he writes brings out another side of how the band interacts . In general , having four people with different ideas and strengths has changed our sound the most . NL : You seem to enjoy self - producing in houses versus the studio route . You even go so far as to celebrate that fact with your new album title . What 's the advantage of recording in a house and doing production yourselves ? CB : I think the biggest advantage is just flexibility ... being able to work at any time of the day and not be dependent on studio hours . A lot of the stuff we 'd end up recording was really late at night after voices had really warmed up or after properly loosening up at our religious cocktail hour . Also , self - producing makes it a little more comfortable to try things out and toy with different sounds for a long time . After the initial basic tracking month , a lot of things were added individually by everyone and a lot of those sounds were very time intensive . I could n't imagine doing some of those things with everyone around or feeling like you 're on the clock at a studio . NL : Why the remix CD for Horn of Plenty ? Can we expect something similar for Yellow House ? Are you planning on doing any more remixes for other artists ? CB : The remixes for HOP started because Kanine was going to rerelease the album with better distribution but need some sort of \" bonus \" to make it happen . It was kind of Ed 's pet project . He basically just emailed a lot of people and luckily most of them were down to do it . Everyone was very gracious for participating . I do n't think the same will happen for Yellow House ... at least to level that it did for HOP , not every song , but there are some in the works . Chris T. and I did a remix for Of Montreal , and that was really fun . I 'd be interested in doing some more . It is a fun way to think about music . NL : Did any of the Horn of Plenty remixes affect your sound either live or recorded ? CB : Hmm .... I do n't think we 've necessarily changed our songs as a result of any of the remixes . But Final Fantasy did some strings on Yellow House as a result of the relationship we developed through the remix project . NL : A lot of major blogs have really gotten behind the new album and you yourselves have a pretty great blog promoting music you like . How much effect do you think music blogs have on getting the word out ? CB : Blogs and the Internet in general are incredibly effective in terms of getting your music out there . It 's kind of scary how quickly some bands come out of nowhere and blow up , primarily from gathering buzz on the Internet . But I 'm very happy with the response and that people are excited about the music we make . NL : Yellow House has lately supplanted Kid A as my go -to album for night driving . What activities do you suggest pairing your music to ? CB : Oh wow ... Replacing Kid A is pretty epic -- that is a pretty great night drive album . I guess Yellow House works as a nighttime album . For some reason , I sort of associate it with chips , salsa and cocktails , late afternoon ... but that has very little to do with the music . That was just ritual during the first month we started the record . NL : Speaking of activities , I read about a laser light show you did in Seattle ? What was that like ? CB : Man ... that was totally amazing . Probably one of the coolest places we 've ever played . I just wish we could have watched the whole show ... but it was hard to look up at the ceiling the whole time . Everyone said the laser technician did a great job working with the music . NL : Horn of Plenty seemed very much like a breakup album , a heartbreak album . Does Yellow House have any similar overarching motivations ? CB : I do n't think so ... Personally , I feel like we were all just learning to play and interact with each other . NL : If Chris T. could cut anyone 's hair , who would he pick ? CB : He said Andy Warhol .... he 's always had pretty awesome hair . NL : What is your favorite trend or development in music as of late ? CB : Screwed and chopped shit . NL : I 've never seen you in concert before , but I 'll be there on Sept. 29th at The Independent . What can I expect from the Grizzly Bear live experience ? CB : Well , it is very different from the first album . Any songs we play from Horn of Plenty will sound totally different ... much more dynamic and fleshed out . A lot of the things from Yellow House are have changed in the live show too ... we just worked out a live version of \" Little Brother \" that is more stone groove / classic rock song . NL : Is there a tangible difference between American audiences and international ones ? Where would you most like to play that you have n't played yet ? CB : I think international audiences are more curious perhaps . People are more likely to come up , introduce themselves , and ask questions or just talk about what they thought of the music . Also , more people want autographs internationally which is funny to me . I 'd really love to play in Brazil and Australia some day . NL : Rave about three artists or albums from 2006 everyone should check out . CB : Dirty Projectors - I know he has been around for a while , but I discovered his music in 2006 . I liked what I had heard before , but then we played with him in Canada and I was sold . His live show was incredible . I love how ambitious his music is , yet at the same time it is totally palatable and poppy . His choice of instruments , arrangements , voice , melodies .... all totally incredible and inspirational . [ Ed. note -- Dirty Projectors are opening for Grizzly Bear at the Bowery Ballroom on September 26th . A good chance to catch them both . ] Wyrd Visions - I had never heard them until the first show of a Canadian tour we did with them and Final Fantasy . Colin [ Bergh ] has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard ... pure , delicate and unaffected . It 's kind of like Chet Baker if he made dark , nordic folky music . Danava - I think their music is finally going to be properly released by Kemado soon . These dudes from Portland are so serious . I 'm not really that much of a metalhead , but they are amazing . Kind of Black Sabbath / T. Rex but more acid metal like Hawkwind or something . I got to see them live and it was so great . One of the loudest shows i've ever seen , but I could n't bring myself to put earplugs in .

CB : I think the biggest advantage is just flexibility ... being able to work at any time of the day and not be dependent on studio hours . A lot of the stuff we 'd end up recording was really late at night after voices had really warmed up or after properly loosening up at our religious cocktail hour . Also , self - producing makes it a little more comfortable to try things out and toy with different sounds for a long time . After the initial basic tracking month , a lot of things were added individually by everyone and a lot of those sounds were very time intensive . I could n't imagine doing some of those things with everyone around or feeling like you 're on the clock at a studio . NL : Why the remix CD for Horn of Plenty ? Can we expect something similar for Yellow House ? Are you planning on doing any more remixes for other artists ? CB : The remixes for HOP started because Kanine was going to rerelease the album with better distribution but need some sort of \" bonus \" to make it happen . It was kind of Ed 's pet project . He basically just emailed a lot of people and luckily most of them were down to do it . Everyone was very gracious for participating . I do n't think the same will happen for Yellow House ... at least to level that it did for HOP , not every song , but there are some in the works . Chris T. and I did a remix for Of Montreal , and that was really fun . I 'd be interested in doing some more . It is a fun way to think about music . NL : Did any of the Horn of Plenty remixes affect your sound either live or recorded ? CB : Hmm .... I do n't think we 've necessarily changed our songs as a result of any of the remixes . But Final Fantasy did some strings on Yellow House as a result of the relationship we developed through the remix project . NL : A lot of major blogs have really gotten behind the new album and you yourselves have a pretty great blog promoting music you like . How much effect do you think music blogs have on getting the word out ? CB : Blogs and the Internet in general are incredibly effective in terms of getting your music out there . It 's kind of scary how quickly some bands come out of nowhere and blow up , primarily from gathering buzz on the Internet . But I 'm very happy with the response and that people are excited about the music we make . NL : Yellow House has lately supplanted Kid A as my go -to album for night driving . What activities do you suggest pairing your music to ? CB : Oh wow ... Replacing Kid A is pretty epic -- that is a pretty great night drive album . I guess Yellow House works as a nighttime album . For some reason , I sort of associate it with chips , salsa and cocktails , late afternoon ... but that has very little to do with the music . That was just ritual during the first month we started the record . NL : Speaking of activities , I read about a laser light show you did in Seattle ? What was that like ? CB : Man ... that was totally amazing . Probably one of the coolest places we 've ever played . I just wish we could have watched the whole show ... but it was hard to look up at the ceiling the whole time . Everyone said the laser technician did a great job working with the music . NL : Horn of Plenty seemed very much like a breakup album , a heartbreak album . Does Yellow House have any similar overarching motivations ? CB : I do n't think so ... Personally , I feel like we were all just learning to play and interact with each other . NL : If Chris T. could cut anyone 's hair , who would he pick ? CB : He said Andy Warhol .... he 's always had pretty awesome hair . NL : What is your favorite trend or development in music as of late ? CB : Screwed and chopped shit . NL : I 've never seen you in concert before , but I 'll be there on Sept. 29th at The Independent . What can I expect from the Grizzly Bear live experience ? CB : Well , it is very different from the first album . Any songs we play from Horn of Plenty will sound totally different ... much more dynamic and fleshed out . A lot of the things from Yellow House are have changed in the live show too ... we just worked out a live version of \" Little Brother \" that is more stone groove / classic rock song . NL : Is there a tangible difference between American audiences and international ones ? Where would you most like to play that you have n't played yet ? CB : I think international audiences are more curious perhaps . People are more likely to come up , introduce themselves , and ask questions or just talk about what they thought of the music . Also , more people want autographs internationally which is funny to me . I 'd really love to play in Brazil and Australia some day . NL : Rave about three artists or albums from 2006 everyone should check out . CB : Dirty Projectors - I know he has been around for a while , but I discovered his music in 2006 . I liked what I had heard before , but then we played with him in Canada and I was sold . His live show was incredible . I love how ambitious his music is , yet at the same time it is totally palatable and poppy . His choice of instruments , arrangements , voice , melodies .... all totally incredible and inspirational . [ Ed. note -- Dirty Projectors are opening for Grizzly Bear at the Bowery Ballroom on September 26th . A good chance to catch them both . ] Wyrd Visions - I had never heard them until the first show of a Canadian tour we did with them and Final Fantasy . Colin [ Bergh ] has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard ... pure , delicate and unaffected . It 's kind of like Chet Baker if he made dark , nordic folky music . Danava - I think their music is finally going to be properly released by Kemado soon . These dudes from Portland are so serious . I 'm not really that much of a metalhead , but they are amazing . Kind of Black Sabbath / T. Rex but more acid metal like Hawkwind or something . I got to see them live and it was so great . One of the loudest shows i've ever seen , but I could n't bring myself to put earplugs in .

Syedna Dawood Bin Ajabshah ( R.A. ) 975-999 A.H. : Syedna was molested by Muzaffarshah in Ahmedabad . He looted mumenins and tyranissed them in every way . Due to his tyranny Syedna went to kapadwanj . Muzzafarshah was then defeated by Akbar . So he fled from Ahmedabad to Kapadwanj . There he was welcomed by syedna 's representatives Sh. Kazikhan and Khoj bin malak . Syedna did not think of avenging the cruelties of Muzzafarshah in latter 's plight . Later syedna invited Muzaffershah and his troops to his home and latter repented for his misdeeds . After appointing Mirjahan as his deputy Akbar returned to lahore . But mirjahan also molested mumenins for not consuming drugs ( Ganja and Bhang ) . He was also a tyrant and was instigated by Mohammed bin Taher Nehrwala . In Baroda also Akbar 's deputy Moh. khan troubled mumenins much . Salahuddin of baroda killed Syedi Moosanji Tajsaheb on backbitings of foes . They were trying to arrest Syedna . Thereafter Syedna came to Cambay ( Khambhat ) . There Syedna was presented Shawls by the deputy of Akbar , khan Azam . He instructed his representatives to respect Syedna . Syedna 's spirituality attracted every one including Kings and rich people of the city of Cambay . Syedna Dawood Bin Qutubshah ( RA ) 999-1021A. H. : Syedna Dawood bin Qutubshah ( RA ) also passed the difficult period with the rulers . In his time Shahmurad the prince of Akbar came to Ahmedabad as Governor . Representatives of Suleman went to him and bribed him . They claimed Rs. 16 lakhs of rupees from Syedna . This caused the arrest of learned and virtous persons Miya Shaikh Adam and Miya Ali Mohammed for forty days . At that time Sadiq Mohammed the vazir of the emperor helped Syedna in many ways . When Shah Murad came to know about about the reality , he ordered to give up charges of arrest . After some days Shah murad released the pious persons with all their due repsects . Suleman refused to accept Syedna as a Dai . However a big file of letters was revealed in which suleman had accepted Syedna as Dai . On the basis of this file the documents were prepared to support Syedna . These documents were signed by Vazir Sadiq Muhammed , Qazi jan Muhammed Sakaki , Amir Kabir , Shah Abu Turab and others . When turk of vazir came to know about the artocities of Suleman , he arrested suleman in the fort of zamamar and asked him to pay a bail of Rs.80,000 . Suleman did not pay and escaped to India . Syed Qasim again arrested Maula Ali Mohammed and Maula Shaikh Adam . When Begum of Shah Murad in Bharuch knew the matter she immediately ordered the release of Maula shaikh Ali Mohammed and Maula Shaikh Adam . She ordered the arrest of Suleman and Ibrahim . Suleman and Ibrahim reached lahore after their release and backbited Ahdi Kamal Khan , one of the darbaris of Akbar . This caused the arrest of six pious persons including Maula Ali Mohammed and Maula Shaikh Adam . After arresting them Kamal Khan came to Ahmedabad to arrest Syedna . He troubled the mumenins of Ahmedabad a lot . He looted the Mohallas of mumenins . In lahore six pious persons were under the tyranny of Osman , brother - in - law of Kamal Khan . When vazir fathulla khachki knew about the arrest , he immediately ordered to release them . After tyrannising in Ahmedabad kamal khan returned to Lahore with all looted property . Due to tyranny 27,000 mumenins of Ahmedabad scattered and resided in remote parts . When the emperor was informed of tyranny and loot , he ordered Aamir kabir raja ramdas to arrest him before entering lahore . He was then arrested and presented in Darbar . Saiyedi Shaikh Adam was also presented with him in the Darbar . After hearing the sufferings mumenins had from Kamalkhan the emperor ordered rigorous imprisonment for kamalkhan . In 1005 A.H. Syedna Dawood Bin Qutubshah , having been summoned by emperor Akbar to appear at the court , he besought maula shaikh Adam , Maula Ali Mohammed , Maula Mamuji and Maulana Khanji . through Hakim Ali. Maula Shaikh Adam replied that \" Though Syedna was in seclusion since four years but they should try their best to convey him the bounties of emperor \" . The emperor granted khilat to four pious persons and a shawl to Syedna . When Syedna reached Lahore , the emperor was in Kashmir . In emperor 's absence Hakim Ali received Syedna in Lahore and escorted him to the court of Kashmir in a state silver palanquin . The emperor received him with great respect . Syedna was given a high seat in the darbar . According to his habit Syedna recited Quran - Sharif daily in the darbar of emperor . The emperor was so influenced by the spirituality of Syedna that he would gaze at him for hours . Syedna stayed in kashmir as a respected guest of emperor . All nobles especially Abul Fazal , Hakim Ali and Khan Azam gave due respect to syedna . Syedna came to Lahore from Kashmir and thereafter he returned to Ahmedabad under the protection of the emperor with Royal Farman , ordering the officials at Ahmedabad to show him every attention and to receive him wherever he went with respect on account of his great learning , virtue and piety . The emperor granted the following farman in syedna 's honour . This farman is written by vazir Abdul Fazal in golden letters . Emperor Akbar 's farman : Allaho-akbar . This glorious farman is issued graciously to satisfy the wishes of sardar of Dawoodi Bohras after considering and calling him to our darbar so that the deputies of Gujarat especially authorities of Ahmedabad and Sidhpur and areas in connection to them , not obstruct them in their ways and let them come to us according to their will . And ( the auhorities ) should not object them and his followers especially in their religious traditions , systems and taxes and about prohibited things and they should return their properties which are sealed , afer removing the seals giving them back . Not to restrict them from any business or occupation they are willing . They should give facilities to them and authorities should not be covetous for any thing . They should return all the properties which are seized because in near future their case is to be taken under consideration . Karories , Jagirdars and all responsible Mutasaddirs of Gujarat are required to extend all facilities to the mentioned pious persons while passing through their territories . If he wants any guide then provide him with it for safety against robbery and all dangers of the way so that they may reach to their safe place . To respect them must be considered a duty . 1st Rabiul - Awwal 1005 A.D. Capitol Lahore . Along with this farman Syedna was presented with valuable khilas and a horse . The farman was renewed by Jahangir in 1099 A.H. After these events contacts with Hakim of Ahmedabad harmonised . But soon Shadman came to Ahmedabad as new Hakim . He was not good with Syedna . Thereafter Syedna left Ahmedabad . When Jahangir knew about it , he removed him and Shaikh farid came to Ahmedabad . Syedna already had good relations with Shaikh farid . Shaikh farid earnestly requested syedna to return to Ahmedabad . Thereafter Syedna returned to Ahmedabad and was respected by high authorities throughout rest of his life . Syedna Abdul Taiyab Zakiuddin ( R.A ) 1030 - 1041 A.H. : During the reign of Syedna Abdul Taiyed Zakiuddin , son of Syedna Dawood bin Qutubshah , Ali bin Ibrahim turned astray . He went to Jahangir 's darbar and complained that he was excommunicated by syedna and was very much molested by his enemies creating great disturbance in Ahmedabad and preferring several vexation complaints against him at the court of Jahangir . The ministers of the darbar opined that reconcillations should be brought between Syedna and his enemies ( Ali bin Ibrahim ) . Syedna was invited by the emperor to his court , where he stayed for some period and was treated with great honour andrespect . Ali bin Ibrahim begged pardon of syedna through emperor 's recommendation . Syedna pardoned Ali bin Ibrahim for his deeds . Syedna Qasim Khan Bin Feerkhan 1042-1054 A.H. : Syedna was grandson of Syedi Hasan peer shahid who had solved the difficulty of sultan peeram shah about an Aayat of Quran . During this period there were no disastorous events but the period was not completely quiet . The jealous groups were unsatisfied by the civilised approach of Akbar and Jahangir but they were compelled to obey the directions of these emperors . The explosion of these jealousy took place in the reign of Syedna Qutub khan Qutbuddin , son of Syedna Dawood bin Qutubshah to whom Akbar and Jahangir had granted glorious farmans . Syedna Qutbuddin Shahid 1054-1056 A.H. : During the reign of Syedna Qutbuddin Shahid Aurangzeb came to Ahmedabad . Abdul Gavi a staunch Sunni backbited Aurangzeb and caused the arrest of Syedna . Gavi argued that Syedna was Rafzi ( one who do not obey Rasulullah 's Sunnah ) and therefore his blood is legal . Though shahbeg the kutuwal was not tyrant but was bound to follow the orders of Gavi . He carried away six big carriages of books to see whether there was anything to prove Rafzi . He imprisoned Syedna Qutbuddin Shahid , his sucessor Syedna Fir Khan Shujauddin and two other mumenins . Syedna suffered a rigourous prison for about a month . He was then invited to Aurangzeb 's darbar for clarification . Syedna declared that they are the true followers of Rasullullah and his sunnah . All present darbaris were greatly impressed by Syedna 's speech . Abdul Gavi a staunch sunni was not ready to release a pious shia . He prepared a false mehdara blaming syedna as Rafzi . Qazi refused to attest the mehdara without witness . Abdul Gavi persuaded two innocent children from Syedna 's family and presented before Qazi as witness . Qazi signed the mehdara unwillingly . The document for Syedna 's execution was prepared . On the 27th of Jamadil - Ukhra in 1056 A.H. Syedna was slained by the tyrants . His corpse were not given to mumenin to bury . But by a miracle they were able to carry it under the sentry . After this martyrdom there was a open slaughter of mumenins on streets of Ahmedabad . Tyrant Auangzeb ordered to expell the momenins , the followers of Syedna from city . This was the second plight after the plight of tyranny of kamalkhan . A glorious mausoleum is erected over his tomb by Syedna Taher Saifuddin Saheb in Ahmedabad . Syedna Feer Khan Shujauddin 1056 - 1065 A.H. : He was kept in captivity by the bigoted prince Aurangzeb and was taken by him to Aurangabad after being removed by emperor shahjahan from Gujarat to the Deccan on account of his cruel oppression . Thereafter in Lahore Syedna was placed in stable , which on the following night happened to catch fire and was totally destroyed except the dungeon , where in Syedna passed the night and prayed to Almighty and was found quite safe in the morning . All people held that the conflagration was the consequence of the curse the prince had brought upon himself by keeping his holiness in captivity . By an imperial order Aurangzeb was compelled to set Syedna at liberty and grant him a safe and honourable return to Ahmedabad . He reached Ahmedabad after two years of Shahdat in themonth of Ramazan . Gheratkhan was then Hakim of Ahmedabad . Again Gherat Khan was backbited . He arrested Syedna and demanded Rs. 3 lakhs . Syedna was again imprisoned and was released after the 6 months . In 1066 A.H. Shahmurad came to Ahmedabad and arrested Syedna . Thus after Shahdat of Maulana Qutbuddin Shahid R.A. , Syedna Shujauddin suffered much for the sake of the divine mission of the khidmat of Imamuz -zaman . On one side Syedna was suffering and on the other Hakims were compelling mumenins to Shave their beards , to intoxicate and to use bangles and ornaments made of ivory . One may remind the circumstances during and after shahdat of Imam Hussain ( S.A. ) in Karbala after Rasulullah ( S.A. ) Syedna Abdul Taiyeb Zakiuddin ( R.A. ) 1085 - 1110 A.H. : On request of Mumenins Syedna arrived in Ahmedabad . He was again persecuted by the deputies of Aurangzeb acting in collusion with his enemies . Kar Talib khan , who was then Hakim tried to arrest Syedna coveting wealth . But Syedna secretly went away to Jamnagar . In Jamnagar Jam Tamanjee gave refugee to Syedna accepting the imprisonment of his two sons laka and bhaba . During the same period Maulana Najam Khan , Maulana Abdul Vahid , Maulana Hassan Khan , Maulana Tayeb Khan and many other pious persons were led in captivity to the court of Aurangzeb at Aurangabad . They were released after undergoing severe hardships .","annotations":[{"text":"Syedna","span":[4944,4949],"token_span":[905,905],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The Theme is the entity that changes location.

Suleman and Ibrahim reached lahore after their release and backbited Ahdi Kamal Khan , one of the darbaris of Akbar . This caused the arrest of six pious persons including Maula Ali Mohammed and Maula Shaikh Adam . After arresting them Kamal Khan came to Ahmedabad to arrest Syedna . He troubled the mumenins of Ahmedabad a lot . He looted the Mohallas of mumenins . In lahore six pious persons were under the tyranny of Osman , brother - in - law of Kamal Khan . When vazir fathulla khachki knew about the arrest , he immediately ordered to release them . After tyrannising in Ahmedabad kamal khan returned to Lahore with all looted property . Due to tyranny 27,000 mumenins of Ahmedabad scattered and resided in remote parts . When the emperor was informed of tyranny and loot , he ordered Aamir kabir raja ramdas to arrest him before entering lahore . He was then arrested and presented in Darbar . Saiyedi Shaikh Adam was also presented with him in the Darbar . After hearing the sufferings mumenins had from Kamalkhan the emperor ordered rigorous imprisonment for kamalkhan . In 1005 A.H. Syedna Dawood Bin Qutubshah , having been summoned by emperor Akbar to appear at the court , he besought maula shaikh Adam , Maula Ali Mohammed , Maula Mamuji and Maulana Khanji . through Hakim Ali. Maula Shaikh Adam replied that \" Though Syedna was in seclusion since four years but they should try their best to convey him the bounties of emperor \" . The emperor granted khilat to four pious persons and a shawl to Syedna . When Syedna reached Lahore , the emperor was in Kashmir . In emperor 's absence Hakim Ali received Syedna in Lahore and escorted him to the court of Kashmir in a state silver palanquin . The emperor received him with great respect . Syedna was given a high seat in the darbar . According to his habit Syedna recited Quran - Sharif daily in the darbar of emperor . The emperor was so influenced by the spirituality of Syedna that he would gaze at him for hours . Syedna stayed in kashmir as a respected guest of emperor . All nobles especially Abul Fazal , Hakim Ali and Khan Azam gave due respect to syedna . Syedna came to Lahore from Kashmir and thereafter he returned to Ahmedabad under the protection of the emperor with Royal Farman , ordering the officials at Ahmedabad to show him every attention and to receive him wherever he went with respect on account of his great learning , virtue and piety . The emperor granted the following farman in syedna 's honour . This farman is written by vazir Abdul Fazal in golden letters . Emperor Akbar 's farman : Allaho-akbar . This glorious farman is issued graciously to satisfy the wishes of sardar of Dawoodi Bohras after considering and calling him to our darbar so that the deputies of Gujarat especially authorities of Ahmedabad and Sidhpur and areas in connection to them , not obstruct them in their ways and let them come to us according to their will . And ( the auhorities ) should not object them and his followers especially in their religious traditions , systems and taxes and about prohibited things and they should return their properties which are sealed , afer removing the seals giving them back . Not to restrict them from any business or occupation they are willing . They should give facilities to them and authorities should not be covetous for any thing . They should return all the properties which are seized because in near future their case is to be taken under consideration . Karories , Jagirdars and all responsible Mutasaddirs of Gujarat are required to extend all facilities to the mentioned pious persons while passing through their territories . If he wants any guide then provide him with it for safety against robbery and all dangers of the way so that they may reach to their safe place . To respect them must be considered a duty . 1st Rabiul - Awwal 1005 A.D. Capitol Lahore . Along with this farman Syedna was presented with valuable khilas and a horse . The farman was renewed by Jahangir in 1099 A.H. After these events contacts with Hakim of Ahmedabad harmonised . But soon Shadman came to Ahmedabad as new Hakim . He was not good with Syedna . Thereafter Syedna left Ahmedabad . When Jahangir knew about it , he removed him and Shaikh farid came to Ahmedabad . Syedna already had good relations with Shaikh farid . Shaikh farid earnestly requested syedna to return to Ahmedabad . Thereafter Syedna returned to Ahmedabad and was respected by high authorities throughout rest of his life . Syedna Abdul Taiyab Zakiuddin ( R.A ) 1030 - 1041 A.H. : During the reign of Syedna Abdul Taiyed Zakiuddin , son of Syedna Dawood bin Qutubshah , Ali bin Ibrahim turned astray . He went to Jahangir 's darbar and complained that he was excommunicated by syedna and was very much molested by his enemies creating great disturbance in Ahmedabad and preferring several vexation complaints against him at the court of Jahangir . The ministers of the darbar opined that reconcillations should be brought between Syedna and his enemies ( Ali bin Ibrahim ) . Syedna was invited by the emperor to his court , where he stayed for some period and was treated with great honour andrespect . Ali bin Ibrahim begged pardon of syedna through emperor 's recommendation . Syedna pardoned Ali bin Ibrahim for his deeds . Syedna Qasim Khan Bin Feerkhan 1042-1054 A.H. : Syedna was grandson of Syedi Hasan peer shahid who had solved the difficulty of sultan peeram shah about an Aayat of Quran . During this period there were no disastorous events but the period was not completely quiet . The jealous groups were unsatisfied by the civilised approach of Akbar and Jahangir but they were compelled to obey the directions of these emperors . The explosion of these jealousy took place in the reign of Syedna Qutub khan Qutbuddin , son of Syedna Dawood bin Qutubshah to whom Akbar and Jahangir had granted glorious farmans . Syedna Qutbuddin Shahid 1054-1056 A.H. : During the reign of Syedna Qutbuddin Shahid Aurangzeb came to Ahmedabad . Abdul Gavi a staunch Sunni backbited Aurangzeb and caused the arrest of Syedna . Gavi argued that Syedna was Rafzi ( one who do not obey Rasulullah 's Sunnah ) and therefore his blood is legal . Though shahbeg the kutuwal was not tyrant but was bound to follow the orders of Gavi . He carried away six big carriages of books to see whether there was anything to prove Rafzi . He imprisoned Syedna Qutbuddin Shahid , his sucessor Syedna Fir Khan Shujauddin and two other mumenins . Syedna suffered a rigourous prison for about a month . He was then invited to Aurangzeb 's darbar for clarification . Syedna declared that they are the true followers of Rasullullah and his sunnah . All present darbaris were greatly impressed by Syedna 's speech . Abdul Gavi a staunch sunni was not ready to release a pious shia . He prepared a false mehdara blaming syedna as Rafzi . Qazi refused to attest the mehdara without witness . Abdul Gavi persuaded two innocent children from Syedna 's family and presented before Qazi as witness . Qazi signed the mehdara unwillingly . The document for Syedna 's execution was prepared . On the 27th of Jamadil - Ukhra in 1056 A.H. Syedna was slained by the tyrants . His corpse were not given to mumenin to bury . But by a miracle they were able to carry it under the sentry . After this martyrdom there was a open slaughter of mumenins on streets of Ahmedabad . Tyrant Auangzeb ordered to expell the momenins , the followers of Syedna from city . This was the second plight after the plight of tyranny of kamalkhan . A glorious mausoleum is erected over his tomb by Syedna Taher Saifuddin Saheb in Ahmedabad . Syedna Feer Khan Shujauddin 1056 - 1065 A.H. : He was kept in captivity by the bigoted prince Aurangzeb and was taken by him to Aurangabad after being removed by emperor shahjahan from Gujarat to the Deccan on account of his cruel oppression . Thereafter in Lahore Syedna was placed in stable , which on the following night happened to catch fire and was totally destroyed except the dungeon , where in Syedna passed the night and prayed to Almighty and was found quite safe in the morning . All people held that the conflagration was the consequence of the curse the prince had brought upon himself by keeping his holiness in captivity . By an imperial order Aurangzeb was compelled to set Syedna at liberty and grant him a safe and honourable return to Ahmedabad . He reached Ahmedabad after two years of Shahdat in themonth of Ramazan . Gheratkhan was then Hakim of Ahmedabad . Again Gherat Khan was backbited . He arrested Syedna and demanded Rs. 3 lakhs . Syedna was again imprisoned and was released after the 6 months . In 1066 A.H. Shahmurad came to Ahmedabad and arrested Syedna . Thus after Shahdat of Maulana Qutbuddin Shahid R.A. , Syedna Shujauddin suffered much for the sake of the divine mission of the khidmat of Imamuz -zaman . On one side Syedna was suffering and on the other Hakims were compelling mumenins to Shave their beards , to intoxicate and to use bangles and ornaments made of ivory . One may remind the circumstances during and after shahdat of Imam Hussain ( S.A. ) in Karbala after Rasulullah ( S.A. ) Syedna Abdul Taiyeb Zakiuddin ( R.A. ) 1085 - 1110 A.H. : On request of Mumenins Syedna arrived in Ahmedabad . He was again persecuted by the deputies of Aurangzeb acting in collusion with his enemies . Kar Talib khan , who was then Hakim tried to arrest Syedna coveting wealth . But Syedna secretly went away to Jamnagar . In Jamnagar Jam Tamanjee gave refugee to Syedna accepting the imprisonment of his two sons laka and bhaba . During the same period Maulana Najam Khan , Maulana Abdul Vahid , Maulana Hassan Khan , Maulana Tayeb Khan and many other pious persons were led in captivity to the court of Aurangzeb at Aurangabad . They were released after undergoing severe hardships .","annotations":[{"text":"Syedna","span":[4944,4949],"token_span":[905,905],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"The Theme is the entity that changes location.

Recent space missions then suggested that the southern ice cap , existing all year round , could be a mixture of water and carbon dioxide . But only with Mars Express have scientists been able to confirm directly for the first time that water ice is present at the south pole too . Mars Express made observations with its OMEGA instrument to measure the amounts of sunlight and heat reflected from the Martian polar region . When planetary scientists analysed the data , it clearly showed that , as well as carbon dioxide ice , water ice was present too . The results showed that hundreds of square kilometres of ' permafrost ' surround the south pole . Permafrost is water ice , mixed into the soil of Mars , and frozen to the hardness of solid rock by the low Martian temperatures .

The move has come after a succession of financial problems , in particular the failed implementation of a new SAP computer system in October 2008 , the effects of which were exacerbated by the economic downturn . These have caused significant cash flow pressures , excess stock , and supply chain and service difficulties in its distribution and retail units . They have culminated in the decision to exit the business . IBS - STL UK convened an emergency task force led by Global President of Biblica and former CEO of STL , Keith Danby , which has been in constant dialogue with its suppliers and bankers . It had also engaged restructuring and business process consultants in an attempt to resolve the systems and financial challenges . Danby said : \u201c Given the severe financial and operational strains we have experienced , the Board of Trustees and management team believe a sale or exit from all or parts of certain operations is a prudent and necessary step . Whilst a difficult decision , we are focused on finding a solution to continue the important work of IBS - STL UK , to secure the jobs of the 490 people employed in our ministry , and to fulfill our financial obligations to our suppliers and creditors . We are working diligently and praying vigilantly for a successful outcome . \u201d The corporate finance division of Baker Tilly is actively marketing the operations of the charity to a number of interested parties and is hopeful it will complete negotiations for the sales or potential closures within the next few weeks .

The move has come after a succession of financial problems , in particular the failed implementation of a new SAP computer system in October 2008 , the effects of which were exacerbated by the economic downturn . These have caused significant cash flow pressures , excess stock , and supply chain and service difficulties in its distribution and retail units . They have culminated in the decision to exit the business . IBS - STL UK convened an emergency task force led by Global President of Biblica and former CEO of STL , Keith Danby , which has been in constant dialogue with its suppliers and bankers . It had also engaged restructuring and business process consultants in an attempt to resolve the systems and financial challenges . Danby said : \u201c Given the severe financial and operational strains we have experienced , the Board of Trustees and management team believe a sale or exit from all or parts of certain operations is a prudent and necessary step . Whilst a difficult decision , we are focused on finding a solution to continue the important work of IBS - STL UK , to secure the jobs of the 490 people employed in our ministry , and to fulfill our financial obligations to our suppliers and creditors . We are working diligently and praying vigilantly for a successful outcome . \u201d The corporate finance division of Baker Tilly is actively marketing the operations of the charity to a number of interested parties and is hopeful it will complete negotiations for the sales or potential closures within the next few weeks . IBS - STL UK was founded in 1962 and has grown to become a major UK charity . IBS - STL UK has three trading divisions ; Authentic Media , a book and music publisher ; STL Distribution , a distributor of Christian resources and Wesley Owen Books and Music , a retailer with 40 shops in the UK . IBS - STL UK is part of Biblica , a global Bible translation , publishing , distribution and outreach ministry serving more than 100 countries with books , Bibles and other Christian resources . Biblica said the planned sale of the UK operations will not impact its other global operations and donor funds supporting Biblica 's worldwide outreach ministries will not be affected . Michael Fitch , Chairman of the IBS - STL UK Board of Trustees , concluded : \u201c We continue to believe strongly in the power of God 's Word and Christian resources to change peoples ' lives . We are praying that we can pass the torch on to other likeminded organisations so that our UK staff , suppliers and ministry partners can carry our work forward . \u201d - ENDS - Notes to Editors IBS - STL UK , formerly known as Send The Light , began operating as a literature distributor in the UK in 1962 and expanded into worldwide evangelism and church planting organisation Operation Mobilisation . STL merged with the International Bible Society ( IBS ) in 2007 to create a worldwide Christian ministry focusing on Bible Translation , book and Bible publishing , multi-channel distribution and outreach spanning five continents . IBS - STL UK operations include trade book publisher Authentic Media , retailer Wesley Owen Books & Music and Christian resource distributor STL Distribution .

Even now when one looks at the walls and buildings of the modern village it is hard not to feel some resentment when realising that parts of them were once components of something far more magnificent and so much diminished as a result . Situated within the Southern Inner Circle of the the henge is Avebury Chapel ...... Built during the 17th Century it is interesting to note that the religious superstitions of the medieval period must have dissipated considerably as the builders felt no qualms about using demolished megaliths in its construction . Richard Colt Hoare 's vision of how the henge originally appeared ( after William Stukeley ) A concrete plinth marks the location of a destroyed stone Although efforts to safeguard the monument started to be made in the 1870s it did n't become totally protected until Alexander Keiller became the owner of the site in the 1930s . Stones were broken up by heating with a fire and pouring water over them . Stukeley made a drawing of one such event . And this stupendous fabric , which for some thousands of years , had brav'd the continual assaults of weather , and by the nature of it , when left to itself , like the pyramids of Egypt , would have lasted as long as the globe , hath fallen a sacrifice to the wretched ignorance and avarice of a little village unluckily plac'd within it . William Stukeley William Stukeley produced a detailed plan of the henge on which he gives details showing the destruction dates of individual stones . This is a fascinating document to any serious student of Avebury 's history . It is divided it into 6 overlapping images . Each image is about 300 k so some patience is required on a slow connection . north west north centre north east south west south centre south east WILLIAM STUKELEY'S 1724 PLAN OF THE HENGE Richard Colt Hoare 's assessment of the surviving stones in 1815 reveals that the destruction continued unabated after William Stukeley had completed his survey .

Even now when one looks at the walls and buildings of the modern village it is hard not to feel some resentment when realising that parts of them were once components of something far more magnificent and so much diminished as a result . Situated within the Southern Inner Circle of the the henge is Avebury Chapel ...... Built during the 17th Century it is interesting to note that the religious superstitions of the medieval period must have dissipated considerably as the builders felt no qualms about using demolished megaliths in its construction . Richard Colt Hoare 's vision of how the henge originally appeared ( after William Stukeley ) A concrete plinth marks the location of a destroyed stone Although efforts to safeguard the monument started to be made in the 1870s it did n't become totally protected until Alexander Keiller became the owner of the site in the 1930s . Stones were broken up by heating with a fire and pouring water over them . Stukeley made a drawing of one such event . And this stupendous fabric , which for some thousands of years , had brav'd the continual assaults of weather , and by the nature of it , when left to itself , like the pyramids of Egypt , would have lasted as long as the globe , hath fallen a sacrifice to the wretched ignorance and avarice of a little village unluckily plac'd within it . William Stukeley William Stukeley produced a detailed plan of the henge on which he gives details showing the destruction dates of individual stones . This is a fascinating document to any serious student of Avebury 's history . It is divided it into 6 overlapping images . Each image is about 300 k so some patience is required on a slow connection . north west north centre north east south west south centre south east WILLIAM STUKELEY'S 1724 PLAN OF THE HENGE Richard Colt Hoare 's assessment of the surviving stones in 1815 reveals that the destruction continued unabated after William Stukeley had completed his survey .

The remains of the bath house of the fort , established in AD 130 , are among the tallest Roman structures surviving in northern Britain : the walls stand almost 4 metres ( 13 feet ) high . Domestic use of the building in the Middle Ages led to the substantial preservation of the site . The site lay in Muncaster Castle Park in the post-medieval period , and was described as ' the ancient dwelling place of the Penningtons ' by John Denton in 1610 . Excavations in the late nineteenth century and survey work in the 1980s indicated that the bath house was a substantial structure extending beyond the present field boundary , as well as to either side of the existing structures . At least two rooms contained under-floor hypocausts ( heating systems ) . The walls are of regularly coursed sandstone bonded with mortar and rendered internally with pink cement . One of the doorways has a worn threshold and a broad groove to receive a timber doorframe . There are also the remains of windows . The bath house was for use both by Roman soldiers and for civilians who lived in the settlement outside the fort , which extended over much of the present field .
