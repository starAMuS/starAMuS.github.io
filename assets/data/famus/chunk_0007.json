The King was Charles 11 , the battle was at Worcester and the enemy was the Parliamentary Army led by Cromwell . The imagination of Trevor Antill , our speaker at this meeting , was captured by the story of that desperate flight when he first heard it as a boy , especially as he was born not far from Bentley Hall , which had a part in it . An enthusiastic walker , Trevor kept coming into contact with places which also figured in the royal escape and eventually the idea of a long distance walk , following the route took shape and was put into action . The result , ten years later , was the Monarch 's Way , a 610 - mile footpath following as closely as possible the King 's epic journey from Worcester , through the Midlands and on to Bridport , then across the South Downs to Shoreham , where a boat was found to take him to France . Trevor 's talk , illustrated with slides , took us along the first 175 miles of this way-marked walk . Today the Monarch 's Way can be followed as a leisure activity but for Charles 11 it was a matter of life or death . The party seemed to have travelled a good deal on the main roads , which were rutted and potholed , and made slow going , there were no useful signposts and of reliable maps there were none . On a personal level Charles was not an easy man to disguise , he was well over six feet tall and had a dark , almost swarthy , complexion , so much so that his supporters referred to him as \" the Black Boy \" when the use of his name would have been indiscreet . With the Royal Army crumbling before Cromwell 's cavalry , Charles took the advice of his generals and fled the scene . With a small escort he left the Commandery and went into Worcester through the Sidbury Gate . The Commandery still stands but the Sidbury Gate is long gone and its place taken by a bridge over the Worcester and Birmingham Canal ; the Monarch 's Way also starts at this bridge and uses the canal towpath which is not quite the original line but near enough to it . Leaving through St. Martins Gate the fugitives headed north , mingling with Scottish cavalry streaming from the City until , realising that this was a dangerous tactic , they \" moved a little right \" , to quote an official account , and headed for Droitwich probably following what later became the line of the Droitwich canal , which after years of dereliction , is being restored and a slide showed some of the work being done . Droitwich however , was by passed by Charles and they went through Salwarpe , a one time royal manor once part of the marriage settlement of Catherine of Aragon . Whether they called at Salwarpe Court is doubtful but there is , preserved in the parish church archives , a letter from Charles commanding the men of Salwarpe to bring picks , shovels and spades to strengthen the defences at Worcester - did he remember that as he rode through ? Passing through Hampton Lovett they came , as does the Way , to Doverdale , where today 's travellers , unlike the fugitives , can pause to admire Doverdale Hall , built by one of the salt barons , and visit the church , amongst whose records is a bill for cleaning it up after Cromwell 's troops had used it for stabling . Charles and his escort had reached Chaddesley Corbett and night was failing when the trooper who was their guide admitted that he was lost An urgent discussion took place and at the suggestion of one of the Gifford family , who was in the party , decided to head for Boscobel House via Stourbridge and from there head for the Severn and so into Wales . The Giffords were Roman Catholics , accustomed to subterfuge and part of the network of similar families one of whom lived nearby in Harvington Hall . A slide of the Hall as it is today , shows a peaceful building in mellowed red brick with no hint of the perilous days of Catholic persecution , when the priest holes hid Jesuit fathers and raids by the Authorities could happen at any time . Trevor speculated that the Hall may have been the scene of the discussion or perhaps the family were asked to help . The Monarch 's Way of today uses field paths and lanes over this section which gives fine views across Worcestershire and the West Midlands and , with a local man as a guide , the royal party may have taken the same paths , but at night and with troopers all over the place , so scenic attractions were ignored and they pressed on to Stourbridge . How Charles 11 and his men found their way there is uncertain but Trevor used an A-Z guide when planning the Way , which goes through the steep sided Ham Dingle . The Stourbridge of 1661 was a small place but never the less dangerous , so , to fool any possible informers , curious about a mounted party riding through at night , they spoke loudly to each other in French . There must have been sound reasons for this action but today it smacks of \" a cunning plan \" by Baldrick of the Black Adder series : but it worked . Shortly after this the King stopped for beer and cheese at an inn , tradition says was in Wordesley , then pressed on through Stourton . It may be that their route followed what later became the line of the Staffs & Worcs Canal , whose towpath is part of the Way and takes the traveller to the picturesque Bratch Locks , which look well worth a visit . The King 's party , now guided by Richard Gifford , went through the hamlet of Wombourne ; heading north all the while , and in the small hours arrived at White Ladies Farm where the King and his horse were taken into the house by Richard Penderel . Great care was needed as a troop of Roundhead soldiers was based at nearby Codsall and Richard Penderel and the King spent some of the following day hidden in Spring Coppice as the troopers searched the district . As its name suggests White Ladies was once an Augustian nunnery , which became a farmhouse after the Dissolution and is now only a ruin . Nearby Hubbal Hall is in the same ruinous condition , but in 1651 it was the home of the Penderel family where the King and Richard Penderel broke their journey to Wales for a meal on the evening of the day following his arrival at White Ladies . They were heading for Wales where the pursuit might not be so hot and the two walked steadily through the night . They passed through Tong , as does the Way , but Trevor paused to tell us a little of the history of the place . Its church came under siege during the Civil War , after which Tong sank back to obscurity until Charles Dickens began his frequent visits to the village and , in The Old Curiosity Shop , used it as the setting for Little Nell 's death . So many Victorian visitors asked the verger to show them the grave of Nell that he gave way to temptation and made a fake one to which ( for a small fee ) he guided them . This early tourist scam came to light , however , when , seeking to increase his rake off , the verger forged an entry in the church register ; the grave is still there but now carries a plaque which tells the story of the errant , if enterprising , church official . Penderel and the King plodded through the night , their only incident being at Eveleth Mill where Penderel let a gate slam and raised the household . The pair ran on as fast as they could as the miller came to investigate but he made no attempt to follow them and they slowed down again ; later historians established that the miller was himself sheltering fugitives from Worcester , hence his lack of curiosity . Arriving at Madeley they enquired at the home of another Catholic , Francis Wolfe , who gave them the depressing news that the Severn was heavily guarded at all crossings and the banks were patrolled . Adding to that was the fact that they were on foot and that Richard Penderel could n't swim there was no alternative but to a return to Boscabel . Despite the personal risk Francis Wolfe sheltered them in his barn all day . That barn still exists and is a listed building and , as a slide showed , has recently been sensitively converted into dwellings . As night fell the two men set out on the return journey . They may well have passed the Hundred House at Norton but it seems unlikely that the King paid much attention to the surroundings : tired and footsore his spirits must have been at a low ebb when , in the small hours , Boscobel House was reached and he was hidden in the priests hole . Even that proved perilous : troopers arrived to search the house and the King had to be spirited away to spend the day in a nearby oak tree while they searched the grounds as well . Visitors today can see the offspring of the original \" royal oak \" to which , as we saw , recent high winds have caused severe damage ; a third generation replacement is at hand , however , despite the acorns that Prince Charles planted having died . English Heritage , who now own Boscobel House , have an unusual export trade in the sate of \" royal \" acorns to Japan . When the coast was clear the King ended his hugely famous sojourn in the branches and returned to Boscobel House . Here he found that the Penderel brothers had been out and about amongst their co-religionists and that Humphrey had spoken to Father Huddleston at Moseley Old Hall . The priest told him that Mistress Jane Lane of Bentley Hall was travelling to a relative in Bristol and had an official pass to cover her journey : a golden opportunity . That night the King , with the Penderel brothers , made a rendezvous at Pendeford Mill to meet his new guides , one of whom was Father Huddleston and made his way to Moseley Old Hall with its priest hole . During the day Charles saw from the window of the top room where he was hidden , a group of Scottish soldiers begging in the road and had to be restrained from going to help them ; he was the crowned king of Scotland and must have felt some responsibility for their plight . The short journey to Bentley Hall was made that night . The Hall to which Charles made his way was re-built two or three times in the following centuries and finally collapsed in 1929 due to subsidence , exacerbated by the sinking of a shaft in the front garden by striking miners during the General Strike . The Monarch 's Way goes to the site of the Hall , marked by a cairn , through a rather dreary industrialised area . The scene was much different when , on the morning after Charles arrival , Mistress Jane Lane , with her brother and his wife and a cousin , one of the Lascelles , set out for Abbots Leigh near Bristol , Jane riding pillion behind a groom , a tall , dark man with the short hair and plain clothes fitting to his station in life : Charles was now using subterfuge rather than stealth to make his escape . The party would have had to climb the hills at Rowley but the Way makes use of the Netherton Tunnel , the last to be built in the country , and uses the towpaths as much as possible which take the walker past Cobb 's Engine House . Cobb had a neat business pumping water out of the mines and into the canal and being paid by both parties . Gorsty Hill tunnel has no towpath , however , and the Way uses the road passing the large brick airshaft in a front garden , a most incongruous sight . This stretch brings to an end the section through the Black Country . The Way now passes the ruins of the Halesowen Abbey and crosses the line of the railway bridge , now dismantled , which carried a branch line across the steep Dowery Dell and which was nick named the Nibble and Clink fine . Tradition has it that the royal party stopped for refreshment at a nearby farm , which was later , re-named Good Rest Farm . Mistress Lane and her party would be keeping a look out for Parliamentary patrols but todays traveller can enjoy the sights and sounds of ancient Pepper Wood and ponder the Chartist Cottages at Dodford . become market gardeners that , as landowners , would be eligible to vote , thus extending the franchise . The plan failed , only six houses were built of which only two remain almost in their original condition , the others having been extended and modernised , but the village has a distinctive character . At the time of Charles 's escape , however , it was just one of the tiny hamlets through which they plodded on their way to Bromsgrove where the party stopped for a meal at The Old Black Cross . It was during this pause that Charles must have needed all his talent as an actor when , in keeping with his role as a groom , he sought out a blacksmith to replace a shoe that his horse had lost . The smith was not only a Parliamentarian but had fought at Worcester and Charles had to listen to the smith 's opinion of \" the man Charles Stuart \" and his activities . It is an interesting to speculate if the smith ever realised in later years , that the subject of his vilification was so close and that the \u00a3 1000 reward had been within his reach . The horse re-shod the party continued on its way to Stratford picking up the ridgeway at Astwood Bank . Whether they passed through Alcester is debatable but the Way certainly includes it since , as we saw from the slides , it is well worth a visit . That they passed through Snitterfield is certain and it was there that they saw a Parliamentary patrol and took to the field paths to avoid them , only to meet them again in Stratford . With no means of avoiding them the party , trying to look as normal as possible , plodded past without being challenged and continued on their way to Long Marston and the home of a Royalist supporter who sheltered them for the night . This point in the escape of Charles 11 is the end of part one of the guide to the Monarch 's Way and the end , also , of Trevor 's talk . Answering questions from members Trevor explained that establishing the exact route of the King 's escape was difficult for several reasons . The full story could only be told years afterwards and memory fades ; for obvious reasons , no one taking part in the episode kept a diary or wrote to friends about the part they played in the risky journey . The truth was also distorted by the spurious accounts , which Charles released , when in France , to confuse Parliamentary agents and protect his helpers . This , plus the post Restoration desire to show loyalty , accounts for the many claims that the King slept at , passed through , stopped to eat at , so many places that , had he really done so , he would still be on the road . When restored to the throne Charles remembered the principal participants and the enormous risks they ran and awarded the Lane and Penderel families pensions which are still paid to their descendants . When Charles II made his escape and unknowingly ' pioneered ' the Monarch 's Way he must have had so much on his mind that the scenery probably attracted little of his attention but , as the slides demonstrated , today 's followers in his footsteps pass through some splendid parts of the country with some points of interest that did n't exist in 1651 . \u00a9 QLHS - Trevor Antill 2005 Ed 's comment - The above is a write up by John Mawditt of Smethwick LHS following a talk by Trevor Antill .

The King was Charles 11 , the battle was at Worcester and the enemy was the Parliamentary Army led by Cromwell . The imagination of Trevor Antill , our speaker at this meeting , was captured by the story of that desperate flight when he first heard it as a boy , especially as he was born not far from Bentley Hall , which had a part in it . An enthusiastic walker , Trevor kept coming into contact with places which also figured in the royal escape and eventually the idea of a long distance walk , following the route took shape and was put into action . The result , ten years later , was the Monarch 's Way , a 610 - mile footpath following as closely as possible the King 's epic journey from Worcester , through the Midlands and on to Bridport , then across the South Downs to Shoreham , where a boat was found to take him to France . Trevor 's talk , illustrated with slides , took us along the first 175 miles of this way-marked walk . Today the Monarch 's Way can be followed as a leisure activity but for Charles 11 it was a matter of life or death . The party seemed to have travelled a good deal on the main roads , which were rutted and potholed , and made slow going , there were no useful signposts and of reliable maps there were none . On a personal level Charles was not an easy man to disguise , he was well over six feet tall and had a dark , almost swarthy , complexion , so much so that his supporters referred to him as \" the Black Boy \" when the use of his name would have been indiscreet . With the Royal Army crumbling before Cromwell 's cavalry , Charles took the advice of his generals and fled the scene . With a small escort he left the Commandery and went into Worcester through the Sidbury Gate . The Commandery still stands but the Sidbury Gate is long gone and its place taken by a bridge over the Worcester and Birmingham Canal ; the Monarch 's Way also starts at this bridge and uses the canal towpath which is not quite the original line but near enough to it . Leaving through St. Martins Gate the fugitives headed north , mingling with Scottish cavalry streaming from the City until , realising that this was a dangerous tactic , they \" moved a little right \" , to quote an official account , and headed for Droitwich probably following what later became the line of the Droitwich canal , which after years of dereliction , is being restored and a slide showed some of the work being done . Droitwich however , was by passed by Charles and they went through Salwarpe , a one time royal manor once part of the marriage settlement of Catherine of Aragon . Whether they called at Salwarpe Court is doubtful but there is , preserved in the parish church archives , a letter from Charles commanding the men of Salwarpe to bring picks , shovels and spades to strengthen the defences at Worcester - did he remember that as he rode through ?

Hospitals in Israel provide the most extensive amount of care , including consultations , diagnostic tests , lab work , surgery and emergency care . Medical centres offer highly - specialised care and surgery . In some cases , hospitals run medical schools . At these hospitals , doctors and surgeons teach in addition to seeing patients . All major cities have multiple hospitals . For example , Tel Aviv has nine major hospitals which offer standard and specialised medical procedures as well as research and development . Jerusalem has five major hospitals which offer similar services . Regardless of your city , you should be able to find a hospital accepted by your health insurance which offers good care . English-speaking hospitals in Israel English is a semi-official language in Israel , and many doctors and nurses will be able to speak English . The Hadassah Medical Centre in Jerusalem and the Chaim Sheba Medical Centre in Tel Aviv require their nurses and doctors to know English . Nazareth Hospital in Nazareth is known as the \u201c English hospital \u201d and provides services in Hebrew , English , Arabic and Russian . Shaare Zedek Medical Centre in Jerusalem staffs many English-speakers . Many other hospitals and medical centres in Israel translate their websites into English , and online appointment requests are available in English . This does not guarantee you will be seen by an English -speaking doctor or nurse , however . Patients who do n't speak Hebrew should specifically request to see medical personnel who can speak English . Public and private hospitals Hospitals and medical centres can be public or private . The Israeli government finances public hospitals , and health funds run them . Most health funds share facilities , which means that patients have a wide range of access to hospitals and medical centres . Private facilities are funded by non-governmental organisations and employ private practitioners . Both public and private hospitals offer quality treatments , although facilities and patient care are better in private hospitals . If you have public health insurance , you will go to a public hospital . Patients in public hospitals share rooms , and facilities are often loud because doctors and nurses constantly check patients . Cafeteria food is unappetizing ( to say the least ) , and hospitals limit visiting hours to a few hours per day . Despite the substandard services , the healthcare is equivalent to private hospitals . At a private hospital , patients may have private rooms . These are more like hotel rooms than hospital rooms . Television and internet access are standard , cafeteria facilities are available for visitors and offer restaurant - quality food , and some hospitals allow visitors an extra bed to stay overnight with patients . If you are uninsured , you may go to any hospital . However , you must pay all bills yourself - and health care in Israel is expensive ! If possible , sign up for either public or private insurance . Hospital services Special treatments and surgeries available in Israeli hospitals include ( but are not limited to ) : - cardiothoracic surgery - bone marrow transplants - chemotherapy - disease diagnosis - neurosurgery - oral surgery and maxillary rehabilitation - dialysis treatment - gynaecology and obstetrics - neonatal care - nursing care To see a specialist at a hospital , you must first make an appointment . Most hospitals will allow you to make an appointment by phone or online . In addition to major surgery facilities , hospitals also offer smaller department clinics . They will perform non-invasive surgeries . Payments National health insurance pays for procedures such as general surgery and diagnostic tests .

Hospitals in Israel provide the most extensive amount of care , including consultations , diagnostic tests , lab work , surgery and emergency care . Medical centres offer highly - specialised care and surgery . In some cases , hospitals run medical schools . At these hospitals , doctors and surgeons teach in addition to seeing patients . All major cities have multiple hospitals . For example , Tel Aviv has nine major hospitals which offer standard and specialised medical procedures as well as research and development . Jerusalem has five major hospitals which offer similar services . Regardless of your city , you should be able to find a hospital accepted by your health insurance which offers good care . English-speaking hospitals in Israel English is a semi-official language in Israel , and many doctors and nurses will be able to speak English . The Hadassah Medical Centre in Jerusalem and the Chaim Sheba Medical Centre in Tel Aviv require their nurses and doctors to know English . Nazareth Hospital in Nazareth is known as the \u201c English hospital \u201d and provides services in Hebrew , English , Arabic and Russian . Shaare Zedek Medical Centre in Jerusalem staffs many English-speakers . Many other hospitals and medical centres in Israel translate their websites into English , and online appointment requests are available in English . This does not guarantee you will be seen by an English -speaking doctor or nurse , however . Patients who do n't speak Hebrew should specifically request to see medical personnel who can speak English . Public and private hospitals Hospitals and medical centres can be public or private . The Israeli government finances public hospitals , and health funds run them . Most health funds share facilities , which means that patients have a wide range of access to hospitals and medical centres . Private facilities are funded by non-governmental organisations and employ private practitioners . Both public and private hospitals offer quality treatments , although facilities and patient care are better in private hospitals . If you have public health insurance , you will go to a public hospital . Patients in public hospitals share rooms , and facilities are often loud because doctors and nurses constantly check patients . Cafeteria food is unappetizing ( to say the least ) , and hospitals limit visiting hours to a few hours per day . Despite the substandard services , the healthcare is equivalent to private hospitals . At a private hospital , patients may have private rooms . These are more like hotel rooms than hospital rooms . Television and internet access are standard , cafeteria facilities are available for visitors and offer restaurant - quality food , and some hospitals allow visitors an extra bed to stay overnight with patients . If you are uninsured , you may go to any hospital . However , you must pay all bills yourself - and health care in Israel is expensive ! If possible , sign up for either public or private insurance . Hospital services Special treatments and surgeries available in Israeli hospitals include ( but are not limited to ) : - cardiothoracic surgery - bone marrow transplants - chemotherapy - disease diagnosis - neurosurgery - oral surgery and maxillary rehabilitation - dialysis treatment - gynaecology and obstetrics - neonatal care - nursing care To see a specialist at a hospital , you must first make an appointment . Most hospitals will allow you to make an appointment by phone or online . In addition to major surgery facilities , hospitals also offer smaller department clinics . They will perform non-invasive surgeries . Payments National health insurance pays for procedures such as general surgery and diagnostic tests . Special procedures like radiology therapy and outpatient care may be covered under supplemental coverage . The amount of care and coverage you receive depends on your fund and supplemental insurance . Patients who do not have supplemental coverage will be required to pay for such services . Private insurance premiums cover most healthcare costs , as well as patient care .","annotations":[{"text":"visitors","span":[2829,2836],"token_span":[472,472],"role":"Guest","label":"Guest","role_definition":"The Guest remains for a relatively short period of time in the Location."},{"text":"some hospitals","span":[2808,2821],"token_span":[469,470],"role":"Location","label":"Location","role_definition":"The Location where the Guest spends a short amount of time."},{"text":"overnight","span":[2859,2867],"token_span":[478,478],"role":"Duration","label":"Duration","role_definition":"The length of time that the Guest remains at the Location."},{"text":"Israel","span":[72,77],"token_span":[11,11],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place indicates the larger physical setting of the temporary stay."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-1558-1339-frame-Temporary_stay","frame":"Temporary_stay","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Guest stays for a time at a Location, which is not his or her permanent residence, for some Duration.","frame_ancestors":["Residence","Visiting","Being_located","State","Intentionally_act","Event","Visiting_scenario_stay"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"In this mixture of swamps and woodlands , 300 species of birds breed , feed or stop over on their migratory route between Northern Europe and Africa .

From its plate- glass windows , you gaze \u2013 over a small lake ringed with bulrushes \u2013 at a group of tamarisk bushes covered with squawking , screeching birdlife . Cattle egrets , night herons , purple herons and glossy ibis have made their homes here , while in the foreground flamingos and spoonbills wade gracefully through the shallow , reed - filled water . This an ornithologist 's dream : 200,000 hectares of salt marsh of unrivalled importance to the birdlife of western Europe . Dozens of Britain 's most loved migratory birds , including house martins , swallows , cuckoos and warblers , find precious rest here on their annual migrations from Africa . For good measure , Do\u00f1ana , a UN World Heritage Site , is home to some of Europe 's rarest birds , including the Spanish imperial eagle , while its mammalian inhabitants include the highly endangered Iberian lynx . It is a glorious , vibrant landscape . Yet it exists on a knife - edge , a point brought home dramatically 16 years ago last week when almost two billion gallons of contaminated , highly acidic water , mixed with arsenic , cadmium and other waste metals , surged into the park from a dam that had burst its bank at Los Frailes mine 45 km to the north , near the little town of Aznalc\u00f3llar . A toxic tsunami of mine tailings poured down the Guadiamar river and over its banks , leaving a thick crust of metallic crud over a vast stretch of parkland . More than 25,000 kilos of dead fish were collected in the aftermath and nearly 2,000 adult birds , chicks , eggs and nests killed or destroyed . Even worse , the contamination persisted and many birds gave birth to deformed or dead chicks for several years . It was Spain 's worst environmental disaster and the clean - up cost \u20ac 90 m ( \u00a3 74 m ) . Suddenly aware of Do\u00f1ana 's status as the nation 's most important natural site , Spain decided to spend a further \u20ac 360 m , some of it EU money , on restoring the landscape which , in the 1950s and 60s , had been drained in places to create rice and cotton fields . Some of this farmland is now being returned to its original wetland state . It has been a costly but encouraging process . Yet the fate of Do\u00f1ana still hangs in the balance thanks to the increasing pressures of modern life . An example is provided by local farms which , in a bid to provide western Europe with out - of - season fruit , have laid out endless ribbons of plastic arches in which they grow strawberries all year round . Strawberries drink a lot , however , and that has led farmers to pump up ground water \u2013 in many cases , illegally \u2013 and so lower the park 's critically important water table . In addition , plans have been outlined to build an oil pipeline through Do\u00f1ana , while other developers have announced proposals to expand local tourist resorts whose new hotels and golf courses would demand water supplies that would further erode the local table . Silt washed from nearby farms is also choking the channels that crisscross Do\u00f1ana . The wetlands of Do\u00f1ana are under threat of a death by drought . However , the real body blow for conservationists has been the recent decision of the Andaluc\u00edan government to reopen the Frailes mine which so very nearly destroyed Do\u00f1ana in 1998 . \" This is Europe 's most precious bird sanctuary , both in terms of indigenous species and also as a resting place for birds that migrate between Africa and Britain and other parts of north - west Europe , \" says Laurence Rose , of the RSPB . \" Do\u00f1ana already faces a great number of threats , but now they want to bring back the very cause of its near-undoing 16 years ago . It is extremely worrying . \" Having spent so much restoring Do\u00f1ana to its past glories , it might seem strange that the local government should choose to announce that it wants mining companies to tender bids to rework Los Frailes . However , a brief examination of the state of the local economy provides an explanation . The crash of Spain 's banks five years ago hit the region catastrophically and unemployment in some parts of Andaluc\u00eda is now more then 30 % . Reopening the mine would provide more than 1,000 precious jobs . \" There are riches here , riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants , \" Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez Guerrero , secretary - general of Innovation , Industry and Energy for Andaluc\u00eda , recently told the BBC . \" We think mining is a good way to make it possible to allow local people to continue to live in the area . This is a mining area . People have been digging metals and ores here since Roman times , after all . \" More to the point , added Fern\u00e1ndez , the mine licence would stipulate that only modern mining techniques , which avoid the creation of poisonous wet tailings , would be allowed . ( It has also stipulated that Boliden Apirsa , the Canadian company that ran Los Frailes , cannot bid for the contract . Sixteen years after the accident , the two sides remained locked over compensation claims . ) \" The best technology in the world will be used here , \" Fern\u00e1ndez insisted . \" Liquid will not be used .

That body of work was published as a book , Caf\u00e9 Lehmitz , which is now widely considered a seminal work in the development of European photography . ( On par with , but very different from , Robert Frank 's The Americans ) . It is practically impossible to separate the man from his photography . He carries his small Contax T3 always , and captures beauty in some of the most unlikely places . With his camera , he records an intensely curious and personal diary . Born in Stockholm in 1944 , he went out on his own , at age 18 , to discover the world , starting with Hamburg , Germany . There he encountered a wild nightlife counter - culture which was incredibly and thrillingly different from his rather staid upbringing in Sweden . He soon befriended prostitutes , transvestites , alcoholics and drug users , and adopted a love of nightlife and people living beyond the margins of polite society . After seeing one photograph made by Christer Str\u00f6mholm ( a cemetery at night with dark footprints in the snow ) , Petersen went back to Sweden to meet and study photography with Str\u00f6mholm between 1966 and 1968 . Then he returned to Hamburg , where over the course of several years and many many late nights , he took the photos that became his first book , Caf\u00e9 Lehmitz . Since then , he has gone on to publish more than 20 books , almost all of which feel like personal diaries of his experiences with people and places that are only encountered in the outskirts of towns or under cover of darkness . For an extend period of time , he practically lived in a high - security prison to make the photographs for his 1984 book , Fangelse . He has also documented , in his highly personal style , the people in an insane asylum , and others living in a home for old people . In each body of work , Anders Petersen forces us to regard \u2014 from often uncomfortably close vantage points \u2014 situations and people that most of us would avoid at all costs . Yet , what he reveals is tenderness , beauty , and common humanity . In 2005 , Anders Petersen spent two two - week residencies in the towns of Gap and St. Etienne in southeast and central France , where he was able to find and photograph more of the outsiders and outcasts that always seem to attract him . The photographs are sometimes disturbingly intimate and difficult .

That body of work was published as a book , Caf\u00e9 Lehmitz , which is now widely considered a seminal work in the development of European photography . ( On par with , but very different from , Robert Frank 's The Americans ) . It is practically impossible to separate the man from his photography . He carries his small Contax T3 always , and captures beauty in some of the most unlikely places . With his camera , he records an intensely curious and personal diary . Born in Stockholm in 1944 , he went out on his own , at age 18 , to discover the world , starting with Hamburg , Germany . There he encountered a wild nightlife counter - culture which was incredibly and thrillingly different from his rather staid upbringing in Sweden . He soon befriended prostitutes , transvestites , alcoholics and drug users , and adopted a love of nightlife and people living beyond the margins of polite society . After seeing one photograph made by Christer Str\u00f6mholm ( a cemetery at night with dark footprints in the snow ) , Petersen went back to Sweden to meet and study photography with Str\u00f6mholm between 1966 and 1968 . Then he returned to Hamburg , where over the course of several years and many many late nights , he took the photos that became his first book , Caf\u00e9 Lehmitz . Since then , he has gone on to publish more than 20 books , almost all of which feel like personal diaries of his experiences with people and places that are only encountered in the outskirts of towns or under cover of darkness . For an extend period of time , he practically lived in a high - security prison to make the photographs for his 1984 book , Fangelse . He has also documented , in his highly personal style , the people in an insane asylum , and others living in a home for old people . In each body of work , Anders Petersen forces us to regard \u2014 from often uncomfortably close vantage points \u2014 situations and people that most of us would avoid at all costs . Yet , what he reveals is tenderness , beauty , and common humanity . In 2005 , Anders Petersen spent two two - week residencies in the towns of Gap and St. Etienne in southeast and central France , where he was able to find and photograph more of the outsiders and outcasts that always seem to attract him . The photographs are sometimes disturbingly intimate and difficult . When I first saw them exhibited in Arles in 2006 , they made everything else on display at the huge photography festival pale in comparison . They became the \u201c buzz \u201d in Arles . And everyone realized that Anders Petersen ( that wildly energetic 62 - year - old guy ) is still making some of the most arresting personal documentary photographs today \u2014 almost 40 years after the powerful and poignant photos from Caf\u00e9 Lehmitz .

Humphry Carpenter and Mari Prichard ( Oxford , 1995 ) , p. 510 ; the other materials have been drawn from various scholarly studies and eighteenth - century texts as well as one 20th century anonymous review . The famous child 's classic known in English as Swiss Family Robinson was written by a Swiss Pastor , Johann David Wyss ( 1743 - 1818 ) . He was born in Berne , became an army chaplain , and is said to have told the story episode by episode to his four sons . According to the The Oxford Companion to Children 's Literature , \" he left the manuscript incomplete and disorganized , and it was prepared for publication at Zurich in 1812 - 13 as Der schweizerische Robinson ; \" its editor was his son , Johann Rudolf Wyss ( 1781 - 1830 ) who was a professor of philosophy at Berne . Montolieu produced the first French adaptation / translation in 1814 which included material she had added herself ; \" the first English translation was by probably the work of William Godwin and was published by his wife , M. J. Godwin in 1814 [ but see below ] as The Family Robinson Crusoe and described as a transation ' from the German of M. Wiss , ' though it incorporated some of Montolieu 's additions . The Godwin version was re-issued in a longer version in 1816 , and the book 's familiar title first used in 1818 . In 1824 Montolieu produced a yet larger version in French ; she added the adventures of Fritz , Franz , Ernest and Jack \" ( Oxford Companion , p. 510 ) . Still other writers added yet further ( improbable ) adventures ; interestingly these as well as the adventures added by Montolieu are among the best known . The story \" as originally published lacked a clear ending , and concluded with the boys ' father wondering ( after two years on the island ) whether the family wouldl ever see another human face again . An editor 's postscript followed , explaining that three or four years later they were discovered by an English vessel whose Captain was given their journal , but the ship was driven away again before they could be rescued . Later texts introeduced the character of an English girl who is shipwrecked on a neighbouring rock and discovered by one of the boys . He returns to England with her while the rest of the family remain ; others settlers join them , and the island eventually becomes a flouishing colony , ' New Switzerland ' \" ( Oxford Companion , p. 510 ) The reader will want to know that William H. G. Kingston 's version of The Swiss Family Robinson is an Englished shortened version of Isabelle de Montolieu 's Le Robinson suisse , ou , Journal d'un p\u00e8re de famille , naufrag\u00e9 avec ses enfans . Other English editions which claim include the whole of the Wyss- Montolieu narrative are by W. H. Davenport Adams ( 1869 - 0 ) and Mrs H. B. Paull ( 1879 ) . As Carpenter and Prichard write , \" with all the expansions and contractions \" over the past two centuries ( this includes a long history of abridgements , condensations , Christianizings , and Disney products ) , \" Wyss 's original narative has long since been obscured , and the book is chiefly characterized by its improbable profusion of animals -- penguins , kangaroos , monkeys and even a whale - conveniently gathered together on a tropical island \" ( Oxford Companion , p. 510 ) . As to its connection with 18th century thought and Montolieu , Wyss 's attitude towards education is Rousseauist . The adventures are presented as the basis of lessons in natural history and the physical sciences and resemble numbers of other similar educational books for children in this period , for example , Charlotte Smith 's Rural Walks : in Dialogues intended for the use of Young Persons ( 1795 ) , Rambles Further : A continuation of Rural Walks ( 1796 ) A Natural History of Birds , intended chiefly for young persons ( 1807 ) . In other words , Wyss 's book belongs to the subgenre of children 's literature which was developing at the time whose practitioners included the Edgeworths , Thomas Day ( Sandford and Merton ) -- and Montolieu 's friend , St\u00e9phanie - F\u00e9licit\u00e9 de Genlis , one of the earliest of the French writers ( e.g , Les Veill\u00e9es du Ch\u00e2teau or Tales of the Castle : Or , Stories of Instruction and Delight ( 1785 ) . Wyss differs from all these because his book comes out of a German pietistic milieu , is long and involved , and is based on the model of Defoe 's Robinson Crusoe and is a genuine adventure story , though it is continuously didactic ; as Carpenter and Prichard remark , \" as the family 's \" ship founders at the beginning of the story , [ the father ] pauses to explain to one of the boys the principle of the lever \" ( Oxford Companion , p. 510 ) . It should be noted that a number of Godwin scholars dispute the assertion that the English translation which appeared in 1814 was by William Godwin ; they think the translation was by his second wife . The book is also shaped in accordance with Christian thought and lessons . The following excerpt from an anonymous intelligent review on Amazon ( written on April 26 , 2001 ) reflects its strong Christian , idealizing and optimistic thrust , which help account for the book 's appeal and continual reprinting and adaptations : Daniel Defoe 's Robinson Crusoe carved a literary niche for the survival story , and The Swiss Family Robinson is one of the many stories carved in that mould . Written from the perspective of the father , it chronicles the first - hand account of the shipwreck and survival of a Swiss family of six on a remote island somewhere near New Guinea . The family consists of a Swiss pastor who is a walking encyclopedia on agricultural practices from around the world ; his wife who excels in equal measure with culinary skills , and four energetic sons . Displaying remarkable resilience and resourcefulness , they survive completely alone for over ten years until their rescue . In the process , they create their own European civilization , showing complete mastery over animals and plants , and creatively establishing houses . The bulk of the novel consists of their struggle for survival with their endless discovery of new species of plants and animals .. Readers should be warned that different versions of the Swiss Family Robinson abound . The Swiss pastor originally credited with the work - Johann David Wyss ( 1743 - 1818 ) - originally told many of these tales to his children , one of whom was likely responsible for the editing and publication of it . It was subsequently translated into many languages , with translators taking major liberties in abridgement or adding episodes of their own . The Disney film version , for instance , contains confrontations with pirates that are entirely absent from the original . Some versions speak of the shipwrecked lass as \" Jenny \" , others as \" Emily \" . The version I read ( the Puffin Classics edition ) was the translation of WHG Kingston , first published in 1879 , and widely regarded as one of the best-loved English translations . Remarkably , however , it is not based on the original German version , but on an 1816 French version . Regardless of which version one reads , abridged versions sacrifice much of the charm of the original . The longer versions are eloquent , descriptive , and employ vocabulary and language that makes them far more satisfying than most contemporary condensed versions . Given that the original author was a Swiss pastor , it 's not surprising to find the narrative soaked with implicit Christian influences . There are frequent references to God 's providence , commendation into God 's care , keeping the day of rest , as well as the encouragement of Christian morals . The exercise and promotion of Christian virtue is a clear theme , evident especially in a final scene where the father charges his sons to be faithful as Christians . \" In a long conversation with my sons I solemnly charged them with the future responsibilities of their life , in all its varied aspects , of duty towards God , their fellow men , and themselves , pointing out the temptations to which their different characters were likely to expose them , and exhorting them affectionately to hold fast to the faith in which they had been brought up . \" The boys all have different strengths and weaknesses , and Wyss presents this as a moral lesson for his readers : \" Children are , on the whole , very much alike everywhere , and you four lads fairly represent multitudes , who are growing up in all directions . It will make me happy to think that my simple narrative may lead some of these to observe how blessed are the results of patient continuance in well - doing , what benefits arise from the thoughtful application of knowledge and science , and how good and pleasant a thing it is when brethren dwell together in unity , under the eyes of parental love . \" The importance of a wholesome Christian family working together is very central : \" And my great wish is that young people who read this record of our lives and adventures , should learn from it how admirably suited is the peaceful , industrious and pious life of a cheerful and united family , to the formation of strong , pure and manly character . \" The island proves to be a form of idyllic paradise , where animals from every continent around the world apparently co-exist in a rather impossible manner ( Australian kangaroos and platypuses , Antarctic penguins , African lions and elephants , North American wolves , and bears , South American boa constrictors , not to mention walruses , tapirs , toucans , flamingos and ostriches ) . New species of plants and animals are conveniently discovered on a daily basis , and the Wyss family appears to have an inexhaustible knowledge of how to use these resources to create their own civilization . They are little troubled by sickness , storms or strife , and have few difficulties in taming nearly every animal known to mankind . They are able to cook every delicacy ever conceived . Whether their menu offers truffles or turtle , roasted bear - paw or buffalo , the food is always good and the meat never burnt . In fact their success sometimes becomes rather repetitive and tiresome , and is evidently rooted in an overly optimistic view of mankind and faith in the possibilities offered by scientific knowledge . But rather than become too frustrated by the utopianism , you should suspend your sense of disbelief and enjoy the ride . Certainly it is rather hard to believe that a Swiss pastor can immediately recognize a Myrica cerifera when he sees one and conveniently knows that its berries can be melted and strained to make candles , or that he knows that a sturgeon 's bladder can be used to make isinglass , or that he remembers intricate details about Italian , Indian and South American practices of agriculture and animal husbandry . The production of chinaware , porcelain , soap , and rubber boots and the apparent skills in taxidermy and other exotic abilities may at times be hard to swallow . And the endless discoveries and conquests of nature are rather repetitive . But in the end it 's enjoyable . It 's little wonder that the Wyss family decided not to leave their \" New Switzerland \" at the end . For the same reason , so many people come back to the Robinson 's island time and again . Some of the ideas in this book are certainly dated , but this book has stood the test of time , and spending time with the Swiss Family Robinson will continue to be rewarding .","annotations":[{"text":"The famous child 's classic known in English as Swiss Family Robinson","span":[310,378],"token_span":[56,67],"role":"Text","label":"Text","role_definition":"The entity which results from the act of writing or speaking."},{"text":"a Swiss Pastor , Johann David Wyss","span":[395,428],"token_span":[71,77],"role":"Author","label":"Author","role_definition":"The Author produces a particular Text."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"History Written by Swiss writer , Johann David Wyss , edited by his son Johann Rudolf Wyss , and illustrated by another son , Johann Emmanuel Wyss , the novel was intended to teach his four sons about family values , good husbandry , the uses of the natural world and self-reliance .","annotations":[{"text":"Johann David Wyss","span":[34,50],"token_span":[6,8],"role":"Author","label":"Author","role_definition":"The Author produces a particular Text."},{"text":"the novel","span":[149,157],"token_span":[28,29],"role":"Text","label":"Text","role_definition":"The entity which results from the act of writing or speaking."}],"trigger":{"text":"writer","start_char":25,"end_char":30,"start_token":4,"end_token":4,"frame":"Text_creation"}},"source":{"text":"Where indicated , the following is taken from The Oxford Companon to Children 's Literature , edd .

Synopsis : A young department store employee falls in love with a female store mannequin who , as it turns out , is actually a gorgeous peasant girl who 's been cursed into a frozen trance for a thousand years . Tagline : A Lively Comedy about a Living Doll Part 1 : A Lion Walks Into an Elevator Blake J. Harris : Stewart , before we get into Mannequin 2 , I was curious to hear how you first got into film and television . Stewart Raffill : Well , I did n't really do too much television . I really went straight into film . Blake J. Harris : Sorry about that . I thought you got your start on that Tarzan TV series from the ' 60s . Stewart Raffill : Oh , ah yes . I used to have a company that rented wild animals to the studios . That was my first business . I used to do the stunt work for Tarzan . A couple different Tarzans . In Brazil and Mexico and a couple different places where they filmed them . Then I got into independent filmmaking after that . Blake J. Harris : Wow , I did n't realize you rented out wild animals . How did that happen ? Or rather , before that , how did you even know how to train animals ? Stewart Raffill : Well , I grew up on a farm in England . We used to have horses that we raced and everything . So it was a natural for me to be around animals . And I got my degree in agriculture . Then , when I was 18 years old , I came here on the Queen Mary . I never had any connection with film or TV until I went into the business of supplying animals . It 's an interesting business because you spend every day of your life on set watching other people directing and producing . It was an eye-opener . Blake J. Harris : What types of animals did you train ? Stewart Raffill : Lions , tigers , elephants , chimpanzees . All those creatures . Grizzles too . Blake J. Harris : Did you have a favorite animal to work with ? Stewart Raffill : No , I liked them all . The chimps are the most interesting , but the most dangerous . Elephants are pretty nice to work with . Big cats : they 're all individuals , so you need to figure out how to work with them . And big bears are usually pretty smart and nice to work with too . It just depends on the story . Blake J. Harris : How did you used to prepare the animals for being on camera ? Stewart Raffill : You have to get them as cubs and raise them . You know , this was a long time ago . Nowadays , it 's pretty hard for anybody to get any cubs of any kind . There 's all sorts of restrictions . Game department gets involved with everything . The whole thing changed . I mean , there was a time I used to walk down Hollywood Boulevard with my lion on a chain . Blake J. Harris : Really ? Stewart Raffill : Used to drive into town with him in the back seat of the car . Took him up until a building . There was a guy called Sy Weintraub that was going to do the original Tarzan television series . And he was in the last office building on Sunset . And myself and a friend . Do you remember Grizzly Adams ? Blake J. Harris : Yeah . Stewart Raffill : Yeah , Dan Haggerty , he worked for me in those days and we took the leopard , the lion and a big chimp and we stopped at this big high rise at the end of Sunset Boulevard . The last building before you go into Beverly Hills . And we pulled up in front \u2014 got the cats and the chimp out \u2014 walked into the lobby . People just ... they did n't know how to react . Got into the elevator . Went up to the 11th floor . Walked into the guy 's office and said if you 're doing a new TV series about Tarzan these are the animals you need . And he hired him . Blake J. Harris : That 's so amazing . Stewart Raffill : It was kind of funny because when we left , the elevator stopped at a couple of floors . And most people just stopped and said , \" Oh man ! Are you kidding !! \" One guy , who was like too tough to react , he got in there and just stood there kind of sweating and pretending it was n't happening . Blake J. Harris : That 's a great visual . Stewart Raffill : It was a very great visual . Blake J. Harris : So I 'm assuming at some point along the way you stopped training animals , right ? Stewart Raffill : [ laughing ] Yes . Right now I have a little Shih Tzu , that 's the only animal I have left . Part 2 : The Politics of Hollywood Stewart Raffill : What happened was I used some of the money from from renting animals and I made my first movie , a kid 's movie , down at the Okefenokee Swamp down in Georgia . The Tender Warrior [ 1971 ] . And then sold that to Warner Bros . They did n't do much . Bought it back and then re-distributed it with someone else . Then did things like [ The Adventures of ] the Wilderness Family that became quite successful . Independent family films with lots of animals and kids . Blake J. Harris : That 's a pretty fun niche . Stewart Raffill : It was . I did quite a few family films . The second script I wrote was a thing called Napoleon and Samantha , which I sold to Disney . I was one of the producers on it and I had the pet lion on it . I believe that was Jodie Foster 's first job and Michael Douglas ' first film as a star . Blake J. Harris : Oh , wow . What was that experience like ? Stewart Raffill : That was great . I mean Walt Disney was still alive in those days . The studio was a very lively place . And then , of course , he died and it went through all sorts of transitions and it became a conglomerate . It became less personal , as far as I 'm concerned . Blake J. Harris : You either wrote or directed about ten films during the ' 70s and ' 80s . Does any stand out as a favorite ? Stewart Raffill : Probably High Risk . With Anthony Quinn , James Coburn , Jim Brolin , Lindsay Wagner and Ernest Borgnine . I made that in Mexico with a Mexican crew . Then after that , I got hired by John Forman and David Begelman \u2014 who were over at MGM \u2014 to do a movie called The Ice Pirates . We did that at the old MGM . In fact it was the last film that was shot on that lot before it became part of Sony . And of course David Begelman and John Forman were the producers on Mannequin : On the Move , the second one . Blake J. Harris : Right . The beginning of a fruitful relationship . How did they find you ? Stewart Raffill : David was the head of the studio , MGM . And the studio had not been doing well . So the bank put a limit of $ 8 million on each movie they made . Which put a project they 'd been developing into real jeopardy . A project called The Water Planet . The budget was , like , $ 20 million , so they came to me and asked if this was something I could make for $ 8 million . I said I 'd have to re-write it and make it into a comedy or something . That worked for them . The studio had a contract with Bob Urich at that time , for a TV series , so they wanted him in it . So that 's how it came about . But it ended up being a fiasco . Blake J. Harris : How so ? Stewart Raffill : Because MGM went through a transition and they brought in a new guy , who was eventually found out to be stealing money from the company . He was a little problematic sort of a fellow . And he had a bad time with John Foreman so he tried to sabotage the film . Pulled the money out on them , but we did finish it . [ long sigh ] The politics of Hollywood . Part 3 : On the Move Blake J. Harris : So how did Mannequin 2 happen ? Stewart Raffill : David [ Begelman ] owned the company that did the original , and it was very successful , so they just decided to make a sequel . They had a screenplay written , and they were just looking for someone to make it for a sensible price . They called me up and I just finished a thing called The Philadelphia Experiment . This project was a comedy and it seemed like it could be fun . So I said , \" I 'll do it . \" Blake J. Harris : And how familiar were you with that first Mannequin movie ? Stewart Raffill : I was n't at all . Had never seen it . This was one of those \" Can you do it ? \" \" Yes I can \" situations . John Foreman was a close friend of mine . There was money in the bank . Sure , let 's do it . Blake J. Harris : You mentioned that there was already a script in place . Did it change much after you came on board ? Did you weigh in on it ? Stewart Raffill : No , I did n't . That was part of the deal . Just do this thing . Blake J. Harris : What do you remember about the filming ? Stewart Raffill : I remember how beautiful the girl was in it . Blake J. Harris : Yeah , she was . Kristy Swanson was great . Stewart Raffill : Oh , she was just such a beautiful girl , she was . And it 's a shame , you know , because she was the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer . And when they came to do the series , she was a celebrity and she said , \" I do n't want to go into TV . \" Which was the biggest mistake ever . Because TV became the pre-eminent medium , really , for making money for actors . And features has been on the decline for several decades . Blake J. Harris : What about the rest of the cast ? Where did they come from ? Stewart Raffill : Well , Meshach [ Taylor ] had been in the first one . And the boy in it , I forget his name [ William Ragsdale ] , he was kind of an up- and - coming yuppie love-interest . But he never went anywhere after that . And then that was it . Blake J. Harris : What about Terry Kiser ? Stewart Raffill : Oh , he was amazing . You know , he eventually got fed up with Hollywood and moved to Colorado . Then he went out of business . I put him in another low- budget film I made . He was a wonderful , eccentric fun character who just disappeared , you know ? He did Weekend at Bernie 's and that was it . They already thought he was dead . Blake J. Harris : And what about those three tough guys ? I think , maybe , they were foreign . Do you remember them ? The comic relief ? Stewart Raffill : I call them the goons . The muscle guys . They were all weightlifters . Blake J. Harris : Exactly , yeah . I think their voices were dubbed . How come ? Stewart Raffill : Because they just were n't actors . Just muscular guys that they hire because of their looks . Never acted before . And just did n't have that vocal ability . To be real or even just say simple things like , \" Look out ! \" Blake J. Harris : [ laughter ] Compared to most of the other films you 'd been doing \u2014 be it The Philadelphia Experiment or family films with animals \u2014 this one was a bit different . So how did you approach that ? The sensibility ? Stewart Raffill : The main thing was just to play the humor . It 's a situation comedy so you have to set up the situation . It 's obviously an outlandish idea \u2014 it 's an inanimate thing and then it comes to life \u2014 so in that structure you have all sorts of humor . Particularly if the person is just suddenly falling in love . You want that person 's reactions to be interesting , so you try to come up with scenes that , you know , take advantage of that particular configuration of comedy potentials . Blake J. Harris : Do you remember what the most challenging part of filming was ? Stewart Raffill : It was not a very challenging movie . I mean , it was a very simple film to make because it mostly took place in a big store . This place called Wanamaker 's , which is one of the great stores of Philadelphia ( and one of the first department stores in the United States ) . So that went well . It was a good shoot . And Kristy was a charm to work with . Very accessible and not spoiled in any way . She was just a neophyte as far as being an actor is concerned , but she played that part pretty well . Blake J. Harris : Yeah , she was charming . Stewart Raffill : It 's a cute movie . Maybe they need some more things like that nowadays . But innocence has sort of faded , has n't it ? That type of innocent humor . This was an era when , you know , simpler values existed . Part 4 : Mac and Me Stewart Raffill : Mac and Me? That was another movie where somebody called me up and he was a producer who had worked on quite a few films . He 'd made a lot of big movies , but he decided he want to make his own movie . And he raised the money from one of the main partners at McDonalds \u2014 I think , like , the produce provider for McDonalds \u2014 and he put up the money to do that movie with the understanding that the proceeds from that movie would go to the Ronald McDonald Foundation . Blake J. Harris : That 's ... unusual . Stewart Raffill : Just wait . So I was hired out of the blue . And the producer asked me to come down to the office . So I did and he had a whole crew there , a whole crew on the payroll . It was amazing . He had the transportation captain . The camera department head . The AD . The Production Manager . He had everybody already hired and I said , \" Well , what 's the script ? \" And he said , \" We do n't have a script . I do n't like the script . You have to write the script . You 're gonna have to write it quick so prep the movie and write the script on the weekends . \" Blake J. Harris : No way . Really ? Did you ? Stewart Raffill : Yeah , so I 'd go and lock myself in a hotel on Friday night , write ' til Monday , anticipate what the locations were going to be , go out and find the locations , design the aliens and all that stuff . It was kind of a messy way to make a movie . Blake J. Harris : Of course . Stewart Raffill : The interesting thing was the guy wanted to do a film with a real ... you know , he wanted to help someone who was handicapped . So he found a kid who had spina bifida . The kid had never acted before , but he was a wonderful kid . But when they finished it was as if the fact that they used a real encumbered person to play the person did n't mean anything to even the people who lived in the world . You 'd think that if you made a movie about a kid with spina bifida and you really used a real kid with spina bifida , it would be something unique for the millions of people in the country who have spina bifida or their parents or anyone who 's life has been affected by it . Blake J. Harris : If nothing else , I 'm surprised that was n't part of the marketing . Stewart Raffill : Right ? So that was Mac and Me. \" Would you be interested in directing an alien movie with a kid that 's handicapped for kids for the McDonalds Company . And we gotta do it quick . \" I said yes and just made it up and there you go . Part 5 : How Scripts Evolve Blake J. Harris : Before we finish , there was one project I feel compelled to ask about . Passenger 57 . A longtime favorite in the Harris household . I did n't realize that you were the screenwriter on that . How did that come about ? Stewart Raffill : Well , that 's a whole different story . That was a great script that I had written and everybody in town loved it . But it was a very ... the original story was about a guy liked Clint Eastwood and it was about a guy who went to bury his son in Spain and on this plane he sat next to some urbane guy from Iran . And the guy from Iran turns out to be a terrorist and they highjack the plane and take all the Americans to Iran . And they take them off the plane and they put them in to different cells and they kept them all away . And Clint Eastwood , through the whole thing , is watching this guy and eventually gets the gun . Shoots a whole bunch and says , \" Who are the people running this country ? \" The Mullahs . He says , \" Okay \" and he goes to where the Mullahs are and he takes all the Mullahs as prisoners and he holds them as prisoners to exchange for all the Americans there and then fights his way out of Iran . That was the original story . Way too political . Blake J. Harris : Haha . Stewart Raffill : The head of the studio said to me , \" If I make that movie , they 'll blow up the theaters . \" So I did a couple of re-writes for them , for Warner Bros who owned it , then I got another picture and came back and then it became a black movie . And that was it . Blake J. Harris : So you did n't write that famous line \" Always bet on black ? \" Stewart Raffill : No I did n't because there was n't any black people in it when I wrote it . Blake J. Harris : So one final question . Good or bad , Passenger 57 \u2014 the version that was shot \u2014 was pretty different from your initial vision . And with movies like Mannequin 2 and Mac and Me , these were n't really your creative vision to begin with . So I was just curious , during this time \u2014 the ' 80s and ' 90s \u2014 which movie , or movies , you think are most reflective of your artistic sensibilities . Stewart Raffill : I 'd say The Philadelphia Experiment . By the time I got involved , that movie had been rewritten 9 times . I was doing the Ice Pirates for MGM at that time , but there was a Canadian guy who was supposed to do the next re-write and I said I 'd do it subject to the screenplay coming in . But when it came in , the screenplay was terrible . So I said to my agent , \" I just ca n't do this . The script does n't even make sense . \" And he said , \" You 're going to have to tell the head of the studio . \" So I spoke to the head of Universal for a while and I told him I did n't want to do it . He said , \" Well what did you want to do ? \" I said it should have been this and this and this . And I told him what I had envisioned . Then he said , \" Alright , well , why do n't you make that movie ? \" And I said , \" Because I 'm supposed to start shooting it in three weeks . \" Blake J. Harris : Oh wow . Stewart Raffill : So he asked if I had ever dictated a screenplay before . I told him I had not . Then he said , \" Well , I 'm gonna send someone to your house , a girl , every afternoon , and just dictate the story you told me and fill in the dialogue and we 'll make that . \" And I said , \" Okay . \" So that 's what I did . \" Blake J. Harris : Worked out pretty well . Stewart Raffill : It did . Though the funny thing is that I never even got a writing credit on that one . Oh well .","annotations":[{"text":"a new guy","span":[8277,8285],"token_span":[1743,1745],"role":"Perpetrator","label":"Perpetrator","role_definition":"Perpetrator is the person (or other agent) that takes the goods away."},{"text":"money","span":[8333,8337],"token_span":[1755,1755],"role":"Goods","label":"Goods","role_definition":"Goods is anything (including labor, time, or legal rights) that can be taken away."},{"text":"from the company","span":[8339,8354],"token_span":[1756,1758],"role":"Victim","label":"Victim","role_definition":"Victim is the person (or other sentient being or group) that owns the goods before they are taken away by the perpetrator."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"Raffill says the film \" ended up being a fiasco ...

And then , of course , he died and it went through all sorts of transitions and it became a conglomerate . It became less personal , as far as I 'm concerned . Blake J. Harris : You either wrote or directed about ten films during the ' 70s and ' 80s . Does any stand out as a favorite ? Stewart Raffill : Probably High Risk . With Anthony Quinn , James Coburn , Jim Brolin , Lindsay Wagner and Ernest Borgnine . I made that in Mexico with a Mexican crew . Then after that , I got hired by John Forman and David Begelman \u2014 who were over at MGM \u2014 to do a movie called The Ice Pirates . We did that at the old MGM . In fact it was the last film that was shot on that lot before it became part of Sony . And of course David Begelman and John Forman were the producers on Mannequin : On the Move , the second one . Blake J. Harris : Right . The beginning of a fruitful relationship . How did they find you ? Stewart Raffill : David was the head of the studio , MGM . And the studio had not been doing well . So the bank put a limit of $ 8 million on each movie they made . Which put a project they 'd been developing into real jeopardy . A project called The Water Planet . The budget was , like , $ 20 million , so they came to me and asked if this was something I could make for $ 8 million . I said I 'd have to re-write it and make it into a comedy or something . That worked for them . The studio had a contract with Bob Urich at that time , for a TV series , so they wanted him in it . So that 's how it came about . But it ended up being a fiasco . Blake J. Harris : How so ? Stewart Raffill : Because MGM went through a transition and they brought in a new guy , who was eventually found out to be stealing money from the company . He was a little problematic sort of a fellow . And he had a bad time with John Foreman so he tried to sabotage the film . Pulled the money out on them , but we did finish it . [ long sigh ] The politics of Hollywood . Part 3 : On the Move Blake J. Harris : So how did Mannequin 2 happen ? Stewart Raffill : David [ Begelman ] owned the company that did the original , and it was very successful , so they just decided to make a sequel . They had a screenplay written , and they were just looking for someone to make it for a sensible price . They called me up and I just finished a thing called The Philadelphia Experiment . This project was a comedy and it seemed like it could be fun . So I said , \" I 'll do it . \" Blake J. Harris : And how familiar were you with that first Mannequin movie ? Stewart Raffill : I was n't at all . Had never seen it . This was one of those \" Can you do it ? \" \" Yes I can \" situations . John Foreman was a close friend of mine . There was money in the bank . Sure , let 's do it . Blake J. Harris : You mentioned that there was already a script in place . Did it change much after you came on board ? Did you weigh in on it ? Stewart Raffill : No , I did n't . That was part of the deal . Just do this thing . Blake J. Harris : What do you remember about the filming ? Stewart Raffill : I remember how beautiful the girl was in it . Blake J. Harris : Yeah , she was . Kristy Swanson was great . Stewart Raffill : Oh , she was just such a beautiful girl , she was . And it 's a shame , you know , because she was the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer . And when they came to do the series , she was a celebrity and she said , \" I do n't want to go into TV . \" Which was the biggest mistake ever . Because TV became the pre-eminent medium , really , for making money for actors . And features has been on the decline for several decades . Blake J. Harris : What about the rest of the cast ? Where did they come from ? Stewart Raffill : Well , Meshach [ Taylor ] had been in the first one . And the boy in it , I forget his name [ William Ragsdale ] , he was kind of an up- and - coming yuppie love-interest . But he never went anywhere after that . And then that was it . Blake J. Harris : What about Terry Kiser ? Stewart Raffill : Oh , he was amazing . You know , he eventually got fed up with Hollywood and moved to Colorado . Then he went out of business . I put him in another low- budget film I made . He was a wonderful , eccentric fun character who just disappeared , you know ? He did Weekend at Bernie 's and that was it . They already thought he was dead . Blake J. Harris : And what about those three tough guys ? I think , maybe , they were foreign . Do you remember them ? The comic relief ? Stewart Raffill : I call them the goons . The muscle guys . They were all weightlifters . Blake J. Harris : Exactly , yeah . I think their voices were dubbed . How come ? Stewart Raffill : Because they just were n't actors . Just muscular guys that they hire because of their looks . Never acted before . And just did n't have that vocal ability . To be real or even just say simple things like , \" Look out ! \" Blake J. Harris : [ laughter ] Compared to most of the other films you 'd been doing \u2014 be it The Philadelphia Experiment or family films with animals \u2014 this one was a bit different . So how did you approach that ? The sensibility ? Stewart Raffill : The main thing was just to play the humor . It 's a situation comedy so you have to set up the situation . It 's obviously an outlandish idea \u2014 it 's an inanimate thing and then it comes to life \u2014 so in that structure you have all sorts of humor . Particularly if the person is just suddenly falling in love . You want that person 's reactions to be interesting , so you try to come up with scenes that , you know , take advantage of that particular configuration of comedy potentials . Blake J. Harris : Do you remember what the most challenging part of filming was ? Stewart Raffill : It was not a very challenging movie . I mean , it was a very simple film to make because it mostly took place in a big store . This place called Wanamaker 's , which is one of the great stores of Philadelphia ( and one of the first department stores in the United States ) . So that went well . It was a good shoot . And Kristy was a charm to work with . Very accessible and not spoiled in any way . She was just a neophyte as far as being an actor is concerned , but she played that part pretty well . Blake J. Harris : Yeah , she was charming . Stewart Raffill : It 's a cute movie . Maybe they need some more things like that nowadays . But innocence has sort of faded , has n't it ? That type of innocent humor . This was an era when , you know , simpler values existed . Part 4 : Mac and Me Stewart Raffill : Mac and Me? That was another movie where somebody called me up and he was a producer who had worked on quite a few films . He 'd made a lot of big movies , but he decided he want to make his own movie . And he raised the money from one of the main partners at McDonalds \u2014 I think , like , the produce provider for McDonalds \u2014 and he put up the money to do that movie with the understanding that the proceeds from that movie would go to the Ronald McDonald Foundation . Blake J. Harris : That 's ... unusual . Stewart Raffill : Just wait . So I was hired out of the blue . And the producer asked me to come down to the office . So I did and he had a whole crew there , a whole crew on the payroll . It was amazing . He had the transportation captain . The camera department head . The AD . The Production Manager . He had everybody already hired and I said , \" Well , what 's the script ? \" And he said , \" We do n't have a script . I do n't like the script . You have to write the script . You 're gonna have to write it quick so prep the movie and write the script on the weekends . \" Blake J. Harris : No way . Really ? Did you ? Stewart Raffill : Yeah , so I 'd go and lock myself in a hotel on Friday night , write ' til Monday , anticipate what the locations were going to be , go out and find the locations , design the aliens and all that stuff . It was kind of a messy way to make a movie . Blake J. Harris : Of course . Stewart Raffill : The interesting thing was the guy wanted to do a film with a real ... you know , he wanted to help someone who was handicapped . So he found a kid who had spina bifida . The kid had never acted before , but he was a wonderful kid . But when they finished it was as if the fact that they used a real encumbered person to play the person did n't mean anything to even the people who lived in the world . You 'd think that if you made a movie about a kid with spina bifida and you really used a real kid with spina bifida , it would be something unique for the millions of people in the country who have spina bifida or their parents or anyone who 's life has been affected by it . Blake J. Harris : If nothing else , I 'm surprised that was n't part of the marketing . Stewart Raffill : Right ? So that was Mac and Me. \" Would you be interested in directing an alien movie with a kid that 's handicapped for kids for the McDonalds Company . And we gotta do it quick . \" I said yes and just made it up and there you go . Part 5 : How Scripts Evolve Blake J. Harris : Before we finish , there was one project I feel compelled to ask about . Passenger 57 . A longtime favorite in the Harris household . I did n't realize that you were the screenwriter on that . How did that come about ? Stewart Raffill : Well , that 's a whole different story . That was a great script that I had written and everybody in town loved it . But it was a very ... the original story was about a guy liked Clint Eastwood and it was about a guy who went to bury his son in Spain and on this plane he sat next to some urbane guy from Iran . And the guy from Iran turns out to be a terrorist and they highjack the plane and take all the Americans to Iran . And they take them off the plane and they put them in to different cells and they kept them all away . And Clint Eastwood , through the whole thing , is watching this guy and eventually gets the gun . Shoots a whole bunch and says , \" Who are the people running this country ? \" The Mullahs . He says , \" Okay \" and he goes to where the Mullahs are and he takes all the Mullahs as prisoners and he holds them as prisoners to exchange for all the Americans there and then fights his way out of Iran . That was the original story . Way too political . Blake J. Harris : Haha . Stewart Raffill : The head of the studio said to me , \" If I make that movie , they 'll blow up the theaters . \" So I did a couple of re-writes for them , for Warner Bros who owned it , then I got another picture and came back and then it became a black movie . And that was it . Blake J. Harris : So you did n't write that famous line \" Always bet on black ? \" Stewart Raffill : No I did n't because there was n't any black people in it when I wrote it . Blake J. Harris : So one final question . Good or bad , Passenger 57 \u2014 the version that was shot \u2014 was pretty different from your initial vision . And with movies like Mannequin 2 and Mac and Me , these were n't really your creative vision to begin with . So I was just curious , during this time \u2014 the ' 80s and ' 90s \u2014 which movie , or movies , you think are most reflective of your artistic sensibilities . Stewart Raffill : I 'd say The Philadelphia Experiment . By the time I got involved , that movie had been rewritten 9 times . I was doing the Ice Pirates for MGM at that time , but there was a Canadian guy who was supposed to do the next re-write and I said I 'd do it subject to the screenplay coming in . But when it came in , the screenplay was terrible . So I said to my agent , \" I just ca n't do this . The script does n't even make sense . \" And he said , \" You 're going to have to tell the head of the studio . \" So I spoke to the head of Universal for a while and I told him I did n't want to do it . He said , \" Well what did you want to do ? \" I said it should have been this and this and this . And I told him what I had envisioned . Then he said , \" Alright , well , why do n't you make that movie ? \" And I said , \" Because I 'm supposed to start shooting it in three weeks . \" Blake J. Harris : Oh wow . Stewart Raffill : So he asked if I had ever dictated a screenplay before . I told him I had not . Then he said , \" Well , I 'm gonna send someone to your house , a girl , every afternoon , and just dictate the story you told me and fill in the dialogue and we 'll make that . \" And I said , \" Okay . \" So that 's what I did . \" Blake J. Harris : Worked out pretty well . Stewart Raffill : It did . Though the funny thing is that I never even got a writing credit on that one . Oh well .","annotations":[{"text":"Bob Urich","span":[8040,8048],"token_span":[1689,1690],"role":"Perpetrator","label":"Perpetrator","role_definition":"Perpetrator is the person (or other agent) that takes the goods away."},{"text":"from the company","span":[8339,8354],"token_span":[1756,1758],"role":"Victim","label":"Victim","role_definition":"Victim is the person (or other sentient being or group) that owns the goods before they are taken away by the perpetrator."},{"text":"money","span":[8333,8337],"token_span":[1755,1755],"role":"Goods","label":"Goods","role_definition":"Goods is anything (including labor, time, or legal rights) that can be taken away."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-0881-818-frame-Theft","frame":"Theft","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"These are words describing situations in which a Perpetrator takes Goods from a Victim or a Source.","frame_ancestors":["Committing_crime","Misdeed","Event","Taking","Getting","Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"A Bomb Was Stolen ( ) is a 1961 Romanian dialogue - free spy film directed by Ion Popescu - Gopo .

Sponsored by DA : Statement by Athol Trollip , Democratic Alliance Parliamentary leader , on Paul Ngobeni ( 22/03/2010 ) / MEDIA STATEMENT / The content on this page is not written by Polity.org.za , but is supplied by third parties . This content does not constitute news reporting by Polity.org.za . On Friday morning , we sent a letter to the Minister o Defence , Lindiwe Sisulu , in response to the letter received from her office on 15 February , concerning the hiring of controversial figure Paul Ngobeni as a legal advisor to her Ministry . The contents of the letter received from the Minister and that of the DA 's response sent on Friday , follow below . The correspondence between the Minister and the Democratic Alliance ( DA ) on this matter stems from a complaint laid with the Presidential Hotline on 14 September 2009 regarding Mr Ngobeni 's appointment . Subsequent to the complaint lodged with the Hotline , the DA , in response to a request from the Ministry of Defence , wrote to Minister Sisulu on 28 January 2010 . In her response to this letter , dated 15 February , the Minister contested our argument that Mr Ngobeni had been suspended from the roll in the United States and is a fugitive from justice - and is therefore highly unsuitable for the advisory position he has assumed in her Ministry . Mr Ngobeni also left his position as deputy registrar at the University of Cape Town under a cloud of suspicion after an internal disciplinary process was conducted . On Friday , we provided the Minister with irrefutable proof of Mr Ngobeni 's status as a wanted criminal and his disbarment in the United States . Faced with the necessary evidence about Mr Ngobeni , Minister Sisulu now has no option but to make a decision about his continued employment in her Ministry . Whether the Minister will take a principled stand against the hiring of unsuitable individuals on the grounds of political patronage , or whether she will decide to perpetuate this corrupt agenda , remains to be seen . Either way , her decision will be a critical indicator of where the ANC government 's true allegiance lies - with their political cronies or with the South African citizenry the government was elected to serve . Dear Mr Trollip Appointment of Dr P Ngobeni as part time advisor Your letter in the above regard , dated 28 January 2010 , as well as your complaint lodged with the Presidential Hotline refer . Repeated allegations have been made regarding Dr Paul Ngobeni . The allegations range from Dr Ngobeni being a fugitive from justice to him having being found guilty of misconduct including theft , larceny etc . None of this is true despite being repeated ad nauseum . A. Dr Ngobeni is a fugitive Dr Ngobeni has been in the USA a number of times since the first time the allegation was made . South Africa and the USA have some of the most effective extradition arrangement and this would have been activated if there was merit to the allegation . He is a public figure and continues to participate in the public life of this country . This is not the behavior of a fugitive from justice . Fugitives hide , and will even assume a different identity . Dr Ngobeni has taken a frontline position in the public domain , as you well know . Hardly the demeanor of a fugitive . B. Dr Ngobeni is banned from practicing law in several states in America This is a baseless allegation that is meant to confuse . First is that he is admitted to more than 8 jurisdictions in the US , including the US Supreme Court itself . In December 2007 , he resigned his membership in the Connecticut state bar and the Court made the following finding : \" ... there are matters pending before Judge Graham now , a jurisdictional challenge by you to his ability to proceed with disbarment and answer by you denying many of the claims made in the presentment that the Disciplinary Counsel has brought . You 're not in any way today , by voluntarily resigning either conceding that the court has jurisdiction to proceed with disbarment or admitting any of the allegations against you in the presentment . Is that correct ? See , Transcript page 8 , lines 10 - 19 . The Court went on to state that \" ... judgment of disbarment has been vacated and that a resignation has been accomplished ... the record will be clear that Mr Ngobeni has n't been disbarred ; that the final resolution is by way of his resignation . \" Dr Ngobeni 's detractors have refused to familiarise themselves with the actual transcript from the court which is publicly available . It is one those inconvenient truths they prefer not to reveal . Dr Ngobeni is still a member of the bar in Massachusetts . A simple investigation will reveal this . In early 2008 the Bar Counsel submitted a motion to a single justice of the Massachusetts highest court seeking disbarment based on his Connecticut voluntary resignation . The court ( Greaney J. ) refused to grant the request and expressly noted that the Connecticut court 's jurisdiction was disputed , no wrongdoing was established and no disbarment ordered . To set the record straight , it is worth repeating what Dr Max Price , the University of Cape Town 's Vice Chancellor had to say on the matter of Dr Ngobeni 's departure from UCT . Writing to staff , Price wrote ; ' The media reported these as allegations of professional misconduct in his role as an attorney in Connecticut USA , as a result of which he had been suspended from practice in Connecticut , New York and Massachusetts . These charges were never proven and they were dropped in Connecticut after he resigned from the Connecticut bar and waived any future right to seek readmission to it . These facts were not known to UCT when Paul Ngobeni was appointed . Confronted with the public allegations , the UCT Council rightly raised concern about the substance of the allegations ... The Council sought , and accepted , independent legal advice that was given at the time , viz . that these matters had no bearing on his employment at UCT and that he was not obliged to reveal them if we did not specifically ask him about them . I believe UCT erred in not making it public at the time that we had cleared Paul Ngobeni of any suggestion that he misled the university . There can be no question that we should have done so . ' Dr Ngobeni is a brilliant legal brain and I have no reason to question his integrity . I appointed him as a legal advisor based on his knowledge and ability to understand and advise me on the legal challenges facing the Department of Defence . Should your information be contrary to the factual assertions detailed here , please feel free to submit these to myself . Yours sincerely L N Sisulu , MP Minister of Defence and Military Veterans 19 March 2010 Minister Lindiwe Sisulu Department of Defence and Military Veterans Private Bag X427 PRETORIA 0001 Response to letter regarding the appointment of Paul Ngobeni Dear Minister Sisulu The response to my initial letter , dated January 28 , 2010 , sent by your office on 15 February , 2010 , appears to be both disingenuous and overlooking of key facts related to Paul Ngobeni 's questionable legal integrity . Key Areas of Concern On March 28 , 2008 , a warrant for the arrest of Mr Ngobeni was issued by a Connecticut court after he failed to report for a court hearing . Communications Officer for the Division of Criminal Justice in the State of Connecticut , Mark A. Dupuis , confirmed the following in writing on 12 March 2010 : \" Mr. Ngobeni is charged with four separate counts of Larceny and one count of Illegal Practice of Law . The present status of the case is ' Rearrest Ordered ' , and he is considered a fugitive from justice by the State of Connecticut . \" Mr Ngobeni 's status as a fugitive from justice makes his appointment in your Department , especially in a legal capacity , greatly problematic . In an attempt to dismiss his status as a fugitive , your letter states that Paul Ngobeni has visited the USA \" a number of times since the first time the allegation was made . \" Mr Ngobeni may well have visited the United States since the first allegation . However , it must be clarified whether he made these trips after the 28 March 2008 , when the warrant for his arrest was issued , and whether he visited the state of Connecticut or neighbouring states . For Mr Ngobeni to have done so would be highly unlikely , as he would have been arrested and subject to the \" effective extradition arrangements \" to which your letter refers . Therefore , the argument that Mr Ngobeni 's freedom of movement between the United States and South Africa serves to confirm his non-fugitive status , holds little weight . Arguing that Mr Ngobeni 's position as a fugitive can be disputed given his brazen re-involvement in South Africa 's public life is more a testament to his audacious behaviour than proof that he is innocent of the allegations made against him . Factual Oversights Your letter refers to a December 2007 court finding ; see Transcript page 8 , lines 10 - 19 , as proof that Mr Ngobeni is not barred from practicing law in the United States . Furthermore , it is argued that the highest court in Massachusetts refused to grant a request for Mr Ngobeni to be disbarred based on his Connecticut voluntary resignation , expressly noting that \" ... the Connecticut court 's jurisdiction was disputed , no wrongdoing was established and no disbarment was ordered . \" At one point , your letter goes so far as to accuse Mr Ngobeni 's detractors of refusing \" ... to familiarise themselves with the actual transcript from the court which is publically available . It is one of those inconvenient truths they prefer not to reveal . \" The truth is inconvenient indeed . In a subsequent decision made in Massachusetts in February 2009 , which you conveniently omitted to mention , the court overruled the decision mentioned in your letter . It was found that , given Mr Ngobeni 's voluntary resignation in Connecticut after a series of allegations of professional misconduct , the state of Massachusetts is permitted to institute reciprocal discipline against him . Mr Ngobeni would therefore be barred from legal practice in this state . The court concluded that : \" ... the respondent 's voluntary resignation in Connecticut unaccompanied by an admission or finding of misconduct warrants the imposition of reciprocal discipline in Massachusetts without the need to litigate the validity of the Connecticut charges . If an attorney like the respondent may permanently resign in another State in the face of serious allegations of misconduct - here involving multiple clients - but do so without admission of misconduct , and then practice in Massachusetts without restriction unless bar counsel undertakes the burdensome and expensive task of investigating and proving the other State 's charges , it would \" tend [ ] to undermine public confidence in the effectiveness of attorney disciplinary procedures and threaten [ ] harm to the administration of justice and to innocent clients . \" See Transcript : Case Number SJC - 10178 , Supreme Judicial Court for the Country of Suffolk , page 6 , lines 21 - 31 . The Massachusetts ruling confirms that Mr Ngobeni is currently barred from practicing under state law . This case has been referred to the Court of Appeal and is currently awaiting decision . As it stands , the above finding has a significant bearing on the original Connecticut ruling . Given that its outcome has been overruled , the finding of the Connecticut enquiry to which you refer is therefore no longer applicable to discussions concerning Mr Ngobeni 's freedom to practice law in the United States . Given Paul Ngobeni 's proven status as fugitive from justice in the United States , his subsequent appointment as an advisor in your Department raises serious questions about the NIA clearance procedures followed as part of his application process . On 8 September 2009 , you confirmed that Mr Ngobeni had been vetted by the intelligence services prior to his appointment . Quite how a wanted criminal could have obtained the high level clearance necessary to act in an advisory capacity to a Ministry for which such vetting is of primary importance , given the sensitive nature of the Defence Department 's work , is of the utmost concern . These points powerfully substantiate our initial argument - Paul Ngobeni is highly unsuitable for the position within the Ministry of Defence that he has assumed under your leadership , and for which he is remunerated using taxpayers ' money . I consider this an issue of public importance and will be making the correspondence related to this matter available to the press in the near future . Given the serious nature of this situation , we request that Mr Ngobeni 's appointment in your ministry be urgently reviewed .

Sponsored by DA : Statement by Athol Trollip , Democratic Alliance Parliamentary leader , on Paul Ngobeni ( 22/03/2010 ) / MEDIA STATEMENT / The content on this page is not written by Polity.org.za , but is supplied by third parties . This content does not constitute news reporting by Polity.org.za . On Friday morning , we sent a letter to the Minister o Defence , Lindiwe Sisulu , in response to the letter received from her office on 15 February , concerning the hiring of controversial figure Paul Ngobeni as a legal advisor to her Ministry . The contents of the letter received from the Minister and that of the DA 's response sent on Friday , follow below . The correspondence between the Minister and the Democratic Alliance ( DA ) on this matter stems from a complaint laid with the Presidential Hotline on 14 September 2009 regarding Mr Ngobeni 's appointment . Subsequent to the complaint lodged with the Hotline , the DA , in response to a request from the Ministry of Defence , wrote to Minister Sisulu on 28 January 2010 . In her response to this letter , dated 15 February , the Minister contested our argument that Mr Ngobeni had been suspended from the roll in the United States and is a fugitive from justice - and is therefore highly unsuitable for the advisory position he has assumed in her Ministry . Mr Ngobeni also left his position as deputy registrar at the University of Cape Town under a cloud of suspicion after an internal disciplinary process was conducted . On Friday , we provided the Minister with irrefutable proof of Mr Ngobeni 's status as a wanted criminal and his disbarment in the United States . Faced with the necessary evidence about Mr Ngobeni , Minister Sisulu now has no option but to make a decision about his continued employment in her Ministry . Whether the Minister will take a principled stand against the hiring of unsuitable individuals on the grounds of political patronage , or whether she will decide to perpetuate this corrupt agenda , remains to be seen . Either way , her decision will be a critical indicator of where the ANC government 's true allegiance lies - with their political cronies or with the South African citizenry the government was elected to serve . Dear Mr Trollip Appointment of Dr P Ngobeni as part time advisor Your letter in the above regard , dated 28 January 2010 , as well as your complaint lodged with the Presidential Hotline refer . Repeated allegations have been made regarding Dr Paul Ngobeni . The allegations range from Dr Ngobeni being a fugitive from justice to him having being found guilty of misconduct including theft , larceny etc . None of this is true despite being repeated ad nauseum . A. Dr Ngobeni is a fugitive Dr Ngobeni has been in the USA a number of times since the first time the allegation was made . South Africa and the USA have some of the most effective extradition arrangement and this would have been activated if there was merit to the allegation . He is a public figure and continues to participate in the public life of this country . This is not the behavior of a fugitive from justice . Fugitives hide , and will even assume a different identity . Dr Ngobeni has taken a frontline position in the public domain , as you well know . Hardly the demeanor of a fugitive . B. Dr Ngobeni is banned from practicing law in several states in America This is a baseless allegation that is meant to confuse . First is that he is admitted to more than 8 jurisdictions in the US , including the US Supreme Court itself . In December 2007 , he resigned his membership in the Connecticut state bar and the Court made the following finding : \" ... there are matters pending before Judge Graham now , a jurisdictional challenge by you to his ability to proceed with disbarment and answer by you denying many of the claims made in the presentment that the Disciplinary Counsel has brought . You 're not in any way today , by voluntarily resigning either conceding that the court has jurisdiction to proceed with disbarment or admitting any of the allegations against you in the presentment . Is that correct ? See , Transcript page 8 , lines 10 - 19 . The Court went on to state that \" ... judgment of disbarment has been vacated and that a resignation has been accomplished ... the record will be clear that Mr Ngobeni has n't been disbarred ; that the final resolution is by way of his resignation . \" Dr Ngobeni 's detractors have refused to familiarise themselves with the actual transcript from the court which is publicly available . It is one those inconvenient truths they prefer not to reveal . Dr Ngobeni is still a member of the bar in Massachusetts . A simple investigation will reveal this . In early 2008 the Bar Counsel submitted a motion to a single justice of the Massachusetts highest court seeking disbarment based on his Connecticut voluntary resignation . The court ( Greaney J. ) refused to grant the request and expressly noted that the Connecticut court 's jurisdiction was disputed , no wrongdoing was established and no disbarment ordered . To set the record straight , it is worth repeating what Dr Max Price , the University of Cape Town 's Vice Chancellor had to say on the matter of Dr Ngobeni 's departure from UCT . Writing to staff , Price wrote ; ' The media reported these as allegations of professional misconduct in his role as an attorney in Connecticut USA , as a result of which he had been suspended from practice in Connecticut , New York and Massachusetts . These charges were never proven and they were dropped in Connecticut after he resigned from the Connecticut bar and waived any future right to seek readmission to it . These facts were not known to UCT when Paul Ngobeni was appointed . Confronted with the public allegations , the UCT Council rightly raised concern about the substance of the allegations ... The Council sought , and accepted , independent legal advice that was given at the time , viz . that these matters had no bearing on his employment at UCT and that he was not obliged to reveal them if we did not specifically ask him about them . I believe UCT erred in not making it public at the time that we had cleared Paul Ngobeni of any suggestion that he misled the university . There can be no question that we should have done so . ' Dr Ngobeni is a brilliant legal brain and I have no reason to question his integrity . I appointed him as a legal advisor based on his knowledge and ability to understand and advise me on the legal challenges facing the Department of Defence . Should your information be contrary to the factual assertions detailed here , please feel free to submit these to myself . Yours sincerely L N Sisulu , MP Minister of Defence and Military Veterans 19 March 2010 Minister Lindiwe Sisulu Department of Defence and Military Veterans Private Bag X427 PRETORIA 0001 Response to letter regarding the appointment of Paul Ngobeni Dear Minister Sisulu The response to my initial letter , dated January 28 , 2010 , sent by your office on 15 February , 2010 , appears to be both disingenuous and overlooking of key facts related to Paul Ngobeni 's questionable legal integrity . Key Areas of Concern On March 28 , 2008 , a warrant for the arrest of Mr Ngobeni was issued by a Connecticut court after he failed to report for a court hearing . Communications Officer for the Division of Criminal Justice in the State of Connecticut , Mark A. Dupuis , confirmed the following in writing on 12 March 2010 : \" Mr. Ngobeni is charged with four separate counts of Larceny and one count of Illegal Practice of Law . The present status of the case is ' Rearrest Ordered ' , and he is considered a fugitive from justice by the State of Connecticut . \" Mr Ngobeni 's status as a fugitive from justice makes his appointment in your Department , especially in a legal capacity , greatly problematic . In an attempt to dismiss his status as a fugitive , your letter states that Paul Ngobeni has visited the USA \" a number of times since the first time the allegation was made . \" Mr Ngobeni may well have visited the United States since the first allegation .

He has been listed in the FP 100 Global Thinkers list , the Foreign Policy Magazine 's list of the world 's top 100 minds . David Pearce is a British utilitarian philosopher . In 1998 , he co-founded the World Transhumanist Association ( WTA ) with Nick Bostrom . The association , which later changed its name to Humanity + , advocates transhumanism \u2013an ideology and movement which has emerged to support the recognition and protection of the right of citizens either to maintain or modify their own minds and bodies so as to guarantee them the freedom of choice and informed consent of using human enhancement technologies . ** * Andr\u00e9s Lome\u00f1a : Transhumanism , or human enhancement , suggests the use of new technologies to improve mental and physical abilities , discarding some aspects as stupidity , suffering and so forth . You have been described as technoutopian by critics who write on \u201c Future hypes \u201d . In my opinion , there is something pretty much worse than optimism : radical technopessimism , managed by Paul Virilio , the recently deceased Baudrillard and other thinkers . Why is there such a strong strain between the optimistic and pessimistic overview ? Nick Bostrom : I ca n't recall any instance of me personally being labeled \u201c technoutopian , \u201d although certainly it 's a term that has been applied to transhumanism by some critics . In fact , there is some justice in this criticism . Transhumanism is a very diverse movement , and some individuals who call themselves transhumanists might fairly be called \u201c technoutopian \u201d in the sense of \u201c uncritically accepting of the view that technology will inevitably soon solve all big problems . \u201d I do n't know whether technopessimism is worse or better than technoutopianism . It seems to me that we should try to overcome biases in either direction\u2013 biases towards positive as well as biases towards negative outcomes\u2013and assign probabilities based on evidence and honest judgment rather than on the basis of ideological or temperamental prejudice . David Pearce : Is our quality of life in technologically advanced societies better than life for our hunter - gatherer ancestors on the African savannah ? The answer might seem , \u201c Obviously , yes . \u201d Technopessimists might reply that evidence suggesting we 're on average any happier is thin\u2013and then go on to extrapolate accordingly . Such extrapolation is premature . We 're on the eve of a profound transformation of human nature itself . In theory , we can even recalibrate the hedonic treadmill and become constitutionally happier \u2013relegat - ing pessimism to history . Technopessimism can sometimes be useful when it encourages deeper thought on unanticipated consequences of new technologies , worst - case scenario planning and better riskreward analysis . But if humans were all depressive realists , then we 'd still be living in caves . Transhumanists believe that we can overcome our physical , intellectual , emotional ( and moral ? ) limitations as human beings via the responsible use of technology . For what it 's worth , I 'm a pessimist by temperament . But I ( tentatively ) believe that infotech and biotechnology will deliver billions of years of invincible well - being far richer than anything feasible today . A.L. : There is much fear and even more ignorance . Wikipedia classifies them as follows : infeasibility , playing God argument , Fountain of Youth argument , Brave New World argument , Frankenstein argument or Terminator argument ( based on Our Final Hour by Martin Rees ) . Which of these issues are sound ( understandable ) fears and which are not ? One common criticism uses to be the eschatological vision of transhumanism ( like Marxism and Christianity , for instance ) . In short , how can we struggle against these dystopian points of view ? N.B. : On a case - by - case basis , as well as by trying to identify biases that could affect our judgments across a broad range of cases . Fear is not necessarily a bad thing , provided it 's directed at something that really is dangerous , and that it results in some constructive striving to reduce the danger . For example , it makes good sense to be concerned about pandemic disease , naturally occurring as well as the possibility of bioengineered superbugs . But to fear having the option of delaying disease and senility through some effective rejuvenation therapy is perverse . In fact , I do n't think there are many people who are actually afraid of that , although some might express opposition for ideological reasons . For an illustration of how one might attempt to diagnose and remove a bias affecting judgment across a range of enhancement issues , see a paper on status quo bias ( http://www.nickbostrom.com/ ethics/statusquo.pdf ) , which I wrote together with Toby Ord . D.P. : Hubris / Playing God ? What could be more \u201c godlike \u201d than creating new life ? Not all cultures historically have made the connection between having sex and reproduction ; but we have no such excuse . On the one hand , we condemn writers of computer malware who release corrupt code . Yet we freely propagate our own corrupt code across the generations \u2013notably a lethal genetic disease ( aging ) and a predisposition to anxiety disorders , depression and other nasty Darwinian states of mind . As reproductive medicine advances , what 's wrong with acting as responsible parents instead ? Why not plan the long - term genetic health and happiness of future generations ? Contempt for the flesh / Fountain of Youth argument ? What could show more contempt for the flesh than to champion Darwinian bodies which crumble and die ? As genetic medicine matures , why not design blueprints for perpetually youthful bodies ? Moreover , we will soon have the opportunity to explore richer forms of sensuality ; to magnify the somato-sensory cortex ; and to isolate the molecular signature of sexual desire and amplify its substrates on demand . Transcending the flesh might be an option ; it 's not an obligation . Brave New World ? This argument is harder to dismiss outright . But biotechnology can potentially empower the individual citizen rather than the state . For example , enhancing mood tends to increase personal autonomy and active participation in society . Conversely , low mood is associated with subordination and social withdrawal . Huxley 's soma was wrongly touted as an \u201c ideal pleasure drug . \u201d Truly utopian pharmacology will surpass it . Dehumanization / the Frankenstein argument ? Yes , technology can dehumanize ; and biotech can create monsters . Yet biotech can also create saints and angels . Put less poetically , we will shortly be able \u201c humanize \u201d ourselves . For we can biologically enhance our capacity for empathy \u2013 whether by functionally amplifying our mirror neurons , or by use of pro-social designer empathogens , or by genetically engineering sustained oxytocin-release to promote social trust . Will we do so ? I do n't know . The Terminator argument ? Bioterrorism and \u201c gray goo \u201d are perhaps the most worrying scenarios . But within the next few decades , we will most likely have self - sustaining bases on the Moon and Mars . Even on the most apocalyptic scenarios , any existential risk to intelligent life will thereby be sharply diminished . From an ethical utilitarian perspective , it 's critical that human beings survive to become posthuman . For we are the only species capable of eradicating suffering in all sentient life . We are also the only species smart enough to spread intelligent bliss throughout the accessible universe . A.L. : Probably , the most important problem is the shortage of information . Actually , we do not know too much about Transhumanism , excepting some of Fukuyama 's articles ( initially optimistic and then pessimistic ) . We would like to ask you about the connections between transhumanism and other topics . For instance : Transhumanism and religion : Do you consider yourself religious ? Is there an atheist or agnostic transhumanism ? N.B. : I would call myself agnostic . Most transhumanists appear to be non-religious , but there are also Catholic transhumanists , Mormon transhumanists , Buddhist transhumanists , etc. D.P. : I think it 's hard to reconcile transhumanism and revealed religion . If we want to live in paradise , we will have to engineer itourselves . If we want eternal life , then we 'll need to rewrite our bugridden genetic code and become god-like . \u201c May all that have life be delivered from suffering , \u201d said Gautama Buddha . It 's a wonderful sentiment . Sadly , only hi-tech solutions can ever eradicate suffering from the living world . Compassion alone is not enough . A.L. : Transhumanism and eugenics : Are all transhumanists eugenicist ? Do you have a political program with regards to this topic ? Do you consider yourself a lobby of future generations ? N.B. : The World Transhumanist Association has officially adopted a statement banning all forms of neo-Nazi eugenicists from the organization . ( This was in response to an incident some years ago when one or two such trolls attempted to infiltrate the WTA . ) Transhumanism supports reproductive rights among other human rights . We tend to think that it is better that reproductive decisions be in the hands of parents , in consultation with their doctor , and within broad guidelines laid down by the state . It would be ethically unacceptable , as well as potentially very dangerous , to have the state impose a one-size- fits - all formula on what kind of people should exist in the next generation . If I were a parent , I would consider myself as having a moral duty to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the child which I was about to bring into the world would start his or her life with the best possible chances for a good life . If a pregnant woman can improve her child 's IQ by taking folic acid or choline supplements , and by avoiding alcohol , tobacco , and lead - contaminated drinking water , I believe would be irresponsible for her to fail to take these easy steps . Similarly , if I were using in vitro fertilization , and there were a simple genetic test which could select the embryo with the best genes for health and other desirable capacities , then I believe it would be negligent not to make use of the test . It would be a very small inconvenience for a potentially large gain . D.P. : Transhumanists are n't eugenicists in anything resembling the odious traditional sense . However , humanity is on the brink of a reproductive revolution . Prospective parents will soon be empowered to choose the kinds of children they want to bring into the world . Preimplantation diagnosis is likely to become routine . Designer genomes will follow . Most parents will aspire to have happier , smarter , healthier children . In principle , a majority of people today would probably support use of genetic medicine to prevent diseases such as cystic fibrosis . By contrast , only a minority of people currently favor \u201c enhancement \u201d technologies . But today 's enhancement technologies are tomorrow 's remedial therapies . By the standards of our successors , mortal humans will presumably all seem tragically diseased and dysfunctional . At present we think it 's morally acceptable to pass on to our children the lethal hereditary disease of aging \u2013and a predisposition to various ugly states of mind ( e.g. jealousy , low mood , anxiety , resentment , and loneliness ) adaptive in the ancestral environment . Yet human life could potentially be so much richer . As technology matures , why not replace the cruel genetic roulette of natural selection \u2026?

El proyecto ha sido calificado de tecnout\u00f3pico por cr\u00edticos que lo describen como una de las \u201c hip\u00e9rboles del futuro \u201d . Sin embargo , en mi opini\u00f3n hay algo mucho peor que este optimismo : el tecnopesimismo radical , dirigido por Paul Virilio y el recientemente fallecido Baudrillard , entre otros . \u00bf Por qu\u00e9 existe una intensa pugna entre las conclusiones optimista y pesimista ? Nick Bostrom : No recuerdo haber sido etiquetado como \u201c tecnout\u00f3pico \u201d , aunque seguramente es un t\u00e9rmino usado por algunos cr\u00edticos . De hecho , hay cierta justicia en esa acusaci\u00f3n . El transhumanismo es un movimiento muy diverso y algunos que se hacen llamar transhumanistas podr\u00edan muy bien ser tildados de \u201c tecnout\u00f3picos \u201d en el sentido de \u201c aceptar acr\u00edticamente el punto de vista de que la tecnolog\u00eda resolver\u00e1 pronto e inevitablemente todos nuestros grandes problemas \u201d . No s\u00e9 si el tecnopesimismo es peor o mejor que el tecnoutopismo . Pero me parece que deber\u00edamos intentar superar nuestros prejuicios en cualquier direcci\u00f3n y probar s\u00f3lo las probabilidades basadas en evidencias y juicios honestos y no con base en obcecaciones ideol\u00f3gicas o temperamentales . David Pearce : \u00bf Es nuestra calidad de vida en las sociedades avanzadas tecnol\u00f3gicamente mejor que la de nuestros antepasados cazadores y recolectores de la sabana africana ? Obviamente , la respuesta podr\u00eda ser que s\u00ed . Por su parte , los tecnopesimistas podr\u00edan responder que , en promedio , la evidencia que sugiere que somos m\u00e1s felices es m\u00ednima , extrapolando luego todas las consecuencias de tal deducci\u00f3n . Pero aqu\u00ed toda extrapolaci\u00f3n es prematura . Nos encontramos en v\u00edsperas de una profunda transformaci\u00f3n de la naturaleza humana . En teor\u00eda , podemos calibrar incluso nuestro promedio de bienestar [ hedonic treadmill ] y llegar a ser constitucionalmente felices , relegando a la historia el pesimismo . El tecnopesimismo puede ser \u00fatil cuando alienta un pensamiento riguroso acerca de las consecuencias imprevisibles de las nuevas tecnolog\u00edas , proyectando el peor de los escenarios y , en este sentido , en favor de un an\u00e1lisis a fondo de los riesgo y beneficios . Pero si los seres humanos fueran todos realista-depresivos , a\u00fan estar\u00edamos viviendo en las cavernas . Ciertamente , los transhumanistas consideran que podemos superar nuestras limitaciones f\u00edsicas , intelectuales , emocionales ( \u00bfy morales ? ) mediante el uso responsable de la tecnolog\u00eda . En las cosas importantes soy pesimista por temperamento . Pero ( en principio ) creo que las tecnolog\u00edas inform\u00e1ticas lo mismo que la biotecnolog\u00eda podr\u00edan ofrecer much\u00edsimos a\u00f1os de insuperable bienestar en mayor medida que cualquier otra de las alternativas factibles hoy en d\u00eda . A.L. : Hay muchos miedos y mayor ignorancia . Wikipedia ha sistematizado todos esos temores bajo los siguientes argumentos : infactibilidad , jugueteo con la idea de Dios , Fuente de la Juventud , un Mundo Feliz , Frankenstein o Terminator ( basado en Our final hour , de Martin Rees ) . \u00bf Qu\u00e9 de estas publicaciones son miedos razonables y cu\u00e1les no ? Una cr\u00edtica com\u00fan es la visi\u00f3n escatol\u00f3gica del transhumanismo parecida a la del marxismo y el cristianismo , por ejemplo . \u00bf C\u00f3mo podemos responder a esas opiniones ? N.B. : Partiendo de una base caso por caso , as\u00ed como tratando de identificar las influencias externas que pudieran afectar nuestros juicios en una amplia gama de ejemplos . El miedo no es necesariamente malo , siempre y cuando est\u00e9 enfocado sobre algo realmente peligroso y que , al cabo , redunde en un esfuerzo constructivo para someter cualquier riesgo . Por ejemplo , tiene sentido preocuparse por las pandemias de origen natural as\u00ed como las producidas por potenciales s\u00faper bacterias salidas de la bioingenier\u00eda . Pero experimentar miedo ante la opci\u00f3n de retardar las enfermedades y la senilidad gracias a algunas terapias de rejuvenecimiento eficaces , es perverso . De hecho , no creo que existan muchas personas realmente con miedo , si bien algunos podr\u00edan expresar su oposici\u00f3n por razones ideol\u00f3gicas . Para dar un ejemplo de c\u00f3mo se podr\u00eda tratar de localizar y corregir ciertos prejuicios en torno a una serie de posibles optimizaciones , recomiendo consultar el documento que escrib\u00ed junto con Toby Ord : \u201c The Reversal Test : Eliminating Status Quo Bias in Applied Ethics \u201d ( http:// www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/statusquo.pdf). DP : Jugar con la idea de Dios . Se trata del pecado de hibris : arrogancia desmesurada . \u00bf Pero qu\u00e9 puede ser m\u00e1s arrogante y \u201c divino \u201d que crear nueva vida ? Hist\u00f3ricamente , no todas las culturas han hecho la conexi\u00f3n entre relaciones sexuales y reproducci\u00f3n , pero nosotros no tenemos esa coartada . Por un lado , condenamos a los programadores de malware inform\u00e1tico que liberan c\u00f3digo corrupto en las redes . Sin embargo , nosotros mismos propagamos nuestro c\u00f3digo corrupto a otras generaciones \u2013particularmente , esa enfermedad gen\u00e9tica letal , el envejecimiento ; o las predisposiciones a los trastornos de ansiedad y depresi\u00f3n junto con otros estados de \u00e1nimos ofensivamente darwinianos . A medida que avanza la medicina reproductiva , \u00bfqu\u00e9 hay de malo en actuar como padres responsables ? \u00bf Por qu\u00e9 no planear a largo plazo la salud gen\u00e9tica y la calidad de vida de las generaciones futuras ? Desprecio de la carne / \u00bf Fuente de la Eterna Juventud ? \u00bf Pero qu\u00e9 puede mostrar mayor desprecio por la carne que abogar por esos cuerpos que se desmoronan y mueren ? En la medida en que la medicina gen\u00e9tica se consolide , \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 no planear un modelo preliminar de constituciones eternamente j\u00f3venes ? Por otra parte , pronto tendremos la oportunidad de explorar formas m\u00e1s ricas de sensualidad , ampliar la corteza somato-sensorial y aislar la r\u00fabrica molecular del deseo sexual amplific\u00e1ndolo a voluntad . La trascendencia de la carne podr\u00eda ser una opci\u00f3n \u2026 , no una obligaci\u00f3n . \u00bf Un mundo feliz ? Este argumento es m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de descartar . Aunque la biotecnolog\u00eda puede reafirmar al ciudadano y no al Estado . Por ejemplo , mejorando las iniciativas en favor de una mayor autonom\u00eda personal y de participaci\u00f3n activa en la sociedad . Por el contrario , un estado de \u00e1nimo depresivo se asocia con la subordinaci\u00f3n y el aislamiento social . El soma de Huxley fue err\u00f3neamente considerado una \u201c droga de placer ideal \u201d . La farmacolog\u00eda ut\u00f3pica ser\u00e1 superada . Deshumanizaci\u00f3n / Frankenstein . S\u00ed , la tecnolog\u00eda puede deshumanizar y la biotecnolog\u00eda crear monstruos . Aunque tambi\u00e9n podr\u00eda crear santos y \u00e1ngeles . Dig\u00e1moslo de manera menos po\u00e9tica : dentro de poco ser\u00e1 capaz de \u201c humanizarnos \u201d para que , biol\u00f3gicamente , mejoremos nuestras capacidades de empat\u00eda \u2026 Sea por la amplificaci\u00f3n funcional de nuestras neuronas espejo , mediante empat\u00f3genos de dise\u00f1o pro-sociales o gracias a la ingenier\u00eda gen\u00e9tica que liberar\u00eda oxitocina ambiente y continua para propiciar nuestra confianza social \u00bf Lo haremos ? No lo s\u00e9 . Terminator . El bioterrorismo y la \u201c plaga gris \u201d [ grey goo : colapso global mediante \u201c plagas \u201d de nanotecnolog\u00eda ] son quiz\u00e1 los escenarios m\u00e1s preocupantes . No obstante , en las pr\u00f3ximas d\u00e9cadas contaremos con mayores posibilidades de establecer bases autosustentables en la Luna y Marte . Incluso en los escenarios m\u00e1s apocal\u00edpticos , el riesgo existencial para la vida inteligente se ver\u00e1 marcadamente disminuido . Desde una perspectiva \u00e9tica utilitaria , es fundamental que los seres humanos sobrevivan para convirtirse en \u201c post-humanos \u201d . Somos la \u00fanica especie capaz de erradicar el sufrimiento de toda vida sensible . Asimismo , la \u00fanica especie inteligente como para propagar tal inteligencia en ese universo que nos sea accesible . AL :. Probablemente , el problema m\u00e1s importante es la escasez de informaci\u00f3n . En realidad , no sabemos demasiado acerca de transhumanismo , con excepci\u00f3n de algunos art\u00edculos de Fukuyama ( inicialmente optimista y despu\u00e9s pesimista ) . Me gustar\u00eda hacer conexiones entre el transhumanismo y otros temas , por ejemplo , el transhumanismo y la religi\u00f3n . \u00bf Se consideran religiosos ? \u00bf Hay transhumanismo ateo o agn\u00f3stico ? NB : Me gustar\u00eda decir que soy agn\u00f3stico . La mayor\u00eda de los transhumanistas parecen ser no religiosos , aunque hay transhumanistas cat\u00f3licos , mormones , budistas , etc. DP : Creo que es dif\u00edcil conciliar el transhumanismo con la religi\u00f3n revelada . Si queremos vivir en el para\u00edso , vamos a tener que crearlo nosotros mismos ; si deseamos una vida eterna , entonces tendremos que reescribir nuestra c\u00f3digo gen\u00e9tico plagado de errores y llegar a ser\u2026 celestiales . \u201c Que lo que tiene vida sea libre de sufrir \u201d , dijo el Buda . Un sentimiento maravilloso . Lamentablemente , \u00fanicamente las soluciones de alta tecnolog\u00eda podr\u00e1n alguna vez erradicar el sufrimiento de los seres vivos . La compasi\u00f3n por s\u00ed sola no es suficiente . AL : Transhumanismo y eugenesia . \u00bf Son todos los transhumanistas partidarios de \u00e9sta ? \u00bf Tienen un programa pol\u00edtico al respecto ? \u00bf Se consideran ustedes un lobby de las generaciones futuras ? NB :. La Asociaci\u00f3n Mundial Transhumanista ha expresado oficialmente su rechazo de todas las formas de eugenesia neo-nazi . Esto fue en respuesta a un incidente ocurrido hace algunos a\u00f1os , cuan do ciertos trolls intentaron infiltrarse en la WTA . El transhumanismo defiende los derechos reproductivos , entre otros derechos humanos . Creemos que lo mejor , a este respecto , es que las decisiones reproductivas est\u00e9n en manos de los padres , con base en las consultas con su m\u00e9dico y dentro de las directrices generales establecidas por el Estado . Ser\u00eda \u00e9ticamente inaceptable y potencialmente muy peligroso que cualquier Estado imponga f\u00f3rmulas unitalla para la gente en las pr\u00f3ximas generaciones . Si yo fuera padre , tendr\u00eda la obligaci\u00f3n moral de tomar todas las medidas razonables para asegurarme de que el ni\u00f1o que estuviera a punto de traer al mundo empezara su vida con las mejores oportunidades . Si una mujer embarazada puede mejorar el coeficiente intelectual de su hijo tomando \u00e1cido f\u00f3lico o suplementos de bilineurina y evitando , asimismo , el alcohol , tabaco o cualquier tipo de agua contaminada , creo que ser\u00eda irresponsable para ella dejar al margen estas simples precauciones . Del mismo modo , si recurri\u00f3 a la fecundaci\u00f3n in vitro y gracias a una simple prueba gen\u00e9tica podr\u00eda seleccionar un embri\u00f3n gen\u00e9ticamente saludable , entre otras capacidades deseables , creo que ser\u00eda imprudente no hacer uso de esa prueba . Una peque\u00f1a tarea para una ganancia muy importante . DP : Los transhumanistas no son nada semejantes a los tradicionalmente odiosos eugenisistas . Como quiera , la humanidad se encuentra al borde de una revoluci\u00f3n en materia reproductiva . Muy pronto , los padres tendr\u00e1n la posibilidad de elegir el tipo de hijos que desean traer al mundo . Probablemente , el examen gen\u00e9tico preimplantacional [ utilizado para identificar problemas gen\u00e9ticos en los embriones creados mediante fecundaci\u00f3n in vitro ] pronto se convertir\u00e1 en rutina . Le seguir\u00e1n los genomas de dise\u00f1o . La mayor\u00eda de los padres aspiran a tener hijos m\u00e1s felices , sanos e inteligentes . Por principio , la mayor\u00eda apoyar\u00eda hoy el uso de medicina gen\u00e9tica para prevenir enfermedades como la fibrosis qu\u00edstica . Por el contrario , s\u00f3lo una minor\u00eda favorece las \u201c mejoras \u201d de origen tecnol\u00f3gico . Sin embargo , las tecnolog\u00edas de optimizaci\u00f3n de hoy ser\u00e1n las terapias del ma\u00f1ana . Para los est\u00e1ndares de nuestros sucesores por venir , los humanos de hoy morimos tr\u00e1gicamente enfermos y disfuncionales . Actualmente , creemos que es moralmente aceptable transmitir a nuestros hijos la herencia letal del envejecimiento \u2013junto con una predisposici\u00f3n a varios estados de \u00e1nimo feos ( celos , depresi\u00f3n , ansiedad , rencor y soledad , por ejemplo ) resultado del entorno hereditario . Sin embargo , la vida humana podr\u00eda ser mucho m\u00e1s rica .

He has been listed in the FP 100 Global Thinkers list , the Foreign Policy Magazine 's list of the world 's top 100 minds . David Pearce is a British utilitarian philosopher . In 1998 , he co-founded the World Transhumanist Association ( WTA ) with Nick Bostrom . The association , which later changed its name to Humanity + , advocates transhumanism \u2013an ideology and movement which has emerged to support the recognition and protection of the right of citizens either to maintain or modify their own minds and bodies so as to guarantee them the freedom of choice and informed consent of using human enhancement technologies . ** * Andr\u00e9s Lome\u00f1a : Transhumanism , or human enhancement , suggests the use of new technologies to improve mental and physical abilities , discarding some aspects as stupidity , suffering and so forth . You have been described as technoutopian by critics who write on \u201c Future hypes \u201d . In my opinion , there is something pretty much worse than optimism : radical technopessimism , managed by Paul Virilio , the recently deceased Baudrillard and other thinkers . Why is there such a strong strain between the optimistic and pessimistic overview ? Nick Bostrom : I ca n't recall any instance of me personally being labeled \u201c technoutopian , \u201d although certainly it 's a term that has been applied to transhumanism by some critics . In fact , there is some justice in this criticism . Transhumanism is a very diverse movement , and some individuals who call themselves transhumanists might fairly be called \u201c technoutopian \u201d in the sense of \u201c uncritically accepting of the view that technology will inevitably soon solve all big problems . \u201d I do n't know whether technopessimism is worse or better than technoutopianism . It seems to me that we should try to overcome biases in either direction\u2013 biases towards positive as well as biases towards negative outcomes\u2013and assign probabilities based on evidence and honest judgment rather than on the basis of ideological or temperamental prejudice . David Pearce : Is our quality of life in technologically advanced societies better than life for our hunter - gatherer ancestors on the African savannah ? The answer might seem , \u201c Obviously , yes . \u201d Technopessimists might reply that evidence suggesting we 're on average any happier is thin\u2013and then go on to extrapolate accordingly . Such extrapolation is premature . We 're on the eve of a profound transformation of human nature itself . In theory , we can even recalibrate the hedonic treadmill and become constitutionally happier \u2013relegat - ing pessimism to history . Technopessimism can sometimes be useful when it encourages deeper thought on unanticipated consequences of new technologies , worst - case scenario planning and better riskreward analysis . But if humans were all depressive realists , then we 'd still be living in caves . Transhumanists believe that we can overcome our physical , intellectual , emotional ( and moral ? ) limitations as human beings via the responsible use of technology . For what it 's worth , I 'm a pessimist by temperament . But I ( tentatively ) believe that infotech and biotechnology will deliver billions of years of invincible well - being far richer than anything feasible today . A.L. : There is much fear and even more ignorance . Wikipedia classifies them as follows : infeasibility , playing God argument , Fountain of Youth argument , Brave New World argument , Frankenstein argument or Terminator argument ( based on Our Final Hour by Martin Rees ) . Which of these issues are sound ( understandable ) fears and which are not ? One common criticism uses to be the eschatological vision of transhumanism ( like Marxism and Christianity , for instance ) . In short , how can we struggle against these dystopian points of view ? N.B. : On a case - by - case basis , as well as by trying to identify biases that could affect our judgments across a broad range of cases . Fear is not necessarily a bad thing , provided it 's directed at something that really is dangerous , and that it results in some constructive striving to reduce the danger . For example , it makes good sense to be concerned about pandemic disease , naturally occurring as well as the possibility of bioengineered superbugs . But to fear having the option of delaying disease and senility through some effective rejuvenation therapy is perverse . In fact , I do n't think there are many people who are actually afraid of that , although some might express opposition for ideological reasons . For an illustration of how one might attempt to diagnose and remove a bias affecting judgment across a range of enhancement issues , see a paper on status quo bias ( http://www.nickbostrom.com/ ethics/statusquo.pdf ) , which I wrote together with Toby Ord . D.P. : Hubris / Playing God ? What could be more \u201c godlike \u201d than creating new life ? Not all cultures historically have made the connection between having sex and reproduction ; but we have no such excuse . On the one hand , we condemn writers of computer malware who release corrupt code . Yet we freely propagate our own corrupt code across the generations \u2013notably a lethal genetic disease ( aging ) and a predisposition to anxiety disorders , depression and other nasty Darwinian states of mind . As reproductive medicine advances , what 's wrong with acting as responsible parents instead ? Why not plan the long - term genetic health and happiness of future generations ? Contempt for the flesh / Fountain of Youth argument ? What could show more contempt for the flesh than to champion Darwinian bodies which crumble and die ? As genetic medicine matures , why not design blueprints for perpetually youthful bodies ? Moreover , we will soon have the opportunity to explore richer forms of sensuality ; to magnify the somato-sensory cortex ; and to isolate the molecular signature of sexual desire and amplify its substrates on demand . Transcending the flesh might be an option ; it 's not an obligation . Brave New World ? This argument is harder to dismiss outright . But biotechnology can potentially empower the individual citizen rather than the state . For example , enhancing mood tends to increase personal autonomy and active participation in society . Conversely , low mood is associated with subordination and social withdrawal . Huxley 's soma was wrongly touted as an \u201c ideal pleasure drug . \u201d Truly utopian pharmacology will surpass it . Dehumanization / the Frankenstein argument ? Yes , technology can dehumanize ; and biotech can create monsters . Yet biotech can also create saints and angels . Put less poetically , we will shortly be able \u201c humanize \u201d ourselves . For we can biologically enhance our capacity for empathy \u2013 whether by functionally amplifying our mirror neurons , or by use of pro-social designer empathogens , or by genetically engineering sustained oxytocin-release to promote social trust . Will we do so ? I do n't know . The Terminator argument ? Bioterrorism and \u201c gray goo \u201d are perhaps the most worrying scenarios . But within the next few decades , we will most likely have self - sustaining bases on the Moon and Mars . Even on the most apocalyptic scenarios , any existential risk to intelligent life will thereby be sharply diminished . From an ethical utilitarian perspective , it 's critical that human beings survive to become posthuman . For we are the only species capable of eradicating suffering in all sentient life . We are also the only species smart enough to spread intelligent bliss throughout the accessible universe . A.L. : Probably , the most important problem is the shortage of information . Actually , we do not know too much about Transhumanism , excepting some of Fukuyama 's articles ( initially optimistic and then pessimistic ) . We would like to ask you about the connections between transhumanism and other topics . For instance : Transhumanism and religion : Do you consider yourself religious ? Is there an atheist or agnostic transhumanism ? N.B. : I would call myself agnostic . Most transhumanists appear to be non-religious , but there are also Catholic transhumanists , Mormon transhumanists , Buddhist transhumanists , etc. D.P. : I think it 's hard to reconcile transhumanism and revealed religion . If we want to live in paradise , we will have to engineer itourselves . If we want eternal life , then we 'll need to rewrite our bugridden genetic code and become god-like . \u201c May all that have life be delivered from suffering , \u201d said Gautama Buddha . It 's a wonderful sentiment . Sadly , only hi-tech solutions can ever eradicate suffering from the living world . Compassion alone is not enough . A.L. : Transhumanism and eugenics : Are all transhumanists eugenicist ? Do you have a political program with regards to this topic ? Do you consider yourself a lobby of future generations ? N.B. : The World Transhumanist Association has officially adopted a statement banning all forms of neo-Nazi eugenicists from the organization . ( This was in response to an incident some years ago when one or two such trolls attempted to infiltrate the WTA . ) Transhumanism supports reproductive rights among other human rights . We tend to think that it is better that reproductive decisions be in the hands of parents , in consultation with their doctor , and within broad guidelines laid down by the state . It would be ethically unacceptable , as well as potentially very dangerous , to have the state impose a one-size- fits - all formula on what kind of people should exist in the next generation . If I were a parent , I would consider myself as having a moral duty to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the child which I was about to bring into the world would start his or her life with the best possible chances for a good life . If a pregnant woman can improve her child 's IQ by taking folic acid or choline supplements , and by avoiding alcohol , tobacco , and lead - contaminated drinking water , I believe would be irresponsible for her to fail to take these easy steps . Similarly , if I were using in vitro fertilization , and there were a simple genetic test which could select the embryo with the best genes for health and other desirable capacities , then I believe it would be negligent not to make use of the test . It would be a very small inconvenience for a potentially large gain . D.P. : Transhumanists are n't eugenicists in anything resembling the odious traditional sense . However , humanity is on the brink of a reproductive revolution . Prospective parents will soon be empowered to choose the kinds of children they want to bring into the world . Preimplantation diagnosis is likely to become routine . Designer genomes will follow . Most parents will aspire to have happier , smarter , healthier children . In principle , a majority of people today would probably support use of genetic medicine to prevent diseases such as cystic fibrosis . By contrast , only a minority of people currently favor \u201c enhancement \u201d technologies . But today 's enhancement technologies are tomorrow 's remedial therapies . By the standards of our successors , mortal humans will presumably all seem tragically diseased and dysfunctional . At present we think it 's morally acceptable to pass on to our children the lethal hereditary disease of aging \u2013and a predisposition to various ugly states of mind ( e.g. jealousy , low mood , anxiety , resentment , and loneliness ) adaptive in the ancestral environment . Yet human life could potentially be so much richer . As technology matures , why not replace the cruel genetic roulette of natural selection \u2026?

Por su parte , los tecnopesimistas podr\u00edan responder que , en promedio , la evidencia que sugiere que somos m\u00e1s felices es m\u00ednima , extrapolando luego todas las consecuencias de tal deducci\u00f3n . Pero aqu\u00ed toda extrapolaci\u00f3n es prematura . Nos encontramos en v\u00edsperas de una profunda transformaci\u00f3n de la naturaleza humana . En teor\u00eda , podemos calibrar incluso nuestro promedio de bienestar [ hedonic treadmill ] y llegar a ser constitucionalmente felices , relegando a la historia el pesimismo . El tecnopesimismo puede ser \u00fatil cuando alienta un pensamiento riguroso acerca de las consecuencias imprevisibles de las nuevas tecnolog\u00edas , proyectando el peor de los escenarios y , en este sentido , en favor de un an\u00e1lisis a fondo de los riesgo y beneficios . Pero si los seres humanos fueran todos realista-depresivos , a\u00fan estar\u00edamos viviendo en las cavernas . Ciertamente , los transhumanistas consideran que podemos superar nuestras limitaciones f\u00edsicas , intelectuales , emocionales ( \u00bfy morales ? ) mediante el uso responsable de la tecnolog\u00eda . En las cosas importantes soy pesimista por temperamento . Pero ( en principio ) creo que las tecnolog\u00edas inform\u00e1ticas lo mismo que la biotecnolog\u00eda podr\u00edan ofrecer much\u00edsimos a\u00f1os de insuperable bienestar en mayor medida que cualquier otra de las alternativas factibles hoy en d\u00eda . A.L. : Hay muchos miedos y mayor ignorancia . Wikipedia ha sistematizado todos esos temores bajo los siguientes argumentos : infactibilidad , jugueteo con la idea de Dios , Fuente de la Juventud , un Mundo Feliz , Frankenstein o Terminator ( basado en Our final hour , de Martin Rees ) . \u00bf Qu\u00e9 de estas publicaciones son miedos razonables y cu\u00e1les no ? Una cr\u00edtica com\u00fan es la visi\u00f3n escatol\u00f3gica del transhumanismo parecida a la del marxismo y el cristianismo , por ejemplo . \u00bf C\u00f3mo podemos responder a esas opiniones ? N.B. : Partiendo de una base caso por caso , as\u00ed como tratando de identificar las influencias externas que pudieran afectar nuestros juicios en una amplia gama de ejemplos . El miedo no es necesariamente malo , siempre y cuando est\u00e9 enfocado sobre algo realmente peligroso y que , al cabo , redunde en un esfuerzo constructivo para someter cualquier riesgo . Por ejemplo , tiene sentido preocuparse por las pandemias de origen natural as\u00ed como las producidas por potenciales s\u00faper bacterias salidas de la bioingenier\u00eda . Pero experimentar miedo ante la opci\u00f3n de retardar las enfermedades y la senilidad gracias a algunas terapias de rejuvenecimiento eficaces , es perverso . De hecho , no creo que existan muchas personas realmente con miedo , si bien algunos podr\u00edan expresar su oposici\u00f3n por razones ideol\u00f3gicas . Para dar un ejemplo de c\u00f3mo se podr\u00eda tratar de localizar y corregir ciertos prejuicios en torno a una serie de posibles optimizaciones , recomiendo consultar el documento que escrib\u00ed junto con Toby Ord : \u201c The Reversal Test : Eliminating Status Quo Bias in Applied Ethics \u201d ( http:// www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/statusquo.pdf). DP : Jugar con la idea de Dios . Se trata del pecado de hibris : arrogancia desmesurada . \u00bf Pero qu\u00e9 puede ser m\u00e1s arrogante y \u201c divino \u201d que crear nueva vida ? Hist\u00f3ricamente , no todas las culturas han hecho la conexi\u00f3n entre relaciones sexuales y reproducci\u00f3n , pero nosotros no tenemos esa coartada . Por un lado , condenamos a los programadores de malware inform\u00e1tico que liberan c\u00f3digo corrupto en las redes . Sin embargo , nosotros mismos propagamos nuestro c\u00f3digo corrupto a otras generaciones \u2013particularmente , esa enfermedad gen\u00e9tica letal , el envejecimiento ; o las predisposiciones a los trastornos de ansiedad y depresi\u00f3n junto con otros estados de \u00e1nimos ofensivamente darwinianos . A medida que avanza la medicina reproductiva , \u00bfqu\u00e9 hay de malo en actuar como padres responsables ? \u00bf Por qu\u00e9 no planear a largo plazo la salud gen\u00e9tica y la calidad de vida de las generaciones futuras ? Desprecio de la carne / \u00bf Fuente de la Eterna Juventud ? \u00bf Pero qu\u00e9 puede mostrar mayor desprecio por la carne que abogar por esos cuerpos que se desmoronan y mueren ? En la medida en que la medicina gen\u00e9tica se consolide , \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 no planear un modelo preliminar de constituciones eternamente j\u00f3venes ? Por otra parte , pronto tendremos la oportunidad de explorar formas m\u00e1s ricas de sensualidad , ampliar la corteza somato-sensorial y aislar la r\u00fabrica molecular del deseo sexual amplific\u00e1ndolo a voluntad . La trascendencia de la carne podr\u00eda ser una opci\u00f3n \u2026 , no una obligaci\u00f3n . \u00bf Un mundo feliz ? Este argumento es m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de descartar . Aunque la biotecnolog\u00eda puede reafirmar al ciudadano y no al Estado . Por ejemplo , mejorando las iniciativas en favor de una mayor autonom\u00eda personal y de participaci\u00f3n activa en la sociedad . Por el contrario , un estado de \u00e1nimo depresivo se asocia con la subordinaci\u00f3n y el aislamiento social . El soma de Huxley fue err\u00f3neamente considerado una \u201c droga de placer ideal \u201d . La farmacolog\u00eda ut\u00f3pica ser\u00e1 superada . Deshumanizaci\u00f3n / Frankenstein . S\u00ed , la tecnolog\u00eda puede deshumanizar y la biotecnolog\u00eda crear monstruos . Aunque tambi\u00e9n podr\u00eda crear santos y \u00e1ngeles . Dig\u00e1moslo de manera menos po\u00e9tica : dentro de poco ser\u00e1 capaz de \u201c humanizarnos \u201d para que , biol\u00f3gicamente , mejoremos nuestras capacidades de empat\u00eda \u2026 Sea por la amplificaci\u00f3n funcional de nuestras neuronas espejo , mediante empat\u00f3genos de dise\u00f1o pro-sociales o gracias a la ingenier\u00eda gen\u00e9tica que liberar\u00eda oxitocina ambiente y continua para propiciar nuestra confianza social \u00bf Lo haremos ? No lo s\u00e9 . Terminator . El bioterrorismo y la \u201c plaga gris \u201d [ grey goo : colapso global mediante \u201c plagas \u201d de nanotecnolog\u00eda ] son quiz\u00e1 los escenarios m\u00e1s preocupantes . No obstante , en las pr\u00f3ximas d\u00e9cadas contaremos con mayores posibilidades de establecer bases autosustentables en la Luna y Marte . Incluso en los escenarios m\u00e1s apocal\u00edpticos , el riesgo existencial para la vida inteligente se ver\u00e1 marcadamente disminuido . Desde una perspectiva \u00e9tica utilitaria , es fundamental que los seres humanos sobrevivan para convirtirse en \u201c post-humanos \u201d . Somos la \u00fanica especie capaz de erradicar el sufrimiento de toda vida sensible . Asimismo , la \u00fanica especie inteligente como para propagar tal inteligencia en ese universo que nos sea accesible . AL :. Probablemente , el problema m\u00e1s importante es la escasez de informaci\u00f3n . En realidad , no sabemos demasiado acerca de transhumanismo , con excepci\u00f3n de algunos art\u00edculos de Fukuyama ( inicialmente optimista y despu\u00e9s pesimista ) . Me gustar\u00eda hacer conexiones entre el transhumanismo y otros temas , por ejemplo , el transhumanismo y la religi\u00f3n . \u00bf Se consideran religiosos ? \u00bf Hay transhumanismo ateo o agn\u00f3stico ? NB : Me gustar\u00eda decir que soy agn\u00f3stico . La mayor\u00eda de los transhumanistas parecen ser no religiosos , aunque hay transhumanistas cat\u00f3licos , mormones , budistas , etc. DP : Creo que es dif\u00edcil conciliar el transhumanismo con la religi\u00f3n revelada . Si queremos vivir en el para\u00edso , vamos a tener que crearlo nosotros mismos ; si deseamos una vida eterna , entonces tendremos que reescribir nuestra c\u00f3digo gen\u00e9tico plagado de errores y llegar a ser\u2026 celestiales . \u201c Que lo que tiene vida sea libre de sufrir \u201d , dijo el Buda . Un sentimiento maravilloso . Lamentablemente , \u00fanicamente las soluciones de alta tecnolog\u00eda podr\u00e1n alguna vez erradicar el sufrimiento de los seres vivos . La compasi\u00f3n por s\u00ed sola no es suficiente . AL : Transhumanismo y eugenesia . \u00bf Son todos los transhumanistas partidarios de \u00e9sta ? \u00bf Tienen un programa pol\u00edtico al respecto ? \u00bf Se consideran ustedes un lobby de las generaciones futuras ? NB :. La Asociaci\u00f3n Mundial Transhumanista ha expresado oficialmente su rechazo de todas las formas de eugenesia neo-nazi . Esto fue en respuesta a un incidente ocurrido hace algunos a\u00f1os , cuan do ciertos trolls intentaron infiltrarse en la WTA . El transhumanismo defiende los derechos reproductivos , entre otros derechos humanos . Creemos que lo mejor , a este respecto , es que las decisiones reproductivas est\u00e9n en manos de los padres , con base en las consultas con su m\u00e9dico y dentro de las directrices generales establecidas por el Estado . Ser\u00eda \u00e9ticamente inaceptable y potencialmente muy peligroso que cualquier Estado imponga f\u00f3rmulas unitalla para la gente en las pr\u00f3ximas generaciones . Si yo fuera padre , tendr\u00eda la obligaci\u00f3n moral de tomar todas las medidas razonables para asegurarme de que el ni\u00f1o que estuviera a punto de traer al mundo empezara su vida con las mejores oportunidades . Si una mujer embarazada puede mejorar el coeficiente intelectual de su hijo tomando \u00e1cido f\u00f3lico o suplementos de bilineurina y evitando , asimismo , el alcohol , tabaco o cualquier tipo de agua contaminada , creo que ser\u00eda irresponsable para ella dejar al margen estas simples precauciones . Del mismo modo , si recurri\u00f3 a la fecundaci\u00f3n in vitro y gracias a una simple prueba gen\u00e9tica podr\u00eda seleccionar un embri\u00f3n gen\u00e9ticamente saludable , entre otras capacidades deseables , creo que ser\u00eda imprudente no hacer uso de esa prueba . Una peque\u00f1a tarea para una ganancia muy importante . DP : Los transhumanistas no son nada semejantes a los tradicionalmente odiosos eugenisistas . Como quiera , la humanidad se encuentra al borde de una revoluci\u00f3n en materia reproductiva . Muy pronto , los padres tendr\u00e1n la posibilidad de elegir el tipo de hijos que desean traer al mundo . Probablemente , el examen gen\u00e9tico preimplantacional [ utilizado para identificar problemas gen\u00e9ticos en los embriones creados mediante fecundaci\u00f3n in vitro ] pronto se convertir\u00e1 en rutina . Le seguir\u00e1n los genomas de dise\u00f1o . La mayor\u00eda de los padres aspiran a tener hijos m\u00e1s felices , sanos e inteligentes . Por principio , la mayor\u00eda apoyar\u00eda hoy el uso de medicina gen\u00e9tica para prevenir enfermedades como la fibrosis qu\u00edstica . Por el contrario , s\u00f3lo una minor\u00eda favorece las \u201c mejoras \u201d de origen tecnol\u00f3gico . Sin embargo , las tecnolog\u00edas de optimizaci\u00f3n de hoy ser\u00e1n las terapias del ma\u00f1ana . Para los est\u00e1ndares de nuestros sucesores por venir , los humanos de hoy morimos tr\u00e1gicamente enfermos y disfuncionales . Actualmente , creemos que es moralmente aceptable transmitir a nuestros hijos la herencia letal del envejecimiento \u2013junto con una predisposici\u00f3n a varios estados de \u00e1nimo feos ( celos , depresi\u00f3n , ansiedad , rencor y soledad , por ejemplo ) resultado del entorno hereditario . Sin embargo , la vida humana podr\u00eda ser mucho m\u00e1s rica .

The regalia , jewelry , ceremonial weapons , and ritualistic and funerary objects attest to the recently uncovered evidence of prosperity and achievement of Philippine polities that flourished between the tenth and thirteenth centuries , long before the Spanish discovered and colonized the region . Although the forms and styles of the majority of these works developed locally , some indicate that Philippine craftsmen had been exposed to objects from beyond their borders through the robust cultural connections and maritime trade in Southeast Asia during what was an early Asian economic boom . The Philippine archipelago of over 7,000 islands lies between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean in the region off the Asian mainland known as Island Southeast Asia . During the time when artists and craftsmen created the works in this exhibition , mariners , merchants , missionaries , and emissaries plied the waters connecting the tropical isles to distant lands including China and India . Monsoon winds dictated the comings and goings of merchant ships \u2014 the time of year they docked , how long they stayed , and when they set sail . Port settlements near protected coves such as ancient Butuan by the mouth of the Agusan River where it empties into Butuan Bay in northeastern Mindanao attracted ships and sailors seeking refuge from the strong southwest winds that blew from May to November . Some of these merchant ships traded for the natural resources of what early Indian texts refer to as Survarnadvipa , or \u201c Islands of Gold , \u201d a geographic place name that scholars believe refers to the islands of Southeast Asia , including Sumatra in Indonesia and nearby Mindanao and Luzon in the Philippines . The Philippines has the second largest gold deposit in the world . The works on view here \u2014 from tiny gold tweezers to fabulous pieces of jewelry \u2014 reveal that these natural resources were readily exploited by the local people between the tenth and thirteenth centuries . While the diverse objects offer clues about those who produced and used them , future finds will hopefully provide further information about the once flourishing but now lost cultures that created these sophisticated treasures .

Burial No. 1 , Northeast Mindanao Salvage Project , April 4\u20136 , 1981 . Archaeologist Warren Peterson and his team excavated six graves in the site called Masago near present - day Butuan City in 1981 . The first burial contained the skeletal remains of a young individual of unknown gender lying on its back with arms crossed on the chest . The weight of a large earthenware jar on the lower legs had depressed the leg bones by several centimeters . This photograph shows the jar elevated on a block of soil for analysis . Near the burial , Chinese ceramic sherds of the Northern Song period from kilns in Fujian or Zhejiang suggest that the grave dates to the tenth to twelfth century . Image courtesy of the Locsin Collection . Marinduque , an island near the center of the Philippines , was the site of the first documented discoveries of precolonial gold in the Philippines that were similar to the objects recovered in the 1960s through 1981 . The ornaments were all recovered in ceramic burial jars and wooden coffins by the French explorer Alfred Marche in 1881 . The gold discoveries of more recent decades reveal that these early finds are stylistically consistent with gold works found in association with tenth - and thirteenth - century Chinese export ceramics . In addition to the array of gold objects from various sites throughout the archipelago , archaeologists have recovered hundreds of clay crucibles for smelting gold , gold - working tools , and raw and wrought gold during the excavations of precolonial wooden plank boats ( balangay ) in Butuan in 1976 . In 1981 , a heavy machinery operator working on an irrigation project accidentally discovered a hoard of gold objects in the hamlet of Magroyong near present - day Butuan City on Mindanao island . In the same year , the Locsin Foundation sponsored an archaeological project led by archaeologist Warren Peterson . Under controlled conditions , Peterson recovered six burials in the excavation site called Masago between the barrios of Masao and Ambago near Butuan . The late archaeologist Cecilia Y. Locsin ( 1930 \u2013 2013 ) and her husband , architect Leandro V. Locsin ( 1928\u20131994 ) , played key roles in the collection and documentation of many of these precious objects , which are now preserved for posterity in the Ayala Museum in the Philippines . The Butuan burials yielded Chinese export ceramics from the Song dynasty in association with gold objects and iron objects ; radiocarbon dating of charcoal samples from the graves indicate approximate dates between the tenth and thirteenth centuries . These ceramic finds are primarily wares from kilns in the provinces of Guangdong , Fujian , Jiangxi , and Zhejiang in the south of China , and include white iron-spotted ware and Yue -type greenware . Similar ceramics recovered from other gravesites along with gold adornments have also provided archaeologists with a valuable baseline for dating the associated gold . Set of two barter rings .

Photography by Wig Tysmans , image courtesy of the lender . The Philippines were part of a network of Asian maritime trade . During the period when the objects in this exhibition were produced , there was a boom in the trade linking Southeast Asia to both the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea . The gold piloncito coin and barter rings on view are evidence that currency was in circulation in the Philippines during this period . Similar piloncito also were in use in Java during this time . In addition , slit hoops used for trade or as personal ornaments similar to those from the Philippines on display in the gallery also were produced in the Mekong River delta region of Vietnam , Java , and eastern Indonesia . However , it remains unclear where in Southeast Asia the slit hoop form first originated . Intriguing clues might lie in recent excavations in the northernmost Philippine islands of Batanes that identify a manufacturing site of greenstone ( nephrite ) slit hoops , which archaeologists call \u201c lingling - o . \u201d Dated to approximately 3,000 to 1,000 years ago , archaeological evidence from Batanes indicates that nephrite slit hoops of the type recovered in various sites in Southeast Asia , including Vietnam and Borneo , were produced in the Batanes islands using nephrite imported from Fengtien in Taiwan , located about sixty - two miles to the north . This discovery suggests a long tradition of interregional exchange of products , materials , and ideas pre-dating the timeframe of this exhibition . The Chinese Song state encouraged maritime trade and even sent missions to Southeast Asia to drum up traders for China 's southern ports . Early Chinese historical sources document various Asian trade missions to China , including visits from the polity of Butuan . It was the first Philippine state to establish diplomatic relations with China in the eleventh century and had direct contact with Champa ( a Sino -Vietnamese kingdom ) as early as the tenth century . Traders from Butuan are documented as bringing goods like camphor , cloves , mother - of - pearl , and tortoise shell to China , and returning with gold , silver , and ceremonial flags . Chinese texts also mention traders coming from Ma-i ( probably Mindoro island , just south of Luzon ) to Guangdong . In the thirteenth century the Chinese imported gold from Ma-i. Archaeological finds in the Philippines suggest that traders likely returned home with Chinese ceramics . Among the examples of early gold from the Philippines are pieces with stylistic , iconographic , and technical similarities to distant and neighboring cultures . These shared features suggest both direct and indirect contacts with trading partners in the Asia - Pacific region and beyond . The impressive quality of recovered gold treasures from Butuan suggests that this flourishing port settlement played an important \u2014 and little studied \u2014 role in early Southeast Asia with possible links to the powerful trading empire of Srivijaya in what is now Indonesia . Detail of a neck ornament . Ayala Museum , 81.5171 . Photography by Neal Oshima ; Image courtesy of Ayala Museum . The polity known as Butuan in the southern Philippines rose to commercial prominence in the tenth century , but ultimately declined in the thirteenth century for unknown reasons . The cultural area associated with this land transcended the political boundaries of the present - day Philippine provinces of Agusan del Norte , Agusan del Sur , and Surigao del Sur. Early Chinese sources offer clues to the power of Butuan at its peak . The Song Shi ( History of the Song ) documents that the Butuan king Ch'i-ling , or Kiling , sent emissaries to the Chinese imperial court in 1003 and 1007 and other texts make note of trade between China and Butuan . The astonishing quantities and impressive quality of gold treasures recovered in Butuan suggest that its flourishing port settlement played an until recently little - recognized role in early Southeast Asian trade . Surprisingly , the amount of gold discovered in Butuan far exceeds that found in Sumatra , where the much better known flourishing kingdom of Srivijaya is said to have been located . Highlighted in this section of the exhibition are selections from a spectacular hoard of gold necklaces , chains , waistbands , bangles , ritual bowls , implements , and ceremonial weapons that was accidentally discovered in 1981 in the hamlet of Magroyong near Butuan . Objects from this cache , known as the Surigao Treasure , are among the most intriguing in the collection of early Philippine gold objects assembled from the 1960s to 1981 by archaeologist - collector Cecilia Y. Locsin ( 1930 \u2013 2013 ) and her husband Leandro V. Locsin ( 1928\u20131994 ) that are now part of the collections of the Ayala Museum . The personal adornments recovered from Butuan appear to be primarily elite regalia . These splendid adornments and ritual objects were probably part of a ruling family 's bahandi , or collective heirloom wealth . The identity and fate of the royal family who presumably owned the treasures are unknown . Future excavations in Butuan may provide us with more information about everyday life in the ancient society that produced these technically astounding works . Detail from the Boxer Codex . Collection of the Lilly Library , Indiana University , Bloomington , Indiana . Image courtesy of the Lilly Library . The early use of gold throughout the islands that comprise what we now call the Philippines was widespread . From the illustrations and descriptions in the Boxer Codex ( ca. 1590 ) , a unique document from the collection of the Lilly Library at Indiana University Bloomington , it is evident that both men and women wore gold rings on their ears , neck , arms , and legs . Hammered diadems and fabulous golden waistbands were reserved for those in the highest ranks of society . Chiefs wore multiple layers of gold chains \u2014 often as many as twelve \u2014 wrapped around the neck , with others hanging down in impressive lengths . Both men and women wore multiple strands of gold chains and gold beads around the neck . Ear ornaments were inserted into distended earlobes or worn as ear cuffs . Elite women wore golden hair ornaments and multiple bangles . The men wore stunning gold cuffs and circular leg ornaments on their calves below the knee . Besides personal adornments , ornate gold hilts for weapons and implements attest to the power and prestige associated with the precious material .

The regalia , jewelry , ceremonial weapons , and ritualistic and funerary objects attest to the recently uncovered evidence of prosperity and achievement of Philippine polities that flourished between the tenth and thirteenth centuries , long before the Spanish discovered and colonized the region . Although the forms and styles of the majority of these works developed locally , some indicate that Philippine craftsmen had been exposed to objects from beyond their borders through the robust cultural connections and maritime trade in Southeast Asia during what was an early Asian economic boom . The Philippine archipelago of over 7,000 islands lies between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean in the region off the Asian mainland known as Island Southeast Asia . During the time when artists and craftsmen created the works in this exhibition , mariners , merchants , missionaries , and emissaries plied the waters connecting the tropical isles to distant lands including China and India . Monsoon winds dictated the comings and goings of merchant ships \u2014 the time of year they docked , how long they stayed , and when they set sail . Port settlements near protected coves such as ancient Butuan by the mouth of the Agusan River where it empties into Butuan Bay in northeastern Mindanao attracted ships and sailors seeking refuge from the strong southwest winds that blew from May to November . Some of these merchant ships traded for the natural resources of what early Indian texts refer to as Survarnadvipa , or \u201c Islands of Gold , \u201d a geographic place name that scholars believe refers to the islands of Southeast Asia , including Sumatra in Indonesia and nearby Mindanao and Luzon in the Philippines . The Philippines has the second largest gold deposit in the world . The works on view here \u2014 from tiny gold tweezers to fabulous pieces of jewelry \u2014 reveal that these natural resources were readily exploited by the local people between the tenth and thirteenth centuries . While the diverse objects offer clues about those who produced and used them , future finds will hopefully provide further information about the once flourishing but now lost cultures that created these sophisticated treasures .

Burial No. 1 , Northeast Mindanao Salvage Project , April 4\u20136 , 1981 . Archaeologist Warren Peterson and his team excavated six graves in the site called Masago near present - day Butuan City in 1981 . The first burial contained the skeletal remains of a young individual of unknown gender lying on its back with arms crossed on the chest . The weight of a large earthenware jar on the lower legs had depressed the leg bones by several centimeters . This photograph shows the jar elevated on a block of soil for analysis . Near the burial , Chinese ceramic sherds of the Northern Song period from kilns in Fujian or Zhejiang suggest that the grave dates to the tenth to twelfth century . Image courtesy of the Locsin Collection . Marinduque , an island near the center of the Philippines , was the site of the first documented discoveries of precolonial gold in the Philippines that were similar to the objects recovered in the 1960s through 1981 . The ornaments were all recovered in ceramic burial jars and wooden coffins by the French explorer Alfred Marche in 1881 . The gold discoveries of more recent decades reveal that these early finds are stylistically consistent with gold works found in association with tenth - and thirteenth - century Chinese export ceramics . In addition to the array of gold objects from various sites throughout the archipelago , archaeologists have recovered hundreds of clay crucibles for smelting gold , gold - working tools , and raw and wrought gold during the excavations of precolonial wooden plank boats ( balangay ) in Butuan in 1976 . In 1981 , a heavy machinery operator working on an irrigation project accidentally discovered a hoard of gold objects in the hamlet of Magroyong near present - day Butuan City on Mindanao island . In the same year , the Locsin Foundation sponsored an archaeological project led by archaeologist Warren Peterson . Under controlled conditions , Peterson recovered six burials in the excavation site called Masago between the barrios of Masao and Ambago near Butuan . The late archaeologist Cecilia Y. Locsin ( 1930 \u2013 2013 ) and her husband , architect Leandro V. Locsin ( 1928\u20131994 ) , played key roles in the collection and documentation of many of these precious objects , which are now preserved for posterity in the Ayala Museum in the Philippines . The Butuan burials yielded Chinese export ceramics from the Song dynasty in association with gold objects and iron objects ; radiocarbon dating of charcoal samples from the graves indicate approximate dates between the tenth and thirteenth centuries . These ceramic finds are primarily wares from kilns in the provinces of Guangdong , Fujian , Jiangxi , and Zhejiang in the south of China , and include white iron-spotted ware and Yue -type greenware . Similar ceramics recovered from other gravesites along with gold adornments have also provided archaeologists with a valuable baseline for dating the associated gold . Set of two barter rings .

Photography by Wig Tysmans , image courtesy of the lender . The Philippines were part of a network of Asian maritime trade . During the period when the objects in this exhibition were produced , there was a boom in the trade linking Southeast Asia to both the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea . The gold piloncito coin and barter rings on view are evidence that currency was in circulation in the Philippines during this period . Similar piloncito also were in use in Java during this time . In addition , slit hoops used for trade or as personal ornaments similar to those from the Philippines on display in the gallery also were produced in the Mekong River delta region of Vietnam , Java , and eastern Indonesia . However , it remains unclear where in Southeast Asia the slit hoop form first originated . Intriguing clues might lie in recent excavations in the northernmost Philippine islands of Batanes that identify a manufacturing site of greenstone ( nephrite ) slit hoops , which archaeologists call \u201c lingling - o . \u201d Dated to approximately 3,000 to 1,000 years ago , archaeological evidence from Batanes indicates that nephrite slit hoops of the type recovered in various sites in Southeast Asia , including Vietnam and Borneo , were produced in the Batanes islands using nephrite imported from Fengtien in Taiwan , located about sixty - two miles to the north . This discovery suggests a long tradition of interregional exchange of products , materials , and ideas pre-dating the timeframe of this exhibition . The Chinese Song state encouraged maritime trade and even sent missions to Southeast Asia to drum up traders for China 's southern ports . Early Chinese historical sources document various Asian trade missions to China , including visits from the polity of Butuan . It was the first Philippine state to establish diplomatic relations with China in the eleventh century and had direct contact with Champa ( a Sino -Vietnamese kingdom ) as early as the tenth century . Traders from Butuan are documented as bringing goods like camphor , cloves , mother - of - pearl , and tortoise shell to China , and returning with gold , silver , and ceremonial flags . Chinese texts also mention traders coming from Ma-i ( probably Mindoro island , just south of Luzon ) to Guangdong . In the thirteenth century the Chinese imported gold from Ma-i. Archaeological finds in the Philippines suggest that traders likely returned home with Chinese ceramics . Among the examples of early gold from the Philippines are pieces with stylistic , iconographic , and technical similarities to distant and neighboring cultures . These shared features suggest both direct and indirect contacts with trading partners in the Asia - Pacific region and beyond . The impressive quality of recovered gold treasures from Butuan suggests that this flourishing port settlement played an important \u2014 and little studied \u2014 role in early Southeast Asia with possible links to the powerful trading empire of Srivijaya in what is now Indonesia . Detail of a neck ornament . Ayala Museum , 81.5171 . Photography by Neal Oshima ; Image courtesy of Ayala Museum . The polity known as Butuan in the southern Philippines rose to commercial prominence in the tenth century , but ultimately declined in the thirteenth century for unknown reasons . The cultural area associated with this land transcended the political boundaries of the present - day Philippine provinces of Agusan del Norte , Agusan del Sur , and Surigao del Sur. Early Chinese sources offer clues to the power of Butuan at its peak . The Song Shi ( History of the Song ) documents that the Butuan king Ch'i-ling , or Kiling , sent emissaries to the Chinese imperial court in 1003 and 1007 and other texts make note of trade between China and Butuan . The astonishing quantities and impressive quality of gold treasures recovered in Butuan suggest that its flourishing port settlement played an until recently little - recognized role in early Southeast Asian trade . Surprisingly , the amount of gold discovered in Butuan far exceeds that found in Sumatra , where the much better known flourishing kingdom of Srivijaya is said to have been located . Highlighted in this section of the exhibition are selections from a spectacular hoard of gold necklaces , chains , waistbands , bangles , ritual bowls , implements , and ceremonial weapons that was accidentally discovered in 1981 in the hamlet of Magroyong near Butuan . Objects from this cache , known as the Surigao Treasure , are among the most intriguing in the collection of early Philippine gold objects assembled from the 1960s to 1981 by archaeologist - collector Cecilia Y. Locsin ( 1930 \u2013 2013 ) and her husband Leandro V. Locsin ( 1928\u20131994 ) that are now part of the collections of the Ayala Museum . The personal adornments recovered from Butuan appear to be primarily elite regalia . These splendid adornments and ritual objects were probably part of a ruling family 's bahandi , or collective heirloom wealth . The identity and fate of the royal family who presumably owned the treasures are unknown . Future excavations in Butuan may provide us with more information about everyday life in the ancient society that produced these technically astounding works . Detail from the Boxer Codex . Collection of the Lilly Library , Indiana University , Bloomington , Indiana . Image courtesy of the Lilly Library . The early use of gold throughout the islands that comprise what we now call the Philippines was widespread . From the illustrations and descriptions in the Boxer Codex ( ca. 1590 ) , a unique document from the collection of the Lilly Library at Indiana University Bloomington , it is evident that both men and women wore gold rings on their ears , neck , arms , and legs . Hammered diadems and fabulous golden waistbands were reserved for those in the highest ranks of society . Chiefs wore multiple layers of gold chains \u2014 often as many as twelve \u2014 wrapped around the neck , with others hanging down in impressive lengths . Both men and women wore multiple strands of gold chains and gold beads around the neck . Ear ornaments were inserted into distended earlobes or worn as ear cuffs . Elite women wore golden hair ornaments and multiple bangles . The men wore stunning gold cuffs and circular leg ornaments on their calves below the knee . Besides personal adornments , ornate gold hilts for weapons and implements attest to the power and prestige associated with the precious material .

The others have been gleaned from various articles . ) - \u201c The Caddo Herald is in its forty - fifth year , having continuously been published these years , and we have owned it lo , these last thirty - four years all by ourselves . There is but one other newspaper now in Oklahoma that exceeds The Herald in age , the Eufala Journal . Others were established and died ; notably the Boggy Depot Star , which flourished a short while in 1873 at Boggy Depot , then a great trading place . \u201d - \u201c The M.K. & T. railroad had its terminus in Caddo for two years , 1870 - 1872 . The first train ran across Red River December 25 , 1872 . During these two years Caddo was the most important trading point in Oklahoma . While Caddo was the terminal of the Katy railroad much goods were shipped her , thence transshipped by wagons to Sherman , Bonham , Paris , Gainesville , and other North Texas points . The soldiers and Indians of western Oklahoma were supplied by wagon freight from Caddo . The United States soldiers had been sent by train to Caddo , then marched to Fort Sill . General Frederick Grant and Lawton are remembered by old timers . \u201d - \u201c C. A. Hancock built a steel bridge across Blue at Nail 's Crossing in 1895 , ten miles west of Caddo , in order to get the trade from the then settling Twelve Mile Prairie . Fort McCulloch is located just across Blue at this point . It was here that during the Civil War a company of Confederate soldiers were stationed under the charge of Captain J. H. Nail . A part of the old redoubt is still visible . \u201d - Caddo 's first mayor was Charles E. McPherren . Mr. McPherren went on to become a prominent attorney in both Durant and OKC . He rode with Teddy Roosevelt 's Rough Riders . He was an Oklahoma State Senator in 1921 . He became Major General Charles McPherren , serving in the Oklahoma National Guard , and with the 45th division in World War I. - The first saloon in the Indian Territory was opened in Caddo when the M.K.&T. completed its line . It was owned by a Chickasaw named Johnson , and was operated illegally for quite some time , until the military finally sent in a squad of soldiers to take Johnson into custody and close its doors . - Lydia Starr McPherson was Caddo 's first woman editor . She moved to Caddo in 1874 and married Caddo newspaper editor Granville McPherson . After his death in 1878 Lydia began publication of the Caddo International News , under her own editorial direction , with her sons as printers . The following year she moved her family to Whitesboro , Texas , and established the weekly Whitesboro Democrat , the first newspaper in Texas owned and operated by a woman . - \u201c The third Masonic lodge was organized in Caddo , and the first Grand Lodge of Masons was organized in Caddo , in October , 1873 . Granville McPherson , editor of the old Caddo Banner , was the first Master of the Lodge and the first Grand Master . \u201d Another article says September and also adds the other lodges : \u201c Caddo 's Masonic Lodge is No. 3 . The old No. 1 was at Doaksville , now passed into the past . Eufaula is No. 2 , Atoka is No. 4 , having succeeded to the charter and membership of the old Boggy Depot Lodge . \u201d - The first public school was established in Caddo in 1904 . Subscription schools had existed in Caddo for a number of years . Judge J. L. Rappolee and his brother , Dr. Walter E. Rappolee , contacted a young teacher , George B. Morris form Rice , Texas , who accepted the position of co-principal together with his brother - in - law , L. A. Ellison . \u201c They promised me they would build me a school , \u201d Morris recalled . \u201c The first year I taught classes in the Blue County Court House . Court would be going on in one part of the building and we held classes in another . Bud Maytubby was U.S. Marshal . My salary was $ 50 a month . \u201d That same year , 1904 , school board members kept their promise and work started on a fine new building . G. W. Phillips , P.W. Arnold , and H. M. Dunlap were members of that first school board . Douglas B. Williams , owner of a furniture and hardware store , and father of Cowboy Pink Williams , was another serving on the school board in those early years . Mrs. Matilda LeFlore Manning , widow of Dr. Manning , and member of the prominent Choctaw family , LeFlore , gave five acres on the north edge of town for the building site . John Steger of Bonham , Texas , whose family later moved to Durant , was awarded the contract . The cost was $ 17,000 . The building accommodated all 11 grades until 1912 when a separate high school was built . The Manning School was considered a very fine edifice when it was completed in 1905 . ( from 1972 newspaper article ) - First graduating class , 1908 : Aileen Clinkscales , Thomas Craighead , Mark Hall , William Harrison , Clara Petty , Morgan Ray , Claude Smith . - The first Odd Fellows Lodge in what is now Oklahoma was founded May 8 , 1875 in Caddo . - Major Aaron Harlan built the first store in Caddo . His wife is known as the \u201c mother of Caddo \u201d and that is what is inscribed on her headstone . - In May of 1902 Peter Bloom installed in his blacksmith shop the first modern steam trip hammer in this part of the country . - Judge Freeny was the first man to put a plow into the black land of the nearby prairies . His neighbors in the woods told him he would starve to death if he tried to farm the prairies . He showed them they were wrong , and became one of the richest farmers among the Choctaws . - \u201c Joel Nail , a son of Captain Nail , had vast grazing lands west of town , and was the first to try barb wire to hold cattle and horses . He tested the fence first by driving a herd of cattle against it to see if it would hold . It did . \u201d - Peter Hamer was Caddo 's first blacksmith . - In September of 1918 an army airplane pilot ran low on fuel and landed his craft outside Caddo . D.B. Williams gave him some letters to carry on to Tulsa , making Caddo , according to the Caddo Herald , \u201c probably the first town to have aerial service in Oklahoma , accident though it may have been \u201d . - Dr Fendall , Dr. Williams , and Dr. J.B. Jones were the first to treat Caddo 's early citizens . - J.S. Hancock owned the first of Caddo 's many hotels . It was The Southern . Other hotels over the years have been The Nail Hotel , The Sims , The Saint James , The Railroad Hotel , The Moon Hotel , Williams Hotel , The Brick Hotel , and The Royal Hotel . - Mr. Greer , who died December 28 , 1874 , is believed to be the first adult to die at Caddo from sickness . - First cemetery : January , 1876 . \u201c The Odd Fellows of Caddo are making preparations for enclosing about four aces of ground on the hill east of town for a cemetery . \u201d Mr. Crossett 's parting words from 1934 are profound : \u201c Caddo was a thriving town when Durant was a switch ; when Hugo was a prairie ; when Madill was unborn ; when Coalgate was un- thought - of ; when Ardmore was only in Pennsylvania ; when Idabel was yet to be ; when Atoka was a small village . Yet all have outgrown us . The reason is plain . We did not elect a delegate to Bill Murray 's famous Constitutional Convention ; and tried to live upon the glories of the past . Finding out too late that we could not run the mill with water that is past . Yet Caddo 's part in the history of the state is honorable . That is secure . The future is another thing . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"Oklahoma","span":[387,394],"token_span":[80,80],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The Place where the thriving takes place."},{"text":"Caddo","span":[6889,6893],"token_span":[1383,1383],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The Entity is experiencing a period of desirable events or states."},{"text":"thriving","span":[6901,6908],"token_span":[1386,1386],"role":"Desirability","label":"Desirability","role_definition":"This role describes the state of the Entity.

The others have been gleaned from various articles . ) - \u201c The Caddo Herald is in its forty - fifth year , having continuously been published these years , and we have owned it lo , these last thirty - four years all by ourselves . There is but one other newspaper now in Oklahoma that exceeds The Herald in age , the Eufala Journal . Others were established and died ; notably the Boggy Depot Star , which flourished a short while in 1873 at Boggy Depot , then a great trading place . \u201d - \u201c The M.K. & T. railroad had its terminus in Caddo for two years , 1870 - 1872 . The first train ran across Red River December 25 , 1872 . During these two years Caddo was the most important trading point in Oklahoma . While Caddo was the terminal of the Katy railroad much goods were shipped her , thence transshipped by wagons to Sherman , Bonham , Paris , Gainesville , and other North Texas points . The soldiers and Indians of western Oklahoma were supplied by wagon freight from Caddo . The United States soldiers had been sent by train to Caddo , then marched to Fort Sill . General Frederick Grant and Lawton are remembered by old timers . \u201d - \u201c C. A. Hancock built a steel bridge across Blue at Nail 's Crossing in 1895 , ten miles west of Caddo , in order to get the trade from the then settling Twelve Mile Prairie . Fort McCulloch is located just across Blue at this point . It was here that during the Civil War a company of Confederate soldiers were stationed under the charge of Captain J. H. Nail . A part of the old redoubt is still visible . \u201d - Caddo 's first mayor was Charles E. McPherren . Mr. McPherren went on to become a prominent attorney in both Durant and OKC . He rode with Teddy Roosevelt 's Rough Riders . He was an Oklahoma State Senator in 1921 . He became Major General Charles McPherren , serving in the Oklahoma National Guard , and with the 45th division in World War I. - The first saloon in the Indian Territory was opened in Caddo when the M.K.&T. completed its line . It was owned by a Chickasaw named Johnson , and was operated illegally for quite some time , until the military finally sent in a squad of soldiers to take Johnson into custody and close its doors . - Lydia Starr McPherson was Caddo 's first woman editor . She moved to Caddo in 1874 and married Caddo newspaper editor Granville McPherson . After his death in 1878 Lydia began publication of the Caddo International News , under her own editorial direction , with her sons as printers . The following year she moved her family to Whitesboro , Texas , and established the weekly Whitesboro Democrat , the first newspaper in Texas owned and operated by a woman . - \u201c The third Masonic lodge was organized in Caddo , and the first Grand Lodge of Masons was organized in Caddo , in October , 1873 . Granville McPherson , editor of the old Caddo Banner , was the first Master of the Lodge and the first Grand Master . \u201d Another article says September and also adds the other lodges : \u201c Caddo 's Masonic Lodge is No. 3 . The old No. 1 was at Doaksville , now passed into the past . Eufaula is No. 2 , Atoka is No. 4 , having succeeded to the charter and membership of the old Boggy Depot Lodge . \u201d - The first public school was established in Caddo in 1904 . Subscription schools had existed in Caddo for a number of years . Judge J. L. Rappolee and his brother , Dr. Walter E. Rappolee , contacted a young teacher , George B. Morris form Rice , Texas , who accepted the position of co-principal together with his brother - in - law , L. A. Ellison . \u201c They promised me they would build me a school , \u201d Morris recalled . \u201c The first year I taught classes in the Blue County Court House . Court would be going on in one part of the building and we held classes in another . Bud Maytubby was U.S. Marshal . My salary was $ 50 a month . \u201d That same year , 1904 , school board members kept their promise and work started on a fine new building . G. W. Phillips , P.W. Arnold , and H. M. Dunlap were members of that first school board . Douglas B. Williams , owner of a furniture and hardware store , and father of Cowboy Pink Williams , was another serving on the school board in those early years . Mrs. Matilda LeFlore Manning , widow of Dr. Manning , and member of the prominent Choctaw family , LeFlore , gave five acres on the north edge of town for the building site . John Steger of Bonham , Texas , whose family later moved to Durant , was awarded the contract . The cost was $ 17,000 . The building accommodated all 11 grades until 1912 when a separate high school was built . The Manning School was considered a very fine edifice when it was completed in 1905 . ( from 1972 newspaper article ) - First graduating class , 1908 : Aileen Clinkscales , Thomas Craighead , Mark Hall , William Harrison , Clara Petty , Morgan Ray , Claude Smith . - The first Odd Fellows Lodge in what is now Oklahoma was founded May 8 , 1875 in Caddo . - Major Aaron Harlan built the first store in Caddo . His wife is known as the \u201c mother of Caddo \u201d and that is what is inscribed on her headstone . - In May of 1902 Peter Bloom installed in his blacksmith shop the first modern steam trip hammer in this part of the country . - Judge Freeny was the first man to put a plow into the black land of the nearby prairies . His neighbors in the woods told him he would starve to death if he tried to farm the prairies . He showed them they were wrong , and became one of the richest farmers among the Choctaws . - \u201c Joel Nail , a son of Captain Nail , had vast grazing lands west of town , and was the first to try barb wire to hold cattle and horses . He tested the fence first by driving a herd of cattle against it to see if it would hold . It did . \u201d - Peter Hamer was Caddo 's first blacksmith . - In September of 1918 an army airplane pilot ran low on fuel and landed his craft outside Caddo . D.B. Williams gave him some letters to carry on to Tulsa , making Caddo , according to the Caddo Herald , \u201c probably the first town to have aerial service in Oklahoma , accident though it may have been \u201d . - Dr Fendall , Dr. Williams , and Dr. J.B. Jones were the first to treat Caddo 's early citizens . - J.S. Hancock owned the first of Caddo 's many hotels . It was The Southern . Other hotels over the years have been The Nail Hotel , The Sims , The Saint James , The Railroad Hotel , The Moon Hotel , Williams Hotel , The Brick Hotel , and The Royal Hotel . - Mr. Greer , who died December 28 , 1874 , is believed to be the first adult to die at Caddo from sickness . - First cemetery : January , 1876 . \u201c The Odd Fellows of Caddo are making preparations for enclosing about four aces of ground on the hill east of town for a cemetery . \u201d Mr. Crossett 's parting words from 1934 are profound : \u201c Caddo was a thriving town when Durant was a switch ; when Hugo was a prairie ; when Madill was unborn ; when Coalgate was un- thought - of ; when Ardmore was only in Pennsylvania ; when Idabel was yet to be ; when Atoka was a small village . Yet all have outgrown us . The reason is plain . We did not elect a delegate to Bill Murray 's famous Constitutional Convention ; and tried to live upon the glories of the past . Finding out too late that we could not run the mill with water that is past . Yet Caddo 's part in the history of the state is honorable . That is secure . The future is another thing . \u201d","annotations":[{"text":"Caddo","span":[6889,6893],"token_span":[1383,1383],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The Entity is experiencing a period of desirable events or states."},{"text":"thriving","span":[6901,6908],"token_span":[1386,1386],"role":"Desirability","label":"Desirability","role_definition":"This role describes the state of the Entity.

However , since 1919 that is exactly what it has managed , often against all the odds , to do ! The town is called Mossley , a name shared by it 's Association Football Club , and this is the beginning of it 's story . It is unfortunate that the early years of football in Mossley are rather poorly documented , but it is known that during the 1880's Rugby Football was the town 's major sporting activity and Mossley boasted a team in the Rugby Football Union The team , which played at Luzley , a small hamlet on a hill on the North side of the town , survived until the late 1890 's before the ever increasing popularity of the Association game took it 's toll and the Rugby Club was forced to disband . Before the split between amateurism and professionalism in rugby football took place in 1895 , there was no organised competitive structure in the sport outside of county and international matches . Club matches did take place but only by invitation , much like friendlies today only on a home and away basis . Details of this period in the sport are pretty scarce but it is known that sevaeral Mossley players represented the county and one , Abe Ashworth , played for England after he 'd moved to Oldham . In fact Abe Ashworth 's move from Mossley to Werneth was one of the contributing factors to the split . Mossley accused the Oldham side of paying him to play for them ( a strict no - no in the amateur game ) and an investigation by Lancashire RU revealed that Werneth had offered him a new job as an iron dresser on \u00a3 1 -7s-0d , an increase on the \u00a3 1 he was earning as a weft carrier in the Mossley mills . Ashworth was banned sine die and Werneth were suspended . After a huge outcry though the suspensions were lifted and the ball towards full professionalism in the sport began rolling . A regular fixture around this time was Mossley vs . Oldham but in 1893 , after the last few meetings had ' degenerated into a roughhouse ' , Oldham refused to play Mossley again . Other clubs then took Oldham 's lead and soon there was next to no opposition for Mossley to play against ; a situation that forced them to turn to association football . Mossley Rugby Club - 1893 The earliest recorded Association Football team in Mossley was established around 1898 when a team known as Mossley Britania played in the Ashton & District League Federation . They were joined the following season by Mossley Albion and Mossley Amateurs , the latter of which survived into the 1990's , along with Mossley Ramblers who played in the Oldham & District League and a club named Mossley United who entered several local cup competitions . 1903 saw the formation of another Mossley team known as Park Villa who entered a couple of local cup competitions and played friendlies , twelve months later a change of name saw them become Mossley Juniors , the forerunners of Mossley AFC . Mossley Juniors FC entered the Stalybridge & District League in 1904 having took over the old Rugby ground at Luzley . They opened their first competitive season in poor style as they were hammered 9 - 1 at Dunham Villa . The following week they faced another new Mossley club , named Mossley Volunteers , and the Juniors recorded their first win by 2 - 1 . Other teams encountered that season were Gee Cross Lads , Mossley Ramblers , Hurst St. John's , Earnshaw Ramblers , Shaw Hall United , Littlemoss , Mossley St.Joseph 's and Hurst MNC Reserves . At the end of the season two players H & P Wood were selected to represent the League in a challenge match against the champions Earnshaw Ramblers . The Juniors finished the season with a record of ;- played 20 , won 6 , drawn 1 , lost 13 , goals for 32 aganst 51 , with 13 points . The 1905 - 06 season opened with a 7 - 0 victory over Dukinfield Villa but form deteriated over the rest of the season and the Juniors managed only three more wins , over Mossley Volunteers , Ebenezer Baptist and Mossley St.Joseph 's . Mossley Juniors entered the Oldham & District League for the 1907 - 08 season and played in Division Two of that competition against such teams as Townfield , Heyside Lads , Hollinwood Catholic , Greenacres Lads and Waterhead United . Players who appeared for the Juniors that season included Harry Thwaite , E.Pritchard , P.Wood , L.Shaw , R.Worsnip , G.Tarr , B.Dyson , Harry Garside , C.Hall , Tom Swift , George Booth , C.Stead , C.Hobbs , M.Capstick , J.Swift , Bob Britland , Joe Wood and Jack Flaherty . The West End Amateur League was entered for the 1908 - 09 season and the Juniors managed 3rd position having competed against Roaches Athletic , Stalybridge St. Peter 's , Millbrook MNC , Manchester Road , Hurst St. John's , Ashton United ( not the present one ) , Moorside Wesleyans , Dukinfield Albion , Dukinfield St. Mary 's and Ashton Baptist . It was 1909 and Mossley Juniors , under the guidance of founder and club secretary James T.Howarth , dropped the name Juniors and became known as Mossley Association Football Club , entering the Ashton & District League Division Two . The first game as Mossley AFC was played on 4th September 1909 away to the unlikely named Ashton Independant Methodists Mens Class , a game Mossley lost 2 - 1 , but a week later recordeed their first win 2 - 1 against Dukinfield St. Mark's . Mossley finished the season joint top along with Ashton St. Peter 's 2nd XI but lost a title deciding play-off 3 - 2 . However , the Club won it 's first trophy defeating Ashton IM 3 - 1 . Amongst Mossley 's other opponents that season were Hyde United . Mossley AFC - Ashton Junior Cup Winners 1909 - 10 Ashton League officials were concerned about the disbanding of several clubs in mid season and so it was decided to discontinue the the 2nd Division for the following season . Mossley were duly elected to the First Division . It was however to be an inglorious first season in the now one division Ashton & District League with the team finishing 14th out of 15 clubs and failing to make progress in the cups . Of the players - team captain Frank Jackman , Harry Laming ( later Mayor of Mossley ) , Jepson Shaw and Dick Whalley were the pick and it was consiedered by secretary James T.Howarth that new players would have to be brought in to improve the team for the following season . The arrival of winger Jackie Darley , new captain Jim Davies and goalkeeper Billy Jackson along with the goalscoring exploits of Jack Flaherty and Frank Jackman proved inspirational for Mossley who produced an excellent season to win the Ashton & District League title losing only one League game with a record of ; Played 26 , won 18 , drawn 7 , lost 1 , goals scored 76 against 19 , points 43 . Mossley were also runners up in both the Ashton Challenge Cup and Lady Aitken Cup . It was to be Mossley 's , then nick - named ' The Luzleyites ' , last season at the Luzley ground as they moved to a new ground more central to the town , a disused cricket field and former tip named Seel Fold , part of the Stamford Estate . 1912 - 13 season was Mossley 's first at the new ground with headquarters at the ' Highland Laddie Hotel ' next door to the ground . It was also Mossley 's first season in the white strip that coined the nick - name ' The Lilywhites ' . Previously the team had played in claret and sky blue . On the field it proved to be a case of ' always the bridesmaid ' as they were runners up in the League , Ashton Junior Cup and Lady Aitken Cup . One interesting feature about the early days of the club was that it was n't uncommon to play two matches on the same day , and it was unfortunate for Mossley that it was on one such day that they had to play the two cup finals . The 1913 - 14 season was another fine one for Mossley AFC , finishing runners up in the League to Droylsden and winning the Lady Aitken Cup in a twice replayed final against Droylsden with over 13,000 spectators attending the three games at Hurst Cross . 360 minutes football had been played before Councillor W.Scholes was able to present the ' beautiful Challenge Cup ' , presented by Lady Aitken to the Ashton & District League , to Mossley captain Arthur Sugden . Gate receipts for the three games were \u00a3 168 12s 4d . Marcroft was the leading scorer with 25 goals and the 3,000 + that witnessed the home fixture with local rivals Mossley Celtic was a new record for Seel Fold , while 3,595 saw the Ashton Junior Cup final which Mossley lost to Ashton St. Peter 's at Hurst Cross . Mossley AFC - Ashton & District League Lady Aitken Cup Winners 1913 - 14 Mossley had a new team captain for the 1914 - 15 season in Arthur Burman and enjoyed another exellent season winning the Ashton & District League and also the Manchester Junior Cup beating Middleton in the final and the Lady Aitken Cup beating Denton St. Lawrence 2 - 1 . Jack Cockcroft was the leading scorer with over 25 goals including five in a 7 - 0 win over Abbey Hey . Mossley AFC - Ashton & District League Champions , Manchester Junior Cup Winners , Lady Aitken Cup Winners 1914 - 15 After four successful seasons in the Ashton & District League the Mossley club decided it was time for a new challenge and they joined the South East Lancashire League for the 1915 - 16 season . With new centre forward John McMenemy scoring at will Mossley made a great start to the season and were leading the table by four points when on the 1st January 1916 it was decided at a meeting of the Mossley AFC committee to disband the club for the remainder of the season due to the war . The following season the club re-formed in the belief that the war would soon be over and they entered the Manchester Amateur League and again made a great start with McMenemy 's goals again a highlight . Unfortunately it was to be another incomplete season . At a meeting of the Mossley AFC held at the Highland Laddie Hotel on 22nd January 1917 , it was decided to disband the club for the duration of the war . There had been a loss of several pounds on the season 's workings , mainly through other clubs failing to fulfill their engagements . Several members of the team and also of the committee , had been ' called to the colours ' and it was felt that the best thing to do for the present was to close down . No League tables were issued for the Manchester Amateur League but the member clubs at the beginning of the season were :- Armstrong Whitworth , Droylsden , Dukinfield , Edge Lane Athletic , Heaton Park , Mersey Athletic , Mossley , New Moss Colliery , Openshaw , Partington Steel Works , Siemens , Westinghouse and Woodhouses . At a meeting held on 11th December 1918 it was decided to re-form Mossley AFC now that the war was over . The decision was taken to join the Manchester Section of the Lancashire Combination for the season to begin on 4th January 1919 . Oddly enough Mossley were unable to resume on that date as heavy snow prevented the scheduled home game against Hurst from taking place . Average crowds for the season were around the 2,000 mark and the club had had a very prosperous half season commencing with a balance in hand of \u00a3 26 and finishing up with a balance of \u00a3 76 on the right side . Jack Flaherty and Jack Cockcroft were regular marksmen as Mossley finished runners up in the section to Stalybridge Celtic . Altrincham , Hurst , Monk 's Hall , Witton Albion , Northwich Victoria and Marple completed the section line up in a season that ended on 19th May . A general meeting held at the end of the season suggested that the committee needed to decide what League to enter for the 1919 - 20 season . It was decided to rescind an earlier decision to rejoin the Combination and to explore the prospect of joining a new League for Cheshire that had been muted . A special meeting convened by the Cheshire Football Association was held at the Mosley Hotel , Manchester and several clubs were invited to join a new League to be known as the Cheshire County League . Mossley were one of several clubs not invited at the time but who applied later and were accepted . It was decided at a later meeting of the Mossley AFC committee to become a professional club for the first time and to employ as many professional footballers as finances would allow .

However , since 1919 that is exactly what it has managed , often against all the odds , to do ! The town is called Mossley , a name shared by it 's Association Football Club , and this is the beginning of it 's story . It is unfortunate that the early years of football in Mossley are rather poorly documented , but it is known that during the 1880's Rugby Football was the town 's major sporting activity and Mossley boasted a team in the Rugby Football Union The team , which played at Luzley , a small hamlet on a hill on the North side of the town , survived until the late 1890 's before the ever increasing popularity of the Association game took it 's toll and the Rugby Club was forced to disband . Before the split between amateurism and professionalism in rugby football took place in 1895 , there was no organised competitive structure in the sport outside of county and international matches . Club matches did take place but only by invitation , much like friendlies today only on a home and away basis . Details of this period in the sport are pretty scarce but it is known that sevaeral Mossley players represented the county and one , Abe Ashworth , played for England after he 'd moved to Oldham . In fact Abe Ashworth 's move from Mossley to Werneth was one of the contributing factors to the split . Mossley accused the Oldham side of paying him to play for them ( a strict no - no in the amateur game ) and an investigation by Lancashire RU revealed that Werneth had offered him a new job as an iron dresser on \u00a3 1 -7s-0d , an increase on the \u00a3 1 he was earning as a weft carrier in the Mossley mills . Ashworth was banned sine die and Werneth were suspended . After a huge outcry though the suspensions were lifted and the ball towards full professionalism in the sport began rolling . A regular fixture around this time was Mossley vs . Oldham but in 1893 , after the last few meetings had ' degenerated into a roughhouse ' , Oldham refused to play Mossley again . Other clubs then took Oldham 's lead and soon there was next to no opposition for Mossley to play against ; a situation that forced them to turn to association football . Mossley Rugby Club - 1893 The earliest recorded Association Football team in Mossley was established around 1898 when a team known as Mossley Britania played in the Ashton & District League Federation . They were joined the following season by Mossley Albion and Mossley Amateurs , the latter of which survived into the 1990's , along with Mossley Ramblers who played in the Oldham & District League and a club named Mossley United who entered several local cup competitions . 1903 saw the formation of another Mossley team known as Park Villa who entered a couple of local cup competitions and played friendlies , twelve months later a change of name saw them become Mossley Juniors , the forerunners of Mossley AFC . Mossley Juniors FC entered the Stalybridge & District League in 1904 having took over the old Rugby ground at Luzley . They opened their first competitive season in poor style as they were hammered 9 - 1 at Dunham Villa . The following week they faced another new Mossley club , named Mossley Volunteers , and the Juniors recorded their first win by 2 - 1 . Other teams encountered that season were Gee Cross Lads , Mossley Ramblers , Hurst St. John's , Earnshaw Ramblers , Shaw Hall United , Littlemoss , Mossley St.Joseph 's and Hurst MNC Reserves . At the end of the season two players H & P Wood were selected to represent the League in a challenge match against the champions Earnshaw Ramblers . The Juniors finished the season with a record of ;- played 20 , won 6 , drawn 1 , lost 13 , goals for 32 aganst 51 , with 13 points . The 1905 - 06 season opened with a 7 - 0 victory over Dukinfield Villa but form deteriated over the rest of the season and the Juniors managed only three more wins , over Mossley Volunteers , Ebenezer Baptist and Mossley St.Joseph 's . Mossley Juniors entered the Oldham & District League for the 1907 - 08 season and played in Division Two of that competition against such teams as Townfield , Heyside Lads , Hollinwood Catholic , Greenacres Lads and Waterhead United . Players who appeared for the Juniors that season included Harry Thwaite , E.Pritchard , P.Wood , L.Shaw , R.Worsnip , G.Tarr , B.Dyson , Harry Garside , C.Hall , Tom Swift , George Booth , C.Stead , C.Hobbs , M.Capstick , J.Swift , Bob Britland , Joe Wood and Jack Flaherty . The West End Amateur League was entered for the 1908 - 09 season and the Juniors managed 3rd position having competed against Roaches Athletic , Stalybridge St. Peter 's , Millbrook MNC , Manchester Road , Hurst St. John's , Ashton United ( not the present one ) , Moorside Wesleyans , Dukinfield Albion , Dukinfield St. Mary 's and Ashton Baptist . It was 1909 and Mossley Juniors , under the guidance of founder and club secretary James T.Howarth , dropped the name Juniors and became known as Mossley Association Football Club , entering the Ashton & District League Division Two . The first game as Mossley AFC was played on 4th September 1909 away to the unlikely named Ashton Independant Methodists Mens Class , a game Mossley lost 2 - 1 , but a week later recordeed their first win 2 - 1 against Dukinfield St. Mark's . Mossley finished the season joint top along with Ashton St. Peter 's 2nd XI but lost a title deciding play-off 3 - 2 . However , the Club won it 's first trophy defeating Ashton IM 3 - 1 . Amongst Mossley 's other opponents that season were Hyde United . Mossley AFC - Ashton Junior Cup Winners 1909 - 10 Ashton League officials were concerned about the disbanding of several clubs in mid season and so it was decided to discontinue the the 2nd Division for the following season . Mossley were duly elected to the First Division . It was however to be an inglorious first season in the now one division Ashton & District League with the team finishing 14th out of 15 clubs and failing to make progress in the cups .

L\u00f6wis < martin at v.loewis.de > - Status - Final - Type - Standards Track - Created - 22 - Apr-2009 - Python-Version - 3.1 - Post-History - Abstract File names , environment variables , and command line arguments are defined as being character data in POSIX ; the C APIs however allow passing arbitrary bytes - whether these conform to a certain encoding or not . This PEP proposes a means of dealing with such irregularities by embedding the bytes in character strings in such a way that allows recreation of the original byte string . Rationale The C char type is a data type that is commonly used to represent both character data and bytes . Certain POSIX interfaces are specified and widely understood as operating on character data , however , the system call interfaces make no assumption on the encoding of these data , and pass them on as - is . With Python 3 , character strings use a Unicode - based internal representation , making it difficult to ignore the encoding of byte strings in the same way that the C interfaces can ignore the encoding . On the other hand , Microsoft Windows NT has corrected the original design limitation of Unix , and made it explicit in its system interfaces that these data ( file names , environment variables , command line arguments ) are indeed character data , by providing a Unicode - based API ( keeping a C -char - based one for backwards compatibility ) . For Python 3 , one proposed solution is to provide two sets of APIs : a byte-oriented one , and a character - oriented one , where the character - oriented one would be limited to not being able to represent all data accurately . Unfortunately , for Windows , the situation would be exactly the opposite : the byte-oriented interface cannot represent all data ; only the character - oriented API can . As a consequence , libraries and applications that want to support all user data in a cross- platform manner have to accept mish - mash of bytes and characters exactly in the way that caused endless troubles for Python 2.x . With this PEP , a uniform treatment of these data as characters becomes possible . The uniformity is achieved by using specific encoding algorithms , meaning that the data can be converted back to bytes on POSIX systems only if the same encoding is used . Being able to treat such strings uniformly will allow application writers to abstract from details specific to the operating system , and reduces the risk of one API failing when the other API would have worked . Specification On Windows , Python uses the wide character APIs to access character - oriented APIs , allowing direct conversion of the environmental data to Python str objects ( PEP 277 ) . On POSIX systems , Python currently applies the locale 's encoding to convert the byte data to Unicode , failing for characters that cannot be decoded . With this PEP , non-decodable bytes >= 128 will be represented as lone surrogate codes U+DC80..U+DCFF . Bytes below 128 will produce exceptions ; see the discussion below . To convert non-decodable bytes , a new error handler ( PEP 293 ) \u201c surrogateescape \u201d is introduced , which produces these surrogates . On encoding , the error handler converts the surrogate back to the corresponding byte . This error handler will be used in any API that receives or produces file names , command line arguments , or environment variables . The error handler interface is extended to allow the encode error handler to return byte strings immediately , in addition to returning Unicode strings which then get encoded again ( also see the discussion below ) . Byte-oriented interfaces that already exist in Python 3.0 are not affected by this specification . They are neither enhanced nor deprecated . External libraries that operate on file names ( such as GUI file choosers ) should also encode them according to the PEP . Discussion This surrogateescape encoding is based on Markus Kuhn 's idea that he called UTF - 8 b [ 3 ] . While providing a uniform API to non-decodable bytes , this interface has the limitation that chosen representation only \u201c works \u201d if the data get converted back to bytes with the surrogateescape error handler also . Encoding the data with the locale 's encoding and the ( default ) strict error handler will raise an exception , encoding them with UTF - 8 will produce non-sensical data . Data obtained from other sources may conflict with data produced by this PEP . Dealing with such conflicts is out of scope of the PEP . This PEP allows the possibility of \u201c smuggling \u201d bytes in character strings . This would be a security risk if the bytes are security - critical when interpreted as characters on a target system , such as path name separators . For this reason , the PEP rejects smuggling bytes below 128 . If the target system uses EBCDIC , such smuggled bytes may still be a security risk , allowing smuggling of e.g. square brackets or the backslash . Python currently does not support EBCDIC , so this should not be a problem in practice . Anybody porting Python to an EBCDIC system might want to adjust the error handlers , or come up with other approaches to address the security risks . Encodings that are not compatible with ASCII are not supported by this specification ; bytes in the ASCII range that fail to decode will cause an exception . It is widely agreed that such encodings should not be used as locale charsets . For most applications , we assume that they eventually pass data received from a system interface back into the same system interfaces . For example , an application invoking os.listdir ( ) will likely pass the result strings back into APIs like os.stat ( ) or open ( ) , which then encodes them back into their original byte representation . Applications that need to process the original byte strings can obtain them by encoding the character strings with the file system encoding , passing \u201c surrogateescape \u201d as the error handler name . For example , a function that works like os . listdir , except for accepting and returning bytes , would be written as : def listdir_b ( dirname ) : fse = sys.getfilesystemencoding ( ) dirname = dirname . decode ( fse , \" surrogateescape \" ) for fn in os.listdir ( dirname ) : # fn is now a str object yield fn.encode ( fse , \" surrogateescape \" ) The extension to the encode error handler interface proposed by this PEP is necessary to implement the ' surrogateescape ' error handler , because there are required byte sequences which cannot be generated from replacement Unicode . However , the encode error handler interface presently requires replacement Unicode to be provided in lieu of the non-encodable Unicode from the source string . Then it promptly encodes that replacement Unicode . In some error handlers , such as the ' surrogateescape ' proposed here , it is also simpler and more efficient for the error handler to provide a pre-encoded replacement byte string , rather than forcing it to calculating Unicode from which the encoder would create the desired bytes . A few alternative approaches have been proposed : - create a new string subclass that supports embedded bytes - use different escape schemes , such as escaping with a NUL character , or mapping to infrequent characters . Of these proposals , the approach of escaping each byte XX with the sequence U+0000 U+00 XX has the disadvantage that encoding to UTF - 8 will introduce a NUL byte in the UTF - 8 sequence . As a consequence , C libraries may interpret this as a string termination , even though the string continues . In particular , the gtk libraries will truncate text in this case ; other libraries may show similar problems . References Copyright This document has been placed in the public domain .

For example , a function that works like os . listdir , except for accepting and returning bytes , would be written as : def listdir_b ( dirname ) : fse = sys.getfilesystemencoding ( ) dirname = dirname . decode ( fse , \" surrogateescape \" ) for fn in os.listdir ( dirname ) : # fn is now a str object yield fn.encode ( fse , \" surrogateescape \" ) The extension to the encode error handler interface proposed by this PEP is necessary to implement the ' surrogateescape ' error handler , because there are required byte sequences which cannot be generated from replacement Unicode . However , the encode error handler interface presently requires replacement Unicode to be provided in lieu of the non-encodable Unicode from the source string . Then it promptly encodes that replacement Unicode . In some error handlers , such as the ' surrogateescape ' proposed here , it is also simpler and more efficient for the error handler to provide a pre-encoded replacement byte string , rather than forcing it to calculating Unicode from which the encoder would create the desired bytes . A few alternative approaches have been proposed : - create a new string subclass that supports embedded bytes - use different escape schemes , such as escaping with a NUL character , or mapping to infrequent characters . Of these proposals , the approach of escaping each byte XX with the sequence U+0000 U+00 XX has the disadvantage that encoding to UTF - 8 will introduce a NUL byte in the UTF - 8 sequence . As a consequence , C libraries may interpret this as a string termination , even though the string continues . In particular , the gtk libraries will truncate text in this case ; other libraries may show similar problems . References Copyright This document has been placed in the public domain .

MEAD , Royal Navy ( Retired ) . In introducing the subject of this article the writer is not quite sure whether an apology is due to its readers . Captain Marryat was at one period of his career in very bad odour in the states . During his visit in 1837 the newspapers declared that they would lynch him . He was burnt in effigy and copies of his novels were thrown to feed the flames . He himself wrote , \" I shall be tarred and feathered yet before I get out of the country . \" They thought he was a \" spy , \" intent on making a book ridiculing the American nation , and he did not improve matters by a speech he made in Toronto . As a matter of fact he had no idea of being offensive , as the subsequent reconciliations proved . Boston took him to its heart , and the New England Galaxy came out with a headline , \" Marryat a Boston Boy , \" and went on to point out that his maternal grandfather was Frederick Geyer , an eminent merchant of that city . His mother Charlotte and her two sisters were born on Summer Street . It is to be hoped , therefore , that the hatchet has long been buried , and that on account of the lasting merits of his work , a happy memory of him may now survive . Frederick Marryat was born on July 10 , 1792 , at 4 Catharine Court , not far from the old Tower of London . The place was demolished in 1913 to make room for the important and imposing building of the Port of London Authority , which now looms up as a notable landmark over River Thames . Marryat 's chief recognition to fame was in the writing of fiction , and there is no doubt that his novels such as Peter Simple , Jacob Faithful , and Mr. Midshipman Easy , to quote only a few of the score or so he produced , have assured him an established place in English literature . It is , however , to another aspect of his work that reference is made here . Before taking to the writing of fiction , Marryat had in 1817 published the first edition of his Code of Signals for the Merchant Service . His biographers have little to say about this branch of the author 's activity . David Hannay in his Life of Frederick Marryat ( 1889 ) merely records that \" his code of signals , which was not literature ( and perhaps on that account only the more lucrative ) was an appreciable income to him throughout his life . \" Now it is thought that a narrative of this signal code , while supplying the omission , may prove of interest to nautical readers . The Dictionary of National Biography asserts that Marryat based his work upon Sir Home Popham 's well - known naval code of 1812 , but it is very much to be doubted if this was the case . Marryat hardly employed any of the flag characters used by Popham . Indeed Marryat 's symbols were very original and very well chosen , while many of Popham 's were complicated and did not succeed for very long . Further , most of Marryat 's flags , with minor modifications , are included in the International Code of today , a survival of 115 years , which says a good deal for their suitability . It was also stated by a rival codist of the name of Watson that Marryat imitated the work of Commander Thomas Lynn who produced a signal book in 1814 . There is very little resemblance in the two codes , and Lynn 's was far too insignificant to suggest copying . The following is Marryat 's introduction to his first edition : When the immense number of Vessels employed in the Merchant Service of Great Britain is considered , and the advantages that would arise from their being able to communicate to each other the intelligence they have obtained , or the distresses under which they labour , it is a circumstance both of surprise and regret , that no Code of Signals for their use has been hitherto adopted . There have , however , been various obstacles to the accomplishment of this object . Among these may be enumerated the expense of providing the necessary number of flags , and the difficulty of working them , for want of a code sufficiently simple and intelligible ; but the most important obstacle seems to have been that such signals would have interfered with those of his Majesty 's Service . Indeed , as during the War most merchantmen sailed under convoy , and as it was absolutely necessary to forbid communications between private ships while under the direction of men of war , the utility of such a code of signals would then have been very limited . But now that with the prospect of a long Peace , our merchantmen are roaming through every navigable sea , and a man-of - war is almost as seldom seen as her protection is required , no such objection can be made to a system that must prove of general and essential benefit . It may indeed be urged that our merchant service has hitherto gone on without it ; but it may safely be affirmed , that many vessels and their crews have been lost , which , had signals been in use , might have been preserved . The Master of a merchant vessel who sees another steering into danger , has at present no means to warn her of it , but must endure the agonizing sensation of following her with his eye , till she is dashed to pieces on the rocks ; and many a vessel that has sprung a leak , or met with some serious accident , within sight of another , sinks during the night ; when had she been able to communicate the particulars of her distress , and the assistance she required , the crew at least , if not the vessel , might have been saved . In like manner , ships making the land , when bad weather or contrary winds or tides may occasion great delay , in boats putting off from the shore to inquire the cause of their distress , returning back with the information , and then bringing them the articles of which they stand in need , by the use of a set of signals generally understood , may explain their wants at once , and thus avoid a delay which is frequently dangerous , and sometimes fatal in its consequences . Independently of these important considerations , great advantages as well as comforts would arise to all parties interested in maritime concerns , from the establishment of signals . Merchants and shipowners would know that their vessels and goods had proceeded so far on their voyage by a given time ; Underwriters would have the satisfaction of receiving the same intelligence of the vessels they had insured ; and the relatives of the passengers and crews , would have the pleasing information that their friends were well , long before it could be communicated in any other mode . In the plan now submitted to the consideration of the shipowners of Great Britain , the number of flags required for signals , compared to those employed in his Majesty 's service , is so much reduced , that the expense of providing them will be trifling ; and the system is so much simplified , as to be rendered perfectly easy in the execution . It is earnestly recommended to Masters of Vessels to read this book until they are perfectly acquainted with its contents ; and to avail themselves of periods of leisure to practise the use of the Signals , so that , when occasion requires , they may be able to make the necessary communications with precision and dispatch . The reference to insurance underwriters was probably prompted by the fact that Marryat 's father , Joseph , was chairman of the committee of Lloyd's . The allusion to the provision of \" wants \" was in connection with one part of the vocabulary which was termed Wanting Stores . The flags to be used in the code consisted of ten numerals , a telegraph flag , a rendezvous flag , two distinguishing pendants , and a numeral pendant , fifteen pieces in all . In shape the numeral flags were as follows : Nos. 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 , and 9 rectangular ; 4 and 6 triangular , and 5 and 0 swallow -tailed . The author was very anxious to do without the complications of substitutes , and , therefore , no duplicate figures occurred in any groups of the code . Substitute flags for repeating a sign already in use , have always been a source of embarrassment . It is true that the International Code of Signals has done without them hitherto , but circumstances have at length proved too exacting , and they are to be included , to the number of three , in the present revision which comes into force in 1934 . In his later editions Marryat had to acknowledge that substitutes would at times be required , for instance , for signaling numbers such as 2211 . The two distinguishing pendants were to be adopted for this purpose , and later on four substitutes were allotted . The code reached its eighth edition in 1841 , and this was the last to be produced under the aegis of the talented author . He disposed of the copyright to the people who published it , Messrs . Richardson , and from thence onwards it was edited by that firm , first by J. M. Richardson and afterwards by G. B. Richardson . Captain Marryat was entitled by the agreement to receive one quarter of the profits on all copies sold during his lifetime . In the year following the arrangement they jointly cleared between five and six hundred pounds . Long after its author 's death , on August 9 , 1848 , the Code of Signals continued to flourish . The last edition seems to have been in 1879 , for nothing later is deposited in the British Museum . By that time it had greatly swollen in bulk , and the book was twice as thick as in 1817 . The Richardsons also introduced \" geometrical shapes \" for calms or for distant signaling , and a system of lights for night communication , but neither scheme seems to have been very popularly adopted . As to the use of the code generally , it may be said that it had quite an exceptional universal vogue ; the profit of \u00a3 500 a year alone shows that . Marshall 's Royal Naval Biography of 1831 records that it was then used in the British and French navies , in all the principal ports in both these kingdoms , in Calcutta and Bombay , at the Cape of Good Hope and other English settlements , and by the mercantile marine of North America . It was published in the Dutch and Italian languages , and by order of the French government no merchant vessel could be insured unless these signals were on board . On June 19 , 1833 , Captain Marryat was informed that the King of France had conferred upon him the cross of the Legion of Honour , sur le compte que je lui ai rendu des services que vous avez rendu \u00e0 la science et \u00e0 la navigation . Undoubtedly this referred to the Code of Signals . Later on there were translations in Spanish and German . In the twelfth edition ( 1854 ) the editor writes : An European vessel is rarely met with unprovided with these signals . This has induced me to vary the title of the work to that of the Universal Code of Signals for the Mercantile Marine of all Nations . As to the usefulness of the code , the following letter to the Editor of the Nautical Magazine in 1840 may be quoted : Sir , - I have had on many occasions cause to regret that Captain Marryat 's Code of Signals were not to be found on board every British merchant vessel ; their trifling cost , the facility with which they may be used , and their very great utility , I think warrant it . As a proof I will state an instance in which through their instrumentality the vessel under my command was saved , if not from shipwreck , at least from any serious injury . We were sailing through Torres Straits in company with another vessel , both ships having on board Capt. Marryat 's Code of Signals . Our consort ( drawing eighteen inches less water than ourselves , and her commander having passed those straits only four months previously ) led the way . We were sailing at the rate of six miles per hour under plain sail , and the mainsail up , when our consort grazed on one of the innumerable coral patches which intersect those straits . Fortunately she did not stop , but immediately hoisted the signal Starboard , which we had just sufficient time to do , and clear the danger , and on passing it had the appearance of a ridge of prickly coral , with deep water all round it . Did shipowners and underwriters but properly appreciate the value of these signals , no ship would be without them . How much more frequently would they hear from their ships , and as I said before many serious losses and accidents would be averted . Shipmasters should apply for them as part of their stores , if not already provided , and explain the utility of them to their owners , many of whom are not aware of their existence , and few I believe so parsimonious , but would supply them , were they made aware of their intrinsic value . Should you think the above worthy of inserting in your valuable pages , you will by so doing confer an obligation on One Who Has Already Much to Thank You For The first part of the nineteenth century was remarkable for the publication of a considerable number of independent signal books , invented by a variety of naval officers . The following list gives some idea of this activity . 1 | 1814 | | Thomas Lynn||Commander ||Honourable East India Company 's Service . | | 1816 || Nathaniel Squire ||Master ||R.N.| | 1821||Joseph Conolly ||Master-at-Arms||R.N.| | 1828 || Henry Raper||Admiral | | 1832 || Barnard L. Watson||Lieutenant ||R.N.| | 1835 ||H. C. Phillips ||Lieutenant ||R.N.| | 1835 ||L. J. Rohde ||Captain || Royal Danish Navy .| | 1841||B.J.Walker||Lieutenant ||R.N.| | 1845 ||William Lord||Lieutenant ||R.N.| | 1850 ||A. P. Eardley-Wilmot ||Commander ||R.N.| | 1854 | | Henry J. Rogers of Baltimore ||( ? ) ||U.S.N.| | 1855 | |C. de Reynold - Chauvancy || Captain || French Navy .| Of these , the codes of Lynn and Squire were relatively unimportant . Raper 's was essentially naval . Those of Squire , Phillips , Raper , Rohde , and Reynold all depended fundamentally upon systems of shapes and not upon the colours of flags , although some of them did use coloured flags as a subsidiary alternative . Their inventors were actuated for the most part by a praiseworthy desire for economy , alleging , for instance , that a pendant , a jack , a guidon , a cornet , two balls , a vane , and a wheft , irrespective of colour , were all that were necessary , and that the acquisition of sets of coloured flags was an expense not lightly to be borne by the more humble shipowners . Phillips and Rohde entered into serious rivalry as to the merits of their systems , both of which were heartily damned by an anonymous but authoritative writer in the United Service Journal in 1836 . Experience has shown that distant signals , or those relying solely upon shapes are of no practical use . The International Code from 1900 to the present day has included three elaborate plans of distant signals , all of which now disappear in the 1931 edition . Radio telegraphy is supposed to have contributed to this result , but the fact remains that , with the exception of the standard signal of distress , they have been seldom - probably never , used . Among the above , special mention must be made of Rogers and Reynold , because these two experts alone made a serious bid to compete with Marryat . Reynold , using a system of shapes , but falling back on the coloured bunting of Marryat , made a sustained effort to establish his invention . His book was published in French and English , German , Italian , Spanish , Russian , and Danish . The French government ordered it to be used instead of Marryat's . Rogers , to whom a considerable measure of credit must be given , based his plan on the very admirable and ingenious scheme of the flags being equally recognizable either when extended in a good breeze or when hanging motionless in a flat calm . At one period it might have been considered that these two had succeeded , but as it turned out they never really attained an extensive international patronage . The formation of the committee for producing the Commercial Code in Great Britain seems most likely to have been the result of this rising tide of signal book manufacture , for it must have been extremely embarrassing and confusing to the shipowners and shipmasters of the period to have been assailed by the conflicting claims of this army of inventors . A Commercial Code , backed by the authority of the Board of Trade , suggested itself as an obvious method of combating the trouble . Marryat 's code , against which there could not have been a vestige of official complaint , was not supported by authority - not in England at all events , and latterly not in France - so that something else must be officially sanctioned . The committee acknowledged in their report that they had examined and considered the various codes already in existence , and mentioned by name most of those dealt with above . The Commercial Code of Signals was published in 1857 and had the desired effect of putting a stop to the appearance of promiscuous codes thereafter . Marryat 's flags in 1856 , had , by the adding of a third distinguishing pendant , been brought up to sixteen in number , and of these no less than twelve were adopted for the Commercial Code as they stood . They were Nos. 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , the telegraph and rendezvous flags , and all four pendants , and their places in the new code were respectively S , J , H , B , R , L , T , N , C , D , F , and G. Numbers 4 and 0 were slightly altered by making them rectangular instead of triangular and swallow - tailed , and now became M and K. Number 8 was made into P , the blue peter , by changing its centre from yellow to white . As the Commercial Code at that time only contained nineteen flags , it will be seen that only four new characters had to be contrived . A significant fact is that the Commercial Code does not seem to have done much harm to Marryat 's signals . Many people indeed still preferred to use his , and there were at least five subsequent English editions , besides several in French , Italian , Spanish , and German . Neither the Commercial Code nor Reynold 's can have been perfectly acceptable in France , or why was it still profitable to continue printing Marryat in the French language right up till 1879 ? There are further proofs that Marryat 's code was very long in dying . In 1857 it had already been found useful to issue a pamphlet called Sea Signals Assimilated , by which either Marryat 's or the official code could be adapted to each other . Then in 1873 a Shanghai firm is found publishing a China Coast Signal Book , appendant to Marryat 's Universal Code , and containing a plan for adapting his signals to the Commercial Code . A circumstance which must have been extremely galling to the British authorities was that Her Majesty 's ships continued to ask the Admiralty to supply them with Marryat 's book . In 1869 , an officer mentions the \" almost universal use of Marryat 's code by merchant ships on the East Indies Station . \" In 1870 , it was reported to be impossible to communicate with merchant vessels on the Cape of Good Hope station , on account of their not having the Commercial Code on board . The most recent and probably the last authoritative reference to Marryat 's signals occurs in the important work on flags and buoyage by Captain Victor Carlson , published in Stockholm in 1890 . He states that although discontinued as signals for the merchant service and no longer employed as such by the British Navy , the first section of Marryat 's signal flags are still used by the French Navy and others , for intercourse with the semaphore stations in France . Here it may be observed that the French , who had been such good friends with the code all through the century , being even more partial to it than the British , were continuing to use Marryat 's symbols as long as 73 years after their inception . The writer ventures to think that this constitutes a record unapproached by any other plan of maritime communication known to posterity .

In shape the numeral flags were as follows : Nos. 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 , and 9 rectangular ; 4 and 6 triangular , and 5 and 0 swallow -tailed . The author was very anxious to do without the complications of substitutes , and , therefore , no duplicate figures occurred in any groups of the code . Substitute flags for repeating a sign already in use , have always been a source of embarrassment . It is true that the International Code of Signals has done without them hitherto , but circumstances have at length proved too exacting , and they are to be included , to the number of three , in the present revision which comes into force in 1934 . In his later editions Marryat had to acknowledge that substitutes would at times be required , for instance , for signaling numbers such as 2211 . The two distinguishing pendants were to be adopted for this purpose , and later on four substitutes were allotted . The code reached its eighth edition in 1841 , and this was the last to be produced under the aegis of the talented author . He disposed of the copyright to the people who published it , Messrs . Richardson , and from thence onwards it was edited by that firm , first by J. M. Richardson and afterwards by G. B. Richardson . Captain Marryat was entitled by the agreement to receive one quarter of the profits on all copies sold during his lifetime . In the year following the arrangement they jointly cleared between five and six hundred pounds . Long after its author 's death , on August 9 , 1848 , the Code of Signals continued to flourish . The last edition seems to have been in 1879 , for nothing later is deposited in the British Museum . By that time it had greatly swollen in bulk , and the book was twice as thick as in 1817 . The Richardsons also introduced \" geometrical shapes \" for calms or for distant signaling , and a system of lights for night communication , but neither scheme seems to have been very popularly adopted . As to the use of the code generally , it may be said that it had quite an exceptional universal vogue ; the profit of \u00a3 500 a year alone shows that . Marshall 's Royal Naval Biography of 1831 records that it was then used in the British and French navies , in all the principal ports in both these kingdoms , in Calcutta and Bombay , at the Cape of Good Hope and other English settlements , and by the mercantile marine of North America . It was published in the Dutch and Italian languages , and by order of the French government no merchant vessel could be insured unless these signals were on board . On June 19 , 1833 , Captain Marryat was informed that the King of France had conferred upon him the cross of the Legion of Honour , sur le compte que je lui ai rendu des services que vous avez rendu \u00e0 la science et \u00e0 la navigation . Undoubtedly this referred to the Code of Signals . Later on there were translations in Spanish and German . In the twelfth edition ( 1854 ) the editor writes : An European vessel is rarely met with unprovided with these signals . This has induced me to vary the title of the work to that of the Universal Code of Signals for the Mercantile Marine of all Nations . As to the usefulness of the code , the following letter to the Editor of the Nautical Magazine in 1840 may be quoted : Sir , - I have had on many occasions cause to regret that Captain Marryat 's Code of Signals were not to be found on board every British merchant vessel ; their trifling cost , the facility with which they may be used , and their very great utility , I think warrant it . As a proof I will state an instance in which through their instrumentality the vessel under my command was saved , if not from shipwreck , at least from any serious injury . We were sailing through Torres Straits in company with another vessel , both ships having on board Capt. Marryat 's Code of Signals . Our consort ( drawing eighteen inches less water than ourselves , and her commander having passed those straits only four months previously ) led the way . We were sailing at the rate of six miles per hour under plain sail , and the mainsail up , when our consort grazed on one of the innumerable coral patches which intersect those straits . Fortunately she did not stop , but immediately hoisted the signal Starboard , which we had just sufficient time to do , and clear the danger , and on passing it had the appearance of a ridge of prickly coral , with deep water all round it . Did shipowners and underwriters but properly appreciate the value of these signals , no ship would be without them . How much more frequently would they hear from their ships , and as I said before many serious losses and accidents would be averted . Shipmasters should apply for them as part of their stores , if not already provided , and explain the utility of them to their owners , many of whom are not aware of their existence , and few I believe so parsimonious , but would supply them , were they made aware of their intrinsic value . Should you think the above worthy of inserting in your valuable pages , you will by so doing confer an obligation on One Who Has Already Much to Thank You For The first part of the nineteenth century was remarkable for the publication of a considerable number of independent signal books , invented by a variety of naval officers . The following list gives some idea of this activity . 1 | 1814 | | Thomas Lynn||Commander ||Honourable East India Company 's Service . | | 1816 || Nathaniel Squire ||Master ||R.N.| | 1821||Joseph Conolly ||Master-at-Arms||R.N.| | 1828 || Henry Raper||Admiral | | 1832 || Barnard L. Watson||Lieutenant ||R.N.| | 1835 ||H. C. Phillips ||Lieutenant ||R.N.| | 1835 ||L. J. Rohde ||Captain || Royal Danish Navy .| | 1841||B.J.Walker||Lieutenant ||R.N.| | 1845 ||William Lord||Lieutenant ||R.N.| | 1850 ||A. P. Eardley-Wilmot ||Commander ||R.N.| | 1854 | | Henry J. Rogers of Baltimore ||( ? ) ||U.S.N.| | 1855 | |C. de Reynold - Chauvancy || Captain || French Navy .| Of these , the codes of Lynn and Squire were relatively unimportant . Raper 's was essentially naval . Those of Squire , Phillips , Raper , Rohde , and Reynold all depended fundamentally upon systems of shapes and not upon the colours of flags , although some of them did use coloured flags as a subsidiary alternative . Their inventors were actuated for the most part by a praiseworthy desire for economy , alleging , for instance , that a pendant , a jack , a guidon , a cornet , two balls , a vane , and a wheft , irrespective of colour , were all that were necessary , and that the acquisition of sets of coloured flags was an expense not lightly to be borne by the more humble shipowners . Phillips and Rohde entered into serious rivalry as to the merits of their systems , both of which were heartily damned by an anonymous but authoritative writer in the United Service Journal in 1836 . Experience has shown that distant signals , or those relying solely upon shapes are of no practical use . The International Code from 1900 to the present day has included three elaborate plans of distant signals , all of which now disappear in the 1931 edition . Radio telegraphy is supposed to have contributed to this result , but the fact remains that , with the exception of the standard signal of distress , they have been seldom - probably never , used . Among the above , special mention must be made of Rogers and Reynold , because these two experts alone made a serious bid to compete with Marryat . Reynold , using a system of shapes , but falling back on the coloured bunting of Marryat , made a sustained effort to establish his invention . His book was published in French and English , German , Italian , Spanish , Russian , and Danish . The French government ordered it to be used instead of Marryat's . Rogers , to whom a considerable measure of credit must be given , based his plan on the very admirable and ingenious scheme of the flags being equally recognizable either when extended in a good breeze or when hanging motionless in a flat calm . At one period it might have been considered that these two had succeeded , but as it turned out they never really attained an extensive international patronage . The formation of the committee for producing the Commercial Code in Great Britain seems most likely to have been the result of this rising tide of signal book manufacture , for it must have been extremely embarrassing and confusing to the shipowners and shipmasters of the period to have been assailed by the conflicting claims of this army of inventors . A Commercial Code , backed by the authority of the Board of Trade , suggested itself as an obvious method of combating the trouble . Marryat 's code , against which there could not have been a vestige of official complaint , was not supported by authority - not in England at all events , and latterly not in France - so that something else must be officially sanctioned . The committee acknowledged in their report that they had examined and considered the various codes already in existence , and mentioned by name most of those dealt with above . The Commercial Code of Signals was published in 1857 and had the desired effect of putting a stop to the appearance of promiscuous codes thereafter . Marryat 's flags in 1856 , had , by the adding of a third distinguishing pendant , been brought up to sixteen in number , and of these no less than twelve were adopted for the Commercial Code as they stood . They were Nos. 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , the telegraph and rendezvous flags , and all four pendants , and their places in the new code were respectively S , J , H , B , R , L , T , N , C , D , F , and G. Numbers 4 and 0 were slightly altered by making them rectangular instead of triangular and swallow - tailed , and now became M and K. Number 8 was made into P , the blue peter , by changing its centre from yellow to white . As the Commercial Code at that time only contained nineteen flags , it will be seen that only four new characters had to be contrived . A significant fact is that the Commercial Code does not seem to have done much harm to Marryat 's signals . Many people indeed still preferred to use his , and there were at least five subsequent English editions , besides several in French , Italian , Spanish , and German . Neither the Commercial Code nor Reynold 's can have been perfectly acceptable in France , or why was it still profitable to continue printing Marryat in the French language right up till 1879 ? There are further proofs that Marryat 's code was very long in dying . In 1857 it had already been found useful to issue a pamphlet called Sea Signals Assimilated , by which either Marryat 's or the official code could be adapted to each other . Then in 1873 a Shanghai firm is found publishing a China Coast Signal Book , appendant to Marryat 's Universal Code , and containing a plan for adapting his signals to the Commercial Code . A circumstance which must have been extremely galling to the British authorities was that Her Majesty 's ships continued to ask the Admiralty to supply them with Marryat 's book . In 1869 , an officer mentions the \" almost universal use of Marryat 's code by merchant ships on the East Indies Station . \" In 1870 , it was reported to be impossible to communicate with merchant vessels on the Cape of Good Hope station , on account of their not having the Commercial Code on board . The most recent and probably the last authoritative reference to Marryat 's signals occurs in the important work on flags and buoyage by Captain Victor Carlson , published in Stockholm in 1890 . He states that although discontinued as signals for the merchant service and no longer employed as such by the British Navy , the first section of Marryat 's signal flags are still used by the French Navy and others , for intercourse with the semaphore stations in France . Here it may be observed that the French , who had been such good friends with the code all through the century , being even more partial to it than the British , were continuing to use Marryat 's symbols as long as 73 years after their inception . The writer ventures to think that this constitutes a record unapproached by any other plan of maritime communication known to posterity .

The plane tore through roofs , sheared a mango tree and rammed into a woodworking studio , a printing press and at least two large apartment buildings in the neighbourhood before stopping . \" We heard a huge explosion , and at first we thought it was a gas canister , \" said Timothy Akinyela , 50 , a local newspaper reporter who was watching a football match with friends in a bar near the crash site in a residential street where tin-roofed houses line mud roads . Showing a video he had taken on his phone , he added : \" Then there were some more explosions and everyone ran out . It was terrifying . There was confusion and shouting . \" Crowds of residents surrounded the crash site , delaying emergency services from searching for survivors . Yushau Shuaib , spokesman for the National Emergency Management Agency , said more casualties on the ground were likely but the number was unknown . He said officials were still trying to get an official manifest on the flight . The plane was operated by Dana Air , which normally flies Boeing MD83 aircraft . The nose of the plane was embedded in the three - storey apartment building , damaging only part of the structure . Fires smouldered as several thousand people looked on . A group of men stood atop the landing gear that was smoking and took pictures with their mobile phones . The president said the crash \" has sadly plunged the nation into further sorrow on a day when Nigerians were already in grief over the loss of many other innocent lives in the church bombing in Bauchi state \" , referring to a suicide bombing that killed 10 people .","annotations":[{"text":"all 153 passengers and crew","span":[96,122],"token_span":[18,22],"role":"Rider","label":"Rider","role_definition":"The Rider is being transported by a Vehicle."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-0379-796-frame-Transportation_status","frame":"Transportation_status","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Rider is being transported in a Vehicle, or is moving on foot.","frame_ancestors":["State"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"On 31 October 1999 , he and all 216 other passengers and crew on board EgyptAir Flight 990 were killed when it crashed into the Atlantic Ocean about southeast of Nantucket Island , Massachusetts .

People living in cities and suburbs are not expected to see the comet with the naked eye , but binoculars and telescopes will reveal its cloudy head and perhaps a striking tail , too . Comets are unpredictable , however , so it 's impossible to say how bright this one might become . Already Lulin is an enjoyable target for small telescopes , producing several striking photographs in the predawn sky . The object is best found using a sky map tailored to your location . The discovery The comet was photographed by Chi Sheng Lin using a 16-inch telescope at the Lulin Observatory at Nantou , Taiwan on July 11 , 2007 . But it was a 19 - year old student , Quanzhi Ye at Sun Yat -sen University in Mainland China who first recognized the new object on three images that were taken by Lin. Initially it was thought to be an asteroid , new images taken a week later revealed the telltale presence of a faint coma . The discovery was part of the Lulin Sky Survey project to explore the various populations of small bodies in the solar system , especially objects that possibly could pose a hazard to the Earth . As such , the comet has been christened Comet Lulin , more formally known to astronomers as Comet C/2007 N3 . This comet is the brightest since the surprising outburst of Comet Holmes more than 15 months ago and in the coming weeks will become favorably placed in the evening sky . During mid-to - late February it will probably be about magnitude 5 or 6 , making it perhaps visible to the naked eye in dark , rural locations and easily observable in binoculars or small telescopes . Unusual orbit Brian Marsden of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory has calculated that Comet Lulin passed through the perihelion point of its orbit ( its closest approach to the sun ) on Jan. 10 , 113 million miles ( 182 million kilometers ) from the sun . However , while the comet is now receding from the sun , its distance from the Earth is decreasing , with a minimum of 38 million miles ( 61 million kilometers ) on Feb. 24 . For this reason , the comet should be at its brightest during the last week of February ; then it will fade fast by mid-March . The orbit of Comet Lulin is very nearly a parabola , according to Marsden . It is also rather unusual since it is moving through space in a direction opposite to that of the planets at a very low inclination of just 1.6 - degrees from the ecliptic . As such , because it is moving opposite to the motion of our Earth , the comet will appear to track rather quickly against the background stars as one observes the object from one night to the next . In addition , over the next three weeks , the comet will appear to rise an average of about 20 - minutes earlier each night . Right now , it is best seen in the predawn sky . Rapid track On the night of Feb. 7 , for instance , Lulin will rise above the east-southeast horizon around midnight and will appear at its highest in the sky toward the south at the break of dawn . But on the night of the 24th , when it will be passing nearest to Earth , Lulin will be visible all night , rising in the east at dusk , peaking high in the south shortly after midnight and setting in the west around sunrise . Currently located in the constellation Libra , Comet Lulin will appear to move on a northwest trajectory , crossing over into Virgo on Feb. 11 and passing 3 - degrees north of the 1st-magnitude star Spica in Virgo on Feb. 16 ( for comparison , your clenched fist held at arm 's length measures about 10 - degrees in width ) . On the night of Feb. 23 , now virtually at its peak brightness , the comet will be sitting just 2 - degrees south - southwest of the planet Saturn , which you can use as a benchmark to locate the comet . Moreover , around this time , Comet Lulin will be racing at more than 5 - degrees per day -- that 's roughly the equivalent of the distance between the stars Dubhe and Merak , the \" Pointer Stars \" of the Big Dipper ; so even a few minutes of watching with a telescope should reveal the comet 's slow shift relative to background field stars . On Feb. 27 , the fading comet will slip just 1 - degree south of the 1st-magnitude star , Regulus in Leo . And come the night of March 5 , Lulin -- by then probably between magnitudes 6 and 7 and no longer visible without binoculars or a telescope -- will pass to within 2 - degrees of the famous Beehive Star Cluster in Cancer . Look for an Antitail Comets are visible because radiation from the sun releases gas and dust from the comet . That material then shines with reflected sunlight , creating a cloudy head , or coma , and sometimes one or two tails . Even when it 's at its very brightest , naked - eye observers probably see Comet Lulin as resembling only a dim , fuzzy star . In binoculars , or a small telescope the comet may resemble an apple on a stick ; that is , the comet 's diffuse head or coma should appear round and somewhat condensed toward its center , with perhaps a tinge of blue or green , while a narrow tail of gas extends out to the northwest . In addition , telescopic observers should also look for a \" spike \" of light , pointing in a direction opposite to the tail . This strange effect , called an \" antitail , \" is caused by a thin sheet of dust that is expelled by the comet but normally is visible for a brief interval when the Earth passes through the comet 's orbital plane . But because Earth will remain in the comet 's orbital plane through February and on into March , there will be an ongoing chance of catching a glimpse of the antitail as well . - Online Sky Maps and More - Sky Calendar & Moon Phases - Astrophotography 101 Joe Rao serves as an instructor and guest lecturer at New York 's Hayden Planetarium .

Season three has moved gracefully , like a big cat stalking its prey , from the outset , playing a flipside game where we cleverly alternate between our universe and an alternate one where Olivia is currently resident . Amber 31422 takes place entirely in the alternate universe , where Olivia , having been convinced she 's from that dimension , is starting to guess that maybe she 's been manipulated to think that .

This review contains spoilers . 3.5 Amber 31422 I have three words for the latest Fringe episode , and they 're all ' brilliant ' . Season three has moved gracefully , like a big cat stalking its prey , from the outset , playing a flipside game where we cleverly alternate between our universe and an alternate one where Olivia is currently resident . Amber 31422 takes place entirely in the alternate universe , where Olivia , having been convinced she 's from that dimension , is starting to guess that maybe she 's been manipulated to think that .

But it sure felt that way for fans who were desperately waiting for the band 's fourth full - length release . In actuality , more than 1,800 days passed between the two albums . The 10,000 Days title has been interpreted by most Tool philosophers to be a reference to the approximate period of time between singer Maynard James Keenan 's mom becoming incapacitated by a stroke when Maynard was 11 years old , and the time she died in June , 2003 . Others have interpreted the title to be a reference to the amount of time it takes Saturn to revolve completely around the sun ; this theory is legitimized by comments Keenan made about the philosophical concept of the Saturn return . \u201c That 's the time in your twenty eighth , twenty ninth year when you are presented the opportunity to transform from whatever your hang - ups were before to let the light of knowledge and experience lighten your load , so to speak and let go of old patterns and embrace a new life , \" he once explained to me . \u201c It 's kind of the story of Noah , and the belly of the whale . You sink or swim at that point . And a lot of people do n't make it . Hendrix did n't , Janis Joplin did n't , John Bonham . Kurt Cobain did n't quite make it past his Saturn Return . For me , starting to recognize those patterns , it was very important to start constructing songs that chronicled that process , hoping that my gift back would be to share that path and hope that I could help somebody get past that spot . \u201d Both theories make sense and probably hold relevance . Or maybe the album has nothing to do with either . Tool are the kind of elusive band that likes to play with people 's theories and expectations . One thing 's for sure : Tool released 10,000 Days in North America on May 2 , 2006 , and those who feared the band would stray from the crushing , experimental sounds of Lateralus breathed a smokey THC - laden sigh of relief as soon as they heard it . Like Lateralus , the album was an offbeat , angular excursion that required careful listening to digest . It featured a thrilling combination of songs that tumbled and ripped like a bag of nails in a whirring particle accelerator , and more atmospheric , psychedelic tracks that opened themselves to more introspective or confessional lyrics ; in retrospect some turned out to be too confessional for the band 's enigmatic vocalist . \u201c I think probably the stupidest thing I could have done on 10,000 Days was put myself out there as much as I did with the tracks ' Wings for Marie ( Part 1 ) ' and ' 10,000 Days ( Wings Part 2 ) , ' Keenan said in an interview to promote the album . \u201c I'll never make that mistake again . It just took too much out of me \u2013 too much emotionally , mentally , physically \u2013 all those manifestations . Those songs were exploited and misconstrued , people were flippant and dismissive . I wo n't be doing that anymore . And technically , ' Wings ' is very difficult to pull off . If any one of us is off , it falls apart and makes that thing tragic , and that 's not a good song for me to have fall apart . It 's just too personal . \u201d Tool , \" Wings for Marie ( Pt. 1 ) \" While Keenan has a bittersweet relationship with some of the lyrics on 10,000 Days , he has no qualms with the mastery that went into the songwriting . Tool guitarist Adam Jones , drummer Danny Carey and bassist Justin Chancellor were obsessive about the music , approaching each song from a multitude of angles before committing to the final versions . Instead of going in with a clear idea of what kind of record they wanted to create , Tool shot from the hip , jamming in their practice space until they liked something they came up with ; then they repeated the process ad infinitum . \u201c We had lots ideas from all the jams and crazy things that went on for Lateralus , so we had a few good starting points to go from , \u201d Carey said . \u201c We went into it thinking , ' This is gonna be way easier for us than the last one , ' but in a lot of ways it was n't . We had all become bigger assholes , and everyone 's idiosyncrasies had become even more grinding on each other . But we were smarter and we knew that those are just our personalities , and at the same time we became more aware of how to give each other space and let them explore and do their own thing -- not that it makes you any happier about it when it goes down . \u201d Going into 10,000 Days , Jones was wary about becoming too jaded . Sometimes he felt like Tool had developed the Midas touch and did n't need to work obsessively in order to achieve their desired results . Whenever he felt that way , he made sure to put even more effort into the songs than he thought they needed just so could n't possibly sell the band short . Tool , \" Rosetta Stoned \" \u201c I think the first song we wrote was ' Rosetta Stoned , ' and that was n't easy to finish , \u201d Jones said . \u201c It involved a lot of trial and error and compromising with your band mates in the process of exploring every path that needed to be taken . I kind of compare it to painting . I take my time and try different colors . Or I may go back and sand a little bit to try to get a little bit of translucency . And sometimes the other guys were on the same page with me and sometimes they were n't . \u201d Based on past experience , Keenan knew not to be in the studio when his band mates were in the mood to experiment . On prior albums he had tried writing to a tune that had been written only to have the basic rhythm change dramatically so by the time he was ready to perform what he had composed it no longer complimented the latest band arrangement . Keenan found the process endlessly frustrating , which is why , in 1999 , he left Tool for a while to work on songs with his other band A Perfect Circle . \u201c You can tell which tracks on the album I was away for , \u201d Keenan said . \u201c They 're the ones that kind of meander off and go crazy and there are all these complicated turnarounds and loops . It requires some sort of form of psilocybin to enjoy \u2013 which is great . I love going away and coming back and having something that I get to enjoy because I was n't there in the kitchen helping cook it . I can just enjoy it on the table and go , ' Oh , this is fun . This is tasty . ' And I can add my spice to it and take it to some other level or take it in a different direction lyrically or structurally . \u201d Tool , \" The Pot \" Keenan remains proud of all of the songs Tool wrote for 10,000 Days . His favorites to perform , however are the more straightforward rockers like \u201c The Pot , \u201d and \u201c Jambi , \u201d which reminded him of the raw , primal music the band wrote for their first two releases Opiate and Undertow before they developed the technical skill to play in unconventional meters , insert abrupt rhythmic shifts and explore ebb and flow dynamics and jagged , totally unexpected phrasing . \u201c I was kind of hoping the album would bring back some of the energy we expressed on our early records , \u201d he says . \u201c It was very difficult to get a groove going on some of 10,000 Days because everything was so complex and choppy and like running up an uneven set of stairs with a blindfold and a wooden leg . I wanted to do some of that because I really enjoy the challenge of a puzzle , and putting lyrics to those complex pieces . But I was also looking forward to doing something that would be like running down a set of stairs with my eyes closed and know that I 'm gonna land on my feet . \u201d Creating 10,000 Days involved plenty of hunting and pecking and waiting for the right moment when inspiration hit and everything came together . Unfortunately , those lightning strikes were few and far between and the album was created in fits and starts , like most of Tool 's best material . \u201c When you finally reach the finish line and the floodgates open there 's such a sense of relief , \u201d Jones said . \u201c And when you 're done , you 're going , \u201c Okay , I wish next time when we start working on the new record we could just pick up where we left off , right at this exact moment . ' But it never works t hat way , and if it did , you 'd just wind up redoing the same thing , which we never want to do . \u201d 10,000 Days debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart , selling 564,000 copies during its first week . On June 2 , 2006 , the album was certified platinum by the RIAA . \u201c Having another plaque is nice I guess , but the real thrill of the record comes from the fact that we were true to these musical , magical moments that sometimes happen when the four of us get into a room together , \u201d Carey said . \u201c It 's unexplainable . I do n't know how that vibe happens , but it 's Tool and there 's nothing else that will ever be Tool . And that 's something I 'll always be proud of . \u201d Loudwire contributor Jon Wiederhorn is the author of Raising Hell : Backstage Tales From the Lives of Metal Legends , co-author of Louder Than Hell : The Definitive Oral History of Metal , as well as the co-author of Scott Ian 's autobiography , I 'm the Man : The Story of That Guy From Anthrax , and Al Jourgensen 's autobiography , Ministry : The Lost Gospels According to Al Jourgensen and the Agnostic Front book My Riot !

His favorites to perform , however are the more straightforward rockers like \u201c The Pot , \u201d and \u201c Jambi , \u201d which reminded him of the raw , primal music the band wrote for their first two releases Opiate and Undertow before they developed the technical skill to play in unconventional meters , insert abrupt rhythmic shifts and explore ebb and flow dynamics and jagged , totally unexpected phrasing . \u201c I was kind of hoping the album would bring back some of the energy we expressed on our early records , \u201d he says . \u201c It was very difficult to get a groove going on some of 10,000 Days because everything was so complex and choppy and like running up an uneven set of stairs with a blindfold and a wooden leg . I wanted to do some of that because I really enjoy the challenge of a puzzle , and putting lyrics to those complex pieces . But I was also looking forward to doing something that would be like running down a set of stairs with my eyes closed and know that I 'm gonna land on my feet . \u201d Creating 10,000 Days involved plenty of hunting and pecking and waiting for the right moment when inspiration hit and everything came together . Unfortunately , those lightning strikes were few and far between and the album was created in fits and starts , like most of Tool 's best material . \u201c When you finally reach the finish line and the floodgates open there 's such a sense of relief , \u201d Jones said . \u201c And when you 're done , you 're going , \u201c Okay , I wish next time when we start working on the new record we could just pick up where we left off , right at this exact moment . ' But it never works t hat way , and if it did , you 'd just wind up redoing the same thing , which we never want to do . \u201d 10,000 Days debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart , selling 564,000 copies during its first week . On June 2 , 2006 , the album was certified platinum by the RIAA . \u201c Having another plaque is nice I guess , but the real thrill of the record comes from the fact that we were true to these musical , magical moments that sometimes happen when the four of us get into a room together , \u201d Carey said . \u201c It 's unexplainable . I do n't know how that vibe happens , but it 's Tool and there 's nothing else that will ever be Tool . And that 's something I 'll always be proud of . \u201d Loudwire contributor Jon Wiederhorn is the author of Raising Hell : Backstage Tales From the Lives of Metal Legends , co-author of Louder Than Hell : The Definitive Oral History of Metal , as well as the co-author of Scott Ian 's autobiography , I 'm the Man : The Story of That Guy From Anthrax , and Al Jourgensen 's autobiography , Ministry : The Lost Gospels According to Al Jourgensen and the Agnostic Front book My Riot !

Rural heritage became a central activity through machinery displays , exhibitions and even in some of the equestrian activities . The highly successful ' free ' show for the 150 th anniversary in 2002 proved a model to follow . Surprisingly much of the increased support came not from attracting visitors in from the outside but renewed interest from the local community and indeed the besieged local farming community . As farmers both continue to diversify and begin to understand the role being thrust upon them as ' guardians of the countryside ' the local rural show , the Mid Somerset Show , seems to have re-found a position for the first decades of the 21 st Century .","annotations":[{"text":"the Mid Somerset Show","span":[297,317],"token_span":[59,62],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The concrete or abstract entity that undergoes a change."},{"text":"a cattle show","span":[1244,1256],"token_span":[240,242],"role":"Final_category","label":"Final_category","role_definition":"The type of Entity that results from the change."},{"text":"the Evercreech Farmers Club with an annual ploughing match","span":[675,732],"token_span":[133,141],"role":"Initial_category","label":"Initial_category","role_definition":"The category that the Entity belongs to before it undergoes the change."},{"text":"By the 1870 's","span":[1192,1205],"token_span":[230,233],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"The time at which the Entity undergoes the transformation."},{"text":"this Mid Somerset area","span":[1292,1313],"token_span":[250,253],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The location that the change takes place."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-0005-307-frame-Undergoing","frame":"Undergoing","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Entity is affected by an Event.","frame_ancestors":["Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Mexico experienced its worst rainy season on record starting beginning on September 10 .

Maritime and Historic Archaeological Survey and Aboriginal Archaeological Survey The maritime and historic archaeology function encompasses the location , recording and protection of shipwrecks / maritime archaeology and post European settlement archaeological relics under the provisions of both State and Commonwealth legislation . The Aboriginal archaeology function encompasses the location , recording and protection of aboriginal prehistory and archaeological relics also under both State and Commonwealth legislation . The Archaeological and Aboriginal Relics Preservation Act 1972 provides for the preservation of archaeological and aboriginal relics . It enables the Governor- in-Council to declare land to be an archaeological area for the preservation of relics therein ; establishes an Archaeological Relics Advisory Committee to advise the Minister on all matters it thinks necessary in relation to archaeological relics and the preservation of those relics ; provides for the buying and selling of relics or the possession or display of Aboriginal skeletal remains to be an offence in certain circumstances . The Historic Shipwrecks Act 1981 provides for the protection of historic shipwrecks and relics pertaining thereto ; establishes a Historic Shipwrecks Advisory Committee to advise the Minister ; enables the Minister by notice published in the Government Gazette to declare shipwrecks and relics to be historic and to declare an area to be a protected zone ; provides for a Register of Historic Shipwrecks . The Victorian Government has delegated authority under the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976 [ Commonwealth ] . This act is similar to the Victorian Act but for Commonwealth waters off Victoria . The Victorian Government also acts as a consultant under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1987 . This Act provides a means for the Commonwealth to protect significant Aboriginal areas and objects where existing State laws do not provide effective protection and enables the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to make declarations in respect to those areas and objects after consultation with the relevant State Minister . These functions are administered under both State and Commonwealth legislation . During the 1980s the Victoria Archaeological Survey operated within the same division of the Ministry of Planning and Environment ( VA 1024 ) as the Aboriginal Affairs Unit . At this time developmental work in the area of aboriginal archaeology was funded through the grants process administered by the Aboriginal Affairs Unit ( VA 3101 ) . Particular emphasis was placed on involving and training Aborigines in the work of the Victoria Archaeological Survey . Cultural Awareness officers within Aboriginal Co-operatives throughout the State were trained and funded , as was the Regional Site Officer scheme for training Aborigines in archaeological investigation and analysis , cultural resource management and community liaison . Two committees were established in 1985 to advise whether Aboriginal skeletal remains should be preserved for scientific value or be reburied . They were the Aboriginal Affairs Committee which advised the Museum of Victoria Council on material in state collections and the Skeletal sub- committee of the Aboriginal Relics Advisory Committee which advised the Secretary for Planning and Environment on the holding and disposition of skeletal remains .

This Act provides a means for the Commonwealth to protect significant Aboriginal areas and objects where existing State laws do not provide effective protection and enables the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to make declarations in respect to those areas and objects after consultation with the relevant State Minister . These functions are administered under both State and Commonwealth legislation . During the 1980s the Victoria Archaeological Survey operated within the same division of the Ministry of Planning and Environment ( VA 1024 ) as the Aboriginal Affairs Unit . At this time developmental work in the area of aboriginal archaeology was funded through the grants process administered by the Aboriginal Affairs Unit ( VA 3101 ) . Particular emphasis was placed on involving and training Aborigines in the work of the Victoria Archaeological Survey . Cultural Awareness officers within Aboriginal Co-operatives throughout the State were trained and funded , as was the Regional Site Officer scheme for training Aborigines in archaeological investigation and analysis , cultural resource management and community liaison . Two committees were established in 1985 to advise whether Aboriginal skeletal remains should be preserved for scientific value or be reburied . They were the Aboriginal Affairs Committee which advised the Museum of Victoria Council on material in state collections and the Skeletal sub- committee of the Aboriginal Relics Advisory Committee which advised the Secretary for Planning and Environment on the holding and disposition of skeletal remains . In 1988 - 89 sixteen skeletal remains were returned to local aboriginal communities and relevant interstate authorities .

Welcome to Democracy Now ! , Brian . BRIAN AVERY : Thanks a lot , Amy . Thanks for having me on . AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about what happened to you , and why you 've returned ? BRIAN AVERY : Yeah . I mean , basically pretty much as Juan laid out , you know , I was shot by Israeli forces in a completely unprovoked attack and essentially left for dead . I was getting no medical treatment or anything by them . And since then , I 've undergone , or in the process of undergoing a series of reconstructive surgeries to rebuild the damage to my face that was caused . And so at this point , now that some of the medical stuff is starting to progress and I 'm getting to a better state of health , I 'm very interested in basically prosecuting the soldiers for what , you know , was a criminal act . AMY GOODMAN : Brian , can you describe the day that you were shot ? Where exactly you were , what was happening ? BRIAN AVERY : Yeah . It was in Jenin in the West Bank and we were -- I was working with the international solidarity movement at the time . And at the time , there was a curfew in the town , which was not very uncommon . It was very usual for us to be out on the streets during the curfew . And this was the case . At the time , it was in the afternoon , there had been some gun fire in the area and once that was quieted down , we went outside to go see if there was any of the local medical emergency teams that needed assistance , which was some of the groups we worked with the most in that area because they were often harassed and prevented from doing their jobs by the Israeli military a lot . And [ inaudible ] just a routine situation . We went out and , you know , we were n't two blocks from our apartment when an Israeli convoy of two vehicles , a tank and an armored personnel carrier , drove up the street from the direction that we were walking from . And so as we heard them coming closer , we stepped off to the side of the road to let them pass by , which was again , you know , a very , very typical situation for us to encounter the soldiers . even during the curfew , and for them just to pass on by , you know , really without taking much notice of us . And so we stood to the side of the road , we put our hands out to show we did n't have any weapons and were n't , you know , threatening them in any way . And I was wearing a fluorescent vest to , you know , try to make ourselves as visible as possible . And once they drove within about 30 meters of where we were standing , they opened fire with their machine guns and continued shooting for a very long time , probably shooting about , you know , 30 rounds of ammunition , which is quite a lot when you see them in action . And I was struck in the face with one of the bullets and , you know , was knocked to the ground immediately . And as soon as the soldiers finished shooting [ inaudible ] , another I.S.M. member , Tobias Karlsson , standing right next to me and there were four others who were close to the scene who were able to witness the scene and once they finished shooting , they drove off . AMY GOODMAN : Well , now William Schultz is here for Amnesty International . I 'd like to -- you did a -- your organization did a report on some of these incidents . Your perspective ? BRIAN AVERY : Well , obviously Amnesty has grave concerns about these kinds of incidents , these kinds of attacks on civilians , the Rachel Corrie case , Brian 's case , and Amnesty has called for investigations of these cases . We want to see an independent look taken at these cases . We understand that Israel , of course , has the right to defend itself , but it also has to do so within the confines of international law and standards . AMY GOODMAN : And , Brian , what was the response of the U.S. government to what happened to you ? Did they in any way try to intercede or demand explanations from the Israeli government ? BRIAN AVERY : No . They did nothing of the sort . Basically , the State Department pretty much ignored it . And the contacts -- the attempted contacts I had with Congressional representatives , they were very sympathetic to me personally , but publicly and politically they did not want to touch it . They , you know , were too afraid it would have negative effects on their political careers . AMY GOODMAN : In fact , we 're coming up on the anniversary of the death of Rachel Corrie on March 16 , who died in Gaza , was run over , was crushed by an Israeli bulldozer and there is a movement in this country also to put pressure on Caterpillar , which made the bulldozer that the Israeli military used . Brian Avery , final comment . BRIAN AVERY : I guess , you know , I 'd just like to see justice done and hope that , you know , in the process that a lot of people will begin to take a lot more aware of what Israel is doing in the territories , the fact that they are getting so much support from the U.S. government , so much -- I should say uncritical support , in that , you know , it is an issue that can be changed and there are things that people can do about it , as long as they are willing to take an active role .

The District includes a 114 - mile stretch of the U.S. border with Mexico . During the campaign , Giffords touted her efforts to push the Obama administration to deploy National Guard troops to the border and for playing an instrumental role in securing $ 600 million in funding to add more technology and Border Patrol agents . Kelly criticized Giffords for not doing enough and had called for the construction of a double - layer border fence , more Border Patrol agents and the deployment of 10,000 National Guard troops to the border , more than eight times the 1,200 sent by the Obama Administration . At one point during the heated campaign , Kelly had said Giffords had \" betrayed southern Arizona by refusing to secure the border . \" Giffords opposed SB 1070 , the state 's new controversial immigration law , calling it \" divisive . \" She supported instead comprehensive immigration reform at the federal law . The law sought to make it a state crime to be in the country illegally and to require police to question suspected illegal immigrants .

We 're not done yet ! Your opinion can help us make it better . Despite EU restrictions , German companies were involved in exporting chemicals to Syria , a report has uncovered . The ingredients can be used to make sarin gas \u2014 a nerve agent repeatedly used in Syria 's devastating war . Despite European Union sanctions , German companies were involved in exporting weapons - grade chemicals to Syria in the midst of the war , according to a report published on Tuesday . The deals were uncovered by the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung , public broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk , and Switzerland 's Tamedia media group . According to the report , German chemical wholesaler Brenntag AG sold the chemicals isopropanol and diethylamine to Syria in 2014 using a subsidiary in Switzerland . The recipient was a Syrian pharmaceutical company that had ties to the regime of President Bashar Assad . Reporters revealed that the diethylamine was produced by German chemicals giant BASF at a plant in the Belgian city of Antwerp . The isopropanol was made by Sasol Solvents Germany GmbH , located in Hamburg . Although the chemicals can be used to make pharmaceutical drugs , they can also be used in the production of chemical weapons and nerve agents such as VX and sarin gas . Sarin gas , in particular , has been used in attacks carried out by the Assad regime during the war . The United Nations found that sarin gas used in an attack in 2017 was made using isopropanol . The attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun killed dozens of people . One of the chemicals was reportedly made at a BASF plant in Antwerp Violating EU rules Brenntag AG confirmed that the delivery of the chemicals to Syria was handled by its subsidiary in Switzerland \" in accordance with the laws at the time , \" S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung reported . Following numerous reports of the Assad regime 's use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war , the EU placed restrictions on exporting raw materials used to make chemical weapons . Formal authorization has been required since 2012 for exports of diethylamine , and since 2013 for isopropanol . These rules not only apply to direct exports to Syria , but also for indirect sales through countries like Switzerland . The Federal Office of Economics and Export Control , which is responsible for approving such exports , said that it had not issued any permits for those chemicals over the time period in question . The involvement of German firms in the 2014 chemical export deals is particularly controversial considering that Syria 's chemical weapons stockpiles were destroyed in an internationally coordinated action that same year .

We 're not done yet ! Your opinion can help us make it better . Despite EU restrictions , German companies were involved in exporting chemicals to Syria , a report has uncovered . The ingredients can be used to make sarin gas \u2014 a nerve agent repeatedly used in Syria 's devastating war . Despite European Union sanctions , German companies were involved in exporting weapons - grade chemicals to Syria in the midst of the war , according to a report published on Tuesday . The deals were uncovered by the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung , public broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk , and Switzerland 's Tamedia media group . According to the report , German chemical wholesaler Brenntag AG sold the chemicals isopropanol and diethylamine to Syria in 2014 using a subsidiary in Switzerland . The recipient was a Syrian pharmaceutical company that had ties to the regime of President Bashar Assad . Reporters revealed that the diethylamine was produced by German chemicals giant BASF at a plant in the Belgian city of Antwerp . The isopropanol was made by Sasol Solvents Germany GmbH , located in Hamburg . Although the chemicals can be used to make pharmaceutical drugs , they can also be used in the production of chemical weapons and nerve agents such as VX and sarin gas . Sarin gas , in particular , has been used in attacks carried out by the Assad regime during the war . The United Nations found that sarin gas used in an attack in 2017 was made using isopropanol . The attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun killed dozens of people . One of the chemicals was reportedly made at a BASF plant in Antwerp Violating EU rules Brenntag AG confirmed that the delivery of the chemicals to Syria was handled by its subsidiary in Switzerland \" in accordance with the laws at the time , \" S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung reported . Following numerous reports of the Assad regime 's use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war , the EU placed restrictions on exporting raw materials used to make chemical weapons . Formal authorization has been required since 2012 for exports of diethylamine , and since 2013 for isopropanol . These rules not only apply to direct exports to Syria , but also for indirect sales through countries like Switzerland . The Federal Office of Economics and Export Control , which is responsible for approving such exports , said that it had not issued any permits for those chemicals over the time period in question . The involvement of German firms in the 2014 chemical export deals is particularly controversial considering that Syria 's chemical weapons stockpiles were destroyed in an internationally coordinated action that same year .

What is known is this : Branson , a professor of physics and chair of the physics department at Howard University , arrived in 1948 and spent roughly a year in Pasadena working with Pauling 's group . During that time he was asked by Pauling to determine all helical structures for protein chains that satisfied certain restrictions and requirements . Among these it is likely that Pauling insisted that all peptide bonds be planar ( a condition that Pauling had first considered likely theoretically , based on his understanding of resonance structures , and then demonstrated experimentally , through Corey 's work on small peptides ) ; that bond lengths and angles conform to the precise figures Corey had obtained for amino acids and peptides ; and that structures allow for as many hydrogen bonds as possible between turns of the helix , in order to stabilize the structure . In addition , Pauling wanted to tie Branson 's work to the available x-ray data ; for this purpose the visiting professor was assisted in his calculations by Sidney Weinbaum , Pauling 's long - time assistant and a \" human calculator \" when it came to analyzing x-ray patterns . Finally , it is likely ( although documentation has not been found ) that Pauling advised Branson not to be hampered by the idea that there had to be an integral number of amino acids per turn . Pauling had long known that nature , at least at the level of molecules , did not always fit itself into neat , whole numbers ; that concept might have permeated his laboratory ( as the lure of integral repeats permeated the Cavendish ) without him having to stress it . These guidelines separated Pauling 's approach from the British work being done at the same time . Without them , the British had come up with many models and little of value . Using them , however , Branson narrowed the field , presenting Pauling with only two candidates , one a more loosely wound structure ( called the gamma helix ) with 5.1 amino acids per turn , and a tighter helix , alpha , which had 3.7 amino acids per turn . The maddening fact remained that neither one matched the experimental evidence from Astbury 's x-ray studies . Astbury had found a 510 picometer repeat in his keratin fibers ; Branson 's and Corey 's models came in at 540 picometers \u2013 a significant difference in structures as precisely modeled as these . Branson wrote up his results late in 1949 , turned them in to Pauling , and returned to Howard University and other work . Pauling held on to the results , hesitating to publish because of the 510 - 540 discrepancy , and rechecking the data . Then he saw Bragg 's group groping toward the goal and made the fateful decision to push ahead and publish what he had . Branson , for his part , gave proteins little thought until he received a note from Pauling in late 1950 along with a draft copy of a paper on the alpha and gamma helixes . \" Dr. Weinbaum did a great amount of work , based on your original notes , and I think that a discussion of the configurations of the spirals is in good shape , \" Pauling wrote , asking for Branson 's suggestions on the manuscript before he sent it in for publication Branson was listed as third author , after Pauling and Corey . There is no record of a reply . Branson went on to a significant career , staying on as chair of the physics department at Howard University for many years , and later serving as president of two colleges . In 1984 , however , as he was nearing retirement , Branson wrote Pauling biographers Victor and Mildred Goertzel implying that his contribution had been greater than the final paper indicated . \" I took my work to Pauling who told me that he thought they [ the proposed alpha and gamma helices ] were too tight , that he thought that a protein molecule should have a much larger radius so that water molecules could fit down inside and cause the protein to swell , \" he wrote . \" I went back and worked unsuccessfully to find such a structure . \" When he received Pauling 's note and the draft manuscript , Branson wrote , \" I interpreted this letter as establishing that the alpha and gamma in my paper were correct and that the subsequent work done was cleaning up or verifying . The differences were nil . \" He added in his letter to the Goertzels that he \" resented \" the later attention lavished on Pauling and Corey . In an interview just before his death in 1995 , Branson added that he thought Corey had nothing to do with the discovery of the helixes . Arguments over priorities in scientific discoveries are more common than most people think . Sometimes it takes years for old resentments to surface , as they appear to have done with Herman Branson . The issue might be resolved if Branson 's original report to Pauling could be found . But because it is not available , and because of the overall paucity of the written record , it might never be possible to firmly place proper credit in the discovery of the alpha and gamma helixes .

That work , however , was invented by Pauling , made possible by Pauling , directed by Pauling , and most important guided by chemical restrictions set by Pauling . Without Pauling 's assignment of the problem , Branson would not have worked on protein structures at all .

One year ago , scientists around the world were eagerly awaiting the start of Rosetta 's historic voyage to orbit and land on a small comet called 46P / Wirtanen . Then , following a mishap with an Ariane 5 launch vehicle , the spacecraft 's odyssey was put on hold and mission planners began to search for other comets that would be within Rosetta 's range . Following careful analysis of the available objects and associated launch constraints for each option , the ESA Science Programme Committee eventually accepted the recommendation to send Rosetta to another periodic intruder into the inner Solar System , comet Churyumov -Gerasimenko . Under the revised flight plan , the hardy spacecraft will now make one flyby of Mars and three flybys of Earth en route to the comet . This circuitous trek will enable Rosetta to make two excursions into the main asteroid belt before its rendezvous with the fast -moving cosmic iceberg . At present , the amount of science that can be conducted during the 10 - year trek to comet Churyumov - Gerasimenko remains uncertain . Some scientific observations of the Red Planet will be possible during the Mars encounter , and there is likely to be at least one opportunity to study a main belt asteroid at close quarters . A number of possible candidates have already been identified , but the final selection will be made after launch , once the mission team has determined how much surplus fuel is available on the spacecraft . However , the most exciting phase of Rosetta 's 11 - year odyssey will come when it brakes into orbit around Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August 2014 . From an altitude of just a few kilometres , its cameras will be able to map the entire pockmarked surface of the icy nucleus at high resolution and search for suitable landing sites . Once the surface of the comet 's nucleus has been surveyed in unprecedented detail and a safe landing site has been selected , the Rosetta lander will separate from the orbiter and slowly descend to the pristine surface . If all goes according to plan , the lander will anchor itself to the icy crust and begin a detailed survey of its surroundings . Over a period of several weeks , a treasure trove of data from the nine instruments on the lander will be sent back to Earth via the Rosetta orbiter . During its historic foray , the lander will return close - up pictures of the comet 's nucleus , drill into the dark organic crust , and sample the primordial ices and gases . Even the internal structure of the dirty snowball will be probed as radio signals from the orbiter pass through the nucleus to the lander and back again . For the scientists , this \" ground truth \" data will provide invaluable validation of the remote observations sent back by the orbiter as its skims over the undulating surface of the small ice world . Meanwhile , the orbiter will continue to monitor the dramatic changes in the nucleus that take place during its headlong plunge towards the inner Solar System . Over a period of about 18 months , the 11 experiments on the Rosetta orbiter will examine every aspect of the comet 's behaviour during its headlong plunge towards the inner Solar System . Since Churyumov-Gerasimenko typically becomes much more active than Wirtanen as it approaches the Sun , scientists expect to observe at close quarters for the first time the remarkable transformation of a comet from a tranquil iceberg into a world of turmoil . In particular , as its ices sublimate , bright jets will appear , ejecting gas and dust into space to create a coma and a distinctive tail that stretches vast distances in the anti-sunward direction . Despite its generally more active nature , the dust environment close to the comet is probably little more hazardous for the spacecraft than it would be in the vicinity of comet Wirtanen . Churyumov- Gerasimenko 's larger perihelion distance means that its nucleus is heated less strongly by the Sun , so limiting the output of gas-laden dust that could threaten the orbiter . According to ESA 's Rosetta project scientist , Gerhard Schwehm , it should be an exciting time for everyone concerned . \" Ground observations have shown that the comet becomes active at around 3 AU ( about 450 million km from the Sun ) , \" he said . \" We see a lot of jets and surface activity with considerable structure in the coma . \" \" Since Churyumov - Gerasimenko has only made a few passes through the inner Solar System , it is still a fairly fresh , active comet , which produces a lot of gas and dust . By flying alongside it for more than a year , we shall be able to observe the dramatic transformation that takes place as it is warmed by the Sun . It will also be intriguing to see how the activity dies down after it passes perihelion and begins the outward leg of its orbit . \" \" Working in unison , the lander and the orbiter will revolutionise our understanding of comets , \" said Schwehm . \" They will lead to amazing discoveries about the most primitive building blocks of the Solar System . \" In particular , the enormous flood of data returned during Rosetta 's remarkable voyage will provide new insights into such fundamental mysteries as the formation of Earth 's oceans and the origin of life . It may even help the human race to survive in the long term . By transforming our understanding of the Solar System 's icy wanderers , Rosetta will give us vital insights about how to respond should we find a comet on a collision course with the Earth .

One year ago , scientists around the world were eagerly awaiting the start of Rosetta 's historic voyage to orbit and land on a small comet called 46P / Wirtanen . Then , following a mishap with an Ariane 5 launch vehicle , the spacecraft 's odyssey was put on hold and mission planners began to search for other comets that would be within Rosetta 's range . Following careful analysis of the available objects and associated launch constraints for each option , the ESA Science Programme Committee eventually accepted the recommendation to send Rosetta to another periodic intruder into the inner Solar System , comet Churyumov -Gerasimenko . Under the revised flight plan , the hardy spacecraft will now make one flyby of Mars and three flybys of Earth en route to the comet . This circuitous trek will enable Rosetta to make two excursions into the main asteroid belt before its rendezvous with the fast -moving cosmic iceberg . At present , the amount of science that can be conducted during the 10 - year trek to comet Churyumov - Gerasimenko remains uncertain . Some scientific observations of the Red Planet will be possible during the Mars encounter , and there is likely to be at least one opportunity to study a main belt asteroid at close quarters . A number of possible candidates have already been identified , but the final selection will be made after launch , once the mission team has determined how much surplus fuel is available on the spacecraft . However , the most exciting phase of Rosetta 's 11 - year odyssey will come when it brakes into orbit around Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August 2014 . From an altitude of just a few kilometres , its cameras will be able to map the entire pockmarked surface of the icy nucleus at high resolution and search for suitable landing sites . Once the surface of the comet 's nucleus has been surveyed in unprecedented detail and a safe landing site has been selected , the Rosetta lander will separate from the orbiter and slowly descend to the pristine surface . If all goes according to plan , the lander will anchor itself to the icy crust and begin a detailed survey of its surroundings . Over a period of several weeks , a treasure trove of data from the nine instruments on the lander will be sent back to Earth via the Rosetta orbiter . During its historic foray , the lander will return close - up pictures of the comet 's nucleus , drill into the dark organic crust , and sample the primordial ices and gases . Even the internal structure of the dirty snowball will be probed as radio signals from the orbiter pass through the nucleus to the lander and back again . For the scientists , this \" ground truth \" data will provide invaluable validation of the remote observations sent back by the orbiter as its skims over the undulating surface of the small ice world . Meanwhile , the orbiter will continue to monitor the dramatic changes in the nucleus that take place during its headlong plunge towards the inner Solar System . Over a period of about 18 months , the 11 experiments on the Rosetta orbiter will examine every aspect of the comet 's behaviour during its headlong plunge towards the inner Solar System . Since Churyumov-Gerasimenko typically becomes much more active than Wirtanen as it approaches the Sun , scientists expect to observe at close quarters for the first time the remarkable transformation of a comet from a tranquil iceberg into a world of turmoil . In particular , as its ices sublimate , bright jets will appear , ejecting gas and dust into space to create a coma and a distinctive tail that stretches vast distances in the anti-sunward direction . Despite its generally more active nature , the dust environment close to the comet is probably little more hazardous for the spacecraft than it would be in the vicinity of comet Wirtanen . Churyumov- Gerasimenko 's larger perihelion distance means that its nucleus is heated less strongly by the Sun , so limiting the output of gas-laden dust that could threaten the orbiter . According to ESA 's Rosetta project scientist , Gerhard Schwehm , it should be an exciting time for everyone concerned . \" Ground observations have shown that the comet becomes active at around 3 AU ( about 450 million km from the Sun ) , \" he said . \" We see a lot of jets and surface activity with considerable structure in the coma . \" \" Since Churyumov - Gerasimenko has only made a few passes through the inner Solar System , it is still a fairly fresh , active comet , which produces a lot of gas and dust . By flying alongside it for more than a year , we shall be able to observe the dramatic transformation that takes place as it is warmed by the Sun . It will also be intriguing to see how the activity dies down after it passes perihelion and begins the outward leg of its orbit . \" \" Working in unison , the lander and the orbiter will revolutionise our understanding of comets , \" said Schwehm . \" They will lead to amazing discoveries about the most primitive building blocks of the Solar System . \" In particular , the enormous flood of data returned during Rosetta 's remarkable voyage will provide new insights into such fundamental mysteries as the formation of Earth 's oceans and the origin of life . It may even help the human race to survive in the long term . By transforming our understanding of the Solar System 's icy wanderers , Rosetta will give us vital insights about how to respond should we find a comet on a collision course with the Earth . Rosetta 's unique odyssey of exploration will terminate in December 2015 , six months after the comet passes perihelion and begins its retreat to the more frigid regions of Jupiter 's realm . After a dramatic saga lasting almost 12 years , the curtain will fall on the most ambitious scientific mission ever launched by Europe .

The KGB almost certainly made the trip happen . It was 1984 and General Vladimir Alexandrovich Kryuchkov had a problem . The general occupied one of the KGB\u00e2s most exalted posts . He was head of the First Chief Directorate , the prestigious KGB arm responsible for gathering foreign intelligence . Kryuchkov had begun his career with five years at the Soviet mission in Budapest under Ambassador Yuri Andropov . In 1967 Andropov became KGB chairman . Kryuchkov went to Moscow , took up a number of sensitive posts , and established a reputation as a devoted and hardworking officer . By 1984 , Kryuchkov\u00e2s directorate in Moscow was bigger than ever before \u00e2 12,000 officers , up from about 3,000 in the 1960s . His headquarters at Yasenevo , on the wooded southern outskirts of the city , was expanding : Workmen were busy constructing a 22 - story annex and a new 11 - story building . In politics , change was in the air . Soon a new man would arrive in the Kremlin , Mikhail Gorbachev . Gorbachev\u00e2s policy of detente with the West\u00e2a refreshing contrast to the global confrontation of previous general secretaries\u00e2meant the directorate\u00e2s work abroad was more important than ever . Kryuchkov faced several challenges . First , a hawkish president , Ronald Reagan , was in power in Washington . The KGB regarded his two predecessors , Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter , as weak . By contrast Reagan was seen as a potent adversary . The directorate was increasingly preoccupied with what it believed\u00e2wrongly\u00e2was an American plot to conduct a preemptive nuclear strike against the USSR . It was around this time that Donald Trump appears to have attracted the attention of Soviet intelligence . How that happened , and where that relationship began , is an answer hidden somewhere in the KGB 's secret archives . Assuming , that is , that the documents still exist . Trump 's first visit to Soviet Moscow in 1987 looks , with hindsight , to be part of a pattern . The dossier by the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele asserts that the Kremlin had been cultivating Trump for \u00e2at least five years\u00e2 before his stunning victory in the 2016 US presidential election . This would take us back to around 2011 or 2012 . In fact , the Soviet Union was interested in him too , three decades earlier . The top level of the Soviet diplomatic service arranged his 1987 Moscow visit . With assistance from the KGB . It took place while Kryuchkov was seeking to improve the KGB 's operational techniques in one particular and sensitive area . The spy chief wanted KGB staff abroad to recruit more Americans . In addition to shifting politics in Moscow , Kryuchkov\u00e2s difficulty had to do with intelligence gathering . The results from KGB officers abroad had been disappointing . Too often they would pretend to have obtained information from secret sources . In reality , they had recycled material from newspapers or picked up gossip over lunch with a journalist . Too many residencies had \u00e2paper agents\u00e2 on their books : targets for recruitment who had nothing to do with real intelligence . Kryuchkov sent out a series of classified memos to KGB heads of station . Oleg Gordievsky\u00e2formerly based in Denmark and then in Great Britain\u00e2copied them and passed them to British intelligence . He later co-published them with the historian Christopher Andrew under the title Comrade Kryuchkov\u00e2s Instructions : Top Secret Files on KGB Foreign Operations 1975 \u00e2 1985 . In January 1984 Kryuchkov addressed the problem during a biannual review held in Moscow , and at a special conference six months later . The urgent subject : how to improve agent recruitment . The general urged his officers to be more \u00e2creative . \u00e2 Previously they had relied on identifying candidates who showed ideological sympathy toward the USSR : leftists , trade unionists and so on . By the mid-1980s these were not so many . So KGB officers should \u00e2make bolder use of material incentives\u00e2 : money . And use flattery , an important tool . The Center , as KGB headquarters was known , was especially concerned about its lack of success in recruiting US citizens , according to Andrew and Gordievsky . The PR Line\u00e2that is , the Political Intelligence Department stationed in KGB residencies abroad\u00e2was given explicit instructions to find \u00e2 U.S. targets to cultivate or , at the very least , official contacts . \u00e2 \u00e2 The main effort must be concentrated on acquiring valuable agents , \u00e2 Kryuchkov said . The memo\u00e2dated February 1 , 1984\u00e2was to be destroyed as soon as its contents had been read . It said that despite improvements in \u00e2information gathering , \u00e2 the KGB \u00e2has not had great success in operation against the main adversary [ America ] . \u00e2 One solution was to make wider use of \u00e2the facilities of friendly intelligence services\u00e2\u00e2for example , Czechoslovakian or East German spy networks . And : \u00e2 Further improvement in operational work with agents calls for fuller and wider utilisation of confidential and special unofficial contacts . These should be acquired chiefly among prominent figures in politics and society , and important representatives of business and science . \u00e2 These should not only \u00e2supply valuable information\u00e2 but also \u00e2actively influence\u00e2 a country\u00e2s foreign policy \u00e2in a direction of advantage to the USSR . \u00e2 There were , of course , different stages of recruitment . Typically , a case officer would invite a target to lunch . The target would be classified as an \u00e2official contact . \u00e2 If the target appeared responsive , he ( it was rarely she ) would be promoted to a \u00e2subject of deep study , \u00e2 an obyekt razrabotki . The officer would build up a file , supplemented by official and covert material . That might include readouts from conversations obtained through bugging by the KGB\u00e2s technical team . The KGB also distributed a secret personality questionnaire , advising case officers what to look for in a successful recruitment operation . In April 1985 this was updated for \u00e2prominent figures in the West . \u00e2 The directorate\u00e2s aim was to draw the target \u00e2into some form of collaboration with us . \u00e2 This could be \u00e2as an agent , or confidential or special or unofficial contact . \u00e2 The form demanded basic details\u00e2name , profession , family situation , and material circumstances . There were other questions , too : what was the likelihood that the \u00e2subject could come to power ( occupy the post of president or prime minister ) \u00e2 ? And an assessment of personality . For example : \u00e2 Are pride , arrogance , egoism , ambition or vanity among subject\u00e2s natural characteristics ?\u00e2 The most revealing section concerned kompromat . The document asked for : \u00e2 Compromising information about subject , including illegal acts in financial and commercial affairs , intrigues , speculation , bribes , graft \u00e2\u00a6 and exploitation of his position to enrich himself . \u00e2 Plus \u00e2any other information\u00e2 that would compromise the subject before \u00e2the country\u00e2s authorities and the general public . \u00e2 Naturally the KGB could exploit this by threatening \u00e2disclosure . \u00e2 Finally , \u00e2his attitude towards women is also of interest . \u00e2 The document wanted to know : \u00e2 Is he in the habit of having affairs with women on the side ? \u00e2 When did the KGB open a file on Donald Trump ? We don\u00e2t know , but Eastern Bloc security service records suggest this may have been as early as 1977 . That was the year when Trump married Ivana Zelnickova , a twenty - eight - year - old model from Czechoslovakia . Zelnickova was a citizen of a communist country . She was therefore of interest both to the Czech intelligence service , the StB , and to the FBI and CIA . During the Cold War , Czech spies were known for their professionalism . Czech and Hungarian officers were typically used in espionage actions abroad , especially in the United States and Latin America . They were less obvious than Soviet operatives sent by Moscow . Zelnickova was born in Zlin , an aircraft manufacturing town in Moravia . Her first marriage was to an Austrian real estate agent . In the early 1970s she moved to Canada , first to Toronto and then to Montreal , to be with a ski instructor boyfriend . Exiting Czechoslovakia during this period was , the files said , \u00e2incredibly difficult . \u00e2 Zelnickova moved to New York . In April 1977 she married Trump . According to files in Prague , declassified in 2016 , Czech spies kept a close eye on the couple in Manhattan . ( The agents who undertook this task were code - named Al Jarza and Lubos . ) They opened letters sent home by Ivana to her father , Milos , an engineer . Milos was never an agent or asset . But he had a functional relationship with the Czech secret police , who would ask him how his daughter was doing abroad and in return permit her visits home . There was periodic surveillance of the Trump family in the United States . And when Ivana and Donald Trump , Jr. , visited Milos in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic , further spying , or \u00e2cover . \u00e2 Like with other Eastern Bloc agencies , the Czechs would have shared their intelligence product with their counterparts in Moscow , the KGB . Trump may have been of interest for several reasons . One , his wife came from Eastern Europe . Two\u00e2at a time after 1984 when the Kremlin was experimenting with perestroika , or Communist Party reform\u00e2Trump had a prominent profile as a real estate developer and tycoon . According to the Czech files , Ivana mentioned her husband\u00e2s growing interest in politics . Might Trump at some stage consider a political career ? The KGB wouldn\u00e2t invite someone to Moscow out of altruism . Dignitaries flown to the USSR on expenses - paid trips were typically left-leaning writers or cultural figures . The state would expend hard currency ; the visitor would say some nice things about Soviet life ; the press would report these remarks , seeing in them a stamp of approval . Despite Gorbachev\u00e2s policy of engagement , he was still a Soviet leader . The KGB continued to view the West with deep suspicion . It carried on with efforts to subvert Western institutions and acquire secret sources , with NATO its No. 1 strategic intelligence target . At this point it is unclear how the KGB regarded Trump . To become a full KGB agent , a foreigner had to agree to two things . ( An \u00e2agent\u00e2 in a Russian or British context was a secret intelligence source . ) One was \u00e2conspiratorial collaboration . \u00e2 The other was willingness to take KGB instruction . According to Andrew and Gordievsky\u00e2s book Comrade Kryuchkov\u00e2s Instructions , targets who failed to meet these criteria were classified as \u00e2confidential contacts . \u00e2 The Russian word was doveritelnaya svyaz . The aspiration was to turn trusted contacts into full - blown agents , an upper rung of the ladder . As Kryuchkov explained , KGB residents were urged to abandon \u00e2stereotyped methods\u00e2 of recruitment and use more flexible strategies\u00e2if necessary getting their wives or other family members to help . As Trump tells it , the idea for his first trip to Moscow came after he found himself seated next to the Soviet ambassador Yuri Dubinin . This was in autumn 1986 ; the event was a luncheon held by Leonard Lauder , the businessman son of Est\u00e9e Lauder . Dubinin\u00e2s daughter Natalia \u00e2had read about Trump Tower and knew all about it , \u00e2 Trump said in his 1987 bestseller , The Art of the Deal . Trump continued : \u00e2 One thing led to another , and now I\u00e2m talking about building a large luxury hotel , across the street from the Kremlin , in partnership with the Soviet government . \u00e2 Trump\u00e2s chatty version of events is incomplete . According to Natalia Dubinina , the actual story involved a more determined effort by the Soviet government to seek out Trump . In February 1985 Kryuchkov complained again about \u00e2the lack of appreciable results of recruitment against the Americans in most Residencies . \u00e2 The ambassador arrived in New York in March 1986 . His original job was Soviet ambassador to the U.N. ; his daughter Dubinina was already living in the city with her family , and she was part of the Soviet U.N. delegation . Dubinin wouldn\u00e2t have answered to the KGB . And his role wasn\u00e2t formally an intelligence one . But he would have had close contacts with the power apparatus in Moscow . He enjoyed greater trust than other , lesser ambassadors . Dubinina said she picked up her father at the airport . It was his first time in New York City . She took him on a tour . The first building they saw was Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue , she told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper . Dubinin was so excited he decided to go inside to meet the building\u00e2s owner . They got into the elevator . At the top , Dubinina said , they met Trump . The ambassador\u00e2\u00e2fluent in English and a brilliant master of negotiations\u00e2\u00e2charmed the busy Trump , telling him : \u00e2 The first thing I saw in the city is your tower ! \u00e2 Dubinina said : \u00e2 Trump melted at once . He is an emotional person , somewhat impulsive . He needs recognition . And , of course , when he gets it he likes it . My father\u00e2s visit worked on him [ Trump ] like honey to a bee . \u00e2 This encounter happened six months before the Est\u00e9e Lauder lunch . In Dubinina\u00e2s account she admits her father was trying to hook Trump . The man from Moscow wasn\u00e2t a wide - eyed rube but a veteran diplomat who served in France and Spain , and translated for Nikita Khrushchev when he met with Charles de Gaulle at the Elys\u00e9e Palace in Paris . He had seen plenty of impressive buildings . Weeks after his first Trump meeting , Dubinin was named Soviet ambassador to Washington . Dubinina\u00e2s own role is interesting . According to a foreign intelligence archive smuggled to the West , the Soviet mission to the U.N. was a haven for the KGB and GRU ( Soviet military intelligence ) . Many of the 300 Soviet nationals employed at the U.N. secretariat were Soviet intelligence officers working undercover , including as personal assistants to secretary - generals . The Soviet U.N. delegation had greater success in finding agents and gaining political intelligence than the KGB\u00e2s New York residency . Dubinin\u00e2s other daughter , Irina , said that her late father\u00e2he died in 2013\u00e2was on a mission as ambassador . This was , she said , to make contact with America\u00e2s business elite . For sure , Gorbachev\u00e2s Politburo was interested in understanding capitalism . But Dubinin\u00e2s invitation to Trump to visit Moscow looks like a classic cultivation exercise , which would have had the KGB\u00e2s full support and approval . In The Art of the Deal , Trump writes : \u00e2 In January 1987 , I got a letter from Yuri Dubinin , the Soviet ambassador to the United States , that began : \u00e2 It is a pleasure for me to relay some good news from Moscow . \u00e2 It went on to say that the leading Soviet state agency for international tourism , Goscomintourist , had expressed interest in pursuing a joint venture to construct and manage a hotel in Moscow . \u00e2 There were many ambitious real estate developers in the United States\u00e2why had Moscow picked Trump ? According to Viktor Suvorov\u00e2a former GRU military spy\u00e2and others , the KGB ran Intourist , the agency to which Trump referred . It functioned as a subsidiary KGB branch . Initiated in 1929 by Stalin , Intourist was the Soviet Union\u00e2s official state travel agency . Its job was to vet and monitor all foreigners coming into the Soviet Union . \u00e2 In my time it was KGB , \u00e2 Suvorov said . \u00e2 They gave permission for people to visit . \u00e2 The KGB\u00e2s first and second directorates routinely received lists of prospective visitors to the country based on their visa applications . As a GRU operative , Suvorov was personally involved in recruitment , albeit for a rival service to the KGB . Soviet spy agencies were always interested in cultivating \u00e2young ambitious people , \u00e2 he said\u00e2an upwardly mobile businessman , a scientist , a \u00e2guy with a future . \u00e2 Once in Moscow , they would receive lavish hospitality . \u00e2 Everything is free . There are good parties with nice girls . It could be a sauna and girls and who knows what else . \u00e2 The hotel rooms or villa were under \u00e2 24 - hour control , \u00e2 with \u00e2security cameras and so on , \u00e2 Suvorov said . \u00e2 The interest is only one . To collect some information and keep that information about him for the future . \u00e2 These dirty -tricks operations were all about the long term , Suvorov said . The KGB would expend effort on visiting students from the developing world , not least Africa . After 10 or 20 years , some of them would be \u00e2nobody . \u00e2 But others would have risen to positions of influence in their own countries . Suvorov explained : \u00e2 It\u00e2s at this point you say : \u00e2 Knock , knock ! Do you remember the marvelous time in Moscow ? It was a wonderful evening . You were so drunk . You don\u00e2t remember ? We just show you something for your good memory .\u00e2\u00e2 Over in the communist German Democratic Republic , one of Kryuchkov\u00e2s 34 - year - old officers\u00e2one Vladimir Putin\u00e2was busy trying to recruit students from Latin America . Putin arrived in Dresden in August 1985 , together with his pregnant wife , Lyudmila , and one-year - old daughter , Maria . They lived in a KGB apartment block . According to the writer Masha Gessen , one of Putin\u00e2s tasks was to try to befriend foreigners studying at the Dresden University of Technology . The hope was that , if recruited , the Latin Americans might work in the United States as undercover agents , reporting back to the Center . Putin set about this together with two KGB colleagues and a retired Dresden policeman . Precisely what Putin did while working for the KGB\u00e2s First Directorate in Dresden is unknown . It may have included trying to recruit Westerners visiting Dresden on business and East Germans with relatives in the West . Putin\u00e2s efforts , Gessen suggests , were mostly a failure . He did manage to recruit a Colombian student . Overall his operational results were modest . By January 1987 , Trump was closer to the \u00e2prominent person\u00e2 status of Kryuchkov\u00e2s note . Dubinin deemed Trump interesting enough to arrange his trip to Moscow . Another thirtysomething U.S.- based Soviet diplomat , Vitaly Churkin\u00e2the future U.N. ambassador\u00e2helped put it together . On July 4 , 1987 , Trump flew to Moscow for the first time , together with Ivana and Lisa Calandra , Ivana\u00e2s Italian - American assistant . Moscow was , Trump wrote , \u00e2an extraordinary experience . \u00e2 The Trumps stayed in Lenin\u00e2s suite at the National Hotel , at the bottom of Tverskaya Street , near Red Square . Seventy years earlier , in October 1917 , Lenin and his wife , Nadezhda Krupskaya , had spent a week in room 107 . The hotel was linked to the glass - and - concrete Intourist complex next door and was\u00e2 in effect\u00e2under KGB control . The Lenin suite would have been bugged . Meanwhile , the mausoleum containing the Bolshevik leader\u00e2s embalmed corpse was a short walk away . Other Soviet leaders were interred beneath the Kremlin\u00e2s wall in a communist pantheon : Stalin , Brezhnev , Andropov\u00e2 Kryuchkov\u00e2s old mentor\u00e2and Dzerzhinsky . According to The Art of the Deal , Trump toured \u00e2a half dozen potential sites for a hotel , including several near Red Square . \u00e2 \u00e2 I was impressed with the ambition of Soviet officials to make a deal , \u00e2 he writes . He also visited Leningrad , later St. Petersburg . A photo shows Donald and Ivana standing in Palace Square\u00e2he in a suit , she in a red polka dot blouse with a string of pearls . Behind them are the Winter Palace and the state Hermitage museum . That July the Soviet press wrote enthusiastically about the visit of a foreign celebrity . This was Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez , the Nobel Prize\u00e2winning novelist and journalist . Pravda featured a long conversation between the Colombian guest and Gorbachev . Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez spoke of how South Americans , himself included , sympathized with socialism and the USSR . Moscow brought Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez over for a film festival . Trump\u00e2s visit appears to have attracted less attention . There is no mention of him in Moscow\u00e2s Russian State Library newspaper archive . ( Either his visit went unreported or any articles featuring it have been quietly removed . ) Press clippings do record a visit by a West German official and an Indian cultural festival . The KGB\u00e2s private dossier on Trump , by contrast , would have gotten larger . The agency\u00e2s multipage profile would have been enriched with fresh material , including anything gleaned via eavesdropping . Nothing came of the trip\u00e2at least nothing in terms of business opportunities inside Russia . This pattern of failure would be repeated in Trump\u00e2s subsequent trips to Moscow . But Trump flew back to New York with a new sense of strategic direction . For the first time he gave serious indications that he was considering a career in politics . Not as mayor or governor or senator . Trump was thinking about running for president .","annotations":[{"text":"The KGB","span":[122,128],"token_span":[23,24],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The physical entity that is permanently associated with entities or characteristics that the Agent wishes to use for some Purpose.

The memo\u00e2dated February 1 , 1984\u00e2was to be destroyed as soon as its contents had been read . It said that despite improvements in \u00e2information gathering , \u00e2 the KGB \u00e2has not had great success in operation against the main adversary [ America ] . \u00e2 One solution was to make wider use of \u00e2the facilities of friendly intelligence services\u00e2\u00e2for example , Czechoslovakian or East German spy networks . And : \u00e2 Further improvement in operational work with agents calls for fuller and wider utilisation of confidential and special unofficial contacts . These should be acquired chiefly among prominent figures in politics and society , and important representatives of business and science . \u00e2 These should not only \u00e2supply valuable information\u00e2 but also \u00e2actively influence\u00e2 a country\u00e2s foreign policy \u00e2in a direction of advantage to the USSR . \u00e2 There were , of course , different stages of recruitment . Typically , a case officer would invite a target to lunch . The target would be classified as an \u00e2official contact . \u00e2 If the target appeared responsive , he ( it was rarely she ) would be promoted to a \u00e2subject of deep study , \u00e2 an obyekt razrabotki . The officer would build up a file , supplemented by official and covert material . That might include readouts from conversations obtained through bugging by the KGB\u00e2s technical team . The KGB also distributed a secret personality questionnaire , advising case officers what to look for in a successful recruitment operation . In April 1985 this was updated for \u00e2prominent figures in the West . \u00e2 The directorate\u00e2s aim was to draw the target \u00e2into some form of collaboration with us . \u00e2 This could be \u00e2as an agent , or confidential or special or unofficial contact . \u00e2 The form demanded basic details\u00e2name , profession , family situation , and material circumstances . There were other questions , too : what was the likelihood that the \u00e2subject could come to power ( occupy the post of president or prime minister ) \u00e2 ? And an assessment of personality . For example : \u00e2 Are pride , arrogance , egoism , ambition or vanity among subject\u00e2s natural characteristics ?\u00e2 The most revealing section concerned kompromat . The document asked for : \u00e2 Compromising information about subject , including illegal acts in financial and commercial affairs , intrigues , speculation , bribes , graft \u00e2\u00a6 and exploitation of his position to enrich himself . \u00e2 Plus \u00e2any other information\u00e2 that would compromise the subject before \u00e2the country\u00e2s authorities and the general public . \u00e2 Naturally the KGB could exploit this by threatening \u00e2disclosure . \u00e2 Finally , \u00e2his attitude towards women is also of interest . \u00e2 The document wanted to know : \u00e2 Is he in the habit of having affairs with women on the side ? \u00e2 When did the KGB open a file on Donald Trump ? We don\u00e2t know , but Eastern Bloc security service records suggest this may have been as early as 1977 . That was the year when Trump married Ivana Zelnickova , a twenty - eight - year - old model from Czechoslovakia . Zelnickova was a citizen of a communist country . She was therefore of interest both to the Czech intelligence service , the StB , and to the FBI and CIA . During the Cold War , Czech spies were known for their professionalism . Czech and Hungarian officers were typically used in espionage actions abroad , especially in the United States and Latin America . They were less obvious than Soviet operatives sent by Moscow . Zelnickova was born in Zlin , an aircraft manufacturing town in Moravia . Her first marriage was to an Austrian real estate agent . In the early 1970s she moved to Canada , first to Toronto and then to Montreal , to be with a ski instructor boyfriend . Exiting Czechoslovakia during this period was , the files said , \u00e2incredibly difficult . \u00e2 Zelnickova moved to New York . In April 1977 she married Trump . According to files in Prague , declassified in 2016 , Czech spies kept a close eye on the couple in Manhattan . ( The agents who undertook this task were code - named Al Jarza and Lubos . ) They opened letters sent home by Ivana to her father , Milos , an engineer . Milos was never an agent or asset . But he had a functional relationship with the Czech secret police , who would ask him how his daughter was doing abroad and in return permit her visits home . There was periodic surveillance of the Trump family in the United States . And when Ivana and Donald Trump , Jr. , visited Milos in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic , further spying , or \u00e2cover . \u00e2 Like with other Eastern Bloc agencies , the Czechs would have shared their intelligence product with their counterparts in Moscow , the KGB . Trump may have been of interest for several reasons . One , his wife came from Eastern Europe . Two\u00e2at a time after 1984 when the Kremlin was experimenting with perestroika , or Communist Party reform\u00e2Trump had a prominent profile as a real estate developer and tycoon . According to the Czech files , Ivana mentioned her husband\u00e2s growing interest in politics . Might Trump at some stage consider a political career ? The KGB wouldn\u00e2t invite someone to Moscow out of altruism . Dignitaries flown to the USSR on expenses - paid trips were typically left-leaning writers or cultural figures . The state would expend hard currency ; the visitor would say some nice things about Soviet life ; the press would report these remarks , seeing in them a stamp of approval . Despite Gorbachev\u00e2s policy of engagement , he was still a Soviet leader . The KGB continued to view the West with deep suspicion . It carried on with efforts to subvert Western institutions and acquire secret sources , with NATO its No. 1 strategic intelligence target . At this point it is unclear how the KGB regarded Trump . To become a full KGB agent , a foreigner had to agree to two things . ( An \u00e2agent\u00e2 in a Russian or British context was a secret intelligence source . ) One was \u00e2conspiratorial collaboration . \u00e2 The other was willingness to take KGB instruction . According to Andrew and Gordievsky\u00e2s book Comrade Kryuchkov\u00e2s Instructions , targets who failed to meet these criteria were classified as \u00e2confidential contacts . \u00e2 The Russian word was doveritelnaya svyaz . The aspiration was to turn trusted contacts into full - blown agents , an upper rung of the ladder . As Kryuchkov explained , KGB residents were urged to abandon \u00e2stereotyped methods\u00e2 of recruitment and use more flexible strategies\u00e2if necessary getting their wives or other family members to help . As Trump tells it , the idea for his first trip to Moscow came after he found himself seated next to the Soviet ambassador Yuri Dubinin . This was in autumn 1986 ; the event was a luncheon held by Leonard Lauder , the businessman son of Est\u00e9e Lauder . Dubinin\u00e2s daughter Natalia \u00e2had read about Trump Tower and knew all about it , \u00e2 Trump said in his 1987 bestseller , The Art of the Deal . Trump continued : \u00e2 One thing led to another , and now I\u00e2m talking about building a large luxury hotel , across the street from the Kremlin , in partnership with the Soviet government . \u00e2 Trump\u00e2s chatty version of events is incomplete . According to Natalia Dubinina , the actual story involved a more determined effort by the Soviet government to seek out Trump . In February 1985 Kryuchkov complained again about \u00e2the lack of appreciable results of recruitment against the Americans in most Residencies . \u00e2 The ambassador arrived in New York in March 1986 . His original job was Soviet ambassador to the U.N. ; his daughter Dubinina was already living in the city with her family , and she was part of the Soviet U.N. delegation . Dubinin wouldn\u00e2t have answered to the KGB . And his role wasn\u00e2t formally an intelligence one . But he would have had close contacts with the power apparatus in Moscow . He enjoyed greater trust than other , lesser ambassadors . Dubinina said she picked up her father at the airport . It was his first time in New York City . She took him on a tour . The first building they saw was Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue , she told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper . Dubinin was so excited he decided to go inside to meet the building\u00e2s owner . They got into the elevator . At the top , Dubinina said , they met Trump . The ambassador\u00e2\u00e2fluent in English and a brilliant master of negotiations\u00e2\u00e2charmed the busy Trump , telling him : \u00e2 The first thing I saw in the city is your tower ! \u00e2 Dubinina said : \u00e2 Trump melted at once . He is an emotional person , somewhat impulsive . He needs recognition . And , of course , when he gets it he likes it . My father\u00e2s visit worked on him [ Trump ] like honey to a bee . \u00e2 This encounter happened six months before the Est\u00e9e Lauder lunch . In Dubinina\u00e2s account she admits her father was trying to hook Trump . The man from Moscow wasn\u00e2t a wide - eyed rube but a veteran diplomat who served in France and Spain , and translated for Nikita Khrushchev when he met with Charles de Gaulle at the Elys\u00e9e Palace in Paris . He had seen plenty of impressive buildings . Weeks after his first Trump meeting , Dubinin was named Soviet ambassador to Washington . Dubinina\u00e2s own role is interesting . According to a foreign intelligence archive smuggled to the West , the Soviet mission to the U.N. was a haven for the KGB and GRU ( Soviet military intelligence ) . Many of the 300 Soviet nationals employed at the U.N. secretariat were Soviet intelligence officers working undercover , including as personal assistants to secretary - generals . The Soviet U.N. delegation had greater success in finding agents and gaining political intelligence than the KGB\u00e2s New York residency . Dubinin\u00e2s other daughter , Irina , said that her late father\u00e2he died in 2013\u00e2was on a mission as ambassador . This was , she said , to make contact with America\u00e2s business elite . For sure , Gorbachev\u00e2s Politburo was interested in understanding capitalism . But Dubinin\u00e2s invitation to Trump to visit Moscow looks like a classic cultivation exercise , which would have had the KGB\u00e2s full support and approval . In The Art of the Deal , Trump writes : \u00e2 In January 1987 , I got a letter from Yuri Dubinin , the Soviet ambassador to the United States , that began : \u00e2 It is a pleasure for me to relay some good news from Moscow . \u00e2 It went on to say that the leading Soviet state agency for international tourism , Goscomintourist , had expressed interest in pursuing a joint venture to construct and manage a hotel in Moscow . \u00e2 There were many ambitious real estate developers in the United States\u00e2why had Moscow picked Trump ? According to Viktor Suvorov\u00e2a former GRU military spy\u00e2and others , the KGB ran Intourist , the agency to which Trump referred . It functioned as a subsidiary KGB branch . Initiated in 1929 by Stalin , Intourist was the Soviet Union\u00e2s official state travel agency . Its job was to vet and monitor all foreigners coming into the Soviet Union . \u00e2 In my time it was KGB , \u00e2 Suvorov said . \u00e2 They gave permission for people to visit . \u00e2 The KGB\u00e2s first and second directorates routinely received lists of prospective visitors to the country based on their visa applications . As a GRU operative , Suvorov was personally involved in recruitment , albeit for a rival service to the KGB . Soviet spy agencies were always interested in cultivating \u00e2young ambitious people , \u00e2 he said\u00e2an upwardly mobile businessman , a scientist , a \u00e2guy with a future . \u00e2 Once in Moscow , they would receive lavish hospitality . \u00e2 Everything is free . There are good parties with nice girls . It could be a sauna and girls and who knows what else . \u00e2 The hotel rooms or villa were under \u00e2 24 - hour control , \u00e2 with \u00e2security cameras and so on , \u00e2 Suvorov said . \u00e2 The interest is only one . To collect some information and keep that information about him for the future . \u00e2 These dirty -tricks operations were all about the long term , Suvorov said . The KGB would expend effort on visiting students from the developing world , not least Africa . After 10 or 20 years , some of them would be \u00e2nobody . \u00e2 But others would have risen to positions of influence in their own countries . Suvorov explained : \u00e2 It\u00e2s at this point you say : \u00e2 Knock , knock ! Do you remember the marvelous time in Moscow ? It was a wonderful evening . You were so drunk . You don\u00e2t remember ? We just show you something for your good memory .\u00e2\u00e2 Over in the communist German Democratic Republic , one of Kryuchkov\u00e2s 34 - year - old officers\u00e2one Vladimir Putin\u00e2was busy trying to recruit students from Latin America . Putin arrived in Dresden in August 1985 , together with his pregnant wife , Lyudmila , and one-year - old daughter , Maria . They lived in a KGB apartment block . According to the writer Masha Gessen , one of Putin\u00e2s tasks was to try to befriend foreigners studying at the Dresden University of Technology . The hope was that , if recruited , the Latin Americans might work in the United States as undercover agents , reporting back to the Center . Putin set about this together with two KGB colleagues and a retired Dresden policeman . Precisely what Putin did while working for the KGB\u00e2s First Directorate in Dresden is unknown . It may have included trying to recruit Westerners visiting Dresden on business and East Germans with relatives in the West . Putin\u00e2s efforts , Gessen suggests , were mostly a failure . He did manage to recruit a Colombian student . Overall his operational results were modest . By January 1987 , Trump was closer to the \u00e2prominent person\u00e2 status of Kryuchkov\u00e2s note . Dubinin deemed Trump interesting enough to arrange his trip to Moscow . Another thirtysomething U.S.- based Soviet diplomat , Vitaly Churkin\u00e2the future U.N. ambassador\u00e2helped put it together . On July 4 , 1987 , Trump flew to Moscow for the first time , together with Ivana and Lisa Calandra , Ivana\u00e2s Italian - American assistant . Moscow was , Trump wrote , \u00e2an extraordinary experience . \u00e2 The Trumps stayed in Lenin\u00e2s suite at the National Hotel , at the bottom of Tverskaya Street , near Red Square . Seventy years earlier , in October 1917 , Lenin and his wife , Nadezhda Krupskaya , had spent a week in room 107 . The hotel was linked to the glass - and - concrete Intourist complex next door and was\u00e2 in effect\u00e2under KGB control . The Lenin suite would have been bugged . Meanwhile , the mausoleum containing the Bolshevik leader\u00e2s embalmed corpse was a short walk away . Other Soviet leaders were interred beneath the Kremlin\u00e2s wall in a communist pantheon : Stalin , Brezhnev , Andropov\u00e2 Kryuchkov\u00e2s old mentor\u00e2and Dzerzhinsky . According to The Art of the Deal , Trump toured \u00e2a half dozen potential sites for a hotel , including several near Red Square . \u00e2 \u00e2 I was impressed with the ambition of Soviet officials to make a deal , \u00e2 he writes . He also visited Leningrad , later St. Petersburg . A photo shows Donald and Ivana standing in Palace Square\u00e2he in a suit , she in a red polka dot blouse with a string of pearls . Behind them are the Winter Palace and the state Hermitage museum . That July the Soviet press wrote enthusiastically about the visit of a foreign celebrity . This was Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez , the Nobel Prize\u00e2winning novelist and journalist . Pravda featured a long conversation between the Colombian guest and Gorbachev . Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez spoke of how South Americans , himself included , sympathized with socialism and the USSR . Moscow brought Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez over for a film festival . Trump\u00e2s visit appears to have attracted less attention . There is no mention of him in Moscow\u00e2s Russian State Library newspaper archive . ( Either his visit went unreported or any articles featuring it have been quietly removed . ) Press clippings do record a visit by a West German official and an Indian cultural festival . The KGB\u00e2s private dossier on Trump , by contrast , would have gotten larger . The agency\u00e2s multipage profile would have been enriched with fresh material , including anything gleaned via eavesdropping . Nothing came of the trip\u00e2at least nothing in terms of business opportunities inside Russia . This pattern of failure would be repeated in Trump\u00e2s subsequent trips to Moscow . But Trump flew back to New York with a new sense of strategic direction . For the first time he gave serious indications that he was considering a career in politics . Not as mayor or governor or senator . Trump was thinking about running for president .","annotations":[{"text":"Donald Trump","span":[1733,1744],"token_span":[305,306],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The sentient entity that is temporarily with the Entity in order to fulfil some Purpose."},{"text":"The KGB","span":[122,128],"token_span":[23,24],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The physical entity that is permanently associated with entities or characteristics that the Agent wishes to use for some Purpose.

The wood 's main route ' the blue route ' , takes from 45 minutes to an hour to walk at average pace , and it covers all types of terrain , from muddy trails shrouded in foliage , to open , flat track . So if you do want to take on the more challenging routes , be sure to bring some walking boots or wellies . Cann Woods is also directly connected to Plymbridge Woods , another one of the city 's fantastic tourist spots which is home to Drake 's Trail , a pathway and cycle path which goes all the way from Plymouth to Tavistock . Cann Woods is n't as busy as Plymbridge Woods , partly because there is n't as much parking available , but also because it 's a little further out in the sticks . The woods is home to Cann Woods Segway , where you can learn to ride a Segway , or brush up on your skills if you 've done it before . Or if you 're like me , you 'd spend the whole time trying to stand up straight . I 'll stick to walking for now , thanks . When you arrive at Cann Woods , simply find yourself a parking space ( if you drove there ) , and take a look at the map situated at the entrance to plan your route . There are also several buses in Plymouth which go out to Cann Woods , so be sure to check the Plymouth Citybus website for details on those if you 're planning a trip . Gallery The dens of Cann Woods Around five - minutes into the blue trail is the perfect opportunity to try your hand at forest den-building , you 'll see the remains of previous attempts on the right as you walk down the main blue route on the right hand side of the path . During a visit on an overcast July day , there was actually one such den , which we 'll call ' the mega den ' - which could have won an architectural award for its design and infrastructure , if you ask me - a completely unqualified judge . I mean , this one den had a main roof beam , which was sturdy enough to comfortably hold all of the many other logs and sticks that formed the den . Not only that , but I could actually ( and did ) get inside this den and sit down , full sheltered from the elements . There was even a few log stumps dragged in there for people to sit on , I mean come on ! Bear Grylls - dare I even say it , Ray Mears - would be proud of this den . That 's not to say that some of the other dens were n't also great - they were all better than I could do , although I 'll admit that is n't exactly a badge of honour - but let 's just say there was one clear winner . To sum up , this little section of Cann Woods is a great place to stop off and have fun with the kids , or the grown-ups , if that 's what you 're into . More about Boringdon Camp hillfort - looking back in time The following information is taken from the Historic England UK website . Boringdon Camp hillfort is classed as a slight univallate hillfort , according to Historic England . Slight univallate hillforts have generally been interpreted as stock enclosures , redistribution centres , places of refuge and permanent settlements . The earthworks generally include a rampart , narrow level berm , external ditch and counterscarp bank , while access to the interior is usually provided by two entrances comprising either simple gaps in the earthwork or an inturned rampart . Postholes revealed by excavation indicate the occasional presence of portal gateways while more elaborate features like overlapping ramparts and outworks are limited to only a few examples . Internal features included timber or stone round houses ; large storage pits and hearths ; scattered postholes , stake holes and gullies ; and square or rectangular buildings supported by four to six posts , often represented by postholes , and interpreted as raised granaries . Slight univallate hillforts are rare with around 150 examples recorded nationally . Although on a national scale the number is low , in Devon they comprise one of the major classes of hillfort . In other areas where the distribution is relatively dense , for example , Wessex , Sussex , the Cotswolds and the Chilterns , hillforts belonging to a number of different classes occur within the same region . Examples are also recorded in eastern England , the Welsh Marches , central and southern England . In view of the rarity of slight univallate hillforts and their importance in understanding the transition between Bronze Age and Iron Age communities , all examples which survive comparatively well and have potential for the recovery of further archaeological remains are believed to be of national importance . Despite some damage to its ramparts , Boringdon Camp hillfort and associated remains is well - preserved . Its ramparts , surrounding ditch , outworks and interior will contain archaeological and environmental information relating to the hillfort and the landscape in which it was built . The outer ramparts remain of importance in understanding the development of the site . Ring ditches usually represent the encircling ditch of a bowl barrow , the most numerous form of round barrow , which are funerary monuments dating from the Late Neolithic to the Late Bronze Age , with most examples belonging to the period 2400 to 1500 BC . They were constructed as earthen or rubble mounds , sometimes ditched , which covered single or multiple burials . The close relationship between the hillfort and the ring ditch to its west suggests a continuity of use for this area over three millenia . Why Boringdon Camp hillfort is closed to visitors Visitors caused erosion at several points around the ramparts of Boringdon Camp , which lead to the site 's inevitable closure back in 2016 , first of all for a two - year trial , and then fully in 2018 . South Hams District Council , which owns the site , closed the site to the public in 2016 , to allow the Iron Age earthworks to recover . The ramparts used to be managed and protected by grazing sheep , but they were taken away years ago because too many were being killed by dogs . At the time of the site 's closure , John Ette , from Historic England in the South West , said : \u201c Boringdon Camp is an important Iron Age monument , protected by law . The hillfort is at risk from serious erosion to its ancient ramparts . \u201c We welcome the project to repair the erosion and improve the condition of the monument so that future generations can enjoy this impressive site overlooking the Plym Valley . \u201d In the past , the council has protected the earthworks by allowing sheep to graze , which manages the areas of vegetation and halts erosion . Grazing came to an abrupt end several years ago when the number of incidents of sheep being killed by dogs escalated . Back in 2016 , when the trial closure was implemented , Tim Powles , recreation and community ranger with the Forestry Commission , said : \u201c It is a shame that this trial closure has to take place as people , particularly dog walkers , enjoy walking in this area . \u201c However , we fully support the decision because it means that the monument will be given time to recover and hopefully be enjoyed for years to come . \u201c The good news is there is another 500 acres of space for people to enjoy at Cann Woods and we would encourage visitors to keep walking there and take the opportunity to explore parts of the forest they have n't been to before . \u201d Closing the monument to the public will allow the monument time to recover , bring grazing back on to the land , begin works to the areas of highest erosion and begin the clearance of vegetation which has grown up on the ramparts through lack of grazing . \" Read next : Life in Plymouth during the 1950s in 39 fascinating pictures Hidden Plymouth beauty spots that are well worth a visit","annotations":[{"text":"Cann Woods","span":[0,9],"token_span":[0,1],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"A description of the position of the Agent during the visit."},{"text":"Boringdon Camp hillfort","span":[182,204],"token_span":[38,40],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The physical entity that is permanently associated with entities or characteristics that the Agent wishes to use for some Purpose.

In 2011 , Opul acquired land leases from a Ugandan businessman , Amos Ssempa , with the aim of expanding its plantations . About 7,500 hectares ( 18,500 acres ) of oil palm have been planted since 2002 ( pdf ) . Opul describes the project as part of an initiative to increase vegetable oil production in the country .

The palm oil project is supported by the UN 's International Fund for Agricultural Development ( Ifad ) . Bidco and global palm oil giant Wilmar International are major investors . In 2004 , the World Bank withdrew from the project amid concern that it was not complying with the bank 's forestry policies ( pdf ) .

What we do is that we give highly subsidised finance to government which benefits small farmers in Kalangala . \u201c We [ Ifad ] support people who are growing oil palms on their own land . There are more than 1,600 farmers in Kalangala , who are growing oil palms at a commercial basis on their own land , and these are the people we support . \u201d While some of the farmers agreed to be compensated , they say the money they have received is insufficient for the value of the land they have lost and the food that has been destroyed .

' \u201d Kiggundu said . Emmanuel Kyambazi , 41 , experienced something similar . He says he was forced to sign for 100,000 shillings ( $ 34.50 ) in compensation for his 10 acres of land . David Balironda , the Kalangala district production officer , said he saw people being compensated . Asked why he had not objected to the fact that the compensation did not match the value of people 's land and food , he said : \u201c It was their agreement with the landlord . These people were squatters on someone 's land . They agreed on the amount of money . \u201d He added : \u201c I blame the NGOs ; it is them amplifying people to rise up and demand for land even when they were compensated . \u201d Opul says it has so far recruited 1,200 local workers , including university graduates . It says the palm oil production will bring benefits for the area . \u201c The project aspires to provide the people of Kalangala district with a great opportunity to immensely improve their quality of life . We have , for example , started construction and maintenance of roads , set up a clinic and housing for our employees . \u201d Frank Muramuzi , director of the National Association of Professional Environmentalists ( Nape ) / Friends of the Earth Uganda , said : \u201c Wilmar and the other palm oil companies are aware of the fact that communities have been displaced but have to date not been able to resolve the problems . \u201c This project was sold to the residents of Kalangala with promises of employment and a brighter future . But they were not fairly compensated for the loss of their livelihoods , and now without access to land face a daily struggle to get by . \u201d Friends of the Earth Uganda argue that the project has had a devastating effect on the environment . \u201c A large proportion of the palm oil plantations are in areas previously covered by natural forest . An estimated 3,600 hectares of forest have been destroyed to make way for the palm oil plantations , including 100 hectares of the protected Gala forest reserve in Bugala , Kalangala , \u201d it said in a 2012 report ( pdf ) . Samuel Lowe , a land campaigner at Friends of the Earth England , Wales and Northern Ireland , said : \u201c This case clearly shows that we cannot expect companies and financiers to regulate themselves . We need binding regulations in Europe so financiers can no longer provide their services to companies engaged in land grabbing . Land disputes in Uganda are not unusual and , as the government dishes out land to foreign investors , it is the local farmers who are usually the victims . In 2011 , a report by Oxfam said at least 20,000 farmers had been evicted from a government - owned forest in Mubende and Kiboga districts in central Uganda to make way for a British forestry company , New Forests Company ( NFC ) .","annotations":[{"text":"Kalangala , an island in Lake Victoria","span":[144,181],"token_span":[25,31],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the event occurs."},{"text":"on a July morning in 2011","span":[189,213],"token_span":[34,39],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time when the event occurs."},{"text":"Nakamya , 64 ,","span":[217,230],"token_span":[41,44],"role":"Sleeper","label":"Sleeper","role_definition":"This role identifies the sleeping entity."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"According to The Guardian in March 2015 , the land grabbing issue has plagued the community of Kalangala for a number of years .

Asked why he had not objected to the fact that the compensation did not match the value of people 's land and food , he said : \u201c It was their agreement with the landlord . These people were squatters on someone 's land . They agreed on the amount of money . \u201d He added : \u201c I blame the NGOs ; it is them amplifying people to rise up and demand for land even when they were compensated . \u201d Opul says it has so far recruited 1,200 local workers , including university graduates . It says the palm oil production will bring benefits for the area . \u201c The project aspires to provide the people of Kalangala district with a great opportunity to immensely improve their quality of life . We have , for example , started construction and maintenance of roads , set up a clinic and housing for our employees . \u201d Frank Muramuzi , director of the National Association of Professional Environmentalists ( Nape ) / Friends of the Earth Uganda , said : \u201c Wilmar and the other palm oil companies are aware of the fact that communities have been displaced but have to date not been able to resolve the problems . \u201c This project was sold to the residents of Kalangala with promises of employment and a brighter future . But they were not fairly compensated for the loss of their livelihoods , and now without access to land face a daily struggle to get by . \u201d Friends of the Earth Uganda argue that the project has had a devastating effect on the environment . \u201c A large proportion of the palm oil plantations are in areas previously covered by natural forest . An estimated 3,600 hectares of forest have been destroyed to make way for the palm oil plantations , including 100 hectares of the protected Gala forest reserve in Bugala , Kalangala , \u201d it said in a 2012 report ( pdf ) . Samuel Lowe , a land campaigner at Friends of the Earth England , Wales and Northern Ireland , said : \u201c This case clearly shows that we cannot expect companies and financiers to regulate themselves . We need binding regulations in Europe so financiers can no longer provide their services to companies engaged in land grabbing . Land disputes in Uganda are not unusual and , as the government dishes out land to foreign investors , it is the local farmers who are usually the victims . In 2011 , a report by Oxfam said at least 20,000 farmers had been evicted from a government - owned forest in Mubende and Kiboga districts in central Uganda to make way for a British forestry company , New Forests Company ( NFC ) .","annotations":[{"text":"Nakamya","span":[217,223],"token_span":[41,41],"role":"Sleeper","label":"Sleeper","role_definition":"This role identifies the sleeping entity."},{"text":"a July morning in 2011","span":[192,213],"token_span":[35,39],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time when the event occurs."},{"text":"Kalangala","span":[144,152],"token_span":[25,25],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the event occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"train"},{"instance_id":"EN-1427-602-frame-Waking_up","frame":"Waking_up","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Sleeper transitions from a state of consciousness where they are largely unaware of their environment to a wakeful state.","frame_ancestors":["Event"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":false,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"The pain can be very sudden , or can occur gradually over a period .

The ache and stiffness are usually worse in the morning or when you have not been moving for a while . They can sometimes be very debilitating and tend to improve with activity . People with polymyalgia rheumatica sometimes have another disorder called giant cell arteritis , which is associated with inflammation of arteries , especially those located on each side of the head , scalp , and the aorta ( the large artery that carries blood from the heart ) and its main branches . Headaches , scalp tenderness , and jaw pain are common features of giant cell arteritis . If the blood vessels that nourish the eyes are affected , there may be visual problems such as fleeting or permanent vision loss or double vision . It is important to seek treatment right away if you have visual symptoms , because if left untreated they may potentially lead to permanent blindness . Giant cell arteritis is also known as temporal arteritis and Horton disease . Both disorders generally respond well to treatment , although it is common for symptoms to recur after decreasing or stopping therapy . Who Gets Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Giant Cell Arteritis ? You are more likely to get polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis if you have certain risk factors . These include : - Age . They occur almost exclusively in people older than age 50 , typically in people in their late 60s and in their 70s . - Sex . Women get these disorders more frequently than men do . - Ethnic and racial background .

Symptoms of Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Giant Cell Arteritis Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis are related conditions , with some people having symptoms of both . About 10 percent of people with polymyalgia rheumatica have giant cell arteritis , and about 50 percent of those with giant call arteritis have polymyalgia rheumatica . Symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica include : - Pain and stiffness in the shoulders , neck , upper arms , and hip area . The pain and stiffness are usually worse upon waking in the morning or after resting , and usually last an hour or more . You may have difficulty with activities like getting up from bed or a chair , and dressing and brushing hair . It is also typical to have difficulty raising your arms above the shoulders . - Flu-like symptoms , including low-grade fever , weakness , loss of appetite , and weight loss . - Occasional swelling of the wrists or joints in the hands . The symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica can come on quickly , usually in a matter of a few days , and in some cases even overnight . Symptoms of giant cell arteritis include : - Headaches and scalp tenderness . These are the most common symptoms . The headache pain may be severe and is usually located in the temple areas . Some people notice tenderness of the scalp , often prior to the onset of headaches . - Jaw pain . People sometimes experience jaw pain , especially when chewing . - Visual disturbances . Many people have episodes of double vision or vision loss in one or both eyes . At first , the visual disturbances may last only a few minutes and resolve on their own . It is important to see a health care provider right away if you develop visual symptoms , because if left untreated , they can lead to permanent vision loss within hours or days . - Flu-like symptoms . These include low-grade fever , weakness , loss of appetite , and weight loss . - Large artery involvement , including inflammation of the aorta and its major branches can lead to bulging of the artery ( aneurysms ) or , due to blockages in the arteries , cause cramping or aching pain in the arms or legs with activity .

For example , the busiest hurricane season ever recorded in the United States was 1886 , which saw seven hurricanes make landfall \u2014 including one Category 4 hurricane that hit Texas . HURDAT is the official record of tropical storms and hurricanes for the Atlantic Ocean , Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea , including those that have made landfall in the United States . Every year , the NOAA National Hurricane Center , which maintains HURDAT , adds data from the most recent season . This database is used for a variety of purposes , including setting of appropriate building codes for coastal zones , risk assessment for emergency managers , analysis of potential losses for insurance and business interests , intensity forecasting techniques , verification of official and model predictions of track and intensity , seasonal forecasting and climatic change studies . HURDAT has been updated only twice before . The first time was in 2001 when data for years 1851 to 1885 were added to the database . The second time was August 2002 when Hurricane Andrew was upgraded to a Category 5 . REANALYSIS AND CORRECTION \u201c There are many reasons why a reanalysis of the HURDAT dataset is both needed and timely , \u201d said Chris Landsea , a research meteorologist with the NOAA Hurricane Research Division and lead scientist on the project . \u201c HURDAT contained many systematic and random errors that needed correction . Additionally , as our understanding of tropical cyclones had developed , analysis techniques at the NOAA National Hurricane Center changed over the years and led to biases in the historical database that had not been addressed . Another difficulty in applying the hurricane database to studies concerned with landfalling events was the lack of exact location , time and intensity information at landfall . \u201c Finally , recent efforts led by the late Jose Fernandez - Partagas , a Cuban research meteorologist in Miami , FL , uncovered previously undocumented historical tropical cyclones in the mid-1800s to early 1900s that have greatly increased our knowledge of these past events , which also had not been incorporated into the HURDAT database . \u201d More than 5,000 additions and alterations were approved for the years 1851 to 1910 by the NOAA National Hurricane Center 's Best Track Change Committee . This same process was used for the upgrade of 1992 's Hurricane Andrew to a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale in August 2002 . In addition to the groundbreaking work by Partagas , additional analyses , digitization and quality control of the data was carried out by researchers at the NOAA Hurricane Research Division funded by the NOAA Office of Global Programs . Over the next two years , this re-analysis will continue to progress through the remainder of the 20th Century . WHAT'S IN HURDAT ? The following is an example of some of the information contained in HURDAT . 1 . Busiest hurricane season ever for the United States : The 1886 hurricane season has been analyzed to be the busiest on record for the continental United States . Seven hurricanes were recorded to have hit the U.S. \u2022 One Category 2 hurricane into Texas and Louisiana in June \u2022 Two Category 2 hurricanes into northwest Florida in June \u2022 One Category 1 hurricane into northwest Florida in July \u2022 One Category 4 hurricane into Texas in August \u2022 One Category 1 hurricane into Texas in September \u2022 One Category 3 hurricane into Louisiana in October . The previous busiest hurricane season for the United States was 1985 with six hurricanes making landfall . 2 . Busy decade for the United States Atlantic seaboard : The 1890s was one of the busiest decades on record for the Atlantic seaboard of the United States . Four major hurricanes impacted the coast from Georgia northward : \u2022 1893 : Category 3 Sea Islands Hurricane in Georgia and South Carolina and another Category 3 in South Carolina and North Carolina the same year . \u2022 1898 : Category 4 in Georgia \u2022 1899 : Category 3 in North Carolina . Only the decade of the 1950s had more strong hurricanes making landfall along this part of the coast , going back to 1851 . 3 . Cycles of hurricane activity : These records reflect the existence of cycles of hurricane activity , rather than trends toward more frequent or stronger hurricanes . In general , the period of the 1850s to the mid-1860s was quiet . The late 1860s through the 1890s were busy , and the first decade of the 1900s was quiet . ( There were five hurricane seasons with at least 10 hurricanes per year in the active period of the late 1860s to the 1890s and none in the quiet periods . ) Earlier work had linked these cycles of busy and quiet hurricane periods in the 20th Century to natural changes in Atlantic Ocean temperatures . 4 . First time categorization of catastrophic 19th - century U.S. landfalling hurricanes : Several catastrophic hurricanes were categorized for the first time by the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale . These included the \u201c Chenier Caminanda Hurricane \u201d * that struck Louisiana in 1893 and killed about 2,000 people , which was assigned a Category 4 at landfall ; the 1893 \u201c Sea Islands Hurricane \u201d killed 1,000 to 2,000 people in Georgia and South Carolina and was ranked a Category 3 for its impact in both states ; a hurricane in 1881 that also impacted Georgia and South Carolina and killed about 700 people was assigned Category 2 status . These hurricanes rank Nos. 2 , 4 and 5 , respectively , in the largest number of fatalities for continental U.S. landfalling tropical storms and hurricanes ever . 5 . Strongest U.S. landfalling hurricane of the 1851 to 1910 era : The 1886 \u201c Indianola \u201d hurricane was analyzed as having 155 - mph maximum sustained winds , a Saffir - Simpson Hurricane Scale Category 4 ( approaching Category 5 ) and was the strongest to strike the United States between 1851 and 1910 . This hurricane destroyed the town of Indianola , TX , due to its winds and 15 - foot storm surge . The town was never rebuilt . This also was the strongest hurricane of record anywhere in the Atlantic , Gulf of Mexico or Caribbean Sea during the same time period . ( No Category 5 hurricanes were recorded to have hit the United States between 1851 and 1910 . However , records are somewhat incomplete along in Gulf Coast and Florida because there were some coastal regions with few to no inhabitants . Thus , there may be a few systems misdiagnosed in intensity in that period . ) 6 . Longest lasting hurricane on record : Storm No. 3 ( also known as the \u201c San Ciriaco \u201d hurricane for its impact in Puerto Rico ) in 1899 has been re-analyzed to now tie the record for longest lasting tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin . It began on August 3 in the tropical North Atlantic , hit Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane on August 8 , hit North Carolina as a Category 3 hurricane on August 18 , transformed into an extratropical system north of Bermuda on August 21 , redeveloped into a tropical storm on August 26 , went through the Azores Islands as a Category 1 hurricane on September 3 and finally dissipated as an extratropical storm on September 4 . It was a storm system for 33 days and a tropical storm or hurricane for 28 of those days . This ties the record with Hurricane Ginger of 1971 , which also was a tropical cyclone for 28 days . 7 . Most hurricanes ever in one day : On August 22 , 1893 , four hurricanes were occurring simultaneously . Storm No. 3 approaching Nova Scotia , Canada ; Storm No. 4 between Bermuda and the Bahamas ; Storm No. 6 northeast of the Lesser Antilles ; and Storm No. 7 west of the Cape Verde Islands . Storm No. 4 would end up making a direct hit on New York City as a Category 1 hurricane two days later and Storm No. 6 ended up hitting Georgia and South Carolina as a Category 3 hurricane ( the \u201c Sea Islands Hurricane \u201d ) and killing 1,000 to 2,000 people . The only other known date with four hurricanes occurring at the same time was September 25 , 1998 , when hurricanes Georges , Ivan , Jeanne and Karl were in existence . * Tropical storms and hurricanes were not formally given names until the 1950 hurricane season . Before this time , individual systems were sometimes known for the location that they impacted ( e.g. , the \u201c Indianola \u201d hurricane of 1886 for its impact in the town of Indianola , TX ) or by the day of the saint for hurricanes that hit Hispanic locations ( e.g. , \u201c San Ciriaco \u201d for an 1899 hurricane hitting Puerto Rico on August 8 ) .","annotations":[{"text":"recent","span":[2042,2047],"token_span":[347,347],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time when the effort occurs."},{"text":"Jose Fernandez - Partagas , a Cuban research meteorologist","span":[2073,2130],"token_span":[353,361],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent puts effort into reaching Goal."},{"text":"in Miami , FL","span":[2132,2144],"token_span":[362,365],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"The place where the work is done."},{"text":"previously undocumented historical tropical cyclones in the mid-1800s to early 1900s","span":[2158,2241],"token_span":[368,378],"role":"Salient_entity","label":"Salient_entity","role_definition":"An entity that is centrally involved in the Goal that the Agent is attempting to acheive."},{"text":"More than 5,000 additions and alterations","span":[2374,2414],"token_span":[402,407],"role":"Goal","label":"Goal","role_definition":"The Goal is what the Agent expends effort to achieve."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"In addition to the groundbreaking work by Partagas , additional analyses , digitization and quality control of the data was carried out by researchers at the NOAA Hurricane Research Division funded by the NOAA Office of Global Programs .","annotations":[{"text":"Partagas","span":[42,49],"token_span":[7,7],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The Agent puts effort into reaching Goal."},{"text":"data","span":[115,118],"token_span":[18,18],"role":"Salient_entity","label":"Salient_entity","role_definition":"An entity that is centrally involved in the Goal that the Agent is attempting to acheive."}],"trigger":{"text":"work","start_char":34,"end_char":37,"start_token":5,"end_token":5,"frame":"Work"}},"source":{"text":"| | Major revisions to the Atlantic basin hurricane database ( known as HURDAT ) have just been completed for the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century and have turned up some interesting facts . For example , the busiest hurricane season ever recorded in the United States was 1886 , which saw seven hurricanes make landfall \u2014 including one Category 4 hurricane that hit Texas . HURDAT is the official record of tropical storms and hurricanes for the Atlantic Ocean , Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea , including those that have made landfall in the United States . Every year , the NOAA National Hurricane Center , which maintains HURDAT , adds data from the most recent season . This database is used for a variety of purposes , including setting of appropriate building codes for coastal zones , risk assessment for emergency managers , analysis of potential losses for insurance and business interests , intensity forecasting techniques , verification of official and model predictions of track and intensity , seasonal forecasting and climatic change studies . HURDAT has been updated only twice before . The first time was in 2001 when data for years 1851 to 1885 were added to the database . The second time was August 2002 when Hurricane Andrew was upgraded to a Category 5 . REANALYSIS AND CORRECTION \u201c There are many reasons why a reanalysis of the HURDAT dataset is both needed and timely , \u201d said Chris Landsea , a research meteorologist with the NOAA Hurricane Research Division and lead scientist on the project . \u201c HURDAT contained many systematic and random errors that needed correction . Additionally , as our understanding of tropical cyclones had developed , analysis techniques at the NOAA National Hurricane Center changed over the years and led to biases in the historical database that had not been addressed . Another difficulty in applying the hurricane database to studies concerned with landfalling events was the lack of exact location , time and intensity information at landfall . \u201c Finally , recent efforts led by the late Jose Fernandez - Partagas , a Cuban research meteorologist in Miami , FL , uncovered previously undocumented historical tropical cyclones in the mid-1800s to early 1900s that have greatly increased our knowledge of these past events , which also had not been incorporated into the HURDAT database . \u201d More than 5,000 additions and alterations were approved for the years 1851 to 1910 by the NOAA National Hurricane Center 's Best Track Change Committee . This same process was used for the upgrade of 1992 's Hurricane Andrew to a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale in August 2002 . In addition to the groundbreaking work by Partagas , additional analyses , digitization and quality control of the data was carried out by researchers at the NOAA Hurricane Research Division funded by the NOAA Office of Global Programs . Over the next two years , this re-analysis will continue to progress through the remainder of the 20th Century . WHAT'S IN HURDAT ? The following is an example of some of the information contained in HURDAT . 1 . Busiest hurricane season ever for the United States : The 1886 hurricane season has been analyzed to be the busiest on record for the continental United States . Seven hurricanes were recorded to have hit the U.S. \u2022 One Category 2 hurricane into Texas and Louisiana in June \u2022 Two Category 2 hurricanes into northwest Florida in June \u2022 One Category 1 hurricane into northwest Florida in July \u2022 One Category 4 hurricane into Texas in August \u2022 One Category 1 hurricane into Texas in September \u2022 One Category 3 hurricane into Louisiana in October . The previous busiest hurricane season for the United States was 1985 with six hurricanes making landfall . 2 . Busy decade for the United States Atlantic seaboard : The 1890s was one of the busiest decades on record for the Atlantic seaboard of the United States . Four major hurricanes impacted the coast from Georgia northward : \u2022 1893 : Category 3 Sea Islands Hurricane in Georgia and South Carolina and another Category 3 in South Carolina and North Carolina the same year . \u2022 1898 : Category 4 in Georgia \u2022 1899 : Category 3 in North Carolina . Only the decade of the 1950s had more strong hurricanes making landfall along this part of the coast , going back to 1851 . 3 . Cycles of hurricane activity : These records reflect the existence of cycles of hurricane activity , rather than trends toward more frequent or stronger hurricanes . In general , the period of the 1850s to the mid-1860s was quiet . The late 1860s through the 1890s were busy , and the first decade of the 1900s was quiet . ( There were five hurricane seasons with at least 10 hurricanes per year in the active period of the late 1860s to the 1890s and none in the quiet periods . ) Earlier work had linked these cycles of busy and quiet hurricane periods in the 20th Century to natural changes in Atlantic Ocean temperatures . 4 . First time categorization of catastrophic 19th - century U.S. landfalling hurricanes : Several catastrophic hurricanes were categorized for the first time by the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale . These included the \u201c Chenier Caminanda Hurricane \u201d * that struck Louisiana in 1893 and killed about 2,000 people , which was assigned a Category 4 at landfall ; the 1893 \u201c Sea Islands Hurricane \u201d killed 1,000 to 2,000 people in Georgia and South Carolina and was ranked a Category 3 for its impact in both states ; a hurricane in 1881 that also impacted Georgia and South Carolina and killed about 700 people was assigned Category 2 status . These hurricanes rank Nos. 2 , 4 and 5 , respectively , in the largest number of fatalities for continental U.S. landfalling tropical storms and hurricanes ever . 5 . Strongest U.S. landfalling hurricane of the 1851 to 1910 era : The 1886 \u201c Indianola \u201d hurricane was analyzed as having 155 - mph maximum sustained winds , a Saffir - Simpson Hurricane Scale Category 4 ( approaching Category 5 ) and was the strongest to strike the United States between 1851 and 1910 . This hurricane destroyed the town of Indianola , TX , due to its winds and 15 - foot storm surge . The town was never rebuilt . This also was the strongest hurricane of record anywhere in the Atlantic , Gulf of Mexico or Caribbean Sea during the same time period . ( No Category 5 hurricanes were recorded to have hit the United States between 1851 and 1910 . However , records are somewhat incomplete along in Gulf Coast and Florida because there were some coastal regions with few to no inhabitants . Thus , there may be a few systems misdiagnosed in intensity in that period . ) 6 . Longest lasting hurricane on record : Storm No. 3 ( also known as the \u201c San Ciriaco \u201d hurricane for its impact in Puerto Rico ) in 1899 has been re-analyzed to now tie the record for longest lasting tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin . It began on August 3 in the tropical North Atlantic , hit Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane on August 8 , hit North Carolina as a Category 3 hurricane on August 18 , transformed into an extratropical system north of Bermuda on August 21 , redeveloped into a tropical storm on August 26 , went through the Azores Islands as a Category 1 hurricane on September 3 and finally dissipated as an extratropical storm on September 4 . It was a storm system for 33 days and a tropical storm or hurricane for 28 of those days . This ties the record with Hurricane Ginger of 1971 , which also was a tropical cyclone for 28 days . 7 . Most hurricanes ever in one day : On August 22 , 1893 , four hurricanes were occurring simultaneously . Storm No. 3 approaching Nova Scotia , Canada ; Storm No. 4 between Bermuda and the Bahamas ; Storm No. 6 northeast of the Lesser Antilles ; and Storm No. 7 west of the Cape Verde Islands . Storm No. 4 would end up making a direct hit on New York City as a Category 1 hurricane two days later and Storm No. 6 ended up hitting Georgia and South Carolina as a Category 3 hurricane ( the \u201c Sea Islands Hurricane \u201d ) and killing 1,000 to 2,000 people .

Twenty ( including Ballarat ( I ) ) were built on Admiralty order but manned and commissioned by the Royal Australian Navy . Thirty six were built for the Royal Australian Navy and four for the Royal Indian Navy . Ballarat ( I ) commissioned at Melbourne on 30 August 1941 under the command of Lieutenant Commander Alfred D Barling RANR ( S ) . After trials in the Melbourne area Ballarat ( I ) sailed for Sydney on 20 September 1941 . After arrival three days later the ship joined the 20th Minesweeping Flotilla , based in Sydney . On 1 November 1941 Ballarat ( I ) sailed for Jervis Bay to give anti-submarine protection to the transport Queen Mary . That ship and another giant liner of the Cunard Line , Queen Elizabeth , were to comprise Convoy US13 to the Middle East , the troops embarked being mainly from the 6th , 7th and 9th Australian Divisions . After embarkation of troops at Sydney the transports proceeded to Jervis Bay , whence they sailed for the Middle East on 3 November . Ballarat ( I ) returned to Sydney the same day . On 14 November 1941 , Ballarat ( I ) departed Sydney towing Oil Lighter No 1 . The vessels proceeded via Brisbane , Townsville and Thursday Island to Darwin , where they arrived on 8 December . Two days later Ballarat ( I ) commenced escort duty between Darwin , Timor and Ambon . She saw action early in her career , arriving at Batavia early in January 1942 . She then proceeded to Singapore . After leaving Singapore on 3 February 1942 she carried out patrols in Banka Strait ( ' Bomb Alley ' ) , and was employed also in rescuing shipwrecked crews and carrying out demolition work . Ballarat ( I ) carried out one of the largest rescue operations , picking up 215 survivors from the SS Derrymore , sixty miles north - west of Batavia on 14 February 1942 . The Derrymore had been sunk by Japanese submarine in position 5 \u00b0 18\u00b4S , 106\u00b020 \u00b4E . Amongst those rescued by Ballarat ( I ) was Flying Officer JG Gorton RAAF , who was later to become Prime Minister of Australia . Amongst other ministerial posts held by Mr Gorton before he became Prime Minister was that of Minister for the Navy . She landed parties at Oosthaven for demolition , which was successfully carried out without loss . With sister ships , Ballarat ( I ) took a prominent part in the evacuation of Sumatra , operating from Palembang . She was the last RAN ship to leave , staying behind to sink a small unseaworthy minesweeper . The ship then returned to Australia and was employed on convoy escort work , mainly to New Guinea . In November she and her sister ship HMAS Katoomba ( I ) were heavily attacked by Japanese dive bombers . In December 1942 Ballarat ( I ) and her sister ships Broome ( I ) and Colac were detailed to transport Australian troops and land them as far forward as possible in the Buna area . The three vessels reached the landing point at Cape Sudest near Oro Bay without incident , but a few minutes later unidentified aircraft began dropping flares . Because of the threat of attack from enemy aircraft and from enemy warships believed to be in the area it was decided to retire temporarily after only 46 men had disembarked out of a total of 762 . Later the same day ( 14 December ) the operation was successfully completed using a new landing position and under cover of darkness all troops were put safely ashore . During the remainder of the month Ballarat ( I ) was involved in troop carrying on three further occasions . In April 1943 Ballarat ( I ) was ordered to operate off the Australian east coast to counter the Japanese submarine menace . Returning north for escort duty to New Guinea in January 1944 Ballarat ( I ) was later employed between Thursday Island and Darwin . In August 1944 she ferried troops from Eilanden River ( southern Dutch New Guinea ) bringing them without loss to Merauke . In 1945 she was minesweeping off Sydney prior to the arrival of the British Pacific Fleet , departing for Manus on 25 February and arriving at Leyte Gulf on 26 March . Ballarat ( I ) then participated in the operation for the capture of Okinawa ( March - May 1945 ) . Ballarat ( I ) took part in the surrender ceremony at Tokyo , after which she was engaged in minesweeping in the Hong Kong area with the 20th and 21st Minesweeping Flotillas . She was damaged by a mine at Amoy on 6 November , and returned to Melbourne on 13 December where the ship 's company went on long leave . At the conclusion of hostilities Ballarat ( I ) had steamed 130,000 miles . The ship paid off into Reserve at Sydney on 27 September 1946 and was sold to a Hong Kong shipping company , China Traders Ltd , on 10 July 1947 . Ballarat ( I ) did not leave Australian waters and in December 1950 she was resold to the Ta Hing Company ( Hong Kong ) Ltd . She was subsequently refitted for the Chinese coastal trade and renamed Carmencita . In January 1951 , however , the Commonwealth Government issued a Statutory Order banning her from proceeding to Chinese waters . In 1953 she was again sold , on this occasion to John Manners and Co ( Aust ) Pty Ltd , Sydney . It has been reported that the ship was broken up in 1953 . Note : This video is hosted on YouTube .

John Sely lived here until 1443 when he was expelled and deprived of his offices for living at Kilclief Castle with a married woman . The castle was garrisoned for the Crown by Nicholas FitzSymon and ten warders in 1601 - 2 . In the 18th century the castle was thatched and part of a farm . More recently is was used as a farm granary . Kilclief Castle is 4 storeys high and has 2 projecting turrets , one of which contains a spiral staircase . These projecting turrets are joined at roof level by a high machicolation arch covering a drop-hole for dropping missiles on unwelcome visitors below . This defensive arch is familiar from castle gatehouses which is why this kind of tower house is sometimes called the gatehouse type . The unusual style of this castle appears to have been a model for others nearby like Jordan 's Castle and Audley 's Castle .

Kilclief Castle was built between 1412 and 1433 as the summer residence of John Sely , Bishop of Down . It is probably the oldest datable tower - house in the region . John Sely lived here until 1443 when he was expelled and deprived of his offices for living at Kilclief Castle with a married woman . The castle was garrisoned for the Crown by Nicholas FitzSymon and ten warders in 1601 - 2 . In the 18th century the castle was thatched and part of a farm . More recently is was used as a farm granary . Kilclief Castle is 4 storeys high and has 2 projecting turrets , one of which contains a spiral staircase . These projecting turrets are joined at roof level by a high machicolation arch covering a drop-hole for dropping missiles on unwelcome visitors below . This defensive arch is familiar from castle gatehouses which is why this kind of tower house is sometimes called the gatehouse type . The unusual style of this castle appears to have been a model for others nearby like Jordan 's Castle and Audley 's Castle . This is a very nice small castle tower at the shore of the entrance to Strangford Lough . It can be visited for a small fee during opening hours .

How did you find your singing voice ? The difference between how you sounded on those Golliwogs singles and then on the first Creedence recording is startling . | I was very self - conscious about my voice . What happened was that me and some other guys went up to Portland , Oregon , of all places , during the summer of 1964 . We found a drummer and got a two - week engagement at a club called the Town Mart . At that point , this guy named Mike Burns was the singer . Well , one day I said , \" I 'm going to sing . \" And since I was out of my hometown , away from my parents and any of my friends , I kind of just told myself to go ahead and try it , do n't be shy . And I had taken a reel - to - reel tape recorder up there . I would record whole sets . Then I 'd stay up until sunrise listening to myself And I heard myself improve . I 'd try something like a scream or a hard - edged \" Well ! \" I 'd hear myself try to do it on the tape , and the next night I 'd go back and try something else . As I used to say , I developed a scream in Portland . The first record you made as Creedence Clearwater Revival was \" Suzie Q . \" Did n't you have a very specific purpose in recording that song ? This little underground San Francisco radio station , KMPX [ the first progressive - rock station in America ] , would play all kinds of weird things . I told the other guys that the quickest way we could get on the radio , therefore get more exposure and get this thing going was to specifically go in and record an arrangement of \" Suzie Q \" that could get played on that station . It 's been said that what we were doing seemed very far removed from the rest of San Francisco , but that 's not quite true . '' Suzie Q \" was designed to fit right in . The eight - minute opus .

I was scared to death of LSD or any kind of pill . Yeah , I 'd smoked some marijuana , and the other guy 's , I think , were certainly more experimental than me . But I did n't like it as an image . Since I was the leader , I was the guy with the whip saying , \" No , we 're not going to push this as an image thing . \" But at the same time , I did n't feel that made us the Osmond Brothers either . As Creedence was experiencing some of its first Top Forty success , the Band came along with its album Music From Big Pink ' and got a lot of media attention . They were one of the first bands on the cover of Time' Magazine . To be really honest , I 'd say I was a bit envious . There were a few songs they did that I really loved , like \" The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down \" and \" Up on Cripple Creek . \" But they got all this validation from the critics . Here I was , a competitive guy trying to make my band the biggest thing in the world , and here these guys [ are getting attention ] just ' cause they 're from New York or Woodstock or Big Pink or Bob Dylan or whatever .

I think the charm of what you hear on those records is four guys really playing . Let 's talk about some of your best-known songs . \" Proud Mary \" was the first of your original songs to become a hit . In the middle of July of ' 68 , I got my honorable discharge from the United States Army after much consternation . I was overjoyed . This envelope containing this little thing that 's like a diploma had been sitting on the stairs of my apartment building for a couple of days . It said , \" Official Business \" or something . Well , I did n't bother to look close at it . Finally , one day I was coming into my apartment , and I look on the stairs , and , \" Hey , that 's got my name on it ! \" Well , son of a bitch , I opened it up , and I 'm discharged from the army . Holy hallelujah ! I actually went out on the little apartment - building lawn and did a couple of cartwheels . At that one moment it was like \" Wow , all the troubles of the world have been lifted off my shoulders ! \" If it did n't happen within five minutes , certainly within a week and a half I had written \" Proud Mary . \" That one event that led to doing the cartwheels , that 's where \" Left a good job in the city \" comes from . I just felt real good . Although I did n't recall it at the time when I was doing \" Rollin ' on the river , \" there is an old Will Rogers movie about these old paddle wheelers , and I believe at one point they actually sing , \" Rolling on the river . \" I know that buried deep inside me are all these little bits and pieces of Americana . It 's deep in my heart , deep in my soul . As I learned in English 101 , write about what you know about . What inspired \" Born on the Bayou \" ? I would sit there , kind of look at the blank wall in my little apartment , and I just kind of pictured this story . Now around this same time , because of \" Suzie Q \" getting played on the underground radio station , we played the Avalon Ballroom , in San Francisco . We were onstage for a two -minute sound check . I started doing this thing with the guitar , and I started screaming into the microphone what would later become a refined melody but at that moment was just noise , and I had Doug and Stu just play along . I just wanted to hear this energy thing . Anyway , that mythical thing that I was dreaming up at night and that burst of energy on the stage at the Avalon came together . \" Born on the Bayou \" is almost the Gordian knot or the key to what happened later . As I was writing it , it occurred to me that there was more power than just this one song . If there was a way to tie it all together on one album , kind of cross-fertilize , cross - relate the songs , you would have a much more interesting and maybe more powerful image . So that 's what happened . \" Born on the Bayou \" sort of relates to \" Proud Mary . \" It certainly relates to \" Keep on Chooglin \" and \" Graveyard Train . \" \" Green River \" also fits right into what critics started calling bayou rock . \" Green River \" is really about this place where I used to go as a kid on Putah Creek , near Winters , California . I went there with my family every year until I was ten . Lot of happy memories there . I learned how to swim there . There was a rope hanging from the tree . Certainly dragonflies , bullfrogs . There was a little cabin we would stay in owned by a descendant of Buffalo Bill Cody . That 's the reference in the song to Cody Jr. The actual specific reference , \" Green River , \" I got from a soda pop-syrup label . You used to be able to go into a soda fountain , and they had these bottles of flavored syrup . My flavor was called Green River . It was green , lime flavored , and they would empty some out over some ice and pour some of that soda water on it , and you had yourself a Green River . \" Fortunate Son \" it one of your more political songs . It was written , of course , during the Nixon era , and well , let 's say I was very nonsupportive of Mr. Nixon . There just seemed to be this trickle down to the off - spring of people like him . I remember you would hear about Tricia Nixon and David Eisenhower . . . . You got the impression that these people got preferential treatment , and the whole idea of being born wealthy or being born powerful seemed to really be coming to the fore in the late - Sixties confrontation of cultures . How did you come up with \" Bad Moon Rising \" ? I got the imagery from an old movie called The Devil and Daniel Webster . Basically , Daniel Webster makes a deal with Mr. Scratch , the devil . It was supposed to be apocryphal . At one point in the movie , there was a huge hurricane . Everybody 's crops and houses are destroyed . Boom . Right next door is the guy 's field who made the deal with the devil , and his corn is still straight up , six feet . That image was in my mind . I went , \" Holy mackerel ! \" My song was n't about Mr. Scratch , and it was n't about the deal . It was about the apocalypse that was going to be visited upon us . It was n't until the band was learning the song that I realized the dichotomy . Here you got this song with all these hurricanes and blowing and raging ruin and all that , but it 's [ snaps fingers ] \" I see a bad moon rising . \" It 's a happy - sounding tune , right ? It did n't bother me at the time . \" Have You Ever Seen the Rain \" was the last bit the group had before your brother quit Creedence . That song is really about the impending breakup of Creedence . The imagery is , you can have a bright , beautiful , sunny day and it can be raining at the same time . The band was breaking up .

A week before opening fire on an Orlando nightclub , Omar Mateen was on Facebook . Perhaps he was looking for inspiration : According to the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee , Mateen searched the site for a speech by Abu Bakr al - Baghdadi , the secretive ISIS leader . On the day of the shooting , he allegedly pledged allegiance to al - Baghdadi in a Facebook post . Once dependent on leaflets and videotapes , terrorist groups now use social media as a chief recruiting tool . Facebook , Twitter , and other social networks have responded by accelerating campaigns to shut down accounts that spew pro-ISIS messages on their platforms ; Twitter in particular has seen some success suspending ISIS - affiliated accounts by expanding its teams that watch for objectionable content . But it 's impossible to keep terrorist propaganda off of social networking platforms entirely . Each day , Twitter users tweet an average of 500 million times and more than a billion people log into Facebook . Instead of relying on humans to finger dangerous content , a computer - science professor at Dartmouth is proposing a system that proactively flags extremist photos , videos , and audio clips as they 're being posted online . But the software has been met with reluctance from the very social media companies that would use it , even before it was announced last week . The project 's leader is Hany Farid , the chair of Dartmouth 's computer - science department . Farid 's was the mind behind PhotoDNA , a Microsoft - backed system that detects child pornography as it 's posted online . That service relies on a stock of millions of pornographic images of children collected and maintained by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , or NCMEC . PhotoDNA creates a unique fingerprint of each image called a hash , which can identify the photo even if it 's been manipulated or cropped . It 's used by a long list of major organizations and companies \u2014 from social networks and cloud - storage services to governments and law enforcement agencies \u2014 to prevent images of juvenile sexual abuse from spreading . Microsoft has made the service free and easy for any new online services to deploy . When the service was introduced in 2008 , Farid says , the bulk of the child pornography traded on the internet was in the form of images \u2014 but today , child porn is largely in video form . To catch up , Farid has spent the last eight months updating PhotoDNA to be able to flag video and audio files as well as images . The expanded fingerprinting technology can help broaden the fight to suppress child pornography online \u2014 but Farid has long hoped to use it to attack another genre of offensive content . He teamed up with the Counter Extremism Project , a nonprofit led by a star-studded roster of former government officials , to propose a sister program to PhotoDNA that would help online platforms keep extremist content off the internet . Modeled off the child - porn detection system , the new program would establish a central clearinghouse that would maintain a database of extremist content and distribute unique fingerprints of each photo , video , and audio file to the platforms that want to filter for this content . The clearinghouse would be called the National Office for Reporting Extremism , or NOREX . Researchers at the Counter Extremism Project have been painstakingly collecting extremist content for years , even enlisting crowdsourced help from other social media users to point out offensive accounts . Mark Wallace , the organization 's CEO , proposes starting just by flagging the \u201c worst of the worst \u201d of extremist content : files like ISIS 's savage beheading videos , or audio and video footage of Anwar al - Awlaki 's propaganda speeches . Wallace has high hopes that impeding the spread will discourage terrorists from committing violent acts and hobble their propaganda machine . \u201c Imagine the circumstance if you are that ISIS propagandist , and you were thinking , ' Well , is it really worthwhile torturing this poor soul and killing them on video ? Because the moment I place that video online , it ca n't go viral . ' \u201d he said . \u201c I think that has the potential to be a quite consequential , perhaps game - changing effect on this recruitment and propagandizing . \u201d Wallace and Farid announced the program to a group of reporters last week , and indicated that it would be ready to deploy imminently . Farid said his software would be ready within months , and Wallace said that the project 's leaders had \u201c very collegial discussions \u201d with social - media companies about adopting the new software . \u201c I do n't want to get too over my skis here , but I think there 's a lot of interest , \u201d he said . But to hear those companies tell it , the proposal is far from the brink of adoption . Although there have been months of conversations among the platforms that are most likely to use the software , lingering questions and a history of resentment toward Wallace and his organization have thrown up roadblocks . The conversation began in earnest in late April , when Monika Bickert , Facebook 's head of global policy management , organized a conference call with social - media companies to discuss how to deal with terrorist material on their sites . According to company representatives familiar with the discussion , Bickert shared details about a handful of tools that would flag extremist content online . Although Bickert never mentioned CEP , Wallace , or Farid by name , one of the proposals she circulated was identical to the one CEP introduced Friday . That conversation was polite and productive , but in private discussions , some participants raised concerns about the plan \u2014 and about working with Mark Wallace , who has long been a gadfly circling social - media companies and pushing them to police their newsfeeds and timelines for extremism . The companies are mainly concerned about how to determine the terrorist content that would get flagged . While NCMEC 's database of child - porn hashes is made up of illegal images as defined by the law , it 's harder to establish exactly what constitutes extremist content . Many countries define it very broadly , using the label of \u201c terrorist \u201d to silence dissent or opposition . The job of deciding what counts as extremist and what does n't would fall to NOREX . The images , videos , and audio clips that NOREX determines are extremist would be flagged on participating social media sites , regardless of the context they were posted in . \u201c Unlike child pornography \u2014 which is itself illegal \u2014 identifying certain types of speech requires context and intent , \u201d said Lee Rowland , a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union . \u201c Algorithms are not good at determining context and tone like support or opposition , sarcasm or parody . \u201d ( Wallace says the proposed system would have some sort of appeals process , whereby a user notified that his or her post was flagged could submit a counterclaim for human review . Farid also proposed exempting some accounts \u2014 those operated by media companies , for example \u2014 that could post extremist content without repercussion for educational or news purposes . ) Farid says the pushback from social - media companies is reminiscent of the reaction to his original PhotoDNA proposal in 2008 . At the time , he said , a coalition of technology companies would \u201c dutifully meet and wring their hands \u201d on a monthly basis , but never acted . It was n't until Microsoft and Facebook adopted PhotoDNA that other technology companies began slowly to come on board . This time around , Farid has little patience for what he considers excessive foot-dragging . \u201c We 've seen this pattern before , and I find it a little inexcusable , \u201d he said . Wallace , too , lashed out at the industry for its reticence to work with him and his organization . \u201c I wish that certain social - media companies were as prickly about terrorists on their platforms as they are with a bipartisan group of former officials who ask the social media companies \u2014 politely \u2014 to refuse to host those same terrorists , \u201d he said . The companies do seem to share the ultimate goal of developing an algorithm to suppress terrorist content , and the group that arranged the April call is waiting for a written summary of the best options \u2014 likely including the CEP proposal \u2014 to be circulated . ( Other proposals that may be up for consideration have yet to be announced . ) The idea has the backing of the White House , which has encouraged the participation of private companies in fighting extremism . \u201c We welcome the launch of initiatives such as [ this one ] that enable companies to address terrorist activity on their platforms and better respond to the threat posed by terrorists ' activities online , \u201d said Lisa Monaco , President Obama 's top counterterrorism advisor . \u201c The innovative private sector that created so many technologies our society enjoys today can also help create tools to limit terrorists from abusing these technologies in ways their creators never intended . \u201d It 's still too early to say if the eventual solution that social media companies adopt will be CEP's .

A week before opening fire on an Orlando nightclub , Omar Mateen was on Facebook . Perhaps he was looking for inspiration : According to the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee , Mateen searched the site for a speech by Abu Bakr al - Baghdadi , the secretive ISIS leader . On the day of the shooting , he allegedly pledged allegiance to al - Baghdadi in a Facebook post . Once dependent on leaflets and videotapes , terrorist groups now use social media as a chief recruiting tool . Facebook , Twitter , and other social networks have responded by accelerating campaigns to shut down accounts that spew pro-ISIS messages on their platforms ; Twitter in particular has seen some success suspending ISIS - affiliated accounts by expanding its teams that watch for objectionable content . But it 's impossible to keep terrorist propaganda off of social networking platforms entirely . Each day , Twitter users tweet an average of 500 million times and more than a billion people log into Facebook . Instead of relying on humans to finger dangerous content , a computer - science professor at Dartmouth is proposing a system that proactively flags extremist photos , videos , and audio clips as they 're being posted online . But the software has been met with reluctance from the very social media companies that would use it , even before it was announced last week . The project 's leader is Hany Farid , the chair of Dartmouth 's computer - science department . Farid 's was the mind behind PhotoDNA , a Microsoft - backed system that detects child pornography as it 's posted online . That service relies on a stock of millions of pornographic images of children collected and maintained by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , or NCMEC . PhotoDNA creates a unique fingerprint of each image called a hash , which can identify the photo even if it 's been manipulated or cropped . It 's used by a long list of major organizations and companies \u2014 from social networks and cloud - storage services to governments and law enforcement agencies \u2014 to prevent images of juvenile sexual abuse from spreading . Microsoft has made the service free and easy for any new online services to deploy . When the service was introduced in 2008 , Farid says , the bulk of the child pornography traded on the internet was in the form of images \u2014 but today , child porn is largely in video form . To catch up , Farid has spent the last eight months updating PhotoDNA to be able to flag video and audio files as well as images . The expanded fingerprinting technology can help broaden the fight to suppress child pornography online \u2014 but Farid has long hoped to use it to attack another genre of offensive content . He teamed up with the Counter Extremism Project , a nonprofit led by a star-studded roster of former government officials , to propose a sister program to PhotoDNA that would help online platforms keep extremist content off the internet .

Both were born in 1896 ; both came from families that were Austrian in origin but had lived in Prague for generations . And when they met in their first year of medical school they found other things they had in common : a love of research and an enthusiasm for mountain climbing . Yet their backgrounds were very dissimilar . Carl came from a Catholic family which had a history of university professors on both sides . As he wrote in his autobiographical article \" The Call of Science , \" \" It would have been unusual for me to go in a different direction . Rejection of the values of one 's parents was not as prevalent then as it is today , and family tradition was still a strong influence . \" When Carl was two years old , his family moved to Trieste , then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , where his father was named director of the Marine Biological Station . Carl 's father had studied medicine , but later earned a Ph.D. in zoology . Cori later wrote that \" Trieste was a fascinating city in which to grow up . The early contact in school with different language groups developed in me an immunity against racial propaganda . \" Carl was educated at the classical gymnasium , whose syllabus still included rigorous training in Latin and Greek . Equally important in his education was experience at his father 's research institute . Carl often accompanied his father on field trips on a motor boat to collect marine samples . The elder Cori captained the boat and lectured on geology , botany and the history of the region , with side trips to visit Roman ruins . Summers were spent in the Tyrolean Alps with his extended family where the young Carl Cori developed a lifelong love of mountaineering . Less is known about the background of Gerty Radnitz . She was Jewish . Her father was a chemist who devised a method for refining sugar and became a successful manager of sugar refineries . Her mother , a cultured woman , was a friend of Franz Kafka , the influential novelist . The oldest of three sisters , Gerty was educated at home until ten , when she was sent to a private school . Carl Cori and Gerty Radnitz first met in 1914 \u2014 at the beginning of World War I \u2014 when they entered Carl Ferdinand University in Prague to study medicine . Carl described Gerty as \" a young woman who had charm , vitality , intelligence , a sense of humor , and love of the outdoors \u2014 qualities which immediately attracted me . A very pleasant period followed during which we would plan and study together , or go off on excursions to the countryside , or on a skiing expedition . \" The medical students studied inorganic and organic chemistry , physics and biology in the first year , adding biochemistry , physiology and pharmacology in the second year . This seemingly idyllic student environment ended abruptly when Carl was drafted into the Austrian army in 1916 , during the first World War . Like for so many young men who served in that conflict , the war had a profound affect on Carl 's view of human behavior . In addition , his experiences in the war and its immediate aftermath left him gloomy about the ability of doctors to control disease . In 1918 Carl was assigned to a barracks that served as a hospital for infectious diseases near the front lines on the Piave River in Italy . Disease was rampant , and \" the influenza epidemic with its high mortality rate among the poorly nourished soldiers and civilians and the inability to be of any help came as a great shock to me . \" After the war , Carl and Gerty were reunited . In 1920 they received their medical degrees and published their first joint research paper . That same year the young couple was married in Vienna , where they were pursuing postdoctoral studies . Carl split his time between the Internal Medicine Clinic and the Pharmacology Institute , both at the University of Vienna . He was able to conduct research , a rarity due to the economic deprivation of post - War Europe , because his father sent him a shipment of frogs . He used the animals to study the mechanism of the seasonal variation of the vagus action of the heart . Gerty Cori worked in pediatrics at the Karolinen Kinderspital ( children 's hospital ) , where she conducted research on temperature regulation before and following thyroid treatment and published several papers on blood disorders . Carl Cori wrote many years later that \" life in Vienna had its compensations , \" but in fact it also had its deprivations , and Gerty developed symptoms of xerophtalmia , a condition caused by vitamin A deficiency and which was cured only when she returned to Prague , where she ate a better diet . Because of the difficulty of life in Europe and because Gerty was Jewish and a woman , which made finding an academic position difficult , the Coris decided to investigate immigrating to the United States . In 1921 Carl interviewed for a position at the State Institute for the Study of Malignant Disease ( now Roswell Park Memorial Institute ) in Buffalo , New York . But when he heard nothing further , he accepted a position instead with Otto Loewi in the Pharmacology Department at the University of Graz . Gerty remained in Vienna at the Children 's Hospital . Carl Cori found working with Loewi , who discovered that acetylcholine was the substance that led to vagus stimulation of the heart , intellectually rewarding . It was also a period in his life when he planned for the future . It was while he was at Graz that Cori decided to study intestinal absorption and the metabolism of sugar in animals . Family tradition holds that Gerty 's interest in sugar metabolism stemmed from her father , who when be became diabetic , said to his daughter , who was a doctor , \" Find me a cure . \" But despite the joy of working with Loewi , Carl found the atmosphere at Graz disturbing . The living conditions were poor , and it had been necessary for him to prove his Aryan descent to obtain employment at the university . So determined were the Coris to leave Europe that they applied to the Dutch government to serve as doctors in Java . But the offer eventually came from Buffalo , and the Coris eagerly accepted . My grandfather , that is , my mother 's father , toward the end of his life became diabetic and he said to his daughter , who was a doctor , ' Find me a cure . ' \" \u2014 Tom Cori , Living St. Louis , a production of KETC in St. Louis , Missouri . Carl and Gerty Cori : A Truly Collaborative Relationship Carl Cori accepted a position as a biochemist at the State Institute for the Study of Malignant Disease in Buffalo , N.Y. , in 1922 . Gerty Cori joined him six months later , after taking a position as an assistant pathologist . The two were never apart again professionally . At the beginning of their tenure at the Institute , the Coris encountered opposition to their working together . Gerty Cori was told she would lose her job if she strayed from her laboratory in the pathology department . Soon , however , their colleagues came to understand and respect the Coris wish to work together , which they did until Gerty 's death in 1957 . In 1931 Carl Cori was offered the chairmanship of the pharmacology department at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis . The offer came as something of a surprise , since his only previous academic experience was as a one - year adjunct assistant professor at the University of Buffalo . As chairman , Cori had to run the department , equip a research laboratory , and teach medical students . Gerty Cori received a research position in the same department , with only a token salary . Years later , when she was ill , Gerty told Mildred Cohn : \" I do n't feel guilty about accepting my full salary [ now ] in spite of my frequent absence , because when Carl and I first came here , they paid me 10 percent of that they paid him . \" In his autobiography , Carl Cori related one other incident when the Coris encountered opposition to their working collaboratively . He was offered a position at a good university , with three stipulations : That he take speech lessons , that he cease working on insulin , and that he stop collaborating with his wife . He declined because the last two stipulations were unacceptable . On one visit to the university , Gerty was told that it was \" un - American \" for a husband and wife to work together . Eventually most opposition to their working together melted away , but Gerty Cori did run up against other forms of gender discrimination . When the Coris were hired at Washington University , she received one-tenth Carl 's salary , even though they were equal partners in the laboratory . Theirs was a truly collaborative relationship . Their son Tom says his mother had the ideas ; then they both would go into the laboratory to execute the idea or disprove it . Their closeness extended beyond their scientific endeavors ; as Mildred Cohn , who knew the Coris and has written about them , relates , they complemented each other intellectually : \" She would start a sentence , he would finish it . \" Carl Cori summed up the nature of their partnership in his remarks at the Nobel banquet in 1947 : \" Our collaboration began 30 years ago when we were still medical students at the University of Prague and has continued ever since . Our efforts have been largely complementary , and one with the other would not have gone as far as in combination . \" They were a remarkable pair . Gerty would have flights of fancy . She 'd come up with extraordinary ideas . Cori had the ability to put them into concrete questions to answer . And therefore as a team they were extraordinary . \" \u2014 David Kipnis , postdoctoral fellow in the Coris ' laboratory at Washington University The 1947 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology : Discovery of the \" Cori Cycle , \" \" Cori Ester \" and Glycogen Synthesis Carl and Gerty Cori spent more than three decades exploring how the human body metabolizes glucose . It was known in the 1920s that faulty sugar metabolism could lead to diabetes , and it was also known that insulin kept the disease in check . The effect of insulin on blood sugar levels had been observed , but scientists did not understand the biochemical mechanism behind insulin 's effect or how carbohydrates were metabolized . An early breakthrough in their research came with the discovery of the \" Cori cycle . \" This discovery stemmed from their research into the question of what regulates blood glucose concentration and how the human body metabolizes sugar . Sugar metabolism supplies energy for life 's activities . The human body is unable to make the slightest muscular movement without the burning of sugar . In the 19th century , the great French physiologist , Claude Bernard , discovered glycogen , the starch - like substance found in muscles and the liver . Glycogen molecules contain glucose , and when needed the glycogen is processed by the body into glucose . This mechanism keeps the glucose level in the blood constant even though the supply is uneven . The interplay between glucose and glycogen is at the heart of what is known as the \" Cori cycle . \" The Coris found that insulin increased the oxidation of glucose and its conversion to glycogen in muscle , as well as in the liver . Epinephrine , or adrenaline , worked in reverse , decreasing muscle glycogen and liver glycogen . Since other researchers had established that muscle glycogen does not contribute significantly to blood glucose , the Coris concluded that muscle glycogen must form an intermediate substance which then circulates through the blood to the liver . The Coris theorized \u2014 and eventually demonstrated \u2014 that this intermediate was lactic acid and was integral to the \" cycle of carbohydrates , \" or the \" Cori cycle , \" which they depicted in 1929 : In 1931 Carl Cori wrote a review article in Physiological Reviews , which summarized what was then known about mammalian carbohydrate metabolism . He observed that most research to date had been done on whole animals and very little on tissue preparations . Studying whole animals had led to advances in understanding regulatory processes but had yielded little knowledge regarding underlying metabolic mechanisms . In his autobiography , Carl Cori notes it was \" this realization that led us to examine the potentialities of tissue preparation \" which he called \" a most exciting period in biochemistry . \" The 1931 article appeared on the eve of the Coris move to Washington University : it gave an indication of the direction of their future research on the mechanism of glycogen metabolism , more properly known as glycogenolysis . Experimenting on minced skeletal muscle from frogs , the Coris determined a new intermediate of glycogen breakdown , which they described as glucose - 1 - phosphate and which came to be known as the \" Cori ester . \" Working with Sidney Colowick , their joint graduate student , the Coris established the compound 's structure and discovered the enzyme that catalyzed its formation , which they named phosphorylase . In addition , the Coris demonstrated that the reversal of the phosphorylase - catalyzed reaction produced glycogen , the first time a biological macromolecule had been synthesized in a test tube . The Coris , in a collaboration with Arda Green that produced four seminal papers in 1942 - 1943 , crystallized the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase from muscle and investigated its chemical properties . The Coris path-breaking research into the enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions of carbohydrate metabolism resulted in their sharing the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947 with Bernardo Houssay of Argentina . The Nobel committee cited the Coris \" for their discovery of the course of the catalytic conversion of glycogen \" and Houssay \" for the discovery of the importance of the anterior pituitary hormone for the metabolism of sugar . \" Their son Tom , who was then eleven , remembers his parents \" were in high spirits \" when they received news of the Nobel award , but they also told a newspaper reporter that they were \" pleased , overwhelmed , and too busy to celebrate . \" The Coris ' Later Years The years in St. Louis were productive and rewarding for the Coris . In 1946 , Carl switched departments , becoming chairman of biological chemistry . They were able to collaborate on research , the only obstacles being the demands placed on Carl Cori because of his administrative duties as department chairman . They did seminal work in the mechanism of glycogen utilization . And they liked St. Louis , so much so that they turned down prestigious offers from Harvard , Berkeley and the Rockefeller Institute . The Coris were supportive of the many scientists who flocked to their laboratory in St. Louis to study and work with them , including seven future Nobel Laureates . All were invited to take part in the daily brown - bag lunches in the library , where the conversation included current research interests but also might touch on a raft of non-scientific subjects . Most visitors were impressed by the depth of their interests and knowledge . They had many friends in St. Louis , a modern house and a garden in which they divided the labor ; she grew the flowers , he raised the vegetables . The Coris read widely . Gerty was interested in history , biography and modern novels , while her husband was knowledgeable in archaeology , poetry and art . Carl was also a poet and fluent in German , French , Italian and English . The excitement and reward of receiving the Noble Prize in 1947 was overshadowed by the knowledge that Gerty Cori had developed an incurable and fatal illness , myelosclerosis , which leads to anemia . The Coris discovered Gerty 's illness while mountain climbing in the Rockies in the summer of 1947 . She suffered for ten years . Carl later wrote that \" she bore [ the disease ] with great fortitude and without letup in her scientific interests . \" She continued her research almost until the end , working on the enzymatic lesions in different forms of glycogen storage disease and describing with Joseph Larner a new enzyme they called \" the debrancher . \" Mildred Cohn writes that near the end of her life , Gerty Cori said : \" I gave a party to squelch the rumor that I was dead . \" She died at home in 1957 . In 1960 Carl Cori married Anne Fitzgerald - Jones . The two shared many common interests , including archaeology , art and literature . In 1966 he retired from Washington University and was appointed visiting professor of Biological Chemistry at Harvard Medical School . At the same time he maintained a laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital , continuing his research until he became too ill in the 1980s . Cori 's research went in a new direction in these years as he became interested in the relationship between mutations of an enzyme , glucose - 6 - phospatase , to metabolic diseases . In this work he began collaborating with a noted geneticist Salom\u00e9 Gl\u00fcecksohn - Waelsch of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York . Cori and Gl\u00dcecksohn - Waelsch published their first joint paper in 1968 and the last in 1983 , when Carl became too ill to continue research . Carl Cori died in 1984 . Further Reading - Gerty T.

Both were born in 1896 ; both came from families that were Austrian in origin but had lived in Prague for generations . And when they met in their first year of medical school they found other things they had in common : a love of research and an enthusiasm for mountain climbing . Yet their backgrounds were very dissimilar . Carl came from a Catholic family which had a history of university professors on both sides . As he wrote in his autobiographical article \" The Call of Science , \" \" It would have been unusual for me to go in a different direction . Rejection of the values of one 's parents was not as prevalent then as it is today , and family tradition was still a strong influence . \" When Carl was two years old , his family moved to Trieste , then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , where his father was named director of the Marine Biological Station . Carl 's father had studied medicine , but later earned a Ph.D. in zoology . Cori later wrote that \" Trieste was a fascinating city in which to grow up . The early contact in school with different language groups developed in me an immunity against racial propaganda . \" Carl was educated at the classical gymnasium , whose syllabus still included rigorous training in Latin and Greek . Equally important in his education was experience at his father 's research institute . Carl often accompanied his father on field trips on a motor boat to collect marine samples . The elder Cori captained the boat and lectured on geology , botany and the history of the region , with side trips to visit Roman ruins . Summers were spent in the Tyrolean Alps with his extended family where the young Carl Cori developed a lifelong love of mountaineering . Less is known about the background of Gerty Radnitz . She was Jewish . Her father was a chemist who devised a method for refining sugar and became a successful manager of sugar refineries . Her mother , a cultured woman , was a friend of Franz Kafka , the influential novelist . The oldest of three sisters , Gerty was educated at home until ten , when she was sent to a private school . Carl Cori and Gerty Radnitz first met in 1914 \u2014 at the beginning of World War I \u2014 when they entered Carl Ferdinand University in Prague to study medicine . Carl described Gerty as \" a young woman who had charm , vitality , intelligence , a sense of humor , and love of the outdoors \u2014 qualities which immediately attracted me . A very pleasant period followed during which we would plan and study together , or go off on excursions to the countryside , or on a skiing expedition . \" The medical students studied inorganic and organic chemistry , physics and biology in the first year , adding biochemistry , physiology and pharmacology in the second year . This seemingly idyllic student environment ended abruptly when Carl was drafted into the Austrian army in 1916 , during the first World War . Like for so many young men who served in that conflict , the war had a profound affect on Carl 's view of human behavior . In addition , his experiences in the war and its immediate aftermath left him gloomy about the ability of doctors to control disease . In 1918 Carl was assigned to a barracks that served as a hospital for infectious diseases near the front lines on the Piave River in Italy . Disease was rampant , and \" the influenza epidemic with its high mortality rate among the poorly nourished soldiers and civilians and the inability to be of any help came as a great shock to me . \" After the war , Carl and Gerty were reunited . In 1920 they received their medical degrees and published their first joint research paper . That same year the young couple was married in Vienna , where they were pursuing postdoctoral studies . Carl split his time between the Internal Medicine Clinic and the Pharmacology Institute , both at the University of Vienna . He was able to conduct research , a rarity due to the economic deprivation of post - War Europe , because his father sent him a shipment of frogs . He used the animals to study the mechanism of the seasonal variation of the vagus action of the heart . Gerty Cori worked in pediatrics at the Karolinen Kinderspital ( children 's hospital ) , where she conducted research on temperature regulation before and following thyroid treatment and published several papers on blood disorders . Carl Cori wrote many years later that \" life in Vienna had its compensations , \" but in fact it also had its deprivations , and Gerty developed symptoms of xerophtalmia , a condition caused by vitamin A deficiency and which was cured only when she returned to Prague , where she ate a better diet . Because of the difficulty of life in Europe and because Gerty was Jewish and a woman , which made finding an academic position difficult , the Coris decided to investigate immigrating to the United States . In 1921 Carl interviewed for a position at the State Institute for the Study of Malignant Disease ( now Roswell Park Memorial Institute ) in Buffalo , New York . But when he heard nothing further , he accepted a position instead with Otto Loewi in the Pharmacology Department at the University of Graz . Gerty remained in Vienna at the Children 's Hospital . Carl Cori found working with Loewi , who discovered that acetylcholine was the substance that led to vagus stimulation of the heart , intellectually rewarding . It was also a period in his life when he planned for the future . It was while he was at Graz that Cori decided to study intestinal absorption and the metabolism of sugar in animals . Family tradition holds that Gerty 's interest in sugar metabolism stemmed from her father , who when be became diabetic , said to his daughter , who was a doctor , \" Find me a cure . \" But despite the joy of working with Loewi , Carl found the atmosphere at Graz disturbing . The living conditions were poor , and it had been necessary for him to prove his Aryan descent to obtain employment at the university . So determined were the Coris to leave Europe that they applied to the Dutch government to serve as doctors in Java . But the offer eventually came from Buffalo , and the Coris eagerly accepted . My grandfather , that is , my mother 's father , toward the end of his life became diabetic and he said to his daughter , who was a doctor , ' Find me a cure . ' \" \u2014 Tom Cori , Living St. Louis , a production of KETC in St. Louis , Missouri . Carl and Gerty Cori : A Truly Collaborative Relationship Carl Cori accepted a position as a biochemist at the State Institute for the Study of Malignant Disease in Buffalo , N.Y. , in 1922 . Gerty Cori joined him six months later , after taking a position as an assistant pathologist . The two were never apart again professionally . At the beginning of their tenure at the Institute , the Coris encountered opposition to their working together . Gerty Cori was told she would lose her job if she strayed from her laboratory in the pathology department . Soon , however , their colleagues came to understand and respect the Coris wish to work together , which they did until Gerty 's death in 1957 . In 1931 Carl Cori was offered the chairmanship of the pharmacology department at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis . The offer came as something of a surprise , since his only previous academic experience was as a one - year adjunct assistant professor at the University of Buffalo . As chairman , Cori had to run the department , equip a research laboratory , and teach medical students . Gerty Cori received a research position in the same department , with only a token salary . Years later , when she was ill , Gerty told Mildred Cohn : \" I do n't feel guilty about accepting my full salary [ now ] in spite of my frequent absence , because when Carl and I first came here , they paid me 10 percent of that they paid him . \" In his autobiography , Carl Cori related one other incident when the Coris encountered opposition to their working collaboratively . He was offered a position at a good university , with three stipulations : That he take speech lessons , that he cease working on insulin , and that he stop collaborating with his wife . He declined because the last two stipulations were unacceptable . On one visit to the university , Gerty was told that it was \" un - American \" for a husband and wife to work together . Eventually most opposition to their working together melted away , but Gerty Cori did run up against other forms of gender discrimination . When the Coris were hired at Washington University , she received one-tenth Carl 's salary , even though they were equal partners in the laboratory . Theirs was a truly collaborative relationship . Their son Tom says his mother had the ideas ; then they both would go into the laboratory to execute the idea or disprove it . Their closeness extended beyond their scientific endeavors ; as Mildred Cohn , who knew the Coris and has written about them , relates , they complemented each other intellectually : \" She would start a sentence , he would finish it . \" Carl Cori summed up the nature of their partnership in his remarks at the Nobel banquet in 1947 : \" Our collaboration began 30 years ago when we were still medical students at the University of Prague and has continued ever since . Our efforts have been largely complementary , and one with the other would not have gone as far as in combination . \" They were a remarkable pair . Gerty would have flights of fancy . She 'd come up with extraordinary ideas . Cori had the ability to put them into concrete questions to answer . And therefore as a team they were extraordinary . \" \u2014 David Kipnis , postdoctoral fellow in the Coris ' laboratory at Washington University The 1947 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology : Discovery of the \" Cori Cycle , \" \" Cori Ester \" and Glycogen Synthesis Carl and Gerty Cori spent more than three decades exploring how the human body metabolizes glucose . It was known in the 1920s that faulty sugar metabolism could lead to diabetes , and it was also known that insulin kept the disease in check . The effect of insulin on blood sugar levels had been observed , but scientists did not understand the biochemical mechanism behind insulin 's effect or how carbohydrates were metabolized . An early breakthrough in their research came with the discovery of the \" Cori cycle . \" This discovery stemmed from their research into the question of what regulates blood glucose concentration and how the human body metabolizes sugar . Sugar metabolism supplies energy for life 's activities . The human body is unable to make the slightest muscular movement without the burning of sugar . In the 19th century , the great French physiologist , Claude Bernard , discovered glycogen , the starch - like substance found in muscles and the liver . Glycogen molecules contain glucose , and when needed the glycogen is processed by the body into glucose . This mechanism keeps the glucose level in the blood constant even though the supply is uneven . The interplay between glucose and glycogen is at the heart of what is known as the \" Cori cycle . \" The Coris found that insulin increased the oxidation of glucose and its conversion to glycogen in muscle , as well as in the liver . Epinephrine , or adrenaline , worked in reverse , decreasing muscle glycogen and liver glycogen . Since other researchers had established that muscle glycogen does not contribute significantly to blood glucose , the Coris concluded that muscle glycogen must form an intermediate substance which then circulates through the blood to the liver . The Coris theorized \u2014 and eventually demonstrated \u2014 that this intermediate was lactic acid and was integral to the \" cycle of carbohydrates , \" or the \" Cori cycle , \" which they depicted in 1929 : In 1931 Carl Cori wrote a review article in Physiological Reviews , which summarized what was then known about mammalian carbohydrate metabolism . He observed that most research to date had been done on whole animals and very little on tissue preparations . Studying whole animals had led to advances in understanding regulatory processes but had yielded little knowledge regarding underlying metabolic mechanisms . In his autobiography , Carl Cori notes it was \" this realization that led us to examine the potentialities of tissue preparation \" which he called \" a most exciting period in biochemistry . \" The 1931 article appeared on the eve of the Coris move to Washington University : it gave an indication of the direction of their future research on the mechanism of glycogen metabolism , more properly known as glycogenolysis . Experimenting on minced skeletal muscle from frogs , the Coris determined a new intermediate of glycogen breakdown , which they described as glucose - 1 - phosphate and which came to be known as the \" Cori ester . \" Working with Sidney Colowick , their joint graduate student , the Coris established the compound 's structure and discovered the enzyme that catalyzed its formation , which they named phosphorylase . In addition , the Coris demonstrated that the reversal of the phosphorylase - catalyzed reaction produced glycogen , the first time a biological macromolecule had been synthesized in a test tube . The Coris , in a collaboration with Arda Green that produced four seminal papers in 1942 - 1943 , crystallized the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase from muscle and investigated its chemical properties . The Coris path-breaking research into the enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions of carbohydrate metabolism resulted in their sharing the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947 with Bernardo Houssay of Argentina . The Nobel committee cited the Coris \" for their discovery of the course of the catalytic conversion of glycogen \" and Houssay \" for the discovery of the importance of the anterior pituitary hormone for the metabolism of sugar . \" Their son Tom , who was then eleven , remembers his parents \" were in high spirits \" when they received news of the Nobel award , but they also told a newspaper reporter that they were \" pleased , overwhelmed , and too busy to celebrate . \" The Coris ' Later Years The years in St. Louis were productive and rewarding for the Coris . In 1946 , Carl switched departments , becoming chairman of biological chemistry . They were able to collaborate on research , the only obstacles being the demands placed on Carl Cori because of his administrative duties as department chairman . They did seminal work in the mechanism of glycogen utilization . And they liked St. Louis , so much so that they turned down prestigious offers from Harvard , Berkeley and the Rockefeller Institute . The Coris were supportive of the many scientists who flocked to their laboratory in St. Louis to study and work with them , including seven future Nobel Laureates . All were invited to take part in the daily brown - bag lunches in the library , where the conversation included current research interests but also might touch on a raft of non-scientific subjects . Most visitors were impressed by the depth of their interests and knowledge . They had many friends in St. Louis , a modern house and a garden in which they divided the labor ; she grew the flowers , he raised the vegetables . The Coris read widely . Gerty was interested in history , biography and modern novels , while her husband was knowledgeable in archaeology , poetry and art . Carl was also a poet and fluent in German , French , Italian and English . The excitement and reward of receiving the Noble Prize in 1947 was overshadowed by the knowledge that Gerty Cori had developed an incurable and fatal illness , myelosclerosis , which leads to anemia . The Coris discovered Gerty 's illness while mountain climbing in the Rockies in the summer of 1947 . She suffered for ten years . Carl later wrote that \" she bore [ the disease ] with great fortitude and without letup in her scientific interests . \" She continued her research almost until the end , working on the enzymatic lesions in different forms of glycogen storage disease and describing with Joseph Larner a new enzyme they called \" the debrancher . \" Mildred Cohn writes that near the end of her life , Gerty Cori said : \" I gave a party to squelch the rumor that I was dead . \" She died at home in 1957 . In 1960 Carl Cori married Anne Fitzgerald - Jones . The two shared many common interests , including archaeology , art and literature . In 1966 he retired from Washington University and was appointed visiting professor of Biological Chemistry at Harvard Medical School . At the same time he maintained a laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital , continuing his research until he became too ill in the 1980s . Cori 's research went in a new direction in these years as he became interested in the relationship between mutations of an enzyme , glucose - 6 - phospatase , to metabolic diseases . In this work he began collaborating with a noted geneticist Salom\u00e9 Gl\u00fcecksohn - Waelsch of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York . Cori and Gl\u00dcecksohn - Waelsch published their first joint paper in 1968 and the last in 1983 , when Carl became too ill to continue research . Carl Cori died in 1984 . Further Reading - Gerty T.

But a League investigation by \" independent forensic accountants \" found that the football club and SLH were \" inextricably linked as one economic entity \" and applied their mandatory penalty .

He told BBC Five Live Sport : \" Southampton Leisure Holdings and Southampton Football Club are two separate companies . \" Mark Fry is the administrator for SLH , he 's not the administrator for the club . We 're not in administration , we 're paying our bills and I do n't see how they can take these points off us . \" Southampton Football Club was set up so that if this ever happened , we would not have these points deducted - it 's the way they have interpreted the rules . \" I think we have a very strong case , I hope we appeal and we now have to focus on winning against Burnley on Saturday , we need to safeguard our Championship status and then hopefully have this decision overturned - then we 'll be back where we belong next season . \" Responding to Crouch on Five Live Sport , Football League chairman Lord Mawhinney said : \" What he said that was of particular interest of me was when he said this structure was set up to avoid the football club having a penalty if it got into financial trouble . The board is acting on sound legal advice , implementing the rules the clubs themselves wanted put in place Football League chairman Lord Mawhinney \" We have looked carefully at the holding company 's annual accounts , which include the football club , we sent forensic accountants into the company - not Football League staff , but people whose expertise is to get to the bottom of relationships between companies - and we have taken external legal advice . \" It 's quite clear the holding company and the football club are inextricably linked as one economic entity . \" All of the evidence pointed us to the conclusion that an administrator has been appointed that covers the club or aspects of the club as well as the holding company , and that being the case , we had no flexibility under Football League regulations - we had to apply sporting sanctions . \" It 's worth pointing out that those sporting sanctions were agreed by all the clubs . This is not a runaway decision - the board is acting on sound legal advice , implementing the rules the clubs themselves wanted put in place . \" The 10 - point deduction for Football League clubs entering administration was introduced in 2004 , with Wrexham the first League team to suffer a deduction in the 2004/05 season . In 2007 , the rule was amended so that clubs going into administration after the fourth Thursday in March would have the 10 - point deduction suspended , after Leeds United and Boston United both entered administration when they were all but relegated , just before the end of the 2006/07 season . The 72 League clubs ' chairmen unanimously backed the measure , so that if a club entering administration after the deadline escaped relegation , the 10 points would be deducted that season - but if they were relegated anyway , 10 points would be taken off the following season . Mawhinney explained : \" The clubs decided the sporting sanctions would have effect - so if a club was already going to be relegated , it ought not to get an advantage by going into administration and taking a 10 - point hit when it was going to be relegated anyway . \" He also hit back at claims that the club were not given enough notice , adding : \" Towards the end of the process , the club withdrew its co-operation from the process , so we had to move to a conclusion one way or the other . \" Once the decision was made , the club were notified before any public statement was made . \" Southampton are the fifth Football League team to be deducted points this season - Darlington entered administration , while Luton , Bournemouth and Rotherham were all penalised for coming out of administration without a Company Voluntary Agreement in place , as per the League 's insolvency guidelines . The punishment means Southampton are looking at life in English football 's third tier for the first time in 50 years . The 1976 FA Cup winners enjoyed a 27 - year stay in the top flight before the club were relegated in 2005 . BBC South Today 's Tony Husband added : \" It 's been a blame game for the last four years at Southampton since they were relegated from the Premier League , with different sets of directors blaming each other for the ills of the club . \" Former chairman Rupert Lowe is deeply unpopular with many supporters and will undoubtedly shoulder much of the blame , but it would be unfair to say this is a mess totally of his making . \" For 30 years , Southampton were held up as one of the most well - run , friendly and organised clubs , a small - town team punching above its weight by virtue of good management , but this is now a club on its knees - it 's been a footballing catastrophe . \"","annotations":[{"text":"Football League","span":[80,94],"token_span":[12,13],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the Agent finishes the Activity."},{"text":"season","span":[457,462],"token_span":[82,82],"role":"Activity","label":"Activity","role_definition":"This role identifies the Activity that the Agent has finished."},{"text":"Southampton Football Club","span":[1017,1041],"token_span":[183,185],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"This role identifies the Agent who has finished an Activity."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"Administration and change of ownership The club ended the previous season with its parent company , Southampton Leisure Holdings PLC in administration .

The football club is not in administration . \" The Football League is a members ' organisation , and with any such body of that nature , you run the risk that if there is any grey area , they can interpret the rules as they see fit . \" I think they 've interpreted the rules to suit the conclusion they wanted to reach . \" It is expected that an appeal will be launched . \" Leon Crouch , who has had two spells as chairman of the football club , hit out at the \" terrible timing \" of the League 's decision . He told BBC Five Live Sport : \" Southampton Leisure Holdings and Southampton Football Club are two separate companies . \" Mark Fry is the administrator for SLH , he 's not the administrator for the club . We 're not in administration , we 're paying our bills and I do n't see how they can take these points off us . \" Southampton Football Club was set up so that if this ever happened , we would not have these points deducted - it 's the way they have interpreted the rules . \" I think we have a very strong case , I hope we appeal and we now have to focus on winning against Burnley on Saturday , we need to safeguard our Championship status and then hopefully have this decision overturned - then we 'll be back where we belong next season . \" Responding to Crouch on Five Live Sport , Football League chairman Lord Mawhinney said : \" What he said that was of particular interest of me was when he said this structure was set up to avoid the football club having a penalty if it got into financial trouble . The board is acting on sound legal advice , implementing the rules the clubs themselves wanted put in place Football League chairman Lord Mawhinney \" We have looked carefully at the holding company 's annual accounts , which include the football club , we sent forensic accountants into the company - not Football League staff , but people whose expertise is to get to the bottom of relationships between companies - and we have taken external legal advice . \" It 's quite clear the holding company and the football club are inextricably linked as one economic entity . \" All of the evidence pointed us to the conclusion that an administrator has been appointed that covers the club or aspects of the club as well as the holding company , and that being the case , we had no flexibility under Football League regulations - we had to apply sporting sanctions . \" It 's worth pointing out that those sporting sanctions were agreed by all the clubs . This is not a runaway decision - the board is acting on sound legal advice , implementing the rules the clubs themselves wanted put in place . \" The 10 - point deduction for Football League clubs entering administration was introduced in 2004 , with Wrexham the first League team to suffer a deduction in the 2004/05 season . In 2007 , the rule was amended so that clubs going into administration after the fourth Thursday in March would have the 10 - point deduction suspended , after Leeds United and Boston United both entered administration when they were all but relegated , just before the end of the 2006/07 season . The 72 League clubs ' chairmen unanimously backed the measure , so that if a club entering administration after the deadline escaped relegation , the 10 points would be deducted that season - but if they were relegated anyway , 10 points would be taken off the following season . Mawhinney explained : \" The clubs decided the sporting sanctions would have effect - so if a club was already going to be relegated , it ought not to get an advantage by going into administration and taking a 10 - point hit when it was going to be relegated anyway . \" He also hit back at claims that the club were not given enough notice , adding : \" Towards the end of the process , the club withdrew its co-operation from the process , so we had to move to a conclusion one way or the other . \" Once the decision was made , the club were notified before any public statement was made . \" Southampton are the fifth Football League team to be deducted points this season - Darlington entered administration , while Luton , Bournemouth and Rotherham were all penalised for coming out of administration without a Company Voluntary Agreement in place , as per the League 's insolvency guidelines . The punishment means Southampton are looking at life in English football 's third tier for the first time in 50 years . The 1976 FA Cup winners enjoyed a 27 - year stay in the top flight before the club were relegated in 2005 . BBC South Today 's Tony Husband added : \" It 's been a blame game for the last four years at Southampton since they were relegated from the Premier League , with different sets of directors blaming each other for the ills of the club . \" Former chairman Rupert Lowe is deeply unpopular with many supporters and will undoubtedly shoulder much of the blame , but it would be unfair to say this is a mess totally of his making . \" For 30 years , Southampton were held up as one of the most well - run , friendly and organised clubs , a small - town team punching above its weight by virtue of good management , but this is now a club on its knees - it 's been a footballing catastrophe . \"","annotations":[{"text":"Southampton Football Club","span":[1017,1041],"token_span":[183,185],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"This role identifies the Agent who has finished an Activity."},{"text":"season","span":[457,462],"token_span":[82,82],"role":"Activity","label":"Activity","role_definition":"This role identifies the Activity that the Agent has finished."},{"text":"Football League","span":[80,94],"token_span":[12,13],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the Agent finishes the Activity."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-1337-261-frame-Activity_pause","frame":"Activity_pause","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Agent pauses in the course of an Activity.

Of course , this makes it all the more confusing to see them take such a high - quality series and dumb it down for their DSiWare spinoff release Blayz Bloo : Super Melee Action Battle Royale . Now instead of one - on - one fighting action , you get a 4 player beat 'em up that feels like a far less playable version of Super Smash Bros . The basic gameplay premise of BlayzBloo is quite simple . Using a basic set of attack and jump moves , you must battle it out against the three other players on the field . While the simple attack will prove to be your most frequently used offensive weapon , you 'll also have a special Drive Move for times when you need to lay a little extra beat down . You 'll even find treasure chests popping up around the stage that contain specialty items to be picked up and used against your opponents . Of course , the lack of any type of block move means that you 'll also have to spend some of your time moving away from attacks in order to survive as well . When you take on the game as a solo experience , you can do so in one of several ways . The matches can be played by three different rule sets : a Life Match pits you in an all - out duel to be the last character standing whereas a Points Match can be won by the character with the most earned points at the end of the round . The game even offers up a Flag Match that allows all players to fight over a cute little Panda Flag , with the character left holding it at the end of the round being the winner . In the single player mode , you 'll take on the game 's five basic stages in order , each with their own unique set of rules . And if you 'd like to customise things a bit more , you can choose to play in Free Battle Mode where you can choose the sets of rules and the stage . If you 're feeling a bit competitive , the game also offers up a multiplayer Free Battle Mode , which basically plays exactly as it does in the Single Player \u2013 only this time , you can bring in other players who have DSi systems and a copy of the game . While this does n't add much in the way of playability , it 's still a nice feature for those who like to play with friends , although a download play function might have made it a bit more enticing . The controls themselves function fairly well , but it 's the serious lack of depth that ultimately hurts the playability the most . The simple attack system never feels like it offers up enough variety , and once you 've exhausted the minimal set of variations , there 's not much left to enjoy . Couple this together with a sometimes cheap AI system and you 've got a gameplay experience that 's not only overly rudimentary , but also somewhat frustrating to boot . The cel-shaded visuals are certainly easy on the eyes , but much like the control system , the visuals are fairly basic in design . You wo n't see a lot of flashy detail throughout the various stages , and even the silky smooth animation of the characters is n't enough to improve the overall experience too much . The same goes for the musical performance \u2013 there are a few interesting tracks to enjoy , but that 's if you can somehow ignore the rather annoying voice announcer and character sound effects that muddy up the audio . Conclusion As a general rule , when you start messing with a winning formula , bad things tend to follow . Blayz Bloo is n't a terrible game , it 's just terribly mediocre . When you factor in the extremely limited content with the very bland and shallow gameplay system , you get a fighting experience that you 'll likely be tired of within the first 15 minutes of playing it .

These , monks , are the five dangers of reciting the Dhamma with a musical intonation . ( A.iii.250 ) Comments The sacred discourses of the Buddha are full of meaning . When reciting and listening to them it is vital to reflect on the meaning as well as to listen with respect and devotion . Reciting suttas is the traditional method for preserving the sacred texts , and passing them on to future generations . It should not be allowed to degenerate into a form of entertainment . While listening to discourses , the devotees should sit with hands in a\u00f1jali , paying respectful attention . The way of chanting by many monks these days is incorrect , and contrary to the Vinaya rules , because they are striving to make a melodious sound rather than merely striving for clear pronunciation of the words . Buddhist monks should regularly teach the meaning of frequently recited suttas such as Metta Sutta , Mangala Sutta , Ratana Sutta . Every Buddhist devotee should be very familiar with these discourses , and most could probably recite them by heart . However , if the meaning is not understood , the excellent Dhamma teachings contained in these discourses will not be put into practice . \u00a9 You may print any of these books for your own use .

Oneself gets attached to the sound others get attached to the sound , householders are annoyed , saying , \u201c Just as we sing , these sons of the Sakyan sing \u201d , the concentration of those who do not like the sound is destroyed , and later generations copy it . These , monks , are the five dangers of reciting the Dhamma with a musical intonation . ( A.iii.250 ) Comments The sacred discourses of the Buddha are full of meaning . When reciting and listening to them it is vital to reflect on the meaning as well as to listen with respect and devotion . Reciting suttas is the traditional method for preserving the sacred texts , and passing them on to future generations . It should not be allowed to degenerate into a form of entertainment . While listening to discourses , the devotees should sit with hands in a\u00f1jali , paying respectful attention . The way of chanting by many monks these days is incorrect , and contrary to the Vinaya rules , because they are striving to make a melodious sound rather than merely striving for clear pronunciation of the words . Buddhist monks should regularly teach the meaning of frequently recited suttas such as Metta Sutta , Mangala Sutta , Ratana Sutta . Every Buddhist devotee should be very familiar with these discourses , and most could probably recite them by heart . However , if the meaning is not understood , the excellent Dhamma teachings contained in these discourses will not be put into practice . \u00a9 You may print any of these books for your own use .

With the game making its debut today on the European WiiWare service under its new moniker Hydroventure , we thought it might be a good time to sit down with developer Curve Studios to find out a little bit more about the rather unique physics - based adventure . Jonathan Biddle ( affectionately known as Bidds to his friends ) , the Design Director at Curve Studios and director of Fluidity / Hydroventure , was kind enough to take time out of his busy schedule to answer a few of our questions . You can find out what he had to say to us in the exclusive Nintendo Life interview below . Nintendo Life : Can you tell us a little bit about Curve Studios and what key games you have worked on in the past ? Bidds : Curve Studios was formed in 2005 by a number of industry veterans with the express intention of working on smaller games , such as digital download and handheld . We 'd been through the mill on larger , big - budget titles many times before and decided that , with Curve , we 'd like to instead create something that was small and perfectly formed . We 're best known for our work on Sony 's Buzz ! franchise on PSP , and while we 're proud of those games , it 's not really representational of who we are as a developer . We 're very creatively - driven , working hard on making inventive video games with a lot of heart . Although players are only now getting their hands on our first original titles , we 've been slaving away over these for years ; we created the Fluidity concept in 2006 , and started development in 2008 . Explodemon was first started in 2005 . NL : As an established PlayStation developer , why did you decide to develop a game for WiiWare ? Bidds : We 've always been platform- agnostic as a developer . We create original ideas and then target them towards the platform that we 're developing them for . The idea for a water game first came up in 2005 , but it was n't until we saw the Wii Remote that it really took shape . We knew that tilting a controller and having water react on - screen exactly as it would in real life would create an immediate and intuitive interface that people would n't need explaining to them . It was at this point that we knew we had a great WiiWare title . NL : Nintendo published your game on WiiWare - how did this come about ? Bidds : We met up with our eventual Nintendo producers , Masa Miyazaki and Azusa Tajima , at GDC in 2008 and pitched a couple of ideas to them , including Fluidity . After listening patiently , they were very complimentary and said that we 'd pitched some really fresh ideas . They got back shortly after to say that they liked to go forward with an experiment with Fluidity . NL : In North America we know your game as Fluidity , but this was changed to Hydroventure for Europe . What were the reasons behind the name change ? Bidds : This was simply for legal reasons . Fluidity did n't pass Nintendo 's legal and trademark checks in Europe . NL : How did you come up with the game concept for Fluidity ? Bidds : The idea of making a game based on water was originally discussed in 2005 . Water is so universal ; it 's used by everyone in all walks of life every day , and always in a positive way . We have fun in it , clean ourselves with it , drink it , cook with it , it 's even a part of our weather and strongly associated with life and the planet . We all learn about water 's basic properties in science class at school too . The basics of freezing water to make ice and boiling it to make steam are things that no one needs explaining to them . We thought that all of these elements could be brought together to make a great game with really unique mechanics , and when we saw the Wii Remote , we instantly saw how it could be done . NL : What difficulties did you face in developing a physics - based game , particularly with water which is notoriously tough to replicate ? Bidds : The game 's physics system was built organically over the course of the game . We started by creating the water physics and then layered the other elements over the top , for example , adding objects that the water could carry and making them interact with the world . As the game developed we added motors , joints , and the other elements , each time ensuring that they worked with what we had . This meant that the gameplay never outpaced the technology , instead growing together and supporting each other . Working with water as a main character was incredibly hard , however . In most video games , players control a single character that can only be in one place at once . The typical things that you use to control a game 's level design \u2013 such as triggers , switches , enemy AI \u2013 normally rely on a single player position . This was thrown out of the window for Fluidity , since the player could be in hundreds of places at once . We had to devise a system that catered for this in all circumstances , which took a lot of time to get right . NL : The controls handle very well for both newcomers and seasoned players . How did ensure the game handled well for everyone ? Bidds : The original concept we had for the game 's controls \u2013 tilt to move and lift to jump \u2013 went in from the beginning and just worked really well . However , because of the game 's water , we had to do a lot of work on the jump . Normally in a game , you let a character jump once and then not jump again until they have landed on the floor . This is n't possible with water , since we ca n't tell when the water has hit the ground , since it 's not a single entity - some of it might have , while some of it might not . The concept of the water being on the ground just does n't exist . Instead we allowed the player to jump whenever they wanted by lifting the world , even if they were in mid-air . We had to put a delay in after this however - otherwise they could repeatedly jump the water up and up , until it flew up into the sky ! We matched this style of jump control with level design to ensure that it worked well with the kind of challenges we were setting . We thought about putting the jump onto a button press but , aside from not having any buttons left , it did n't make any sense , nor feel right . Something was lost when the tactile , physical interface was removed . In Fluidity , you 're not making a character jump , but instead interacting with the world in a physical manner . We focused on ensuring that the jump worked well when instigated correctly and we 've found that \u2013 once players have got used to the lifting action and the kind of game Fluidity actually is \u2013 it works perfectly . We do have some tips to share though . During play testing , we noticed players holding the Wii Remote in certain positions that made it more difficult for them . In order to get the best out of the game , players should not tilt the Wii Remote past the vertical position , since the game does n't recognise angles past that point . While jumping , they should lift the Wii Remote perpendicular to its upwards face , not trying to ' scoop ' it around corners , for example . Also , players should ensure that the Wii Remote is facing upwards , in the position shown in the opening image of the game . If you follow these tips , you 'll get a perfect control experience . Interestingly , we did a lot of user testing , and found that the difference between those who played games a lot and those who did n't was n't as profound as you 'd normally find . We put this down to the intuitive interface and also because there had n't been a game about water before , so effectively everyone was a beginner . NL : Very few WiiWare titles features the degree of polish found in Fluidity . How were you able to squeeze so much detail and variety into such a small file size restriction ? Bidds : One of the benefits of having Nintendo as a publisher is that they commit to delivering a very polished game . They always pushed us just that bit further than we were used to , and were very supportive in helping us make the game everything it could be . Nintendo also really understands video games . They were always on hand to offer advice or a different way of looking at things , and we were able to collaborate really effectively on all development issues across the course of the game 's creation . It really was a great development experience working with Nintendo , and I think it shows in how well executed Fluidity is . NL : There would seem to be a lot of ideas left to explore with the gameplay scheme you 've created . Any chance we 'll see a sequel ? Bidds : Fluidity was , for us , a big , enjoyable gameplay experiment . We pushed the concept in so many directions , trying out lots of ideas and gradually refining it until we found the sweet spot . Now that we 've got a magic formula , we feel that there are lots of ways we can improve and build on it . Of course , given that Nintendo is the publisher , it 's really down to them . I 'm sure some great sales and positive comments from the game 's fans would really help ! NL : Given the tilt function of the upcoming 3DS system , do you think Fluidity would be a good fit for the system ? Bidds : We 're really excited for the 3DS - we were totally blown away when we saw the 3D effect in action . It 's clearly going to be an outstanding system , so we 'd love to be able to bring Fluidity to it . The gyro sensors in the 3DS would mean that our control scheme would carry across unchanged , so we do feel that it would work well . It 's up to Nintendo whether that becomes a reality though ! NL : The visuals are probably the most stand - out aspect of the game . What prompted the mix of detailed elements on abstract - like backdrops ? Bidds : The visual style of the game changed hugely from its initial concept . We originally wanted the game to look like an airline safety card that had come to life . When development started , we took this further when we began looking towards an educational presentational style , so that players would be learning about water and all of its properties by reading a futuristic interactive book . The book concept remained throughout development , but we found the educational style too plain and dry , so we evolved the style to become much more colourful and friendly . Since it is essential that the game objects can be seen at all times , they were designed to pop out of the background , but because our setting had morphed to become a magical illustrated book , the backdrops could be anything we wanted . This was empowering for the artists who were able to take each panel of the page \u2013 of which there are over a hundred \u2013 and give each its own individual personality . We think it 's created a really unique aesthetic that we 're very proud of . NL : Back in April 2009 we reported that you guys were going to bring Explodemon to WiiWare - why did you decide to switch over to PSN in the end ? Bidds : Because we were self - funding Explodemon , we were only able to focus on one platform at a time . We 'd always planned to lead with Explodemon on PS3 so when we came to look at other versions we had to look at the cost involved . Since any assets that were used for the HD version of the game would have to be recreated for the Wii version , and the engine rewritten to cater to the Wii 's processor , we simply did n't have the money to do it . It is something that we 'd still like to do though . We love the Wii and have had a great experience with WiiWare through Nintendo . We think the game fits the service and the console well , and we know there are people who want it . We 'll just have to see what the future holds ! NL : Did you have problems with Explodemon being confused with Twisted Pixel 's ' Splosion Man ? What 's the story there ? Bidds : There is quite a story to tell there . Explodemon is our oldest concept . I started it in my spare time as a 2D sprite game for PC in November 2005 , just for laughs . As the game became more developed and it was clear that people found it really enjoyable , many friends and colleagues ( and publishers ! ) started to take interest . We decided that it should become a proper Curve project and started to pitch the game to publishers . To cut a long story short , we managed to get slots on PSN and XBLA for the game in April 2008 . Unfortunately , at the same time we lost our funding , and so were unable to start development . We tried to get the game going many times that year , but in October 2008 , Microsoft took away our XBLA slot due to our inability to progress . We continued to develop the game , but more slowly because we still had very little money . On 1st April 2009 , our pitch trailer was discovered and word of our game spread . We got lots of really great comments , which was enormously encouraging for us ! Later that same day Twisted Pixel released their first press release for Splosion Man . We did eventually begin full development of Explodemon for PS3 in November 2009 . We believed in the game so much , and knew that we had something really fun , so we simply would n't give up ! We 're now finally preparing for release . However , we 're finding that there are a lot of people who are n't aware of our history and the things we 've been through , and so we 're subject to repeated accusations of creating a Splosion Man rip -off . As you can imagine , this is pretty frustrating for us , since Explodemon 's core gameplay has n't really changed since 2006 ! For the record , I 've never played Splosion Man , so I ca n't comment on how similar it is , but from what I 've heard the games are very different in style and gameplay . All I know is that the same care and attention that we put into Fluidity is also present in Explodemon . We know video games , and we care a lot about making them right . We 've got some very deep and well - considered gameplay that has been honed in the many years since the prototype was first created . Now we 're just looking forward to people getting their hands on Explodemon so that they can see that it 's very much its own game , really quite unique and extremely enjoyable . The story of Explodemon 's genesis and release is long and interesting . If your readers would like to hear the full tale , they can read the Explodemon Saga at my blog , http://www.onebitbeyond.com. NL : Is there anything you 'd like to say to our readers in closing ? Bidds : Regarding Fluidity , we 're really happy to see a lot of players who 've dived right in and really got it , really enjoyed what we 've created . I 've not seen anyone who bought the game complain about it , which is great ! I think that there 's a bit of prejudgement that goes on these days amongst ' core ' gamers when it comes to motion controls , and some people presume that Fluidity will suffer from this . You 'll find that the game 's control method suits the game better than any traditional system ever could , because it 's been designed for the Wii Remote from the start and tuned right up to the very last moment . Try the demo , it 'll win you over !

However , we 're finding that there are a lot of people who are n't aware of our history and the things we 've been through , and so we 're subject to repeated accusations of creating a Splosion Man rip -off . As you can imagine , this is pretty frustrating for us , since Explodemon 's core gameplay has n't really changed since 2006 ! For the record , I 've never played Splosion Man , so I ca n't comment on how similar it is , but from what I 've heard the games are very different in style and gameplay . All I know is that the same care and attention that we put into Fluidity is also present in Explodemon . We know video games , and we care a lot about making them right . We 've got some very deep and well - considered gameplay that has been honed in the many years since the prototype was first created . Now we 're just looking forward to people getting their hands on Explodemon so that they can see that it 's very much its own game , really quite unique and extremely enjoyable . The story of Explodemon 's genesis and release is long and interesting . If your readers would like to hear the full tale , they can read the Explodemon Saga at my blog , http://www.onebitbeyond.com. NL : Is there anything you 'd like to say to our readers in closing ? Bidds : Regarding Fluidity , we 're really happy to see a lot of players who 've dived right in and really got it , really enjoyed what we 've created . I 've not seen anyone who bought the game complain about it , which is great ! I think that there 's a bit of prejudgement that goes on these days amongst ' core ' gamers when it comes to motion controls , and some people presume that Fluidity will suffer from this . You 'll find that the game 's control method suits the game better than any traditional system ever could , because it 's been designed for the Wii Remote from the start and tuned right up to the very last moment . Try the demo , it 'll win you over ! We 'd like to thank Jonathan Biddle for taking the time to do the interview with us .","annotations":[{"text":"water","span":[3689,3693],"token_span":[720,720],"role":"Food","label":"Food","role_definition":"Food is the entity to which heat is applied by the Cook."},{"text":"boiling","span":[3711,3717],"token_span":[725,725],"role":"Temperature_setting","label":"Temperature_setting","role_definition":"This role identifies the Temperature_setting of the Heating_instrument for the Food."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-4023-69-frame-Appointing","frame":"Appointing","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Selector, often an individual in a leadership role, appoints a Official to assume an official Role in an organization (which can be expressed as the Body).","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":["Change_of_leadership"],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"In October 2000 , he was appointed as manager of Oxford United , with Joe Kinnear as Director of Football .","annotations":[{"text":"October 2000","span":[3,14],"token_span":[1,2],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the designation of the official takes place."},{"text":"he","span":[18,19],"token_span":[4,4],"role":"Official","label":"Official","role_definition":"The Official is a person appointed to a recognized position."},{"text":"manager of Oxford United","span":[38,61],"token_span":[8,11],"role":"Role","label":"Role","role_definition":"Frequently, the Official is referred to only by his/her role.

LONG ISLAND , NY \u2014 Law enforcement is on high alert \u2014 and has offered a hefty reward \u2014 after discovering \" credible \" information that the deadly MS - 13 street gang has issued chilling orders for members to assassinate police officers on Long Island . The MS - 13 gang has sent out a battle cry , stating it was time to \" take back streets ... and take out a cop . \" MS - 13 is a brutal street gang that has set up deadly cartels marked by indiscriminate killing in major cities and small towns across the United States \u2014 including an escalating stronghold on Long Island , where sleepy towns have been the scene of blood - soaked murders and machete violence . Find out what 's happening in Riverheadwith free , real - time updates from Patch . A $ 25,000 reward has been offered by Suffolk County Crime Stoppers for information that leads to an arrest in connection with threats to harm police officers . The Nassau County Police Department was laser- focused Friday with an intelligence bulletin in mind that was issued about the threat to law officers ; on Wednesday , the Hempstead Police Department reported receiving information from a credible informant stating that MS - 13 was \" looking to shoot a cop in the Hempstead area . \" Find out what 's happening in Riverheadwith free , real - time updates from Patch . Police said they were looking for a tall , light - skinned Hispanic man with tattoos of three dots next to his eye . He reportedly told the informant that police had been making too many arrests and it was time to \" take the streets back and take out ( shoot ) a cop like we do in El Salvador , \" police said . Any member of MS - 13 had permission to carry out the attack , the informant reportedly said . The Suffolk County Police Department said it was aware of \" credible threats of violence that MS - 13 is prepared to harm a police officer in retaliation for gang arrests . \" The department has taken necessary precautions to protect its officers , officials said in a release . \" While the Suffolk County Police Department takes this threat seriously , we will not be deterred in our mission by threats by gang members , \" the release said . \" Our commitment in bringing gang members and their associates who commit crimes to justice continues to be a top priority . \" Police were warned to safeguard personal information , especially on social media . \" It is imperative that members of the department take these threats seriously and adapt their work habits and lifestyles accordingly , \" the Nassau County Police 's bulletin said Thursday . Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder issued a statement on the potential violence : \" I will not tolerate any threats against my officers and the Nassau County Police Department will continue to protect our residents and communities . \" Residents , he said , should call 911 immediately if they see or hear anything suspicious regarding any threats . Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa \u2014 the red- beret wearing crime fighter who has fought violence in New York City for years with volunteers patrols who carry no weapons \u2014 was skeptical about the alleged threat . \" I highly doubt it , \" he said . \" The feds just arrested a key ' shot caller . ' \" On Thursday , the highest - ranking member of the East Coast cliques of MS- 13 was arraigned in Nassau County on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and trafficking drugs , authorities said . His arrest was a major blow to the gang , authorities say . Miguel Angel Corea Diaz , aka Reaper , 35 , of Laurel , Maryland , was arraigned in Nassau County on Thursday before Acting Supreme Court Justice Patricia Harrington on three counts of operating as a major trafficker and five counts of second -degree conspiracy . If convicted of the top charge against him , Diaz faces up to 25 years to life in prison . Sliwa said Diaz was brought him from the beltway outside of Washington , D.C. \" Feds ca n't have it both ways , \" Sliwa said . \" They said in court that MS - 13 gang members had to get permission from the ' Reaper ' to commit various crimes , including murder . All of a sudden , having no contact with the Reaper , they 're going to hunt down and shoot cops ? \" Instead , Sliwa said he believes law enforcement will \" use it as a reason to crack down on MS - 13 locally , so that they can justify those raids , \" he said . A Nationwide Spotlight On Gang Brutality After brutal murders of four teens shocked the nation and the world , President Donald Trump spoke in Brentwood last year about the insidious MS - 13 gang that 's been terrorizing local communities across Long Island in the county . And in his speech , he promised to rid the gang - ravaged communities of Long Island of the \" animals \" on their streets . Long Island has been hit hard , with 17 \" beautiful young lives \" murdered since Jan. 16 on Long Island alone , including two teen girls , he said during his speech . \" They butchered those little girls . They kidnap . They extort . They rape and they rob . They prey on children . They should n't be here , \" Trump said . MS - 13 beats with victims with clubs , slashes them with knives and machetes , he said . \" They 're Animals \" \" They have transformed peaceful parks and beautiful , quiet neighborhoods into blood - stained killing fields . They 're animals , Trump said . Days after the gruesome discovery of four bodies in Central Islip on Long Island \u2014 the four young men are believed to have been victims of the deadly MS - 13 street gang \u2014 the spotlight has been steadily shining on Suffolk County as lawmakers , educators and a horrified public try to unravel MS - 13 and seek answers on how to stem the tide of brutality . MS - 13 , which was formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s by immigrants fleeing El Salvador 's civil war , is known for its bloody violence , including machete attacks and home invasions . But for all the public outcry , for those directly impacted by the quadruple homicide in Central Islip , the heartbreak is deeply personal . The four young men found dead on the night of April 12 at Central Islip Recreation Village Park suffered trauma from a sharp- edged instrument . They were only 16 , 18 , 18 and 20 years - old ; their lives just beginning . One of the victims , Jorge Tigre , a Bellport High School honor student , was not a gang member and allegedly became a target after he refused to associate with gang members following the murder of two girls in Brentwood , Nisa Mickens and Kayla Cuevas , who were murdered in September , 2016 by MS - 13 gang members with machetes . Tigre 's sister Monica Tigre , in an interview with Patch , declined to discuss what may have led to her brother 's murder , but said she and her family are left with only memories . \" The only thing I can said he was a wonderful person . He was always smiling and helping my family and me . I will remember him \u2014 his smile and his kindness , \" Tigre said . One Former MS- 13 Member 's Story Trying to illuminate the dark reality of an MS - 13 member 's life , * Elmer \u2014 his real name was withheld to protect his identity \u2014 a former MS - 13 member who was able to escape the gang 's tentacles and is now a member of Council for Unity , a non-profit organization that works with schools and jails to help gang members find new lives , shared his story with Patch . Telling his story , Elmer said : \" I joined the MS - 13 gang right after my mom died . I was 8 - years -old . The gang was , for me , a new life , a new family . \" After an initiation when he was jumped , Elmer said , \" They showed me everything I needed to know and then I started a new life by busting gangs , robbing , beating our enemies , doing any type of drugs every day , every night , shooting people , drinking every day . \" When he was 13 , Elmer said he was shot three times and almost lost his leg . \" I've been shot , stabbed almost to the point of dying and still did n't come to my senses . I spent my young life mostly in jail because of the violent and criminal things that I did . I lost two of my best friends when I was 15 , \" he said . Elmer said he made the decision to leave the gang because he was tired of \" seeing young people on the street getting killed every day . I was tired of funerals . Tired of watching kids join gangs , doing drugs in their early age . I decide to change when I saw two friends get hit with a straight bullet . . I 've made too many mothers cry . I refuse to let another tear be shed because of me . \" Spread of MS-13 Across The Nation The recent murders have put the insidious gang violence on Long Island on the international canvas , with the world watching and wondering how such gruesome violence has come to infiltrate sleepy , suburban communities . Sliwa spoke to Patch about the path MS - 13 has taken to Long Island . \" There was a very violent civil war in El Salvador from 1980 to 1992 . In 12 years 75,000 people were killed . It created a refugee crisis and many El Salvadorians fled North to Los Angeles . They settled in Mexican neighborhoods and immediately were preyed upon by the largest Los Angeles street gang , the 18th Street gang , which got started in Los Angeles in 1965 , \" he said . \" In order to protect themselves from the 18th Street gang , the El Salvadorians formed MS - 13 and started to defend their turf . And even though they were outnumbered they proved to be durable and extremely vicious . \" The \" Mexican Mafia , \" which controlled the Latinos in the California prison system , had MS - 13 join their ranks , Sliwa said . Next , Sliwa said , as El Salvadorians migrated east , looking for work , they landed in large numbers , first in Fairfax County , Va , . which is right outside of Washington , D.C. \" They then followed the trail up into Nassau and Suffolk counties , where there was a lot of day laborer work , \" he said . \" In the early 90s they embedded themselves into Fairfax County and in the late 90s they began to spread into Long Island . Along the way , MS - 13 started to recruit Guatemalans and Hondurans who were also being picked on by the Mexican 18th Street gang . \" The machete is a hallmark of bloody MS - 13 crime , Sliwa said . \" Unlike other gangs , which prefer guns , Ms -13 uses the machete as a weapon of terror . They will slash their victims , slice off fingers and limbs and on occasion , behead their intended targets . It is done to silence any potential snitches . \" Enforcement Efforts To Reign In The Mayhem From the federal government to local law enforcement , officials appalled by the staggering violence have vowed a crackdown . Suffolk County District Attorney Tim Sini has called MS - 13 \" the greatest public safety issue in Suffolk . \" U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions referred to the Central Islip murders as he pledged a federal focus on tackling MS - 13 ; he sent a message to the gang , \" We will find you . \" According to Suffolk County Sheriff 's Office Chief of Staff Michael Sharkey , with amped up enforcement efforts , gang members are now trying to become less identifiable . \" A lot of gangs are trying to blend in , \" Sharkey said . \" They used to have noticeable tattoos , but that 's now seen as counterproductive to their carrying on their gang business . \" In an interview with Patch , Sgt. Steve Lundquist , an investigator for the Suffolk County Sheriff 's Office gang intelligence unit , said the bloody murders \" have put a spotlight \" on gang activity on Long Island . \" And rightfully so . Once it 's young kids , getting killed , young girls getting killed , it really gets people 's attention . \" Discussing MS - 13 's presence in Brentwood and Central Islip , Lundquist said the demographics of the area have changed , with communities \" inundated \" with individuals of Central American descent . \" Not to say they 're bad people , but when a new group does come in , sometimes they are the minority in that area , and gangs form for protection . After awhile , when the area changes , their population increases and they become the dominant group in that area . \" MS - 13 , he agreed , became a presence on Long Island in the late 90s , \" but not with the numbers we have now . \" Unaccompanied minors in the area have been linked to gang activity , Lundquist said . \" Because they are unaccompanied , they are looking for a place to live , looking for food , looking for people that will take care of them , \" he said . \" The gang is very attractive , to help them out , give them a place to live , feed them . That 's one of the ways to recruit them , to become members of a gang \u2014 they have no place else to turn sometimes . \" Many unaccompanied minors , he said , come from areas of El Salvador where MS - 13 \" runs a lot of the country . \" Some are already MS - 13 members when they arrive in the United States , or have grown up with MS - 13 family members . \" They do n't know anything different , \" he said . Recruitment , Lundquist said , is happening in schools , streets , anyplace where people openly congregate , with most kids initiated between 12 and 15 - years - old . \" If they 're going to recruit them , they get them when they 're young and impressionable and do n't know better , \" he said . Some kids who resist recruitment could be killed , Lundquist said , because MS - 13 gangs are afraid those potential recruits will be scooped up by the rival 18th Street gang . MS - 13 violence , he agreed , is marked by deadly machete use and for violent robberies and home invasions , with less of an emphasis on drug dealing , which is seen more with Latin Kings , Bloods and Crips . Rep. Peter King , R-Seaford , agreed that a federal program that allows unaccompanied minors to cross the border is a critical issue ; he said he 's had extensive conversations with Sini \u2014 and of the MS - 13 arrests made , more than 50 to 70 percent were unaccompanied minors , King said . There are more than 4,000 unaccompanied minors in Suffolk County , King told Patch . Unaccompanied minors who come to the United States Department of Health and Human Services , are placed with families \" that have been threatened by MS - 13 or paid by MS - 13 , \" King said . It 's believed , King said , \" that MS - 13 is gaming or using the system \" to get young people placed with Suffolk County families and subsequently , bolster MS - 13 ranks . King said there is definite pressure for kids to join gangs , with the threat of violence for those who wo n't join . \" Police have told me that kids who do n't join get beat up pretty badly , there 's definite pressure \u2014 a definite risk of being killed , \" he said . King said he 's worked with Sessions , Sini \u2014 to whom he gives full credit for the increased crackdown \u2014 and Homeland Security , and said a multi-pronged approach is essential to tackle a lethal problem that 's \" decimating communities . \" MS - 13 coverage on Patch : - MS - 13 : An Inside Look At The Brutal Gang And Its Insidious Spread On Long Island - Crackdown Nets 39 MS - 13 Arrests In 30 Days - AG Jeff Sessions Warns Deadly MS - 13 : ' We Are Targeting You ' - 3 MS - 13 Gang Members Reportedly Charged In Brutal Quadruple Homicide In Central Islip - Feds ID Alleged MS-13 Gang Members Charged In Dozen Long Island Murders - Guardian Angels Founder Curtis Sliwa Offers Plan To Rein In MS-13 - War Against MS-13 Rages On , Police Chief Discusses Concerns - Watch Live : Suffolk Police Commissioner Tim Sini Testifying Before Congress On Deadly MS-13 Gang - ' We Are At War : ' Dozens Of MS-13 Gang Members Arrested , Indicted Patch file photos courtesy Guardian Angels , Suffolk County Police .","annotations":[{"text":"On Thursday","span":[3453,3463],"token_span":[637,638],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time when the arraignment occurs."},{"text":"in Nassau County","span":[3546,3561],"token_span":[655,657],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the arraignment occurs."},{"text":"Miguel Angel Corea Diaz","span":[3708,3730],"token_span":[685,688],"role":"Defendant","label":"Defendant","role_definition":"The Defendant is charged with a crime by a Judge."},{"text":"before Acting Supreme Court Justice Patricia Harrington","span":[3818,3872],"token_span":[707,713],"role":"Judge","label":"Judge","role_definition":"The Judge is the head of the court where the arraignment occurs."},{"text":"on three counts of operating as a major trafficker and five counts of second -degree conspiracy","span":[3874,3968],"token_span":[714,729],"role":"Charges","label":"Charges","role_definition":"Charges is the crime with which the Defendant is charged."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"The East Coast kingpin of the MS - 13 , Miguel Angel Corea Diaz , of Laurel , Maryland ( of Prince George 's County ) , was arraigned April 19 , 2018 , in Nassau County Court in Mineola , New York , on charges including conspiracy to commit murder .

The Suffolk County Police Department said it was aware of \" credible threats of violence that MS - 13 is prepared to harm a police officer in retaliation for gang arrests . \" The department has taken necessary precautions to protect its officers , officials said in a release . \" While the Suffolk County Police Department takes this threat seriously , we will not be deterred in our mission by threats by gang members , \" the release said . \" Our commitment in bringing gang members and their associates who commit crimes to justice continues to be a top priority . \" Police were warned to safeguard personal information , especially on social media . \" It is imperative that members of the department take these threats seriously and adapt their work habits and lifestyles accordingly , \" the Nassau County Police 's bulletin said Thursday . Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder issued a statement on the potential violence : \" I will not tolerate any threats against my officers and the Nassau County Police Department will continue to protect our residents and communities . \" Residents , he said , should call 911 immediately if they see or hear anything suspicious regarding any threats . Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa \u2014 the red- beret wearing crime fighter who has fought violence in New York City for years with volunteers patrols who carry no weapons \u2014 was skeptical about the alleged threat . \" I highly doubt it , \" he said . \" The feds just arrested a key ' shot caller . ' \" On Thursday , the highest - ranking member of the East Coast cliques of MS- 13 was arraigned in Nassau County on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and trafficking drugs , authorities said . His arrest was a major blow to the gang , authorities say . Miguel Angel Corea Diaz , aka Reaper , 35 , of Laurel , Maryland , was arraigned in Nassau County on Thursday before Acting Supreme Court Justice Patricia Harrington on three counts of operating as a major trafficker and five counts of second -degree conspiracy . If convicted of the top charge against him , Diaz faces up to 25 years to life in prison . Sliwa said Diaz was brought him from the beltway outside of Washington , D.C. \" Feds ca n't have it both ways , \" Sliwa said . \" They said in court that MS - 13 gang members had to get permission from the ' Reaper ' to commit various crimes , including murder . All of a sudden , having no contact with the Reaper , they 're going to hunt down and shoot cops ? \" Instead , Sliwa said he believes law enforcement will \" use it as a reason to crack down on MS - 13 locally , so that they can justify those raids , \" he said . A Nationwide Spotlight On Gang Brutality After brutal murders of four teens shocked the nation and the world , President Donald Trump spoke in Brentwood last year about the insidious MS - 13 gang that 's been terrorizing local communities across Long Island in the county . And in his speech , he promised to rid the gang - ravaged communities of Long Island of the \" animals \" on their streets . Long Island has been hit hard , with 17 \" beautiful young lives \" murdered since Jan. 16 on Long Island alone , including two teen girls , he said during his speech . \" They butchered those little girls . They kidnap . They extort . They rape and they rob . They prey on children . They should n't be here , \" Trump said . MS - 13 beats with victims with clubs , slashes them with knives and machetes , he said . \" They 're Animals \" \" They have transformed peaceful parks and beautiful , quiet neighborhoods into blood - stained killing fields . They 're animals , Trump said . Days after the gruesome discovery of four bodies in Central Islip on Long Island \u2014 the four young men are believed to have been victims of the deadly MS - 13 street gang \u2014 the spotlight has been steadily shining on Suffolk County as lawmakers , educators and a horrified public try to unravel MS - 13 and seek answers on how to stem the tide of brutality . MS - 13 , which was formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s by immigrants fleeing El Salvador 's civil war , is known for its bloody violence , including machete attacks and home invasions . But for all the public outcry , for those directly impacted by the quadruple homicide in Central Islip , the heartbreak is deeply personal . The four young men found dead on the night of April 12 at Central Islip Recreation Village Park suffered trauma from a sharp- edged instrument . They were only 16 , 18 , 18 and 20 years - old ; their lives just beginning . One of the victims , Jorge Tigre , a Bellport High School honor student , was not a gang member and allegedly became a target after he refused to associate with gang members following the murder of two girls in Brentwood , Nisa Mickens and Kayla Cuevas , who were murdered in September , 2016 by MS - 13 gang members with machetes . Tigre 's sister Monica Tigre , in an interview with Patch , declined to discuss what may have led to her brother 's murder , but said she and her family are left with only memories . \" The only thing I can said he was a wonderful person . He was always smiling and helping my family and me . I will remember him \u2014 his smile and his kindness , \" Tigre said . One Former MS- 13 Member 's Story Trying to illuminate the dark reality of an MS - 13 member 's life , * Elmer \u2014 his real name was withheld to protect his identity \u2014 a former MS - 13 member who was able to escape the gang 's tentacles and is now a member of Council for Unity , a non-profit organization that works with schools and jails to help gang members find new lives , shared his story with Patch . Telling his story , Elmer said : \" I joined the MS - 13 gang right after my mom died . I was 8 - years -old . The gang was , for me , a new life , a new family . \" After an initiation when he was jumped , Elmer said , \" They showed me everything I needed to know and then I started a new life by busting gangs , robbing , beating our enemies , doing any type of drugs every day , every night , shooting people , drinking every day . \" When he was 13 , Elmer said he was shot three times and almost lost his leg . \" I've been shot , stabbed almost to the point of dying and still did n't come to my senses . I spent my young life mostly in jail because of the violent and criminal things that I did . I lost two of my best friends when I was 15 , \" he said . Elmer said he made the decision to leave the gang because he was tired of \" seeing young people on the street getting killed every day . I was tired of funerals . Tired of watching kids join gangs , doing drugs in their early age . I decide to change when I saw two friends get hit with a straight bullet . . I 've made too many mothers cry . I refuse to let another tear be shed because of me . \" Spread of MS-13 Across The Nation The recent murders have put the insidious gang violence on Long Island on the international canvas , with the world watching and wondering how such gruesome violence has come to infiltrate sleepy , suburban communities . Sliwa spoke to Patch about the path MS - 13 has taken to Long Island . \" There was a very violent civil war in El Salvador from 1980 to 1992 . In 12 years 75,000 people were killed . It created a refugee crisis and many El Salvadorians fled North to Los Angeles . They settled in Mexican neighborhoods and immediately were preyed upon by the largest Los Angeles street gang , the 18th Street gang , which got started in Los Angeles in 1965 , \" he said . \" In order to protect themselves from the 18th Street gang , the El Salvadorians formed MS - 13 and started to defend their turf . And even though they were outnumbered they proved to be durable and extremely vicious . \" The \" Mexican Mafia , \" which controlled the Latinos in the California prison system , had MS - 13 join their ranks , Sliwa said . Next , Sliwa said , as El Salvadorians migrated east , looking for work , they landed in large numbers , first in Fairfax County , Va , . which is right outside of Washington , D.C. \" They then followed the trail up into Nassau and Suffolk counties , where there was a lot of day laborer work , \" he said . \" In the early 90s they embedded themselves into Fairfax County and in the late 90s they began to spread into Long Island . Along the way , MS - 13 started to recruit Guatemalans and Hondurans who were also being picked on by the Mexican 18th Street gang . \" The machete is a hallmark of bloody MS - 13 crime , Sliwa said . \" Unlike other gangs , which prefer guns , Ms -13 uses the machete as a weapon of terror . They will slash their victims , slice off fingers and limbs and on occasion , behead their intended targets . It is done to silence any potential snitches . \" Enforcement Efforts To Reign In The Mayhem From the federal government to local law enforcement , officials appalled by the staggering violence have vowed a crackdown . Suffolk County District Attorney Tim Sini has called MS - 13 \" the greatest public safety issue in Suffolk . \" U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions referred to the Central Islip murders as he pledged a federal focus on tackling MS - 13 ; he sent a message to the gang , \" We will find you . \" According to Suffolk County Sheriff 's Office Chief of Staff Michael Sharkey , with amped up enforcement efforts , gang members are now trying to become less identifiable . \" A lot of gangs are trying to blend in , \" Sharkey said . \" They used to have noticeable tattoos , but that 's now seen as counterproductive to their carrying on their gang business . \" In an interview with Patch , Sgt. Steve Lundquist , an investigator for the Suffolk County Sheriff 's Office gang intelligence unit , said the bloody murders \" have put a spotlight \" on gang activity on Long Island . \" And rightfully so . Once it 's young kids , getting killed , young girls getting killed , it really gets people 's attention . \" Discussing MS - 13 's presence in Brentwood and Central Islip , Lundquist said the demographics of the area have changed , with communities \" inundated \" with individuals of Central American descent . \" Not to say they 're bad people , but when a new group does come in , sometimes they are the minority in that area , and gangs form for protection . After awhile , when the area changes , their population increases and they become the dominant group in that area . \" MS - 13 , he agreed , became a presence on Long Island in the late 90s , \" but not with the numbers we have now . \" Unaccompanied minors in the area have been linked to gang activity , Lundquist said . \" Because they are unaccompanied , they are looking for a place to live , looking for food , looking for people that will take care of them , \" he said . \" The gang is very attractive , to help them out , give them a place to live , feed them . That 's one of the ways to recruit them , to become members of a gang \u2014 they have no place else to turn sometimes . \" Many unaccompanied minors , he said , come from areas of El Salvador where MS - 13 \" runs a lot of the country . \" Some are already MS - 13 members when they arrive in the United States , or have grown up with MS - 13 family members . \" They do n't know anything different , \" he said . Recruitment , Lundquist said , is happening in schools , streets , anyplace where people openly congregate , with most kids initiated between 12 and 15 - years - old . \" If they 're going to recruit them , they get them when they 're young and impressionable and do n't know better , \" he said . Some kids who resist recruitment could be killed , Lundquist said , because MS - 13 gangs are afraid those potential recruits will be scooped up by the rival 18th Street gang . MS - 13 violence , he agreed , is marked by deadly machete use and for violent robberies and home invasions , with less of an emphasis on drug dealing , which is seen more with Latin Kings , Bloods and Crips . Rep. Peter King , R-Seaford , agreed that a federal program that allows unaccompanied minors to cross the border is a critical issue ; he said he 's had extensive conversations with Sini \u2014 and of the MS - 13 arrests made , more than 50 to 70 percent were unaccompanied minors , King said . There are more than 4,000 unaccompanied minors in Suffolk County , King told Patch . Unaccompanied minors who come to the United States Department of Health and Human Services , are placed with families \" that have been threatened by MS - 13 or paid by MS - 13 , \" King said . It 's believed , King said , \" that MS - 13 is gaming or using the system \" to get young people placed with Suffolk County families and subsequently , bolster MS - 13 ranks . King said there is definite pressure for kids to join gangs , with the threat of violence for those who wo n't join . \" Police have told me that kids who do n't join get beat up pretty badly , there 's definite pressure \u2014 a definite risk of being killed , \" he said . King said he 's worked with Sessions , Sini \u2014 to whom he gives full credit for the increased crackdown \u2014 and Homeland Security , and said a multi-pronged approach is essential to tackle a lethal problem that 's \" decimating communities . \" MS - 13 coverage on Patch : - MS - 13 : An Inside Look At The Brutal Gang And Its Insidious Spread On Long Island - Crackdown Nets 39 MS - 13 Arrests In 30 Days - AG Jeff Sessions Warns Deadly MS - 13 : ' We Are Targeting You ' - 3 MS - 13 Gang Members Reportedly Charged In Brutal Quadruple Homicide In Central Islip - Feds ID Alleged MS-13 Gang Members Charged In Dozen Long Island Murders - Guardian Angels Founder Curtis Sliwa Offers Plan To Rein In MS-13 - War Against MS-13 Rages On , Police Chief Discusses Concerns - Watch Live : Suffolk Police Commissioner Tim Sini Testifying Before Congress On Deadly MS-13 Gang - ' We Are At War : ' Dozens Of MS-13 Gang Members Arrested , Indicted Patch file photos courtesy Guardian Angels , Suffolk County Police .","annotations":[{"text":"Miguel Angel Corea Diaz","span":[3708,3730],"token_span":[685,688],"role":"Defendant","label":"Defendant","role_definition":"The Defendant is charged with a crime by a Judge."},{"text":"Acting Supreme Court Justice Patricia Harrington","span":[3825,3872],"token_span":[708,713],"role":"Judge","label":"Judge","role_definition":"The Judge is the head of the court where the arraignment occurs."},{"text":"three counts of operating as a major trafficker","span":[3877,3923],"token_span":[715,722],"role":"Charges","label":"Charges","role_definition":"Charges is the crime with which the Defendant is charged."},{"text":"five counts of second -degree conspiracy","span":[3929,3968],"token_span":[724,729],"role":"Charges","label":"Charges","role_definition":"Charges is the crime with which the Defendant is charged."},{"text":"Thursday","span":[3456,3463],"token_span":[638,638],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the Time when the arraignment occurs."},{"text":"Nassau County","span":[3549,3561],"token_span":[656,657],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the arraignment occurs."},{"text":"LONG ISLAND","span":[218,228],"token_span":[37,38],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the arraignment occurs."},{"text":"NY","span":[232,233],"token_span":[40,40],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"This role identifies the Place where the arraignment occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-2476-1477-frame-Arranging","frame":"Arranging","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"An Agent puts a complex Theme into a particular Configuration, which can be a proper order, a correct or suitable sequence, or a spatial position.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Critical reception Douglas Wolk , in Salon , called the album \" a competent Pavement rip-off with some curious touches in its arrangements , like singer Gary Olson 's trumpet parts . \"","annotations":[{"text":"the album","span":[52,60],"token_span":[9,10],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"An entity that consists of parts which can be put into a configuration relative to each other and/or relative to their environment."},{"text":"a competent Pavement rip-off with some curious touches","span":[64,117],"token_span":[12,19],"role":"Configuration","label":"Configuration","role_definition":"A state that holds of the Theme or a relation that holds among the constituent parts of the Theme as a result of the arranging action."}],"trigger":{"text":"arrangements","start_char":126,"end_char":137,"start_token":22,"end_token":22,"frame":"Arranging"}},"source":{"text":"| crazy in the confines of stardom , they reconfigured their music to reflect the absurdity of their situation .

Ladybug Transistor THE ALBEMARLE SOUND | MERGE BY DOUGLAS WOLK | Sometimes it takes a while for bands to find a voice . Ladybug Transistor 's first album , 1995 's \" Marlborough Farms , \" was a competent Pavement rip-off with some curious touches in its arrangements , like singer Gary Olson 's trumpet parts . In the intervening years and two subsequent albums , Olson has replaced the rest of the band , expanded it to a sextet and discovered the delights of Donovan and Zombies records . On \" The Albemarle Sound , \" he 's modulated his voice to a carefully enunciated purr and surrounded it with snatches of strings , horns and penny whistles , for an exquisite psychedelic - pastoral effect . The production pulls off tricks that nobody 's used much for 30 years ( arranger Joe McGinty , who puts together the \" Loser 's Lounge \" series of ' 60s / ' 70s pop tributes in New York , helped out ) -- most notably , almost every sound is doubled , from Olson 's baritone to the clean , jazzy guitar and bass tones to the stoner 's lope of the saxophones and snare . The piano is just old and tacky - sounding enough ; the apple-eating sound effects in the middle of \" The Swimmer \" recall the Beach Boys ' \" Vegetables . \" There 's a new and marvelous detail every few seconds , and they 're all balanced to feng shui perfection . In the middle of the album , though , there 's a luscious , concise song called \" Like A Summer Rain \" that outshines its surroundings -- and it 's a cover ( of a Jan & Dean obscurity ) . It points to the biggest weakness of \" The Albemarle Sound , \" which is that the band 's songs simply are n't up to the level of its arrangements . They 're non-obvious and inoffensive , and the calm stateliness of the instrumentation makes them sound like vintage AM - radio singles , but they 're also not that memorable on their own . Still , a few tracks here come close to the ideal Ladybug Transistor are aiming for , notably the acid fantasy \" Meadowport Arch \" and the instrumental mariachi-western theme \" Cienfuegos . \" The band 's got its style down fine ; it 's just still working on what to apply it to .

In the case of Nixon 's Head , the answer is C. Their use of the Beatles riff in \" Saturate , \" the leadoff cut on \" Gourmet , \" is a statement of purpose . It heralds a 14 - course ear candy pig-out courtesy of some exceedingly choosy epicures of pure pop . \" Gourmet , \" the first full - length release from Nixon 's Head , marks the return of the Philadelphia - based group after an eight - year hiatus . In their original incarnation , they made the world safe for alternative rock with such releases as the lighthearted EP \" The Doug Factor . \" Since then , they have lightened their punk edge , moving on to songs that have greater melodic and musical depth . ( A good comparison would be \" English Settlement \" - era XTC , though that is due more to shared influences than actual homage . ) There is a refreshing lack of irony on \" Gourmet . \" Admittedly , the more humorous tracks , particularly \" The Loving Finger \" ( sung by guest vocalist Dorothy Haug ) , would in lesser hands be downright embarrassing . Somehow , in Nixon 's Head 's care , such songs seem positively wistful . ( It helps that Haug has the clear , unaffected voice of a Pennsylvanian Emmylou Harris . ) Although \" Gourmet \" may not be , as its cover boasts , \" five minutes ahead of its time , \" it can take its place among the sharpest and freshest pop albums since Stiff Records ruled the earth . Friends of Dean Martinez ATARDECER | KNITTING FACTORY BY DOUGLAS WOLK | The thing about secret weapons is that they 're only useful if they 're a secret . The first two Friends of Dean Martinez albums were mostly driven by Joey Burns and John Convertino , who were moonlighting from their main band Giant Sand . Steel guitarist Bill Elm brought elegance and spookiness to their instrumental drift -- essentially a homage to the ' 50s easy - listening guitarists Santo & Johnny , with elegant touches of modernity and pre-modernity . With \" Atardecer , \" though , Burns and Convertino are gone ( they 've started their own band , Calexico ) , and Elm is running the show -- the only other musician to appear on more than four tracks is keyboardist / percussionist Dave Lachance . ( Lachance gets a pretty inconsequential solo piece of his own , \" Coppertone . \" ) Elm has also given up the band 's sweet simplicity in favor of turbulent sound textures and spacey effects , turning the tints he used on the band 's black - and - white - photo sound into the entire picture . There 's a certain kinship between the suspended , drifting tones a steel guitar can generate and the idea of electromagnetic impulses from interstellar space , and it 's been reinforced in the popular imagination by the note-bending whines of sci-fi TV show themes . Elm 's playing on that association here , augmenting most of the album with spacy Moog doodles , giving his guitar the crinkling distortion of old Pink Floyd records , and drenching it in oh-wow - man reverb . But there 's very little on \" Atardecer \" that approaches the melodic savvy of the sun-baked retro-instrumentals that used to inspire the Friends . \" Spoonie ( Dark Side of the Spoon ) \" is a particular offender -- over five minutes of portentous tom-tom and chirruping noises run through a delay pedal , with no particular tune . Even when they try to play something that might have fit on the first album , like the organ simmer and samba beat of \" Otra Vez , \" Elm 's tone calls too much attention to itself , like a loud , tipsy guest at a party .","annotations":[{"text":"a mundane work","span":[594,607],"token_span":[107,109],"role":"Configuration","label":"Configuration","role_definition":"A state that holds of the Theme or a relation that holds among the constituent parts of the Theme as a result of the arranging action."},{"text":"Blur","span":[765,768],"token_span":[141,141],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The person who causes the Theme to be in a particular Configuration."},{"text":"13","span":[1182,1183],"token_span":[224,224],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"An entity that consists of parts which can be put into a configuration relative to each other and/or relative to their environment."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"Critical reception Douglas Wolk , in Salon , called the album \" a competent Pavement rip-off with some curious touches in its arrangements , like singer Gary Olson 's trumpet parts . \"","annotations":[{"text":"the album","span":[52,60],"token_span":[9,10],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"An entity that consists of parts which can be put into a configuration relative to each other and/or relative to their environment."},{"text":"a competent Pavement rip-off with some curious touches","span":[64,117],"token_span":[12,19],"role":"Configuration","label":"Configuration","role_definition":"A state that holds of the Theme or a relation that holds among the constituent parts of the Theme as a result of the arranging action."}],"trigger":{"text":"arrangements","start_char":126,"end_char":137,"start_token":22,"end_token":22,"frame":"Arranging"}},"source":{"text":"| crazy in the confines of stardom , they reconfigured their music to reflect the absurdity of their situation .

( A good comparison would be \" English Settlement \" - era XTC , though that is due more to shared influences than actual homage . ) There is a refreshing lack of irony on \" Gourmet . \" Admittedly , the more humorous tracks , particularly \" The Loving Finger \" ( sung by guest vocalist Dorothy Haug ) , would in lesser hands be downright embarrassing . Somehow , in Nixon 's Head 's care , such songs seem positively wistful . ( It helps that Haug has the clear , unaffected voice of a Pennsylvanian Emmylou Harris . ) Although \" Gourmet \" may not be , as its cover boasts , \" five minutes ahead of its time , \" it can take its place among the sharpest and freshest pop albums since Stiff Records ruled the earth . Friends of Dean Martinez ATARDECER | KNITTING FACTORY BY DOUGLAS WOLK | The thing about secret weapons is that they 're only useful if they 're a secret . The first two Friends of Dean Martinez albums were mostly driven by Joey Burns and John Convertino , who were moonlighting from their main band Giant Sand . Steel guitarist Bill Elm brought elegance and spookiness to their instrumental drift -- essentially a homage to the ' 50s easy - listening guitarists Santo & Johnny , with elegant touches of modernity and pre-modernity . With \" Atardecer , \" though , Burns and Convertino are gone ( they 've started their own band , Calexico ) , and Elm is running the show -- the only other musician to appear on more than four tracks is keyboardist / percussionist Dave Lachance . ( Lachance gets a pretty inconsequential solo piece of his own , \" Coppertone . \" ) Elm has also given up the band 's sweet simplicity in favor of turbulent sound textures and spacey effects , turning the tints he used on the band 's black - and - white - photo sound into the entire picture . There 's a certain kinship between the suspended , drifting tones a steel guitar can generate and the idea of electromagnetic impulses from interstellar space , and it 's been reinforced in the popular imagination by the note-bending whines of sci-fi TV show themes . Elm 's playing on that association here , augmenting most of the album with spacy Moog doodles , giving his guitar the crinkling distortion of old Pink Floyd records , and drenching it in oh-wow - man reverb . But there 's very little on \" Atardecer \" that approaches the melodic savvy of the sun-baked retro-instrumentals that used to inspire the Friends . \" Spoonie ( Dark Side of the Spoon ) \" is a particular offender -- over five minutes of portentous tom-tom and chirruping noises run through a delay pedal , with no particular tune . Even when they try to play something that might have fit on the first album , like the organ simmer and samba beat of \" Otra Vez , \" Elm 's tone calls too much attention to itself , like a loud , tipsy guest at a party .","annotations":[{"text":"Ladybug Transistor","span":[3032,3049],"token_span":[596,597],"role":"Agent","label":"Agent","role_definition":"The person who causes the Theme to be in a particular Configuration."},{"text":"1995 's \" Marlborough Farms","span":[3188,3214],"token_span":[625,629],"role":"Theme","label":"Theme","role_definition":"An entity that consists of parts which can be put into a configuration relative to each other and/or relative to their environment."},{"text":"a mundane work","span":[594,607],"token_span":[107,109],"role":"Configuration","label":"Configuration","role_definition":"A state that holds of the Theme or a relation that holds among the constituent parts of the Theme as a result of the arranging action."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"dev"},{"instance_id":"EN-3104-692-frame-Arrest","frame":"Arrest","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"Authorities charge a Suspect, who is under suspicion of having committed a crime (the Charges), and take him/her into custody.","frame_ancestors":["Intentionally_affect","Intentionally_act","Event","Transitive_action","Objective_influence"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"On several occasions during the conflict , Egypt prevented the Muslim Brotherhood from delivering aid to Gaza .

In her semi-final against the German wild card Sabine Lisicki , Sharapova had struck 13 double - faults , and she committed another six in this final , including a run of three in a row spread over two games . But Sharapova , who had reached the final without dropping a set , did not beat herself with her own serving yips ; she was beaten by Kvitova 's fine grass - court tennis . When Kvitova arrived at the All England Club last summer she had never won a match on grass ( she had lost her first four appearances on the surface ) , and then she made the semi-finals , She came back this year and won the whole thing .

In this speech , which closed his successful presidential campaign , Hoover , a self - made millionaire , expressed his view that the American system was based on \" rugged individualism \" and \" self -reliance . \" Government , which had assumed unprecedented economic powers during World War I , should , in his view , shrink back to its prewar size and avoid intervening with business . During the early days of the Great Depression , Hoover launched the largest public works projects up until his time . But he continued to believe that problems of poverty and unemployment were best left to \" voluntary organization and community service . \" He feared that federal relief programs would undermine individual character by making recipients dependent on the government . He did not recognize that the sheer size of the nation 's economic problems had made the concept of \" rugged individualism \" meaningless . Document : I intend ... to discuss some of those more fundamental principles upon which I believe the government of the United States should be conducted .... During one hundred and fifty years we have builded up a form of self government and a social system which is peculiarly our own . It differs essentially from all others in the world . It is the American system .... It is founded upon the conception that only through ordered liberty , freedom and equal opportunity to the individual will his initiative and enterprise spur on the march of progress . And in our insistence upon equality of opportunity has our system advanced beyond all the world . During [ World War I ] we necessarily turned to the government to solve every difficult economic problem . The government having absorbed every energy of our people for war , there was no other solution . For the preservation of the state the Federal Government became a centralized despotism which undertook unprecedented responsibilities , assumed autocratic powers , and took over the business of citizens .

In this speech , which closed his successful presidential campaign , Hoover , a self - made millionaire , expressed his view that the American system was based on \" rugged individualism \" and \" self -reliance . \" Government , which had assumed unprecedented economic powers during World War I , should , in his view , shrink back to its prewar size and avoid intervening with business . During the early days of the Great Depression , Hoover launched the largest public works projects up until his time . But he continued to believe that problems of poverty and unemployment were best left to \" voluntary organization and community service . \" He feared that federal relief programs would undermine individual character by making recipients dependent on the government . He did not recognize that the sheer size of the nation 's economic problems had made the concept of \" rugged individualism \" meaningless . Document : I intend ... to discuss some of those more fundamental principles upon which I believe the government of the United States should be conducted .... During one hundred and fifty years we have builded up a form of self government and a social system which is peculiarly our own . It differs essentially from all others in the world . It is the American system .... It is founded upon the conception that only through ordered liberty , freedom and equal opportunity to the individual will his initiative and enterprise spur on the march of progress . And in our insistence upon equality of opportunity has our system advanced beyond all the world . During [ World War I ] we necessarily turned to the government to solve every difficult economic problem . The government having absorbed every energy of our people for war , there was no other solution . For the preservation of the state the Federal Government became a centralized despotism which undertook unprecedented responsibilities , assumed autocratic powers , and took over the business of citizens . To a large degree , we regimented our whole people temporally into a socialistic state . However justified in war time , if continued in peace - time it would destroy not only our American system but with it our progress and freedom as well .

For some transgressions sacrifice was not even effective to obtain forgiveness . Jews believe that sacrifice is the least important way to gain forgiveness from G-d. Repentance is more important . Very few sins required sacrifice ( per Leviticus ) . For example . , the animal sacrifices are only prescribed for unwitting or unintentional sin ( Leviticus 4:2 , 13 , 22 , 27 ; 5:5 , 15 and Numbers 15:30 ) . The one exception is if an individual swore falsely to acquit himself of the accusation of having committed theft ( Leviticus 5:24 - 26 ) . Intentional sin can only be atoned for through repentance , unaccompanied by a blood sacrifice ( Psalms 32:5 , 51:16 - 19 ) . This is re-enforced : \" And you shall call upon Me , and go , and pray to Me , and I will hearken to you . And you shall seek Me , and find Me , when you shall search for Me with all your heart \" ( Jeremiah 29:13 ) . Given its relative unimportance even in Biblical days , what comprised an acceptable Jewish sacrifice ? Many people think that Jewish sacrifice required blood sacrifice . This is not true . The primary commandment about blood is that it should n't be eaten . ( Leviticus 17:10 ) \" And any man from the house of Israel , or from the aliens who sojourn among them , who eats any blood , I will set My face against that person who eats blood , and will cut him off from among his people . \" This can be paraphrased : \" Do n't eat blood . \" The next phrase ( Leviticus 17:11 ) goes on to say , \" For the soul of the flesh is in the blood and I have assigned it for you upon the altar to provide atonement for your souls ; for it is the blood that atones for the soul . \" This explains why blood is not to be eaten , and that when it is used as part of a sacrifice it must be sprinkled on the altar of the Temple . Note that it does n't say , \" blood is the only way to atone \" it says that you should n't eat the blood because its only use is for sacrifice . Since this is a little confusing lets use an example : we can say that all little boys are people , but does that mean that all people are little boys ?. So Leviticus says \" Do n't eat blood . You can use it for sacrifice , \" but it does n't say that blood is the only acceptable sacrifice . What is an acceptable sacrifice ? Well , we know what is n't : the Torah strictly forbids human sacrifice , unlike most religions of the Biblical era . What kind of sacrifices were allowed ? Throughout the Book of Leviticus , only distinct species of animals are permitted for use in blood sacrifices . There is also atonement by a cereal offering ( Leviticus 5:11 - 13 ) , atonement by gold ( Num. 31:50 ) , and atonement by the burning of incense : \" So Moses said to Aaron , ' Take a censer and put fire in it from the altar , put incense on it , and take it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them ; for wrath has gone out from the L-RD . \" ( Numbers 17:11 ) . Remember that prayer and repentence must accompany sacrifices . There were two kinds of offerings that related to sin : Chatas , a sin offering : A chatas was only brought for sins whose punishment is an early death caused by G-d where the person 's violation was n't willfull , but could have been prevented with more care . Criminal negligance . There were also national chatas offerings , e.g. if everyone followed a ruling of the High Court , the Sanhedrin , which in retrospect was in error . There is also a chatas brought on other situations : one was brought by the nation each month , by someone at the end of his nazarite vow ( to atone for not fully partaking of G-d 's world ) , and other relatively rare cases . Asham , a guilt offering : There are two instances where one brought an asham . The first is where one is uncertain whether one is supposed to bring a chatas . The second is someone who stole from or caused financial damage to another . He repays the injured party , in many instances with a penalty fine . However , he needs not only forgiveness from the other person , but also from G-d . That is achieved with the asham . When Jews were not near the Temple ( they lived too far away , or were captives as in Babylon ) sacrifice was not done by them . King Solomon said that even in the days of the Temple prayer could be used by those away from the temple to obtain forgiveness ( I Kings 8:46 - 50 ) .

The trio are a sensation of the animal tent and evoke no end of curiosity . CUBS OF LEOPARD FATHER AND PANTHER MOTHER . The Boston Globe ( Massachusetts ) , 1st August 1906 , pg 7 . Only Examples of their Kind in the World Visit the Globe Office Marvel of Animal Experts . Wonder , nine weeks old , described by his keeper as the nastiest animal of his age I ever saw , came to Boston yesterday , snarling , snapping , clawing , spitting and expressing his general objection to everybody and everything he saw . Wonder is an all - round - bad - egg , but he is only a little worse than his partner , Land , who was with him . Wonder and Land are the only living examples of their kind , and so far as is known the only examples there ever were . They are sui generis , and they must have been fully conscious of their exclusiveness in the animal world , for yesterday they clawed red streaks in the hands of Joseph G. Ferari , their guardian , spat and snarled at the photographer who was taking their pictures , tore long rents in the upholstery of the automobile provided for their enjoyment , and were as hard to handle as a whole menagerie of grown ups . Every time they had an audience , which was practically all the time , Wonder and Land seemed to be imbued with this spirit : We are the get of two most treacherous species of the jungle and we have got to live up to the reputation of our parentage . And they did . Wonder and Land were born at Wonderland park , Revere beach , nine weeks ago , and yesterday was their first afternoon away from the maternal side of the South American panther mother who nurses them . They had not seen much of the world up to yesterday afternoon , when Joseph G. Ferari , of Feraris trained wild animal show , and George Dobbins , manager of the Wonderland animal exhibition , bundled them into an automobile and drove them up to the Globe office to have their pictures taken . They did not like anybody or anything . They insisted upon turning their backs to the camera , would not let the artist get a good view of their spiteful countenances , and showed a disposition to fight without provocation . Wonder had the abhorrence of a camera which a society leader assumes , and he made several vicious passes at the instrument while his keeper was trying to get him in presentable position to be taken . Land was a little more tractable , but when the artist had fixed the imprint of the physical proportions of Wonder and Land on his plate Joseph G. Feraris hands needed the attention of a physician , for the sharp claws of the 9-weeks - old had drawn blood from a score of deep rents . The two tawny , spotted animals , who at nine weeks are able to teach a trained keeper caution , are known as panther - hybrids . Nothing like them has ever been born in the world before , and trainer Ferari says he thinks they are in a fair way to make the ugliest and most treacherous beast in or out of captivity . The father of Wonder an Land is an East India leopard , who was captured in the forest when he was about three years old . The mother is a South American panther , who up to the age of two dwelt in the wilds . Through fortune which is to animal trainers incredible , the leopard and the panther bred and the cubs which are the result are the marvel of animal men . In captivity up to this time leopards and panthers have shown the strongest aversion to each other . They would not associate and it was even dangerous to attempt to keep them in one cage . But Mr Ferari succeeded after much trial in finding one of each specie which would mate with the other . These panther - hybrids in the nine weeks they have been on earth have shown , Mr Ferari says , all the vicious characteristics of leopard and panther . As Mr Ferari says , the little fellows at their age ought to be as easy to handle as kittens , since lions , tigers , panthers and other ferocious beasts can be trained without danger , but yesterday he had to be as much on the alert for the sharp claws of the babies as if they were yeas instead of weeks old . They are very interesting curious and they are also very good specimens , strong and vigorous . Both show the panther and leopard blood . The gray in the tawny coat and the spots are from the father , the leopard , while the dark buff of the coat is of the mother . The head and back are those of the panther mother , and the movement , the loping , stealthy stride indicate strongly the predominance of the panther maternal blood . When these kittens are 4 weeks older it will be impossible for us to attempt to touch them with our hands , said Mr Ferari . Never have I seen the vicious element in animals developed so young . What they will be , what characteristics growth will develop we do not know . They are an enigma , a problem . I think they will be an interesting study . After their excursion to town Wonder and Land late in the afternoon were restored to the care of their panther mother at Wonderland park and it was curious to observe the way the panther snarled as she smelled the traces of numerous human hands on the coats of her offspring . Both male puma x female leopard and male leopard x female puma pairings have produced offspring . Hamburg Zoo had a hybrid ( the one in the black and white photo ) fathered by a puma bred to an Indian leopardess . A specimen purchased in 1898 by Berlin Zoo from Carl Hagenbeck was a cross between a male leopard and a female puma ( the same as the Chicago hybrids ) . Various newspapers published this report in early 1903 : The first successful experiment I made was with a leopard and a puma , \" said Mr. Hagenbeck recently . And the only living animal of the litter I sold some time ago to the Berlin Zoological Garden , where it Is still in the collection . In The Field No 2887 , April 25th , 1908 , Henry Scherren wrote \" Writing in Zoologischer Garten ( 1903 , pp. 288-90 ) , Forstmeister Adolf Rorig , of Frankfort - on - the - Main , gave a summary of the notices of feline hybrids that had previously appeared in that journal . There was , and probably is now , in the Berlin Garden and Indian leopard and puma male hybrid , purchased of Carl Hagenbeck in 1898 . In his Guide Dr Heck described it as a little grey puma with large brown rosettes . Another hybrid between the same species , but with a puma for sire and a leopard from dam , was recently at Stellingen ; it resembled the female parent in form , as may be seen from the reproduction from a photograph taken there . \" Hagenbeck much later wrote ( 1951 ) that a male puma and female leopard produced a hybrid cub that was reared by a Fox terrier bitch ( this was common practice to ensure a tamed individual ) at Hagenbeck Tierpark , Hamburg . The hybrid was male and intermediate between the puma and leopard in colour and pattern , having faint leopard spots on a puma-coloured background . The body length was much less than either parent and the tail was long , like the puma . A pair of leopard x puma hybrid cubs were born in Chicago on 24 April 1896 at Tattersalls indoor arena where Ringling Brothers Circus opened its season . Details about the two cubs were published in The Chicago Chronicle on 25th April 1896 : Two tiny cubs which look like young leopards were born at Tattersall 's where Ringling Brothers circus is housed , yesterday ( 24 APR [ 18 ] 96 ) . They are not leopards , however . Their mother is a mountain lion or cougar and their father is a leopard . They take after their father decidedly , and are the daintiest little members of the cat family ever born in captivity . In fact they are the only ones of their kind , so far as known , ever born , either within the confines of a cage or anywhere else . These black and yellow youngsters were on exhibition yesterday and were admired by all who saw them . They will probably be on view the rest of the time the circus exhibits in Chicago . H Petzsch ( 1956 ) mentioned that puma / leopard hybrids had been obtained by artificial insemination . Dr Helmut Hemmer ( 1966 ) reported a hybrid between a male Indian leopard ( P pardus fusca ) and female puma as being fairly small with a ground colour like that of the puma and having rather faded rosettes . This is a still from a video recording of \" ATV Today \" on 13th May , 1981 , a segment of Southam Wildlife Park . By that time is was owned by the Jones family and housed big cats . It was struggling to attract visitors , on one special opening day it attracted only 10 admissions . It had had a problem earlier when a lioness had mauled a girl and there were calls to end its big cat petting sessions so it was eager for publicity . In 1978 it had claimed a panther - tiger hybrid , which was actually a pure tiger that was later sold to a circus . The full clip is owned by MACE ( Media Archives of Central England ) and listed at 1981 Alleged Leopard Puma Hybrids , Southam Wildlife Park , but has not been digitised for public viewing . While these are n't the leopard - puma hybrids they claim to be , I found it worth debunking the misleading claim . In May 1981 , Southam Wildlife Park claimed to have successfully mated Sampson the leopard with Poppette the puma resulting in cubs that were puma coloured with some spots . Looking at the still , the cubs are normal puma cubs , but the public may not have known that puma cubs are spotted or blotched . They lack the rosette pattern found on genuine hybrids and they have dark dorsal stripes , which were not found on genuine hybrids . From all reports , the Wildlife Park was doing quite badly in the early 1980s . On one \" special opening \" day it only got 10 visitors , so it would have been desperate for publicity and novel attractions . If Sampson was not the father , who was ? In 1979 , the zoo had a cougar called \" Snooty \" ( Coventry Evening Telegraph , 26th October 1979 ) , though its gender is n't mentioned . In 1980 , there was a puma called Peebles which had 2 cubs , Snooples and Dooples ( Daily Mirror , 16th October 1980 ) which means they definitely had a breeding age male puma . There was also a puma cub at the zoo in May 1981 ( Daily Mirror , 30th May 1981 ) . The claim of the leopard being the sire was purely for publicity ; there is no long term follow up on the cubs , so either they died or they were shifted out of sight when their true identities became obvious . Nancy Neff in her introduction to Guy Coheleach 's \" The Big Cats \" : \" the ability to hybridize may seem to contradict the status of ... cats as separate species , since species are usually defined as populations of animals who interbreed among themselves but who are unable to interbreed under natural conditions with other such groups . \" Neff viewed with \" extreme interest , \" instances of captive cross-breeding between the more distantly related puma and leopard ( as opposed to lion - tiger , lion - leopard and leopard - jaguar pairings ) since - at the time she wrote her introduction - the puma was not considered a pantherine . Thus , referring to the puma , \" the ability to hybridize with the leopard is quite unexpected . \" She felt the ability of pumas and leopards to interbreed may be explained by immunological findings placing them both in the pantherine lineage . More recently , the American \" X- Project Magazine \" reported that Britain 's Exmoor Beasts are believed to be descended from a black puma x leopard hybrid . The limited gene pool \" fixed \" the recessive black colour and the adaptability of the puma ensured its survival . This is actually impossible because melanism has never been verified in pumas ; the black big cats kept as pets in Britain were black panthers ( leopards ) and black jaguars and moreover , a self - sustaining population of hybrid big cats is extremely unlikely due to problems of sterility in the males . Additionally there is the problem of dwarfism observed in puma x leopard hybrids , although it is n't clear whether any of the hybrids reached their adult size .

( SeeHybrid Big Cats In The British Countryside ) Confusingly , it has been reported that most pumas kept as pets in the United Kingdom were black rather than tawny ; the rarity of black pumas makes this extremely unlikely . This confusion arises because pumas are also known as panthers and black panthers ( black leopards ) were indeed kept as pets . The confusion is worsened by articles which erroneously refer to \" the black puma out of The Jungle Book \" ( pumas are not found in India ! ) . Unlike black panthers , supposed \" black pumas \" ( \" couguar noire \" ) have dark upper parts , but pale bellies . PUMA / JAGUAR HYBRIDS REMARKABLE HYBRIDS . Alexandria Gazette ( Virginia ) , 17th January 1900 , pg 1 . It has been tried many times in the past , but has , it is claimed , always been unsuccessful heretofore . The attempt to mate a puma and a leopard , or a puma and a jaguar , has also been tried , but has resulted each time in the injury of the puma . A supposed puma x jaguar hybrid was shot in the Mato Grosso , South America in the early half of the 20th Century . It was killed by Sacha Siemel whose opinion was that it was a puma x jaguar hybrid . It was heavily built with brown spots on a fawn background and a dark stripe down its back . Pumas and jaguars are both present in the area , but occupy different niches and would be unlikely to meet , let alone mate . The description of the supposed puma / jaguar hybrid was very similar to that of the captive - bred pumapards . Successful hybridization between pumas and jaguars in captivity has been alleged ( in a report by Dr Helmut Hemmer , 1966 ) , but there is no photographic evidence . The hybrids would look similar to pumapards , but with jaguar-like , rather than leopard - like , markings and would possibly be more powerfully built . These reports , which contain a lot of showman 's hype , also allude to puma / jaguar hybrids . From The New York Times of June 4th , 1906 we have ALL HYBRIDS AT CONEY . Some Beasts There Are Bi-Hybrids This Year All Are Mighty Rare . Bulletin chased bulletin out of the animal shows at Coney Island yesterday . A Coney Island animal show is a cheap affair this year if it hasnt at least one hybrid ; naturally the press agents are n't forgetting that fact . Bostocks press agent announced , with tears in his voiced that Tricolor , the Bostock hybrid , had just died . At the same time , however , there were born to the lioness Princess two tiny cubs . Their father is said to be a cross between a puma and the famous self - eating Jaguar whose favourite occupation is biting a section of his own tail off . Tricolor was only a cross of a puma , a jaguar , and a lion . That , the press agent says , is quite a common cross . The new cubs , of course , are very rare . At the same time , various papers reported that Tricolor , the Bostock leopard - lion - tiger hybrid , died , and a lioness in Mr. Bostocks menagerie had given birth to a pair of puma-jaguar- lion prodigies . Like lion cubs , puma cubs have rosetted markings ; the supposed hybrid might have been an individual which had retained its spots into adulthood . PUMA / LION HYBRIDS The Atlanta Constitution , November 10th , 1907 : FRANK BOSTOCK POSES WITH FAMOUS LIO - PAN Frank C. Bostock , owner and proprietor of the Bostock Arena , posed for a picture of himself and his famous hybrid animal Lio-pan , which is a cross between an African lion and a South American panther , the only one ever known to be born . Further investigation finds that the South American panther is the jaguar , not the puma ( New - York Tribune , 27th April 1907 , pg 4. , NEW ANIMAL , THE LIOPAN ) PUMA / TIGER HYBRIDS An article in the Long Island Ocelot Club newsletter of November / December 1980 noted that hybrids were prevented in the wild through different reproductive behaviour and geographical barriers , but in zoos the different species became familiar enough that the normal sexual behaviour was subtly modified . Hybrids between the big cats attracted the most attention and listed these as : ligers , tigons and leopons as well as \" less well - known hybrids \" of leopard x jaguar , puma x tiger , lion x jaguar and jaguar x puma ( referencing Gray , 1972 ) . The reference to puma x tiger appears to be a mis-translation of \" panther x tiger \" indicating the leopard x tiger cross that is known in captivity as a tigard and known in India as a dogla . A North American would assume a panther to be a puma . INTRASPECIFIC PUMA HYBRIDS Intraspecific hybrids of puma subspecies are common in zoos e.g. Puma concolor capricornensis x Puma concolor concolor ( International Zoo Yearbook of 1968 reports 2 males , born in Brasilia , Brazil , 1966 ) .

The two tawny , spotted animals , who at nine weeks are able to teach a trained keeper caution , are known as panther - hybrids . Nothing like them has ever been born in the world before , and trainer Ferari says he thinks they are in a fair way to make the ugliest and most treacherous beast in or out of captivity . The father of Wonder an Land is an East India leopard , who was captured in the forest when he was about three years old . The mother is a South American panther , who up to the age of two dwelt in the wilds . Through fortune which is to animal trainers incredible , the leopard and the panther bred and the cubs which are the result are the marvel of animal men . In captivity up to this time leopards and panthers have shown the strongest aversion to each other . They would not associate and it was even dangerous to attempt to keep them in one cage . But Mr Ferari succeeded after much trial in finding one of each specie which would mate with the other . These panther - hybrids in the nine weeks they have been on earth have shown , Mr Ferari says , all the vicious characteristics of leopard and panther . As Mr Ferari says , the little fellows at their age ought to be as easy to handle as kittens , since lions , tigers , panthers and other ferocious beasts can be trained without danger , but yesterday he had to be as much on the alert for the sharp claws of the babies as if they were yeas instead of weeks old . They are very interesting curious and they are also very good specimens , strong and vigorous . Both show the panther and leopard blood . The gray in the tawny coat and the spots are from the father , the leopard , while the dark buff of the coat is of the mother . The head and back are those of the panther mother , and the movement , the loping , stealthy stride indicate strongly the predominance of the panther maternal blood . When these kittens are 4 weeks older it will be impossible for us to attempt to touch them with our hands , said Mr Ferari . Never have I seen the vicious element in animals developed so young . What they will be , what characteristics growth will develop we do not know . They are an enigma , a problem . I think they will be an interesting study . After their excursion to town Wonder and Land late in the afternoon were restored to the care of their panther mother at Wonderland park and it was curious to observe the way the panther snarled as she smelled the traces of numerous human hands on the coats of her offspring . Both male puma x female leopard and male leopard x female puma pairings have produced offspring . Hamburg Zoo had a hybrid ( the one in the black and white photo ) fathered by a puma bred to an Indian leopardess . A specimen purchased in 1898 by Berlin Zoo from Carl Hagenbeck was a cross between a male leopard and a female puma ( the same as the Chicago hybrids ) . Various newspapers published this report in early 1903 : The first successful experiment I made was with a leopard and a puma , \" said Mr. Hagenbeck recently . And the only living animal of the litter I sold some time ago to the Berlin Zoological Garden , where it Is still in the collection . In The Field No 2887 , April 25th , 1908 , Henry Scherren wrote \" Writing in Zoologischer Garten ( 1903 , pp. 288-90 ) , Forstmeister Adolf Rorig , of Frankfort - on - the - Main , gave a summary of the notices of feline hybrids that had previously appeared in that journal . There was , and probably is now , in the Berlin Garden and Indian leopard and puma male hybrid , purchased of Carl Hagenbeck in 1898 . In his Guide Dr Heck described it as a little grey puma with large brown rosettes . Another hybrid between the same species , but with a puma for sire and a leopard from dam , was recently at Stellingen ; it resembled the female parent in form , as may be seen from the reproduction from a photograph taken there . \" Hagenbeck much later wrote ( 1951 ) that a male puma and female leopard produced a hybrid cub that was reared by a Fox terrier bitch ( this was common practice to ensure a tamed individual ) at Hagenbeck Tierpark , Hamburg . The hybrid was male and intermediate between the puma and leopard in colour and pattern , having faint leopard spots on a puma-coloured background . The body length was much less than either parent and the tail was long , like the puma . A pair of leopard x puma hybrid cubs were born in Chicago on 24 April 1896 at Tattersalls indoor arena where Ringling Brothers Circus opened its season . Details about the two cubs were published in The Chicago Chronicle on 25th April 1896 : Two tiny cubs which look like young leopards were born at Tattersall 's where Ringling Brothers circus is housed , yesterday ( 24 APR [ 18 ] 96 ) . They are not leopards , however . Their mother is a mountain lion or cougar and their father is a leopard . They take after their father decidedly , and are the daintiest little members of the cat family ever born in captivity . In fact they are the only ones of their kind , so far as known , ever born , either within the confines of a cage or anywhere else . These black and yellow youngsters were on exhibition yesterday and were admired by all who saw them . They will probably be on view the rest of the time the circus exhibits in Chicago . H Petzsch ( 1956 ) mentioned that puma / leopard hybrids had been obtained by artificial insemination . Dr Helmut Hemmer ( 1966 ) reported a hybrid between a male Indian leopard ( P pardus fusca ) and female puma as being fairly small with a ground colour like that of the puma and having rather faded rosettes . This is a still from a video recording of \" ATV Today \" on 13th May , 1981 , a segment of Southam Wildlife Park . By that time is was owned by the Jones family and housed big cats . It was struggling to attract visitors , on one special opening day it attracted only 10 admissions . It had had a problem earlier when a lioness had mauled a girl and there were calls to end its big cat petting sessions so it was eager for publicity . In 1978 it had claimed a panther - tiger hybrid , which was actually a pure tiger that was later sold to a circus . The full clip is owned by MACE ( Media Archives of Central England ) and listed at 1981 Alleged Leopard Puma Hybrids , Southam Wildlife Park , but has not been digitised for public viewing . While these are n't the leopard - puma hybrids they claim to be , I found it worth debunking the misleading claim . In May 1981 , Southam Wildlife Park claimed to have successfully mated Sampson the leopard with Poppette the puma resulting in cubs that were puma coloured with some spots . Looking at the still , the cubs are normal puma cubs , but the public may not have known that puma cubs are spotted or blotched . They lack the rosette pattern found on genuine hybrids and they have dark dorsal stripes , which were not found on genuine hybrids . From all reports , the Wildlife Park was doing quite badly in the early 1980s . On one \" special opening \" day it only got 10 visitors , so it would have been desperate for publicity and novel attractions . If Sampson was not the father , who was ? In 1979 , the zoo had a cougar called \" Snooty \" ( Coventry Evening Telegraph , 26th October 1979 ) , though its gender is n't mentioned . In 1980 , there was a puma called Peebles which had 2 cubs , Snooples and Dooples ( Daily Mirror , 16th October 1980 ) which means they definitely had a breeding age male puma . There was also a puma cub at the zoo in May 1981 ( Daily Mirror , 30th May 1981 ) . The claim of the leopard being the sire was purely for publicity ; there is no long term follow up on the cubs , so either they died or they were shifted out of sight when their true identities became obvious . Nancy Neff in her introduction to Guy Coheleach 's \" The Big Cats \" : \" the ability to hybridize may seem to contradict the status of ... cats as separate species , since species are usually defined as populations of animals who interbreed among themselves but who are unable to interbreed under natural conditions with other such groups . \" Neff viewed with \" extreme interest , \" instances of captive cross-breeding between the more distantly related puma and leopard ( as opposed to lion - tiger , lion - leopard and leopard - jaguar pairings ) since - at the time she wrote her introduction - the puma was not considered a pantherine . Thus , referring to the puma , \" the ability to hybridize with the leopard is quite unexpected . \" She felt the ability of pumas and leopards to interbreed may be explained by immunological findings placing them both in the pantherine lineage . More recently , the American \" X- Project Magazine \" reported that Britain 's Exmoor Beasts are believed to be descended from a black puma x leopard hybrid . The limited gene pool \" fixed \" the recessive black colour and the adaptability of the puma ensured its survival . This is actually impossible because melanism has never been verified in pumas ; the black big cats kept as pets in Britain were black panthers ( leopards ) and black jaguars and moreover , a self - sustaining population of hybrid big cats is extremely unlikely due to problems of sterility in the males . Additionally there is the problem of dwarfism observed in puma x leopard hybrids , although it is n't clear whether any of the hybrids reached their adult size .

( SeeHybrid Big Cats In The British Countryside ) Confusingly , it has been reported that most pumas kept as pets in the United Kingdom were black rather than tawny ; the rarity of black pumas makes this extremely unlikely . This confusion arises because pumas are also known as panthers and black panthers ( black leopards ) were indeed kept as pets . The confusion is worsened by articles which erroneously refer to \" the black puma out of The Jungle Book \" ( pumas are not found in India ! ) . Unlike black panthers , supposed \" black pumas \" ( \" couguar noire \" ) have dark upper parts , but pale bellies . PUMA / JAGUAR HYBRIDS REMARKABLE HYBRIDS . Alexandria Gazette ( Virginia ) , 17th January 1900 , pg 1 . It has been tried many times in the past , but has , it is claimed , always been unsuccessful heretofore . The attempt to mate a puma and a leopard , or a puma and a jaguar , has also been tried , but has resulted each time in the injury of the puma . A supposed puma x jaguar hybrid was shot in the Mato Grosso , South America in the early half of the 20th Century . It was killed by Sacha Siemel whose opinion was that it was a puma x jaguar hybrid . It was heavily built with brown spots on a fawn background and a dark stripe down its back . Pumas and jaguars are both present in the area , but occupy different niches and would be unlikely to meet , let alone mate . The description of the supposed puma / jaguar hybrid was very similar to that of the captive - bred pumapards . Successful hybridization between pumas and jaguars in captivity has been alleged ( in a report by Dr Helmut Hemmer , 1966 ) , but there is no photographic evidence . The hybrids would look similar to pumapards , but with jaguar-like , rather than leopard - like , markings and would possibly be more powerfully built . These reports , which contain a lot of showman 's hype , also allude to puma / jaguar hybrids . From The New York Times of June 4th , 1906 we have ALL HYBRIDS AT CONEY . Some Beasts There Are Bi-Hybrids This Year All Are Mighty Rare . Bulletin chased bulletin out of the animal shows at Coney Island yesterday . A Coney Island animal show is a cheap affair this year if it hasnt at least one hybrid ; naturally the press agents are n't forgetting that fact . Bostocks press agent announced , with tears in his voiced that Tricolor , the Bostock hybrid , had just died . At the same time , however , there were born to the lioness Princess two tiny cubs . Their father is said to be a cross between a puma and the famous self - eating Jaguar whose favourite occupation is biting a section of his own tail off . Tricolor was only a cross of a puma , a jaguar , and a lion . That , the press agent says , is quite a common cross . The new cubs , of course , are very rare . At the same time , various papers reported that Tricolor , the Bostock leopard - lion - tiger hybrid , died , and a lioness in Mr. Bostocks menagerie had given birth to a pair of puma-jaguar- lion prodigies . Like lion cubs , puma cubs have rosetted markings ; the supposed hybrid might have been an individual which had retained its spots into adulthood . PUMA / LION HYBRIDS The Atlanta Constitution , November 10th , 1907 : FRANK BOSTOCK POSES WITH FAMOUS LIO - PAN Frank C. Bostock , owner and proprietor of the Bostock Arena , posed for a picture of himself and his famous hybrid animal Lio-pan , which is a cross between an African lion and a South American panther , the only one ever known to be born . Further investigation finds that the South American panther is the jaguar , not the puma ( New - York Tribune , 27th April 1907 , pg 4. , NEW ANIMAL , THE LIOPAN ) PUMA / TIGER HYBRIDS An article in the Long Island Ocelot Club newsletter of November / December 1980 noted that hybrids were prevented in the wild through different reproductive behaviour and geographical barriers , but in zoos the different species became familiar enough that the normal sexual behaviour was subtly modified . Hybrids between the big cats attracted the most attention and listed these as : ligers , tigons and leopons as well as \" less well - known hybrids \" of leopard x jaguar , puma x tiger , lion x jaguar and jaguar x puma ( referencing Gray , 1972 ) . The reference to puma x tiger appears to be a mis-translation of \" panther x tiger \" indicating the leopard x tiger cross that is known in captivity as a tigard and known in India as a dogla . A North American would assume a panther to be a puma . INTRASPECIFIC PUMA HYBRIDS Intraspecific hybrids of puma subspecies are common in zoos e.g. Puma concolor capricornensis x Puma concolor concolor ( International Zoo Yearbook of 1968 reports 2 males , born in Brasilia , Brazil , 1966 ) .

TGL had the honour of catching up with the man behind the voice and moves of everyone 's favourite white haired ebony and ivory wielding demon slayer , Reuben Langdon . We spoke to Reuben about how he got started in the industry , his production company , his work on James Cameron 's Avatar , how he landed the role of Dante and his take on the forthcoming DMC reboot . Fingers on your devil trigger folks . Let 's rock , baby \u2026.. TGL : Hi Reuben . It 's a pleasure to finally speak with you . How are you doing today ? Reuben Langdon : I 'm great thanks . It 's great to finally speak with you guys . TGL : Why do n't you start off by telling us how you started out in the industry ? EB : Sure . Well , I guess if I 'm going to mention how I got to where I am today , I should trace it back to when I actually did some work as a model . At the start I was n't so sure about acting or the modelling thing but after a couple of attempts and realising that it was n't going to be as bad as I thought it was going to be , I started to make some decent side money and from there that led to an interest in acting and taking acting classes in Japan in Japanese . Then I landed a role on a TV show called B- Fighter Kabuto . That 's where it all started for me in terms of knowing what I wanted to do . I wanted to do action and acting and stunts . That show was kind of like a Power Ranger - esque show . I landed that role and appeared on that show as a regular for about a half a year . Since then I 've been very much involved in the business . It has its ups and downs but I would say that in the last 10 years I 've really been focused on my company \u201c Just Cause \u201d where we are doing bigger and better things every year . The main goal of the company is to produce films and videogame content . TGL : Did \u201c Just Cause \u201d start out as a company that just worked on film and did you just find yourself dabbling more and more in the realm of games ? RL : When I started the company with my partner , Takuya Shibata , who is based in Japan , our goal and our intent was to create our own content and produce our own content . The idea at the start was that it would be mostly for film . Because of my experience doing acting shows and what not , I had worked on Resident Evil : Code Veronica doing motion capture and during that experience I was the only white guy on the cast and they had both a Japanese and English script . The way they had been doing motion capture up to that point was that they would usually have Japanese actors act out everything and then they would go in and localise it with English because they knew the ultimate final project was going to be in English . They asked me to do my part in English but it was awkward for them to ask the Japanese actors to act out in English . It was what I call the \u201c Gun Head \u201d effect . It 's like an old 80/90s Japanese film based on the manga where the lead heroine is speaking English and then there are a couple of actors who perform their dialogue in English but then the rest of the actors were speaking in Japanese and it was just weird . So when I was doing Code Veronica , I felt that weirdness . It did n't feel right . There had to be a better way . So a few years later , me and my partner formed the company and we were basically just looking for projects . We needed to get some experience under our belts and get or company off the ground . So we came up with a proposal to basically coordinate between the two of us and we started working on Power Rangers in the States . We wanted to audition talent in the States , cast them and then fly them over to Japan to do the motion capture . We thought it was n't going to be that big of a deal . Our company would help get the scripts and help localise them and take care of those aspects . We first started off with Resident Evil Outbreak . And then Devil May Cry came on board . Capcom were very happy with the results from our Resident Evil stuff . They decided to hand everything over to us for Devil May Cry and handle the script localisation and getting the talent . We actually recommended the director too . So that 's kind of what got our company started on the games side . We wanted to work on any kind of story telling media and the game thing just sort of kicked off around this time with Capcom . We work with Capcom pretty regularly . We have a very good relationship with them . TGL : Sounds like \u201c Just Cause \u201d is quite a layered service \u2026 RL : Yes it is but I do have to audition for parts in games even if my company is involved like with Chris Redfield or Dante . Actually I had to audition for Dante both times , both for Devil May Cry 3 and Devil May Cry 4 and both times for the voice too . I do both the voice and mo-cap for Dante and just the mo-cap for Chris . I actually auditioned four times for Dante , more if you count call - backs . It 's kind of like a double sided sword with Capcom . It 's great because these projects are coming in the door to my company but then I still have to go through all the motions and hoops and huddles on the auditioning side . Sometimes even more than the other actors because Capcom know I 'm the owner of the company and think \u201c how can he act ? \u201d I 've decided now though that I wo n't be auditioning for any more roles that come through my company , unless it 's a reoccurring role , because it can be too much of a headache on the producer side and the actor side . I 'm separating my careers a little bit more . TGL : But before we talk about games and the parts you 've played in more detail , not many people probably know this but you were significantly involved in James Cameron 's Avatar , were n't you ? You did the mo-cap for Jake Sully . That 's amazing . Congratulations . RL : Thank you . That was an amazing project and I would have to say that its probably one of the , if not the , best project I 've ever worked on . And knock on wood ; I hope I 'll be coming back for Avatar 2 and 3 . Basically I had heard about the project because originally it was going to be Battle Angel . I had done some testing for Battle Angel at House of Moves which is one of the more prestige mo-cap studios here in L.A. Cameron did n't actually make it to any of those tests but some of the other key technical people were there . So I did the test and Battle Angel which for me was my dream project . I 'm a huge Battle Angel fan . I really had to get on this project especially when I heard that Cameron had the rights to the franchise . After I did that test I did n't hear anything . At this time mo-cap in movies was still pretty new . This was about 2005 - 2006 . A friend of mine who was on the project was always submitting my name because I was known for my mo-cap . There were only a couple of Mo-cap films out there at that time like Beowulf and Polar Express . So anyway , I had heard nothing and then all of a sudden I got a call asking me to fill in for a friend on the set . We were the same height so that helped and there I was on the set of Avatar , not Battle Angel . It was cool . Jim seemed to like what I was doing and they kept asking me back and it was on and off for about three years . It 's a super honour to have been a part of it . I 'm really crossing my fingers that I get invited back for the next two movies . Thank you for mentioning Avatar because I find that usually when I go to conventions and if I mention Avatar then people usually start falling asleep . I 'm like \u201c you do n't have any Avatar questions ? It was the highest grossing film of all time ! \u201d But that 's ok . People usually just want to talk about games , which is cool . TGL : So can I ask you about games and your involvement in Devil May Cry ? You are Dante after all . Did you have any idea when you got involved just how big the DMC franchise actually was ? RL : I had played the first DMC . I guess I did n't know it had such a cult following at that stage . I did n't really realise until after we had done the capture and the first trailer came out . It was then that I started to get a lot of hate mail from fans telling me that I was n't Dante and that the voice was different and I was n't the right character anymore . It was only then that I realised that WOW there 's a huge fan base for this . From the DMC 3 trailer that the fans saw at this time , they were not happy with the change and Dante 's new look . I would definitely say that there were more negative emails and negative posts about it on blogs and stuff . But then the game came out and everybody loved it . Then all of a sudden I 'm Dante and everybody forgot about the other guy so it 's cool now . TGL : So what do you make of the new revised Ninja- Theory DMC ? RL : With regards to the new one , I do n't have any part in it , I have n't been asked and I do believe that 's it probably too late in the game for me to come on board , even if they did ask me to voice or do any motion capture or anything like that . I believe that it 's a whole other different take on the character and casting and everything else just like 3 . I 'm not involved so I ca n't say much but because I was involved in 3 and 4 I do know the history and that 3 was a reboot of the series . The new game is that as well . It may be a little more extreme or maybe not . I think people at the time when 3 came out were afraid of the changes and it proved to work in the end . What I would say about the new one is that maybe history might repeat itself . TGL : A lot of fans are quite concerned with what they 've seen of the new game so far . RL : Yeah , I 've been getting a lot of Facebook messages and emails about it and yes , I suppose I 'm not that much of a fan of the direction it is going but also that 's the feeling a lot of Devil May Cry 1 fans had going into Devil May Cry 3 . We wo n't mention Devil May Cry 2 , Capcom do n't like to talk about it that much ! TGL : For obvious reasons \u2026 RL : Yeah , I think we 'll skip over that one . But looking back , who knows ? This could be something very different and revolutionary . TGL : We should just put our faith in Capcom and Ninja - Theory \u2026 RL : Yes . I know that Ninja - Theory are doing the bulk of the work but I was talking to Hideaki Itsuno who was the director on DMC 2 , 3 and 4 and he has been taking lots of trips over and back to and from Ninja - Theory . He seems to be involved quite a bit . So they still have one of the key team members with him working on the game . TGL : So what were Capcom looking from a perspective Dante ? What did they ask of you when you first auditioned for the part ? RL : Well I have to say that it was one of the most difficult , frustrating and yet rewarding character of anyone I 've ever played . For starters he was already established , that and they were looking for a different spin so it would have been easy to just copy the previous guy . There were a lot of cooks in the kitchen so to say . They all wanted a different spin . So on set it was very challenging and difficult because I might have had over twenty directors but really it was the relationship I had with the main director that allowed us to create that newer Dante . But I was getting notes from everybody . I remember my first motion capture scene ; I thought my head was going to explode . \u201c Do this , do that , too much of this , do this more \u201d . I was just really being over directed and I felt like I had no creativity in the character at all . But I think what helped me in the end because I had so much over direction that I ultimately just got so frustrated and I just did n't listen to anybody . I was just like \u201c Screw all of you , I 'm going to do what I want to do because my head just exploded in that last scene and I felt like a robot \u201d . I basically just did my own rendition of it and even though I would still get notes after that Id still shut people down and people would start to see that I was shutting myself off . It 's a testament to any actor that even when you get direction from your director and you take it in , 90 % of it has to be listening to yourself and making the choices as the performer . If you end up doing what everyone is telling you and you do n't listen to yourself then they might as well just animate the guy . TGL : So how much does the character of Dante mean to you ? Are you protective of him ? Is he a real high point in your career ? RL : O yes absolutely . That 's what I meant by saying it was one of the most frustrating and rewarding . It was frustrating the first few days but then everyone would realise that this is me and this is the way Dante is being portrayed this time out . It was rewarding because the team that worked on it were great and I was a producer on it so I had a say in casting and stuff like that . Ultimately Capcom had the final say on everything but being able to bring in certain actors to audition , being able to recommend the director and being able to work with a team that was really passionate about the project was great because there were no egos involved . Any project I 've ever worked with that has a team like that is usually successful . Avatar is a good example . That team was tight and everyone was there to do the project and it all shows in the end . Devil May Cry was rewarding because apart from playing this awesome character I got to be involved in so much more , like production or the script or whatever . I was wearing many hats . So when it came out it was more than just me being the actor . It was the same with DMC 4 and the team . 4 allowed me to bond with the character even more . TGL : Which do you prefer ? The voice work or the more hands on performance aspects ? RL : The performance . Most projects ask you to do voice first and mo-cap second . With Capcom and with my team , we insist that we do the body first and then the voice over second . When you have a recorded voice that you try and put movement to , the timing is already set . You basically become a puppet . We did one project that way . I wo n't name it , but it was disastrous . We were locked into other performances . We had to follow something that was pre-recorded so it was hard . The voice is one tool . The body has so much more happening , arms , legs face and facial expression . You have so many tools to express emotion . The voice is just one tool . You have a lot more freedom with doing the body first . But I love doing both voice and mo-cap . There are plus ' and minus ' to both . I have a one tonal voice . I have Dante 's voice , I have Ken Masters voice , It 's Reuben Langdon 's voice . The way I see voices is that it 's an extra layer . Maybe the body is one , special effects , stunts etc . The voice is another layer on top of that . The motion capture is a basic foundation and it allows for more creativity and more freedom . There 's more room to play around and it 's not a set layer . TGL : So what are you working on at the moment moving forward Reuben ? RL : I 'm working on a few projects at the moment that I ca n't really talk about . TGL : We love non-disclosure agreements \u2026. RL : Yes , the game world is a very secret world . I 'm working on four different very cool high profile videogame projects . I 'm performing in them . Once they are announced , you will know about them . TGL : Sounds great . Thanks Reuben . It was great catching up like this \u2026 RL : Likewise .

TGL had the honour of catching up with the man behind the voice and moves of everyone 's favourite white haired ebony and ivory wielding demon slayer , Reuben Langdon . We spoke to Reuben about how he got started in the industry , his production company , his work on James Cameron 's Avatar , how he landed the role of Dante and his take on the forthcoming DMC reboot . Fingers on your devil trigger folks . Let 's rock , baby \u2026.. TGL : Hi Reuben . It 's a pleasure to finally speak with you . How are you doing today ? Reuben Langdon : I 'm great thanks . It 's great to finally speak with you guys . TGL : Why do n't you start off by telling us how you started out in the industry ? EB : Sure . Well , I guess if I 'm going to mention how I got to where I am today , I should trace it back to when I actually did some work as a model . At the start I was n't so sure about acting or the modelling thing but after a couple of attempts and realising that it was n't going to be as bad as I thought it was going to be , I started to make some decent side money and from there that led to an interest in acting and taking acting classes in Japan in Japanese . Then I landed a role on a TV show called B- Fighter Kabuto . That 's where it all started for me in terms of knowing what I wanted to do . I wanted to do action and acting and stunts . That show was kind of like a Power Ranger - esque show . I landed that role and appeared on that show as a regular for about a half a year . Since then I 've been very much involved in the business . It has its ups and downs but I would say that in the last 10 years I 've really been focused on my company \u201c Just Cause \u201d where we are doing bigger and better things every year . The main goal of the company is to produce films and videogame content . TGL : Did \u201c Just Cause \u201d start out as a company that just worked on film and did you just find yourself dabbling more and more in the realm of games ? RL : When I started the company with my partner , Takuya Shibata , who is based in Japan , our goal and our intent was to create our own content and produce our own content . The idea at the start was that it would be mostly for film . Because of my experience doing acting shows and what not , I had worked on Resident Evil : Code Veronica doing motion capture and during that experience I was the only white guy on the cast and they had both a Japanese and English script . The way they had been doing motion capture up to that point was that they would usually have Japanese actors act out everything and then they would go in and localise it with English because they knew the ultimate final project was going to be in English . They asked me to do my part in English but it was awkward for them to ask the Japanese actors to act out in English . It was what I call the \u201c Gun Head \u201d effect . It 's like an old 80/90s Japanese film based on the manga where the lead heroine is speaking English and then there are a couple of actors who perform their dialogue in English but then the rest of the actors were speaking in Japanese and it was just weird . So when I was doing Code Veronica , I felt that weirdness . It did n't feel right . There had to be a better way . So a few years later , me and my partner formed the company and we were basically just looking for projects . We needed to get some experience under our belts and get or company off the ground . So we came up with a proposal to basically coordinate between the two of us and we started working on Power Rangers in the States . We wanted to audition talent in the States , cast them and then fly them over to Japan to do the motion capture . We thought it was n't going to be that big of a deal . Our company would help get the scripts and help localise them and take care of those aspects . We first started off with Resident Evil Outbreak . And then Devil May Cry came on board . Capcom were very happy with the results from our Resident Evil stuff . They decided to hand everything over to us for Devil May Cry and handle the script localisation and getting the talent . We actually recommended the director too . So that 's kind of what got our company started on the games side . We wanted to work on any kind of story telling media and the game thing just sort of kicked off around this time with Capcom . We work with Capcom pretty regularly . We have a very good relationship with them . TGL : Sounds like \u201c Just Cause \u201d is quite a layered service \u2026 RL : Yes it is but I do have to audition for parts in games even if my company is involved like with Chris Redfield or Dante . Actually I had to audition for Dante both times , both for Devil May Cry 3 and Devil May Cry 4 and both times for the voice too . I do both the voice and mo-cap for Dante and just the mo-cap for Chris . I actually auditioned four times for Dante , more if you count call - backs . It 's kind of like a double sided sword with Capcom . It 's great because these projects are coming in the door to my company but then I still have to go through all the motions and hoops and huddles on the auditioning side . Sometimes even more than the other actors because Capcom know I 'm the owner of the company and think \u201c how can he act ? \u201d I 've decided now though that I wo n't be auditioning for any more roles that come through my company , unless it 's a reoccurring role , because it can be too much of a headache on the producer side and the actor side . I 'm separating my careers a little bit more . TGL : But before we talk about games and the parts you 've played in more detail , not many people probably know this but you were significantly involved in James Cameron 's Avatar , were n't you ? You did the mo-cap for Jake Sully . That 's amazing . Congratulations . RL : Thank you . That was an amazing project and I would have to say that its probably one of the , if not the , best project I 've ever worked on . And knock on wood ; I hope I 'll be coming back for Avatar 2 and 3 . Basically I had heard about the project because originally it was going to be Battle Angel . I had done some testing for Battle Angel at House of Moves which is one of the more prestige mo-cap studios here in L.A. Cameron did n't actually make it to any of those tests but some of the other key technical people were there . So I did the test and Battle Angel which for me was my dream project . I 'm a huge Battle Angel fan . I really had to get on this project especially when I heard that Cameron had the rights to the franchise . After I did that test I did n't hear anything . At this time mo-cap in movies was still pretty new . This was about 2005 - 2006 . A friend of mine who was on the project was always submitting my name because I was known for my mo-cap . There were only a couple of Mo-cap films out there at that time like Beowulf and Polar Express . So anyway , I had heard nothing and then all of a sudden I got a call asking me to fill in for a friend on the set . We were the same height so that helped and there I was on the set of Avatar , not Battle Angel . It was cool . Jim seemed to like what I was doing and they kept asking me back and it was on and off for about three years . It 's a super honour to have been a part of it . I 'm really crossing my fingers that I get invited back for the next two movies . Thank you for mentioning Avatar because I find that usually when I go to conventions and if I mention Avatar then people usually start falling asleep . I 'm like \u201c you do n't have any Avatar questions ? It was the highest grossing film of all time ! \u201d But that 's ok . People usually just want to talk about games , which is cool . TGL : So can I ask you about games and your involvement in Devil May Cry ? You are Dante after all . Did you have any idea when you got involved just how big the DMC franchise actually was ? RL : I had played the first DMC . I guess I did n't know it had such a cult following at that stage . I did n't really realise until after we had done the capture and the first trailer came out . It was then that I started to get a lot of hate mail from fans telling me that I was n't Dante and that the voice was different and I was n't the right character anymore . It was only then that I realised that WOW there 's a huge fan base for this . From the DMC 3 trailer that the fans saw at this time , they were not happy with the change and Dante 's new look . I would definitely say that there were more negative emails and negative posts about it on blogs and stuff . But then the game came out and everybody loved it . Then all of a sudden I 'm Dante and everybody forgot about the other guy so it 's cool now . TGL : So what do you make of the new revised Ninja- Theory DMC ? RL : With regards to the new one , I do n't have any part in it , I have n't been asked and I do believe that 's it probably too late in the game for me to come on board , even if they did ask me to voice or do any motion capture or anything like that . I believe that it 's a whole other different take on the character and casting and everything else just like 3 . I 'm not involved so I ca n't say much but because I was involved in 3 and 4 I do know the history and that 3 was a reboot of the series . The new game is that as well . It may be a little more extreme or maybe not . I think people at the time when 3 came out were afraid of the changes and it proved to work in the end . What I would say about the new one is that maybe history might repeat itself . TGL : A lot of fans are quite concerned with what they 've seen of the new game so far . RL : Yeah , I 've been getting a lot of Facebook messages and emails about it and yes , I suppose I 'm not that much of a fan of the direction it is going but also that 's the feeling a lot of Devil May Cry 1 fans had going into Devil May Cry 3 . We wo n't mention Devil May Cry 2 , Capcom do n't like to talk about it that much ! TGL : For obvious reasons \u2026 RL : Yeah , I think we 'll skip over that one . But looking back , who knows ? This could be something very different and revolutionary . TGL : We should just put our faith in Capcom and Ninja - Theory \u2026 RL : Yes . I know that Ninja - Theory are doing the bulk of the work but I was talking to Hideaki Itsuno who was the director on DMC 2 , 3 and 4 and he has been taking lots of trips over and back to and from Ninja - Theory . He seems to be involved quite a bit . So they still have one of the key team members with him working on the game . TGL : So what were Capcom looking from a perspective Dante ? What did they ask of you when you first auditioned for the part ? RL : Well I have to say that it was one of the most difficult , frustrating and yet rewarding character of anyone I 've ever played . For starters he was already established , that and they were looking for a different spin so it would have been easy to just copy the previous guy . There were a lot of cooks in the kitchen so to say . They all wanted a different spin . So on set it was very challenging and difficult because I might have had over twenty directors but really it was the relationship I had with the main director that allowed us to create that newer Dante . But I was getting notes from everybody . I remember my first motion capture scene ; I thought my head was going to explode . \u201c Do this , do that , too much of this , do this more \u201d . I was just really being over directed and I felt like I had no creativity in the character at all . But I think what helped me in the end because I had so much over direction that I ultimately just got so frustrated and I just did n't listen to anybody . I was just like \u201c Screw all of you , I 'm going to do what I want to do because my head just exploded in that last scene and I felt like a robot \u201d . I basically just did my own rendition of it and even though I would still get notes after that Id still shut people down and people would start to see that I was shutting myself off . It 's a testament to any actor that even when you get direction from your director and you take it in , 90 % of it has to be listening to yourself and making the choices as the performer . If you end up doing what everyone is telling you and you do n't listen to yourself then they might as well just animate the guy . TGL : So how much does the character of Dante mean to you ? Are you protective of him ? Is he a real high point in your career ? RL : O yes absolutely . That 's what I meant by saying it was one of the most frustrating and rewarding . It was frustrating the first few days but then everyone would realise that this is me and this is the way Dante is being portrayed this time out . It was rewarding because the team that worked on it were great and I was a producer on it so I had a say in casting and stuff like that . Ultimately Capcom had the final say on everything but being able to bring in certain actors to audition , being able to recommend the director and being able to work with a team that was really passionate about the project was great because there were no egos involved . Any project I 've ever worked with that has a team like that is usually successful . Avatar is a good example . That team was tight and everyone was there to do the project and it all shows in the end . Devil May Cry was rewarding because apart from playing this awesome character I got to be involved in so much more , like production or the script or whatever . I was wearing many hats . So when it came out it was more than just me being the actor . It was the same with DMC 4 and the team . 4 allowed me to bond with the character even more . TGL : Which do you prefer ? The voice work or the more hands on performance aspects ? RL : The performance . Most projects ask you to do voice first and mo-cap second . With Capcom and with my team , we insist that we do the body first and then the voice over second . When you have a recorded voice that you try and put movement to , the timing is already set . You basically become a puppet . We did one project that way . I wo n't name it , but it was disastrous . We were locked into other performances . We had to follow something that was pre-recorded so it was hard . The voice is one tool . The body has so much more happening , arms , legs face and facial expression . You have so many tools to express emotion . The voice is just one tool . You have a lot more freedom with doing the body first . But I love doing both voice and mo-cap . There are plus ' and minus ' to both . I have a one tonal voice . I have Dante 's voice , I have Ken Masters voice , It 's Reuben Langdon 's voice . The way I see voices is that it 's an extra layer . Maybe the body is one , special effects , stunts etc . The voice is another layer on top of that . The motion capture is a basic foundation and it allows for more creativity and more freedom . There 's more room to play around and it 's not a set layer . TGL : So what are you working on at the moment moving forward Reuben ? RL : I 'm working on a few projects at the moment that I ca n't really talk about . TGL : We love non-disclosure agreements \u2026. RL : Yes , the game world is a very secret world . I 'm working on four different very cool high profile videogame projects . I 'm performing in them . Once they are announced , you will know about them . TGL : Sounds great . Thanks Reuben . It was great catching up like this \u2026 RL : Likewise .

At a secret meeting in an undisclosed location , Tom Harrison , chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board , the sport 's national governing body , is being run through a slideshow presentation on the future of the game . English cricket is sleepwalking through a demographic crisis , he is told . In the UK , the sport retains a mainly white , affluent , middle - aged - male audience . Beyond this privileged set , the appeal fades . The findings are from four years of surveys , taking in the responses of more than 100,000 people on their attitudes towards cricket . Of the 10.5 million \u201c followers \u201d interested in the sport , 1.1 million actually attend matches . The amount of people playing the game is falling . Only 5 per cent of children aged between seven and 15 years old list cricket in their top two favourite sports . The average age of an English cricket fan is 50 . Harrison , a white , affluent , privately educated 47 - year - old already knows this . The research has been circulating within the ECB for months . To his surprise , the last slide proposes a solution : The Hundred , a tournament in which each innings lasts just 100 balls , creating a faster , simpler , more accessible version of the game . \u201c My instantaneous reaction was : I love it , \u201d recalls Harrison when I meet him at the ECB 's offices at Lord 's , the famous London ground that is known as \u201c the home of cricket \u201d . \u201c I absolutely love it . I can actually feel the hairs on my neck just thinking about that moment , that sense of , ' Wow , this is powerful . ' \u201d Then he adds : \u201c Very quickly afterwards [ there was ] a kind of dose of reality . This is n't going to be straightforward . \u201d The Hundred may not sound like a revolution . Last year , the ECB invited an elite group of coaches and players to a two -day workshop to brainstorm innovations , from increasing the size of teams to even , for a few seconds , eliminating the \u201c leg before wicket \u201d rule . Most were not taken up , though some , such as strategic \u201c time-outs \u201d , were . But when it launches in July next year , the game will still feature bat v ball , a duel of willow against leather over 22 yards on a grass pitch . Beneath the surface , though , lies a more subversive design . Millennial audiences have ever-narrowing attention spans , but have ever-greater ways to be entertained . Cricket is not alone in responding to this challenge . The ATP , the body that runs men 's professional tennis , has launched a tournament dedicated to experiments such as using a \u201c shot -clock \u201d to limit the time a player has before serving . In the US , American football , basketball and baseball have all introduced rule changes to speed up the pace of play . The ECB 's plan goes a lot further . It is spending \u00a3 180 m to create new teams featuring the country 's best players , right in the heart of the summer cricket season . English cricket is making an all - in bet on an untested proposition . The sport has accepted the need for speed . This summer will feature The Ashes , a Test series between Australia and England that first took place in 1877 , featuring matches that last up to five days , yet can still end in a draw . But later this month also marks the start of the cricket World Cup in England , where games are crunched into a single day . Last week saw the conclusion of the Indian Premier League , a money -spinning competition launched in 2008 , featuring \u201c Twenty20 \u201d matches that last just a few hours . The Hundred slims cricket down even further . Some argue this is unnecessary and may even harm the game . One top English cricket executive , who declines to be named fearing the wrath of the ECB , says it is like inventing Gaelic football , a game beloved in Ireland , but incomprehensible outside those shores . \u201c To add a fourth format that wo n't be played anywhere else , that has no international relevance , is a real dichotomy for the game , \u201d the executive says . In nondescript offices overlooking the lush , green practice pitches of Lord 's , I meet the team of officials reimagining an ancient game . Over several hours of interviews , they provide the deepest insight yet into the project , though much remains shrouded in secrecy . Their work has led to a fierce debate raging across the game . Is The Hundred a necessary and vital departure , pointing to a brighter future for other sports ? Or an expensive and foolhardy attempt to reach the masses , while alienating cricket 's loyal fan base ? The man who pitched The Hundred to Harrison is a Scot. Sanjay Patel was brought up in the small town of Alloa and played for Scotland 's national cricket team . He spent several years as an executive in the drinks industry before joining the ECB in 2014 . In February , the 46- year - old became managing director of The Hundred , tasked with bringing the new tournament to life . According to Patel , The Hundred is a silver bullet to solve a trio of problems . First , time . Even the shortest form of the game , Twenty 20 matches ( in which each innings lasts 120 balls in total ) , lasts three to four hours , much longer than comparable events , such as a football match . Second , complexity . In cricket 's Byzantine scoring system , newcomers must follow runs scored , overs bowled , wickets taken , among myriad other statistics . Third , perception . Too few outside cricket 's establishment see it as a game for them . The Hundred addresses each of these issues , says Patel . Games will be completed within two and a half hours . And spectators can track a game through a countdown of balls and accumulation of runs . \u201c We felt when cricket was at its best , it was really simple , \u201d he says . \u201c There 's 30 runs required and there 's 15 balls left . That 's when cricket becomes so accessible to a wider audience . \u201d The Hundred 's main method for dealing with the game 's \u201c stale , male , pale \u201d conundrum is to break with almost 130 years of tradition . In English county cricket , competitions feature 18 \u201c first class \u201d counties , representing historic geographic districts around the country \u2014 from Durham in the north to Sussex in the south . Instead , The Hundred will involve eight new city - based franchises in Birmingham , Cardiff , Leeds , Manchester , Nottingham , Southampton and London ( one at the Oval and one at Lord's ) . The ECB says its shift is justified by research , which shows that the growing urbanisation of modern Britain means people now associate more closely with cities than with the \u201c shires \u201d . Still , in order to convince existing counties to accept being swallowed up by metropolises , Harrison , alongside ECB chairman Colin Graves ( one of the few ECB executives not made available for interview ) pledged to give each county \u00a3 1.3 m from the proceeds of the new competition as an incentive to vote in favour of creating it . For most , the cash will be the difference between making a profit or loss . Little is known about the new franchises .

This includes that Mancunians are proud of their city as a home to renowned sports teams and music acts . How such information will be used to guide the creation of new franchises is , for now , anyone 's guess . Last month , ECB officials travelled far from cricket 's heartlands to Nashville , Tennessee . They were there to watch the annual \u201c Draft \u201d for the National Football League , in which 32 NFL franchises select from the best young prospects in American football . The drama is played out live on television , as expectant fans wait to see who will join their side . The trip was a reconnaissance mission .

At the top end , these salaries are higher than most cricketers earn for an entire season \u2014 though the very best are paid hundreds of thousands of pounds for participating in India 's IPL tournament . Choosing players in this way represents another break with the county game .

How will fans react if Root 's prized batting is secured by an outfit based hundreds of miles away in Cardiff or Southampton ? The ECB believes enough fans will embrace a change of allegiances while Harrison insists the best players in the world will feature in The Hundred . However , Virat Kohli , the Indian captain who is cricket 's brightest superstar , has declared no interest in playing . Besides , the BCCI , the body that runs Indian cricket , does not allow male Indian players in the IPL to participate in rival global contests . This will limit interest for the tournament in the world 's biggest cricket market , which comprises hundreds of millions of avid viewers . Can The Hundred become a truly international tournament ? Harrison is talking to BCCI about relaxing its policies . \u201c I promise you one thing , 100 balls has got the attention of the powers - that - be in India in a way that perhaps we have n't managed to in the past . It 's a sign that we 're really thinking differently and thinking probably in a much broader sense about how we grow the game , \u201d he says . The plan in the meantime ?

There will be no draft of women , with the best paid receiving , at most , \u00a3 15,000 , according to Connor . There are only 21 full -time , professional female cricketers in the country , though the ECB says the \u201c aspiration \u201d is to create a further 80 to 100 semi-professional players next year . In the bigger picture , however , The Hundred is seen as a way of moving the women 's game towards parity in more ways than pay . \u201c One story that I heard after the women 's World Cup final : a friend took his son and daughter , \u201d says Connor . \u201c His son said afterwards : ' Daddy , my new favourite player is [ England bowler ] Anya Shrubsole .

At a secret meeting in an undisclosed location , Tom Harrison , chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board , the sport 's national governing body , is being run through a slideshow presentation on the future of the game . English cricket is sleepwalking through a demographic crisis , he is told . In the UK , the sport retains a mainly white , affluent , middle - aged - male audience . Beyond this privileged set , the appeal fades . The findings are from four years of surveys , taking in the responses of more than 100,000 people on their attitudes towards cricket . Of the 10.5 million \u201c followers \u201d interested in the sport , 1.1 million actually attend matches . The amount of people playing the game is falling . Only 5 per cent of children aged between seven and 15 years old list cricket in their top two favourite sports . The average age of an English cricket fan is 50 . Harrison , a white , affluent , privately educated 47 - year - old already knows this . The research has been circulating within the ECB for months . To his surprise , the last slide proposes a solution : The Hundred , a tournament in which each innings lasts just 100 balls , creating a faster , simpler , more accessible version of the game . \u201c My instantaneous reaction was : I love it , \u201d recalls Harrison when I meet him at the ECB 's offices at Lord 's , the famous London ground that is known as \u201c the home of cricket \u201d . \u201c I absolutely love it . I can actually feel the hairs on my neck just thinking about that moment , that sense of , ' Wow , this is powerful . ' \u201d Then he adds : \u201c Very quickly afterwards [ there was ] a kind of dose of reality . This is n't going to be straightforward . \u201d The Hundred may not sound like a revolution . Last year , the ECB invited an elite group of coaches and players to a two -day workshop to brainstorm innovations , from increasing the size of teams to even , for a few seconds , eliminating the \u201c leg before wicket \u201d rule . Most were not taken up , though some , such as strategic \u201c time-outs \u201d , were . But when it launches in July next year , the game will still feature bat v ball , a duel of willow against leather over 22 yards on a grass pitch . Beneath the surface , though , lies a more subversive design . Millennial audiences have ever-narrowing attention spans , but have ever-greater ways to be entertained . Cricket is not alone in responding to this challenge . The ATP , the body that runs men 's professional tennis , has launched a tournament dedicated to experiments such as using a \u201c shot -clock \u201d to limit the time a player has before serving . In the US , American football , basketball and baseball have all introduced rule changes to speed up the pace of play . The ECB 's plan goes a lot further . It is spending \u00a3 180 m to create new teams featuring the country 's best players , right in the heart of the summer cricket season . English cricket is making an all - in bet on an untested proposition . The sport has accepted the need for speed . This summer will feature The Ashes , a Test series between Australia and England that first took place in 1877 , featuring matches that last up to five days , yet can still end in a draw . But later this month also marks the start of the cricket World Cup in England , where games are crunched into a single day . Last week saw the conclusion of the Indian Premier League , a money -spinning competition launched in 2008 , featuring \u201c Twenty20 \u201d matches that last just a few hours . The Hundred slims cricket down even further . Some argue this is unnecessary and may even harm the game . One top English cricket executive , who declines to be named fearing the wrath of the ECB , says it is like inventing Gaelic football , a game beloved in Ireland , but incomprehensible outside those shores . \u201c To add a fourth format that wo n't be played anywhere else , that has no international relevance , is a real dichotomy for the game , \u201d the executive says . In nondescript offices overlooking the lush , green practice pitches of Lord 's , I meet the team of officials reimagining an ancient game . Over several hours of interviews , they provide the deepest insight yet into the project , though much remains shrouded in secrecy . Their work has led to a fierce debate raging across the game . Is The Hundred a necessary and vital departure , pointing to a brighter future for other sports ? Or an expensive and foolhardy attempt to reach the masses , while alienating cricket 's loyal fan base ? The man who pitched The Hundred to Harrison is a Scot. Sanjay Patel was brought up in the small town of Alloa and played for Scotland 's national cricket team . He spent several years as an executive in the drinks industry before joining the ECB in 2014 . In February , the 46- year - old became managing director of The Hundred , tasked with bringing the new tournament to life . According to Patel , The Hundred is a silver bullet to solve a trio of problems . First , time . Even the shortest form of the game , Twenty 20 matches ( in which each innings lasts 120 balls in total ) , lasts three to four hours , much longer than comparable events , such as a football match . Second , complexity . In cricket 's Byzantine scoring system , newcomers must follow runs scored , overs bowled , wickets taken , among myriad other statistics . Third , perception . Too few outside cricket 's establishment see it as a game for them . The Hundred addresses each of these issues , says Patel . Games will be completed within two and a half hours . And spectators can track a game through a countdown of balls and accumulation of runs . \u201c We felt when cricket was at its best , it was really simple , \u201d he says . \u201c There 's 30 runs required and there 's 15 balls left . That 's when cricket becomes so accessible to a wider audience . \u201d The Hundred 's main method for dealing with the game 's \u201c stale , male , pale \u201d conundrum is to break with almost 130 years of tradition . In English county cricket , competitions feature 18 \u201c first class \u201d counties , representing historic geographic districts around the country \u2014 from Durham in the north to Sussex in the south . Instead , The Hundred will involve eight new city - based franchises in Birmingham , Cardiff , Leeds , Manchester , Nottingham , Southampton and London ( one at the Oval and one at Lord's ) . The ECB says its shift is justified by research , which shows that the growing urbanisation of modern Britain means people now associate more closely with cities than with the \u201c shires \u201d . Still , in order to convince existing counties to accept being swallowed up by metropolises , Harrison , alongside ECB chairman Colin Graves ( one of the few ECB executives not made available for interview ) pledged to give each county \u00a3 1.3 m from the proceeds of the new competition as an incentive to vote in favour of creating it . For most , the cash will be the difference between making a profit or loss . Little is known about the new franchises . A year out from the start of the tournament , teams do not have fixed staff , players , names , branding , jerseys or colours . Rob Caulder , the ECB 's commercial director , another Scot though one with a predilection for management speak , pleads for patience . \u201c We spoke to people inside cities [ to understand ] what were the different aspects of identity in each , \u201d he says . And what did he find ? Caulder stiffens . Only when pushed , does he provide the vaguest of insights . This includes that Mancunians are proud of their city as a home to renowned sports teams and music acts . How such information will be used to guide the creation of new franchises is , for now , anyone 's guess . Last month , ECB officials travelled far from cricket 's heartlands to Nashville , Tennessee . They were there to watch the annual \u201c Draft \u201d for the National Football League , in which 32 NFL franchises select from the best young prospects in American football . The drama is played out live on television , as expectant fans wait to see who will join their side . The trip was a reconnaissance mission . In October , the ECB will hold a player draft for The Hundred . It too will be televised live and act as a coming - out party for the tournament . \u201c It creates a bit of excitement , \u201d says Patel . \u201c A bit of noise . \u201d In the draft , team bosses will select from the 400 professional male cricketers in England and Wales , as well as scores of overseas internationals . Each team in The Hundred will have a squad of 15 players , with three places reserved for prestige foreign signings .

At the top end , these salaries are higher than most cricketers earn for an entire season \u2014 though the very best are paid hundreds of thousands of pounds for participating in India 's IPL tournament . Choosing players in this way represents another break with the county game .

What if he fails to be selected by the Leeds franchise that will play at Yorkshire 's home ground of Headingley ?

The MP , who has become a darling of the rightwing press for his campaign about an establishment cover - up of sexual abuse , has been found to be in serious breach of Commons procedures because he repeatedly failed to register monies on time \u2013 including more than \u00a3 12,000 for excerpts from his book , Smile for the Camera , which appeared in the Daily Mail . While Danczuk was cleared of any intention to conceal the cash and argued that a loss of office staff had meant systems were not in place to register his interests in time , MPs on the parliamentary committee that considers complaints said he would have to report back in October 2015 to prove that he will conform to the procedures of the house . Kathryn Hudson , the parliamentary commissioner for standards , said that while MPs had 28 days to register interests and 15 % of payments for employment for which dates were given were registered late , Danczuk 's behaviour had been unacceptable . Hudson said : \u201c At the time when the complaint was made Mr Danczuk had registered one item in the first seven months of the year . During the course of my inquiries he has registered a further 22 items , 13 of which were late . Mr Danczuk has made six late registrations since I drew this matter to his attention , two of these more than a month late . The total amount of money involved was \u00a3 19,894 . Repeated failures to make timely registrations add up to a serious matter . \u201d Danczuk is one of the most high - profile backbenchers , with regular appearances on television and in the newspapers \u2013 something which has made matters worse . \u201c This situation was then exacerbated by an increase in the number of registrations required as a result of the high profile he has acquired in the last year \u2026 as yet I have no evidence that Mr Danczuk has put in place any administrative system which will ensure that it does not [ continue ] . \u201d She went on to question whether Matt Baker , the MP 's assistant who co-wrote Danczuk 's book , should have also registered payments he received as he had a Commons pass , even though he was in based in the constituency . Hudson said : \u201c The payments have not been registered . I have therefore asked the registrar to inquire whether the staff member had considered registering this payment and to report the outcome to me . \u201d When contacted by the Guardian , Danczuk said he accepted the committee 's verdict . \u201c It was down to poor administration in my office and a change of personnel , \u201d he said . \u201c This meant I did not make timely registration .

The MP , who has become a darling of the rightwing press for his campaign about an establishment cover - up of sexual abuse , has been found to be in serious breach of Commons procedures because he repeatedly failed to register monies on time \u2013 including more than \u00a3 12,000 for excerpts from his book , Smile for the Camera , which appeared in the Daily Mail . While Danczuk was cleared of any intention to conceal the cash and argued that a loss of office staff had meant systems were not in place to register his interests in time , MPs on the parliamentary committee that considers complaints said he would have to report back in October 2015 to prove that he will conform to the procedures of the house . Kathryn Hudson , the parliamentary commissioner for standards , said that while MPs had 28 days to register interests and 15 % of payments for employment for which dates were given were registered late , Danczuk 's behaviour had been unacceptable . Hudson said : \u201c At the time when the complaint was made Mr Danczuk had registered one item in the first seven months of the year . During the course of my inquiries he has registered a further 22 items , 13 of which were late . Mr Danczuk has made six late registrations since I drew this matter to his attention , two of these more than a month late . The total amount of money involved was \u00a3 19,894 . Repeated failures to make timely registrations add up to a serious matter . \u201d Danczuk is one of the most high - profile backbenchers , with regular appearances on television and in the newspapers \u2013 something which has made matters worse . \u201c This situation was then exacerbated by an increase in the number of registrations required as a result of the high profile he has acquired in the last year \u2026 as yet I have no evidence that Mr Danczuk has put in place any administrative system which will ensure that it does not [ continue ] . \u201d She went on to question whether Matt Baker , the MP 's assistant who co-wrote Danczuk 's book , should have also registered payments he received as he had a Commons pass , even though he was in based in the constituency . Hudson said : \u201c The payments have not been registered . I have therefore asked the registrar to inquire whether the staff member had considered registering this payment and to report the outcome to me . \u201d When contacted by the Guardian , Danczuk said he accepted the committee 's verdict . \u201c It was down to poor administration in my office and a change of personnel , \u201d he said . \u201c This meant I did not make timely registration .

Marion said she considered a lot of possible suspects in the years since her son 's death , but she \u201c never , never , never \u201d heard of Turner . Authorities confirmed last month they had found a gun believed to have been used in Wright 's killing in a lake in the Walnut , Mississippi , area . That discovery prompted officials to publicize a $ 21,000 reward for information established in the case years earlier . Wright stood 6 - foot - 11 and was a star player for the University of Memphis . He went on to play for several NBA teams including the Los Angeles Clippers and Memphis Grizzlies . He went through personal and financial setbacks , including a divorce and the foreclosure of two homes . He finished his NBA career in 2009 and was killed at age 34 . Wright had been living in Atlanta and was visiting the Memphis area when he disappeared in July 2010 . Wright 's ex-wife , Sherra Robinson Wright , had told authorities in 2010 that he left her Collierville home at about 10:30 p.m. July 18 with drugs and an unspecified amount of money , according to a Memphis police affidavit . She told authorities that Wright made a phone call to an unknown person and said he was going to flip something for $ 110,000 . He then left in a vehicle driven by an unidentified person shortly after the call , she said . Wright appears to have called 911 from his cellphone from a field near the TPC Southwind golf course minutes after midnight on July 19 , 2010 . His body was found in the area several days later , and authorities have said it was so badly decomposed that it was unclear how many times he was shot . Shell casings from different caliber weapons were found at the crime scene . \u25ba Crime : First unsolved murder in Memphis nearly 100 years old Thousands of people attended Wright 's funeral at FedExForum . Speakers included then - Memphis Mayor A C Wharton . \" He was a young man who never forgot who he was , where he came from , the values that shaped him and the people who encouraged him along the way , \" Wharton said at the time . \" Lorenzen 's story was one of those special Memphis stories where a man is able to transcend his roots even while he represents those roots proudly . \" By December 2010 , hope of a quick resolution to the case had faded . Authorities said that only 22 tips had come in , and Crime Stoppers Executive Director Buddy Chapman said at the time that they were n't substantive . It became one of the highest - profile unsolved killings in the city 's recent history . On West South Street in Collierville , neighbors said Turner stayed there with a relative . They could n't believe that the man they 've known for years has been arrested for murder . \u201c I could n't believe it when I heard it . He seems to be a nice person , \u201d said Terrance Jones as he walked on his way to work past the small blue frame house where Turner stays . It was the same for a group of men who were across the street working on a car . \u201c I do n't believe he did it , \u201d said Walter Jordan , who has known Turner all his life . \u201c l never would believe he did no stuff like that . ... Because he 's a really nice person . He 's helped me whenever I needed it . \u201d Turner helped him when Jordan 's truck stopped running , he said , and Turner helped others in the neighborhood with their cars and with work around their homes , as well . \u201c I do n't think he did it . Somebody framed him probably , \u201d Jordan said . Mose Stokes has known Turner for decades as well and agrees . \u201c He ai n't that kind of person . He 's a good man , \" Stokes said . At a press conference , Rallings gave a reminder about other Memphis cases that are unsolved . \u201c We just want to remind everyone that we need citizens to come forward , \u201d Rallings said . Rallings declined to give information about the relationship between Turner and Wright , or any information about motive . He would also not say if there are other suspects in the Wright case . \u201c We 'll continue and we 'll just go wherever the investigation leads us , \u201d he said . \" We 're just going to sit around for the next couple of weeks and see what happens , \u201d Marion said .

Billy R. Turner , 46 , was charged with first-degree murder . According to a document , he was indicted Tuesday . The Multi Agency Gang Unit saw him leave a house in the 4700 block of Waterfront Oak Drive , get into a vehicle and travel to the Collierville Express Mart on U.S. 72 . He was then arrested and was being held on $ 1 million bond . \u25ba Update : Lorenzen Wright 's ex-wife Sherra arrested in connection with his death \u25ba More : ' Finally Justice for Lorenzen Wright ' : How social media reacted to news of arrest \" The Lorenzen Wright case has stayed in the public eye for many years , \" Memphis police Director Michael Rallings said . \" We said many times that we had never stopped investigating . \" Turner is to be arraigned Thursday in Shelby County Criminal Court Division 7 in Judge Lee Coffee 's court . Deborah Marion , Wright 's mother , expressed relief over Tuesday 's developments , saying authorities confirmed Turner 's arrest shortly before a mid-afternoon news conference . \" I 'm ecstatic . I 'm full of flame , \" Marion said , later adding : \u201c We got the main player . \u201d According to Shelby County court records , Turner has an arrest record dating to 1992 . \u25ba Get more from The Commercial Appeal : On Twitter | On Facebook | Subscribe In August 1992 , Turner pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon . He was sentenced to two years in the Shelby County Correction Center , according to court records . Aimen Alaina says his family has owned the Collierville Express Mart for 15 years and Turner has been a regular customer for as long as he can remember . \u201c I'd say at least five times a week , with no bad habits . No cigarettes , no beer , no lottery tickets , \u201d Alaina said . \u201c We 're always laughing together . He 's a nice guy . \" Alaina was n't at the store Tuesday morning when Turner was apprehended but knew immediately who Turner was after seeing the surveillance video of the arrest . Turner owns a landscape business and usually had a trailer loaded with equipment , he said . \u201c I 'm in disbelief , \" Alaina said . \u25ba More : Lorenzen Wright 's killing and Billy Turner 's arrest : What we know No one answered a phone associated with Turner on Tuesday afternoon . Marion said she considered a lot of possible suspects in the years since her son 's death , but she \u201c never , never , never \u201d heard of Turner . Authorities confirmed last month they had found a gun believed to have been used in Wright 's killing in a lake in the Walnut , Mississippi , area . That discovery prompted officials to publicize a $ 21,000 reward for information established in the case years earlier . Wright stood 6 - foot - 11 and was a star player for the University of Memphis . He went on to play for several NBA teams including the Los Angeles Clippers and Memphis Grizzlies . He went through personal and financial setbacks , including a divorce and the foreclosure of two homes . He finished his NBA career in 2009 and was killed at age 34 . Wright had been living in Atlanta and was visiting the Memphis area when he disappeared in July 2010 . Wright 's ex-wife , Sherra Robinson Wright , had told authorities in 2010 that he left her Collierville home at about 10:30 p.m. July 18 with drugs and an unspecified amount of money , according to a Memphis police affidavit . She told authorities that Wright made a phone call to an unknown person and said he was going to flip something for $ 110,000 . He then left in a vehicle driven by an unidentified person shortly after the call , she said . Wright appears to have called 911 from his cellphone from a field near the TPC Southwind golf course minutes after midnight on July 19 , 2010 . His body was found in the area several days later , and authorities have said it was so badly decomposed that it was unclear how many times he was shot . Shell casings from different caliber weapons were found at the crime scene . \u25ba Crime : First unsolved murder in Memphis nearly 100 years old Thousands of people attended Wright 's funeral at FedExForum . Speakers included then - Memphis Mayor A C Wharton . \" He was a young man who never forgot who he was , where he came from , the values that shaped him and the people who encouraged him along the way , \" Wharton said at the time . \" Lorenzen 's story was one of those special Memphis stories where a man is able to transcend his roots even while he represents those roots proudly . \" By December 2010 , hope of a quick resolution to the case had faded . Authorities said that only 22 tips had come in , and Crime Stoppers Executive Director Buddy Chapman said at the time that they were n't substantive . It became one of the highest - profile unsolved killings in the city 's recent history . On West South Street in Collierville , neighbors said Turner stayed there with a relative . They could n't believe that the man they 've known for years has been arrested for murder . \u201c I could n't believe it when I heard it . He seems to be a nice person , \u201d said Terrance Jones as he walked on his way to work past the small blue frame house where Turner stays . It was the same for a group of men who were across the street working on a car . \u201c I do n't believe he did it , \u201d said Walter Jordan , who has known Turner all his life . \u201c l never would believe he did no stuff like that . ... Because he 's a really nice person . He 's helped me whenever I needed it . \u201d Turner helped him when Jordan 's truck stopped running , he said , and Turner helped others in the neighborhood with their cars and with work around their homes , as well . \u201c I do n't think he did it . Somebody framed him probably , \u201d Jordan said . Mose Stokes has known Turner for decades as well and agrees . \u201c He ai n't that kind of person . He 's a good man , \" Stokes said . At a press conference , Rallings gave a reminder about other Memphis cases that are unsolved . \u201c We just want to remind everyone that we need citizens to come forward , \u201d Rallings said . Rallings declined to give information about the relationship between Turner and Wright , or any information about motive . He would also not say if there are other suspects in the Wright case . \u201c We 'll continue and we 'll just go wherever the investigation leads us , \u201d he said . \" We 're just going to sit around for the next couple of weeks and see what happens , \u201d Marion said .

Proceedings from a panel of Jamestown 's 2008 December terrorism conference entitled The Expanding Geography of Militant Jihad . The Who 's Who of the Somali Insurgency is an essential reference guide to the disparate forces and individuals seeking to split , conquer or unify this long troubled nation in the strategic Horn of Africa region . Militants operating in Pakistans North - West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) include both Taliban and non-Taliban forces . However , the Taliban militants are much larger in number and have a lot more influence in the region . The Pakistani Taliban have close links with the Afghan Taliban and operate on both sides of the Pakistan - Afghanistan border , also known as the Durand Line after the British diplomat who demarcated the boundary in 1893 , Sir Mortimer Durand . The non- Taliban militants , on the other hand , are often pro-government and enjoy cordial ties with the Pakistan authorities and security forces . The Tehrik- i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) of North and South Waziristan Most of the Pakistani Taliban militants are grouped in an umbrella organization , the Tehrik - i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) . The movement was launched on December 13 , 2007 , in a secret meeting of senior Taliban commanders hailing from the South Waziristan , North Waziristan , Orakzai , Kurram , Khyber , Mohmand , Bajaur and Darra Adamkhel tribal regions and the districts of Swat , Buner , Upper Dir , Lower Dir , Bannu , Lakki Marwat , Tank , Peshawar , Dera Ismail Khan , Mardan and Kohat ( The News International [ Islamabad ] , December 15 , 2007 ) . According to TTP deputy leader Maulana Faqir Mohammad and other senior commanders , the militants formed the organization to pool the resources and manpower of Pakistans Taliban to fight in self - defense if the security forces of Pakistan attacked their areas and also to extend help to the Afghan Taliban taking part in the jihad , or holy war , against U.S. and International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) troops in neighboring Afghanistan ( Newsline.com.pk [ Karachi ] , July 2008 ; The News International , July 29 , 2007 ) . Due to the military operations undertaken by Pakistans armed forces against them , the Pakistani Taliban now have a fight at home and are therefore unable to send many fighters to Afghanistan to fight alongside the Afghan Taliban . The TTP is headed by Baitullah Mahsud , based in South Waziristan and currently the most powerful Pakistani Taliban commander . In his late 30s , Mahsud is referred to as the Amir Sahib by his followers . Like many other Pakistanis , he began fighting as a young man during the Afghan jihad against the Soviet occupation force in Afghanistan and later joined the Afghan Taliban . Presently , he is stated to be ill , suffering from kidney and heart diseases due to complications arising from diabetes . He reportedly named three of his commanders to run the TTP on his behalf , including Waliur Rahman who has been negotiating with the tribal jirgas , or councils , created by the Pakistan government ( The News International , August 24 ) . The TTP is not a disciplined organization as two fairly recent events showed . First was the refusal of some components of the TTP to accept Hafiz Gul Bahadur , the Pakistani Taliban commander from North Waziristan , as deputy leader of the Baitullah Mahsud - led organization . Later in the winter of 2007 - 2008 , Hafiz Gul Bahadur did not cooperate with Baitullah Mahsud when the latter was under attack from Pakistan Army . In fact , Bahadur warned Baitullah Mahsud against firing rockets at Pakistani forces camps in Razmak , which is located in North Waziristan . His plea was that he and his followers had signed a peace accord with Pakistan government in North Waziristan and therefore no action should be taken against the Pakistani security forces there as it would amount to violation of the agreement ( see Terrorism Monitor , February 7 ) . In simple terms , he refused to become involved in the fighting that was then taking place between Baitullah Mahsuds Taliban and Pakistan Army in neighboring South Waziristan ( Newsline.com.pk , July 2008 ) Opposition to Baitullah Mahsud Hafiz Gul Bahadur is now head of an emerging group of Pakistani Taliban commanders opposed to Baitullah Mahsud . The yet - to - be-named group also includes Maulvi Nazeer , the Taliban commander for Wana area in South Waziristan , and Haji Namdar Khan , the head of the Amr Bil Maruf Wa Nahi Anil Munkar ( Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice ) group of militants operating in the Bara area of Khyber Agency . Namdar Khan was recently killed in Bara by a young man who was allegedly sent by Baitullah Mahsuds group to eliminate him ( The Nation [ Islamabad ] , August 14 ) . This was the second attempt on his life . The earlier attack was a suicide bombing targeting him some months ago , but he survived . Several of his men along with seminary students were killed in the earlier attack which took place inside an Islamic school in Bara . In the second instance of TTP indiscipline , the TTP failed to take action against the Pakistani Taliban commander Omar Khalid ( whose real name is Abdul Wali ) , in Mohmand Agency even though Baitullah Mahsud had sent a commission to investigate charges against him . In fact , TTP spokesman Maulvi Omar had publicly stated that Omar Khalid would be punished for attacking a rival group of Islamic fighters that had a training camp in Mohmand Agency . Omar Khalids men killed the groups commander Shah Khalid and his deputy Obaidullah , along with several other fighters and captured more than 70 ( Dawn [ Karachi ] , July 20 ) . The detained men , all belonging to the so-called Shah group affiliated with the Salafi Ahle - Hadith sect , were subsequently freed through the intervention of a jirga of religious scholars , including Maulana Sher Ali Shah , an Islamic teacher at the Darul Uloom Haqqani seminary in Akora Khattak near Peshawar . In the end , Baitullah Mahsud and the TTP just kept quiet and took no action against Omar Khalid as this would have created disharmony in the organization and possibly even caused a parting of ways between it and its chapter in Mohmand Agency . South Waziristan While discussing the leading figures of the ongoing insurgency in the NWFP , it would be worthwhile to start in South Waziristan , where the Pakistan Army began its military operations in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) in early 2004 and suffered heavy casualties in fierce clashes in Kalosha near the regional headquarters at Wana . The Wana region is inhabited by the Ahmadzai Wazir tribe , which has historically been a foe of the neighboring Mahsud tribe to which Baitullah Mahsud belongs . Both Ahmadzai Wazirs and Mahsuds are Pashtun , the ethnic group to which the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban belong , but they have long been traditional rivals in South Waziristan and competed with each other for political and economic power . Baitullah Mahsud was an obscure Taliban commander in 2004 when Nek Mohammad from the Ahmadzai Wazir tribe in Wana was occupying the media limelight . The 27 - year old Pakistani Taliban commander had fought the Pakistan Army to a standstill and forced it to conclude a peace accord with him largely on his terms . The signing ceremony was held in one of his strongholds , Shakai , near Wana , where the Pakistan Armys Corps Commander for Peshawar , Lieutenant - General Safdar Hussain , publicly embraced and garlanded Nek Mohammad and hailed him as a partner in peace . Subsequently in February 2005 when the government signed a similar peace agreement with Baitullah Mahsud in Sararogha in South Waziristan , the same army general described Baitullah as a soldier of peace ( The News International , February 10 , 2005 ) . Commander Nek Mohammad was killed in April 2004 in a US missile strike on his hideout in a village near Wana . His death not only led to the collapse of the peace accord he had signed with the government but also resulted in a rift among his Taliban followers in Wana on the issue of his succession . Haji Mohammad Omar declared himself the new head of the Taliban in Wana but certain other commanders declined to accept his decision . Eventually , a five-member Shura , or council , emerged to jointly led the Wana Taliban . The Shura included Haji Omar , his brother Haji Sharif Khan , Javed Karmazkhel , Maulana Abdul Aziz and Maulana Mohammad Abbas . The Pakistan government subsequently made a peace deal with this Shura , sometimes called the Wana 5 , and allowed it to form a so-called peace committee that was given an administrative role to man roadside checkpoints and provide security to the people . Conflict with the Uzbeks In 2007 , serious differences emerged among the Pakistani Taliban in Wana over the presence of foreign militants belonging to Uzbekistan in the area . A majority of Taliban and Ahmadzai Wazir tribesmen decided to evict the Uzbek militants , led by Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan ( IMU ) head Tahir Yuldashev , from Wana and Shakai . Backed by the Pakistan government and military with arms and money , they fought the Uzbeks and their tribal supporters and finally succeeded in expelling them from Wana . A young Taliban commander , Maulvi Nazeer , led this campaign along with his two deputies Malik Abdul Hannan and Maulvi Mohammad Iqbal . Hannan was allegedly killed in July 2008 by pro-Uzbek tribesmen commanded by Noor Islam , who is the brother of Haji Omar and Haji Sharif ( of the Wana 5 ) , while Maulvi Iqbal died fighting alongside the Afghan Taliban in Afghanistans Paktika province in June 2008 . Apart from Noor Islam , other pro-Uzbek commanders of the Pakistani Taliban from Wana include Haji Omar , Javed Karmazkhel , Maulana Abdul Aziz and Maulana Mohammad Abbas . They had to take refuge with Baitullah Mahsud in the area populated by the Mahsud tribe in South Waziristan after being evicted along with the Uzbek militants . In recent months , the pro-Uzbek tribal fighters of this group have indulged in targeted killings of men belonging to Maulvi Nazeers group ( Newsline.com.pk , July 2008 ) As mentioned earlier , Baitullah Mahsud is the most powerful and dangerous Pakistani Taliban commander . He was accused of involvement in the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in December 2007 and blamed for sending fighters to Afghanistan to fight US - led coalition forces . He denied his involvement in Benazir Bhuttos murder but conceded on more than one occasion that he was indeed sending his men to wage jihad against U.S. , NATO and Afghan government forces in Afghanistan ( Newsline.com.pk , July 2008 ) . Other Taliban commanders working under him include Waliur Rahman , who could succeed him in case of his death , and Qari Hussain , known for his strong anti-Shia views and also for training suicide bombers and sending them on their fatal mission . There were reports that Qari Hussain was killed in an airstrike earlier this year , but he appears to have survived ( Daily Times [ Lahore ] , January 27 ) . In North Waziristan , the most important Pakistani Taliban commander is Hafiz Gul Bahadur , who is also Amir ( commander ) of the Taliban shura there . He is now opposed to Baitullah Mahsud and has been trying to build a rival alliance of pro-government Pakistani Taliban without any appreciable success ( see Terrorism Monitor , July 25 ) . Two clerics who wield considerable influence on the Taliban in North Waziristan are Maulana Sadiq Noor and Maulana Abdul Khaliq . ( Newsline.com.pk , July 2008 ) Other clerics affiliated to Pakistani parliamentarian Maulana Fazlur Rahmans Jamiat Ulema -i-Islam - F ( Assembly of Islamic Clergy JUI - F ) also appear to have some influence on the Taliban operating in North Waziristan .

The Wana region is inhabited by the Ahmadzai Wazir tribe , which has historically been a foe of the neighboring Mahsud tribe to which Baitullah Mahsud belongs . Both Ahmadzai Wazirs and Mahsuds are Pashtun , the ethnic group to which the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban belong , but they have long been traditional rivals in South Waziristan and competed with each other for political and economic power . Baitullah Mahsud was an obscure Taliban commander in 2004 when Nek Mohammad from the Ahmadzai Wazir tribe in Wana was occupying the media limelight . The 27 - year old Pakistani Taliban commander had fought the Pakistan Army to a standstill and forced it to conclude a peace accord with him largely on his terms . The signing ceremony was held in one of his strongholds , Shakai , near Wana , where the Pakistan Armys Corps Commander for Peshawar , Lieutenant - General Safdar Hussain , publicly embraced and garlanded Nek Mohammad and hailed him as a partner in peace . Subsequently in February 2005 when the government signed a similar peace agreement with Baitullah Mahsud in Sararogha in South Waziristan , the same army general described Baitullah as a soldier of peace ( The News International , February 10 , 2005 ) . Commander Nek Mohammad was killed in April 2004 in a US missile strike on his hideout in a village near Wana . His death not only led to the collapse of the peace accord he had signed with the government but also resulted in a rift among his Taliban followers in Wana on the issue of his succession . Haji Mohammad Omar declared himself the new head of the Taliban in Wana but certain other commanders declined to accept his decision . Eventually , a five-member Shura , or council , emerged to jointly led the Wana Taliban . The Shura included Haji Omar , his brother Haji Sharif Khan , Javed Karmazkhel , Maulana Abdul Aziz and Maulana Mohammad Abbas . The Pakistan government subsequently made a peace deal with this Shura , sometimes called the Wana 5 , and allowed it to form a so-called peace committee that was given an administrative role to man roadside checkpoints and provide security to the people . Conflict with the Uzbeks In 2007 , serious differences emerged among the Pakistani Taliban in Wana over the presence of foreign militants belonging to Uzbekistan in the area . A majority of Taliban and Ahmadzai Wazir tribesmen decided to evict the Uzbek militants , led by Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan ( IMU ) head Tahir Yuldashev , from Wana and Shakai . Backed by the Pakistan government and military with arms and money , they fought the Uzbeks and their tribal supporters and finally succeeded in expelling them from Wana . A young Taliban commander , Maulvi Nazeer , led this campaign along with his two deputies Malik Abdul Hannan and Maulvi Mohammad Iqbal . Hannan was allegedly killed in July 2008 by pro-Uzbek tribesmen commanded by Noor Islam , who is the brother of Haji Omar and Haji Sharif ( of the Wana 5 ) , while Maulvi Iqbal died fighting alongside the Afghan Taliban in Afghanistans Paktika province in June 2008 . Apart from Noor Islam , other pro-Uzbek commanders of the Pakistani Taliban from Wana include Haji Omar , Javed Karmazkhel , Maulana Abdul Aziz and Maulana Mohammad Abbas . They had to take refuge with Baitullah Mahsud in the area populated by the Mahsud tribe in South Waziristan after being evicted along with the Uzbek militants . In recent months , the pro-Uzbek tribal fighters of this group have indulged in targeted killings of men belonging to Maulvi Nazeers group ( Newsline.com.pk , July 2008 ) As mentioned earlier , Baitullah Mahsud is the most powerful and dangerous Pakistani Taliban commander . He was accused of involvement in the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in December 2007 and blamed for sending fighters to Afghanistan to fight US - led coalition forces . He denied his involvement in Benazir Bhuttos murder but conceded on more than one occasion that he was indeed sending his men to wage jihad against U.S. , NATO and Afghan government forces in Afghanistan ( Newsline.com.pk , July 2008 ) . Other Taliban commanders working under him include Waliur Rahman , who could succeed him in case of his death , and Qari Hussain , known for his strong anti-Shia views and also for training suicide bombers and sending them on their fatal mission . There were reports that Qari Hussain was killed in an airstrike earlier this year , but he appears to have survived ( Daily Times [ Lahore ] , January 27 ) . In North Waziristan , the most important Pakistani Taliban commander is Hafiz Gul Bahadur , who is also Amir ( commander ) of the Taliban shura there . He is now opposed to Baitullah Mahsud and has been trying to build a rival alliance of pro-government Pakistani Taliban without any appreciable success ( see Terrorism Monitor , July 25 ) . Two clerics who wield considerable influence on the Taliban in North Waziristan are Maulana Sadiq Noor and Maulana Abdul Khaliq . ( Newsline.com.pk , July 2008 ) Other clerics affiliated to Pakistani parliamentarian Maulana Fazlur Rahmans Jamiat Ulema -i-Islam - F ( Assembly of Islamic Clergy JUI - F ) also appear to have some influence on the Taliban operating in North Waziristan .

Many seem to have been used infrequently and may have been seasonal meeting places and food stores rather than permanently inhabited settlements . Originating in the later Bronze Age ( 1000 BC - 800 BC ) , the hill forts of the early Iron Age are found over a wide area of the British Isles : in Scotland ( Finavon Fort in Angus ) , Wales ( The Brieddin and Moel y Gaer in Powys ) and England ( Grimthorpe in Yorkshire , Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire and Bathampton Down in Somerset ) . Many seem to have been used infrequently and may have been seasonal meeting places and food stores rather than permanently inhabited settlements . Iron objects dating from the sixth or even seventh century BC are known from England , Scotland and Wales , but the widespread adoption of iron only became common during the fourth century BC . The skill of Iron Age blacksmiths is demonstrated by the range of tools and weapons recovered from the excavation of sites such as Danebury in Hampshire and Llyn Cerig Bach on Anglesey , North Wales . These include saws , chisels and other carpentry tools very similar in form to modern ones . Throughout the Iron Age there is evidence for extensive networks of fields associated with small farming settlements . A mixed farming economy is suggested by cattle , sheep and pig remains and the processing of cereals including wheat , barley and oats . Improved cereal crops and breeds of domestic animal were developed and introduced during the Iron Age . The best surviving areas of Iron Age farming can be seen on Salisbury Plain , the Marlborough Downs , the Cheviot Hills and other upland areas . By the fourth century BC , many parts of Britain were dominated by hill forts . In some areas , such as central southern England and the Welsh borders , they were very large with complex earthworks and entrances ( Maiden Castle in Dorset ) . There are significant examples in north Wales , the Borders and eastern regions of Scotland and in Northern Ireland ( parts of the Navan complex ) . Many of these sites supported sizeable populations and acted as service centres for a growing rural population . The earliest ' brochs ' date from 500 - 200 BC , and many were still occupied into the first millennium AD . They were built using two concentric , dry-stone walls to create a hollow tower . Between the walls were galleries and stairways leading to upper levels . Wooden upper floors probably provided the main living space , with the ground floor used as a secure store for livestock . Brochs are mainly located in northern and western Scotland , Orkney and Shetland , with the best example at Mousa on Shetland . Pytheas of Massilia ( now Marseilles ) , a Greek merchant and explorer , circumnavigated the British Isles between about 330 and 320 BC and produced the first written record of the islands . He described the inhabitants as skilled wheat farmers , usually peaceable , but formidable in war when they used horse- drawn chariots . He also described the Cornish trade in tin with the Mediterranean . Built on large timber platforms , these settlements were set on the edge of a now vanished area of marsh and open water . Excavation has recovered thousands of wooden and other organic artefacts that rarely survive from dry-land settlements , and which provide greater insight into the skills of Iron Age woodworkers . In Northern Ireland , Scotland and Wales , smaller lakeside settlements called ' crannogs ' are known . Many of these survived into the Roman period and later . The later Iron Age saw the creation of superb bronze and gold objects . Many of these items were deliberately buried or placed in rivers and lakes , probably as religious offerings . Finds from the Thames include the Battersea Shield and the Waterloo Helmet . In eastern England a number of hoards of gold ' torcs ' ( neck -rings ) are known , most notably from Ipswich and Snettisham in Norfolk . There have also been significant later Iron Age finds in Scotland and north Wales . The first coins found in Britain were gold and minted in France . Around 80 - 60 BC , production started in Britain and by 20 BC silver and bronze were used in south east England . Coins began to bear the names of rulers , some titled ' Rex ' ( Latin for king ) and some naming the place they were minted , such as Camulodunum ( Colchester ) . These inscriptions suggest a growing level of literacy and familiarity with Latin . No Iron Age coins were produced in northern England , Wales , Scotland or Ireland . After conquering Gaul ( modern France and Belgium ) , Julius Caesar crossed the Channel with two legions - about 10,000 men - probably to carry out reconnaissance and send a warning to the British allies of Gaulish tribes . Local tribes contested his landing on the beach at Deal near Dover , but their war chariots were driven back and they subsequently sought a truce . Caesar returned to the continent for the winter after bad weather damaged his fleet and prevented cavalry reinforcements arriving . Julius Caesar invaded Britain for the second time with five legions - about 25,000 men - and won a series of battles before his fleet at Deal was once again wrecked by storms . This delay allowed the British to regroup under Cassivellaunus , ruler of the Catuvellauni tribe . He waged an effective guerrilla war before his betrayal by rival tribes handed Caesar victory . An impending rebellion in Gaul forced him to withdraw , never to return , but Britain was now within Rome 's sphere of influence . Commius , ruler of the Gaulish Atrebates tribe , fled Gaul and became king of the Atrebates tribe of south - central England , with a capital at Silchester ( near Reading ) . There he issued his own coinage , the earliest examples dating from 30BC . Commius was a former ally of Rome and had accompanied Julius Caesar on both of his expeditions to Britain . He joined the Gaulish revolt under Vercingetorix in 52 AD and fled Gaul after a second failed revolt the following year . The settlements known as ' oppida ' ( from Latin , meaning an administrative centre ) were usually very large sites , sometimes defined by rivers or long ditches and banks . Many are associated with centres of tribal power , trade with the Roman world and rich burials . Examples include Colchester , St Albans and Silchester in southern England . By the time of the Roman invasion , they could be found as far north as Stanwick in Yorkshire . No oppida are known in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland . Having defeated the last of his civil war rivals in 31BC , Augustus looked to set secure borders for Rome 's empire . Plans were drawn up for an invasion of Britain , but they came to nothing . In his political testament ' Res Gestae ' , Augustus counts among his deeds that he received supplications from two British kings , Dumnobellaunus and Tincommius . Relations between Rome and Britain remained good for the next two generations , with evidence that Rome had a healthy trade with the Britons . Limited trade in Roman goods such as wine had been underway since about 120 BC . From 20 BC this trade intensified with sites such as Colchester , St Albans and Silchester receiving large quantities of imported pottery , wine and metalwork . Britain was exporting too , including slaves , grain , hunting dogs and precious metals . It is possible that some of the tribes in the south east developed diplomatic links with the early Roman empire of Augustus and his immediate successors . Cunobelinus ( William Shakespeare 's ' Cymbeline ' ) , ruled the Catuvellauni for about 30 years and conquered a huge territory . His name appears on coins issued at Colchester and St Albans and he is described by the Roman historian Suetonius as ' Britannorum rex ' - king of the Britons . His core territory was Hertfordshire , but he eventually controlled much of East Anglia and the south east . A succession struggle erupted around the throne of the ailing Cunobelinus , king of the powerful Catuvellauni tribe . Adminius , the king 's younger son , was exiled and fled to the court of the Roman emperor , Caligula . His elder brothers , Caratacus and Togodumnus , were left in control of the extensive tribal territories stretching over much of East Anglia and the south east of England . Emperor Caligula ( ruled 37 to 41AD ) planned an invasion of Britain in 40 AD , but he was so much reviled for his megalomania that objective facts about the campaign are hard to discern . It seems likely , however , that he wanted the prestige of conquering Britain - of succeeding where Julius Caesar failed . But the army refused and the invasion was abandoned . Instead , troops were ordered to collect seashells as ' spoils taken from Neptune ' - a favourite illustration of Caligula 's ' madness ' . After the death of Cunobelinus , king of the Catuvellauni , his ambitious sons and successors Caratacus and Togodumnus expanded into the territory of their tribal neighbours . Verica , king of the Atrebates , was driven out of south - central Britain and eventually fled to Rome . As a ' client king ' of Rome , he sought the support of the emperor Claudius in a bid to reclaim his throne . This served as the pretext for the Roman invasion of Britain the following year .

Lyles , Alfred Allan Lewis , Jeanine Basinger , Anthony Slide , Emily Leider , David Gasten , Scott Eyman Narrated by Cyndi Williams Produced by Heidi Hutter / Bright Shining City Productions Running time : 89 minutes About the Documentary The legendary film star Pola Negri makes her triumphant return to screen in Life is a Dream in Cinema , a feature - length documentary examining the Life and work of the celebrated actress . The poster in the DVD / poster package that features the Life is a Dream in Cinema DVD . Pola Negri 's place in cinema history cannot be underestimated , as she was the beginning of many firsts in the movies . This list of accomplishments includes popularizing European films in the United States , opening the way for international film artists in Hollywood , popularizing fashions that are with us to this day , and broadening the expression of sex on the screen . She is also remembered for her off - screen love affairs with Charlie Chaplin and Rudolph Valentino and , in fact , was Valentino 's lover at the time of this premature death in 1926 . Life is a Dream in Cinema : Pola Negri brings the story of this great actress back to Life with clips of her films , photographs of the star from throughout her Life , recollections of the people who knew her , and interviews with people who have made a study of her Life and times . The film made its screen debut in 2006 , and has been shown in prestigious venues such as La Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art ( MoMA ) in New York . Actors Hayley Mills and Eli Wallach , both well - known film stars in their own right , performed with Pola in The Moon-spinners ( 1964 ) , her final film , and appear in the documentary . Many other experts in their fields shared a wealth of knowledge and insights about Pola , including : Professor Jeanine Basinger , author of Silent Stars ; A.C. Lyles , producer for Paramount Pictures ; Alfred Allan Lewis , ghostwriter of Memoirs of a Star , Pola 's autobiography ; Emily Leider , author of Rudolph Valentino biography Dark Lover ; Anthony Slide , film historian ; David Gasten , webmaster of The Pola Negri Appreciation Site ; and Scott Eyman , author of Ernst Lubitsch : Laughter in Paradise . Review of Life is a Dream in Cinema documentary by David Gasten After four years of festival screenings , including high - profile appearances at La Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art in New York , Pola Negri 's own documentary , Life is a Dream in Cinema has finally made it to DVD as part of a DVD / poster package ! The wait has been long , but it has been worth it . Life is a Dream in Cinema is lovingly produced and directed by independent film director Mariusz Kotowski . Kotowski began his career as a dancer and dance choreographer before transitioning into directing movies . Kotowski 's award - winning films like Esther 's Diary and Deeper and Deeper have progressively earned him respect because their portrayals are decidedly atypical of the standard Hollywood or indie fare , and cleverly mix different film approaches into a cohesive whole . Life is a Dream in Cinema is a fitting opener for a rare director who truly is following in the footsteps of the classic- era stars and directors he idolizes , and creating a recognizably unique body of work in a era when when it seems as though everything has already been done . Life is a Dream in Cinema opens with narrator Cyndi Williams recalling the magic of classic era movie stars , as portraits of these stars flash on the screen . The portraits then move to the silent era , and then zero in on Pola the Star . Pola 's role as a star remains the theme throughout the movie . As the movie rolls on , Pola 's star becomes more personal and loveable , but remains larger - than - Life as it always was . She is a star , but a star that you can reach out and touch with your hand - and a star you can fall in love with . Life is a Dream in Cinema takes the role of a black - and - white movie that dissolves into color from time to time before returning to its black - and - white home base . There is even a filmed Tango scene in which three tangoing couples dancing to Pola 's \u201c Tango Notturno \u201d ( the title track of one of her German talkie movies ) remains in black and white in keeping with the rest of the movie . Life is a Dream in Cinema also features black and white clips from a number of Pola Negri 's movies . Even though the source material of these prints varies in quality and a great number of them are not as strong as they could be , they still convey Pola 's adorably human and yet larger - than - Life presence regardless of the source quality of the material . Probably one of the best findings presented in Life is a Dream in Cinema is Pola 's correct birth date , which had been debated and uncertain for many years . Director Kotowski was born and raised in Poland , and currently lives in the United States . He used his familiarity with both cultures to his advantage by researching Polish language sources in Warsaw and Pola 's birth city of Lipno in Poland . This led him to uncovering Pola Negri's Polish birth certificate , which is shown in the documentary and reveals a birth date of January 3 , 1897 . The initial belief was that she may have been born on December 31 of 1894 or 1897 , and even we at Polanegri.com had reported the incorrect 1894 date . Life is a Dream in Cinema settles the date once and for all , eliminating the need for any further debate on the subject . In addition to a look at Pola 's birth certificate , we get to see her parents ' marriage certificate , the Imperial Ballet academy in Poland where Pola studied dance and acting , and the places where Pola lived and stayed throughout her Life . The two dramatic portions of the film , the tango and the rose petal sequences , are shot in an exquisite way that recalls the glamour of the classic era of movie making . The \u201c rose petal story \u201d from Pola 's affair with Rudolph Valentino that Pola tells in her autobiography Memoirs of a Star ( 1970 ) is one of the most remembered stories from that book . When film historian William K. Everson wrote his original review of the book for the New York Times in 1970 , he mentioned , \u201c Valentino may \u2026 strew their bed with [ rose ] blossoms\u2013but Miss Negri maintains a discreet slow- fade- out - slow - fade - in device in describing their nights of bliss . \u201d Life is a Dream in Cinema recreates the visual of the rose petals on the bed , with Memoirs of a Star 's ghostwriter retelling the story . Like the book , the movie 's recreation also lets the viewer 's mind fill in the details . The biggest upside of the movie is the extensive recollections of the legendary actors Hayley Mills and Eli Wallach , who both appeared with Pola in the 1964 Disney movie The Moon-Spinners . Pola 's scene-stealing appearance in that movie was filmed over the course of two weeks in London , and both actors appeared with Pola in that final onscreen appearance . Although the two actors ' experience with Pola was brief , the strength of Pola 's star seemed to even dwarf their own stars , and the experience of working with Pola left an indelible impression on both of them . This documentary is the only place you will get to hear them retell that fascinating story , which alone makes the documentary worth the purchase price . Pola 's legacy has fallen into incredibly good hands with Mariusz Kotowski and the Life is a Dream in Cinema documentary . When Kotowski was working on the documentary , he told me that he felt almost as if Pola were keeping him accountable from beyond the grave to treat her legacy well . His love for Pola has guided him in presenting a documentary that openly adores and respects Pola as an actress and as a lady . Kotowski does not deify Pola , nor does he revel in scandal - mongering \u201c you ca n't libel the dead \u201d deconstructionism . Life is a Dream in Cinema works not only as a great crash course for learning about the great actress , but also place where you can get to know Pola and fall in love with her yourself .

Lyles , Alfred Allan Lewis , Jeanine Basinger , Anthony Slide , Emily Leider , David Gasten , Scott Eyman Narrated by Cyndi Williams Produced by Heidi Hutter / Bright Shining City Productions Running time : 89 minutes About the Documentary The legendary film star Pola Negri makes her triumphant return to screen in Life is a Dream in Cinema , a feature - length documentary examining the Life and work of the celebrated actress . The poster in the DVD / poster package that features the Life is a Dream in Cinema DVD . Pola Negri 's place in cinema history cannot be underestimated , as she was the beginning of many firsts in the movies . This list of accomplishments includes popularizing European films in the United States , opening the way for international film artists in Hollywood , popularizing fashions that are with us to this day , and broadening the expression of sex on the screen . She is also remembered for her off - screen love affairs with Charlie Chaplin and Rudolph Valentino and , in fact , was Valentino 's lover at the time of this premature death in 1926 . Life is a Dream in Cinema : Pola Negri brings the story of this great actress back to Life with clips of her films , photographs of the star from throughout her Life , recollections of the people who knew her , and interviews with people who have made a study of her Life and times . The film made its screen debut in 2006 , and has been shown in prestigious venues such as La Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art ( MoMA ) in New York . Actors Hayley Mills and Eli Wallach , both well - known film stars in their own right , performed with Pola in The Moon-spinners ( 1964 ) , her final film , and appear in the documentary . Many other experts in their fields shared a wealth of knowledge and insights about Pola , including : Professor Jeanine Basinger , author of Silent Stars ; A.C. Lyles , producer for Paramount Pictures ; Alfred Allan Lewis , ghostwriter of Memoirs of a Star , Pola 's autobiography ; Emily Leider , author of Rudolph Valentino biography Dark Lover ; Anthony Slide , film historian ; David Gasten , webmaster of The Pola Negri Appreciation Site ; and Scott Eyman , author of Ernst Lubitsch : Laughter in Paradise . Review of Life is a Dream in Cinema documentary by David Gasten After four years of festival screenings , including high - profile appearances at La Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art in New York , Pola Negri 's own documentary , Life is a Dream in Cinema has finally made it to DVD as part of a DVD / poster package ! The wait has been long , but it has been worth it . Life is a Dream in Cinema is lovingly produced and directed by independent film director Mariusz Kotowski . Kotowski began his career as a dancer and dance choreographer before transitioning into directing movies . Kotowski 's award - winning films like Esther 's Diary and Deeper and Deeper have progressively earned him respect because their portrayals are decidedly atypical of the standard Hollywood or indie fare , and cleverly mix different film approaches into a cohesive whole . Life is a Dream in Cinema is a fitting opener for a rare director who truly is following in the footsteps of the classic- era stars and directors he idolizes , and creating a recognizably unique body of work in a era when when it seems as though everything has already been done . Life is a Dream in Cinema opens with narrator Cyndi Williams recalling the magic of classic era movie stars , as portraits of these stars flash on the screen . The portraits then move to the silent era , and then zero in on Pola the Star . Pola 's role as a star remains the theme throughout the movie . As the movie rolls on , Pola 's star becomes more personal and loveable , but remains larger - than - Life as it always was . She is a star , but a star that you can reach out and touch with your hand - and a star you can fall in love with . Life is a Dream in Cinema takes the role of a black - and - white movie that dissolves into color from time to time before returning to its black - and - white home base . There is even a filmed Tango scene in which three tangoing couples dancing to Pola 's \u201c Tango Notturno \u201d ( the title track of one of her German talkie movies ) remains in black and white in keeping with the rest of the movie . Life is a Dream in Cinema also features black and white clips from a number of Pola Negri 's movies . Even though the source material of these prints varies in quality and a great number of them are not as strong as they could be , they still convey Pola 's adorably human and yet larger - than - Life presence regardless of the source quality of the material . Probably one of the best findings presented in Life is a Dream in Cinema is Pola 's correct birth date , which had been debated and uncertain for many years . Director Kotowski was born and raised in Poland , and currently lives in the United States . He used his familiarity with both cultures to his advantage by researching Polish language sources in Warsaw and Pola 's birth city of Lipno in Poland . This led him to uncovering Pola Negri's Polish birth certificate , which is shown in the documentary and reveals a birth date of January 3 , 1897 . The initial belief was that she may have been born on December 31 of 1894 or 1897 , and even we at Polanegri.com had reported the incorrect 1894 date . Life is a Dream in Cinema settles the date once and for all , eliminating the need for any further debate on the subject . In addition to a look at Pola 's birth certificate , we get to see her parents ' marriage certificate , the Imperial Ballet academy in Poland where Pola studied dance and acting , and the places where Pola lived and stayed throughout her Life . The two dramatic portions of the film , the tango and the rose petal sequences , are shot in an exquisite way that recalls the glamour of the classic era of movie making . The \u201c rose petal story \u201d from Pola 's affair with Rudolph Valentino that Pola tells in her autobiography Memoirs of a Star ( 1970 ) is one of the most remembered stories from that book . When film historian William K. Everson wrote his original review of the book for the New York Times in 1970 , he mentioned , \u201c Valentino may \u2026 strew their bed with [ rose ] blossoms\u2013but Miss Negri maintains a discreet slow- fade- out - slow - fade - in device in describing their nights of bliss . \u201d Life is a Dream in Cinema recreates the visual of the rose petals on the bed , with Memoirs of a Star 's ghostwriter retelling the story . Like the book , the movie 's recreation also lets the viewer 's mind fill in the details . The biggest upside of the movie is the extensive recollections of the legendary actors Hayley Mills and Eli Wallach , who both appeared with Pola in the 1964 Disney movie The Moon-Spinners . Pola 's scene-stealing appearance in that movie was filmed over the course of two weeks in London , and both actors appeared with Pola in that final onscreen appearance . Although the two actors ' experience with Pola was brief , the strength of Pola 's star seemed to even dwarf their own stars , and the experience of working with Pola left an indelible impression on both of them . This documentary is the only place you will get to hear them retell that fascinating story , which alone makes the documentary worth the purchase price . Pola 's legacy has fallen into incredibly good hands with Mariusz Kotowski and the Life is a Dream in Cinema documentary . When Kotowski was working on the documentary , he told me that he felt almost as if Pola were keeping him accountable from beyond the grave to treat her legacy well . His love for Pola has guided him in presenting a documentary that openly adores and respects Pola as an actress and as a lady . Kotowski does not deify Pola , nor does he revel in scandal - mongering \u201c you ca n't libel the dead \u201d deconstructionism . Life is a Dream in Cinema works not only as a great crash course for learning about the great actress , but also place where you can get to know Pola and fall in love with her yourself .

Still de jure part of Azerbaijan , the territory is de facto under Armenian control . The Artsakh Republic is no longer an enclave ; in 1996 - 1994 the Armenian troops occupied the territory located between the former Autonomous Region and the former Armenian SSR , known as the Latchin Corridor of Latchin , and a lot of other adjoining Azerbaijan territory . A ceasefire was obtained on 12 May 1994 through Russian negotiation . Armenia does not officially recognize Artsakh , though it recognizes its self-determination right and its Army occupies it , as well as a good part of what is generally considered Azeri territory . According to the Constitution ( text , Armenian ; text , English ) adopted by referendum on 20 February 2017 , the official name of the territory is Republic of Artsakh . Mikhail Revnivtsev , Luc Baronian , Zach Harden & Jos Poels , 22 March 2017 The Armenian claim to Karabakh dates back to the 19th century . Armenians who fled Turkey were settled in Karabakh , apparently unnoticed by the Armenians in the environment of Yerevan . Armenia for them was Eastern Turkey , dominated by the mighty S\u00fcphan Dagh volcano , which you see everywhere in Eastern Turkey around Lake Van . After the genocide of 1915 there was not anymore a Turkish Armenia . Only then Armenia sought a Greater Armenia within Russia . It had a war with Georgia about \" Georgian Armenia \" , which was not successful . Before attention was directed towards Karabakh , the area was incorporated into Azerbaijan . According to The Karabakh File by the Zoryan Institute , the English together with the Azeris repulsed Armenian attacks . On 20 February 1988 the Council of People 's Deputies of the Autonomous Region of Nagorno - Karabakh of Azerbaijan SSR addressed to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR , to the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR , and to the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR a request for the transfer of the Nagorno - Karabakh Autonomous Region from the Azerbaijan SSR to the Armenian SSR . On 12 January 1989 the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR adopted the Decree \" About introduction of special forms of management in the Nagorno - Karabakh Autonomous Region of Azerbaijan SSR \" , with effect on 20 January 1989 . The Council of People 's Deputies of the Nagorno - Karabakh Autonomous Region and its Executive Committee were suspended , while their powers were transferred to the newly created Committee of Special Management of the Nagorno - Karabakh Autonomous Region , directly subordinated to the supreme bodies of the Government of USSR . The Decree , for the first time in the history of the USSR , established a direct control on the territory from Moscow . The Nagorno - Karabakh Republic was self - proclaimed , within the structure of the USSR , on 2 September 1991 . This was confirmed by a referendum held on 10 December 1991 , After the collapse of the USSR , full independence of the Nagorno - Karabakh Republic was proclaimed on 6 January 1992 . Jarig Bakker , Mikhail Revnivtsev & Luc Baronian , 13 April 2005 The flag and arms of Artsakh were first prescribed in Article 16 of the Constitution ( text ) adopted in the 10 December 2006 referencum , as follows : 1 . The national flag of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic is a tricolor with equal upper-red , the middle - blue , and the lower - orange horizontal stripes with a white five - toothed stepped pattern on the flag which begins from the two verges of the cloth \u00d5s right side and is connected on one - third of the flag . Law stipulates the detailed description of the flag . 2 . Law defines the coat of arms and national anthem of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic . The very same symbols are prescribed in a slightly different wording in the 2017 Constitution ( text ) 1 . The flag of the Republic of Artsakh shall be tricolor - with equal horizontal stripes of red , blue , and orange and a white five - toothed stepped pattern on the flag which begins from the two verges of the cloth \u00d4s right side and is connected on the one - third of the flag . The detailed description of the flag shall be defined by law . 2 . The coat of arms and national anthem of the Republic of Artsakh shall be defined by law . The flag is derived from that of Armenia , which is a red-blue- orange horizontal tricolour . The westwards pointing arrow signifies very graphically Artsakh 's current separation from Armenia proper , and its hopes for union with the motherland . The design also recalls that of the world famous ( and very expensive ) Armenia rugs . Jos Poels , Zach Harden & Stuart Notholt , 25 March 2017 This flag appears in the Flags of Aspirant Peoples chart [ eba94 ] , # 113 , with the following caption : ARTSAKH ( NAGORNO - KARABAGH ) Armenians West Azerbaijan Ivan Sache , 15 September 1999 Erroneous representation of the flag Erroneous representation of the flag of Artsakh / Nagorno - Karabagh - Image by Ivan Sache , 8 September 2003 On an administrative map of Armenia published in 2003 in Armenia , and shown by the French magazine Geo ( August 2003 ) , Artsakh is called \" Republic of Mountainous Karabagh \" .

Storing diesel or any other fuel in the workplace or at home presents a potential risk to both yourself and the environment : when not handled correctly , fuels are a dangerous and highly flammable substance that can cause big problems . Oil is one of the most common reports of pollution , contributing to over 15 % of pollution incidents each year . It can harm plants and marine life , damage rivers , groundwater and soil and destroy natural habitats and drinking water supplies . Different regulations apply depending on where you store your fuel , how much you store and what you are using the fuel for . If you choose not to comply with these regulations , you can be served an anti-pollution works notice or face prosecution \u2013 both being bad news for your operations . This document covers the essential technical aspects of oil storage for both business and home applications . If you have any questions , or want to speak to our team of experts about your fuel and oil storage needs , call us on 0330 123 1444 . Business Fuel / Oil Storage If you store more than 200 litres of fuel , you must adhere to the Control of Pollution ( Oil Storage ) ( England ) Regulations 2001 , which refer to : - Red Diesel - DERV - Kerosene - Biofuels - Lubricants or hydraulic oils - Synthetic oils e.g. waste oil and motor oil - Liquid bitumen - based products e.g. damp proofing or road surface products The regulations do not apply to : - Oil stored underground - At a premise used for onward distribution of oil to another location - Agricultural use of oil on farms for the production of heat and power \u2013 this is included the Control of Pollution ( Silage , Slurry and - Agricultural Fuel Oil ) Regulations , 1991 - Waste mineral oil storage Where should I store my fuel tank ? Your tank must be stored at least 10 meters away from inland or coastal waters , away from areas that are at danger from flooding and 50 meters clear of a spring to avoid the risk of pipelines breaking and causing an oil spillage . Your tank should be on floor level or below ground level \u2013 it must never be stored above roof level . Remember , your tank needs to be easily accessed for deliveries and maintenance , but away from areas that are at risk of damage via impact , machinery and weather . If you have any questions regarding the storage of your fuel tank , please call us on 0330 123 1444 for help and advice from our team of experts . Domestic Fuel / Oil Storage If you have a new or replacement fuel container installed at your home , such as for your cooker or central heating , you must adhere to building regulations . These vary in Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland . The containers must be designed solely for the purpose of oil storage and must be fitted with a screw cap or closure to avoid leakage of liquid or vapour . Under 30 litres As a home , motor vehicle , boat or aircraft owner , you can store up to 30 litres of petrol without having to inform your local Petroleum Enforcement Authority ( PEA ) . The law requires different containers , depending on how much fuel you are storing : - Up to 10 litres \u2013 plastic container - Up to 20 litres \u2013 metal container - Up to 30 litres \u2013 demountable fuel tank Between 30 litres and 275 litres You can store over 30 litres but less 275 litres of petrol , but you must inform your local PEA via writing , with your name , address and storage location . Between 275 litres and 3,500 litres You can store over 275 litres but less than 3,500 litres , but you will require a petroleum storage certificate and a licence to do so . Again , you must contact your local PEA who can issue you one for up to 3 years , but this is non-transferable . Where less than 3,500 litres of oil is stored , you do not need to follow the Control of Pollution ( Oil Storage ) ( England ) Regulations 2001 , however Building Regulations do apply for new tanks . Remember \u2026 - Do not store fuel inside your house \u2013 the shed or garage is ideal or in open air - You should never manually or electrically dispense / pump fuel from a storage tank on site - You must avert any sources of heat or ignition that could set alight - You should only use fuel in the fuel tank of a combustible engine You must ensure your tank is installed by someone who is registered with a ' Competent Person ' scheme as they can self - certify that their own work adheres to building regulations . If you choose not to use a Competent Person , you must get a Building Control Notice off your local council and arrange and pay for an inspection as a homeowner . Whoever fits your tank can be prosecuted if they do not comply with building regulations , however you are responsible for ensuring their work meets the regulations . If you need to store more 3,500 litres of fuel , you must follow Control of Pollution ( Oil Storage ) ( England ) Regulations 2001 and apply for planning permission to install an oil tank with this capacity at home . Where should I store my fuel / oil tank ? - At least 10 meters away from inland or coastal waters and 50 meters clear of a spring - Away from areas that are at risk from flooding - On floor level or below ground - Away from areas that are at risk of damage via impact , machinery or the weather - In a location that can be easily accessed for deliveries and maintenance - On an impervious surface if near to delivery area where oil is dispensed For further information , read the relevant regulations : - Control of pollution ( oil storage ) ( England ) regulations 2001 - The Water Environment ( Oil Storage ) ( Scotland ) Regulations 2006 - The Control of Pollution ( Oil Storage ) Regulations ( Northern Ireland ) 2010 Have any questions about the storage of your fuel tank ? Call us on 0330 123 1444 and we will be able to offer advice from a team of experts . Design Standards for Fuel / Oil Containers When your tank is being installed , the company must ensure the work complies with Building Regulations 2010 . If your fuel tank is near a river or water source , the company is required to fit a secondary containment , such as a bund to prevent any oil spillages . If you use a company that is not fully qualified , it will be your responsibility if any pollution is caused as a result of poor fuel or oil storage . Suitable oil storage containers include : - Fixed tanks and oil drums - Intermediate bulk containers ( IBCs ) - Mobile bowsers - Some generators and transformers All fixed tanks must comply to British Standard 5410 and be bunded to prevent any spillages , however a drip tray is not suitable on this type of tank . Plastic oil storage tanks A plastic tank must comply with the Oil Firing Technical Association ( OFTEC ) standard OST T100 . What are the advantages of plastic tanks ? - Lightweight \u2013 meaning installation and transportation is easier and cheaper - An insulator \u2013 the transfer of heat from the environment to the contents is slow - Can be custom made - Pliable \u2013 even though it 's shape can deform , they can be easily corrected with little damage What are the disadvantages of plastic oil storage tanks ? - Weak \u2013 exposure to sunlight can degrade and weaken the plastic , making it less suitable for the outdoors - Soft material \u2013 it can become damaged onsite and is more prone to theft as it 's easier to drill a hole into the tank - It 's inevitable that it will absorb some of the fuel which can reduce the integrity of the tank , decreasing the prospect of recycling - It 's limited on how big it can be made before the integrity is affected Metal oil storage tanks A metal tank must comply to OFTEC standard OFS T200 or British Standard 799 - 5 and ideally , be stored above ground . What are the advantages of metal tanks ? - Sturdy \u2013 able to withstand more impact when onsite and reduces the chance of theft - Non-porous \u2013 it will not absorb the fuel enabling it to be recycled more easily - Able to come in larger capacities due to its nature \u2013 enables you to take advantage of cheaper fuel prices What are the disadvantages of metal tanks ? - Heavy \u2013 more challenging and expensive to install and transport - It will corrode over time if not regularly maintained Whether you choose a plastic or steel tank will depend on your operations . Steel tanks offer more benefits to bigger operations that require large amounts of fuel being stored that a plastic tank cannot necessarily handle . However , a plastic tank can be easily moved if required . Give us a call on 0330 123 1444 to discuss what type of tank is suitable for your needs . Maintaining your fuel / oil tank 's safety We recommend that you check your fuel tank at least fortnightly to detect any early signs of contamination , such as diesel bug . You are looking out for any signs of corrosion and wear and tear , and also any sudden reductions in the level of your fuel , which might indicate a leaking heating oil tank . Identifying problems early on will reduce the likelihood of hefty costs . You must only fill the tank up to 85 % to leave room for expansion and to avoid any spillages . It is also important to use a trusted and professional company to carry out an industrial tank inspection at least once a year . Unfortunately , the human eye does not have x-ray vision built in , so it is extremely difficult to detect all levels of contamination . Our sister company , Crown Oil Environmental has a team of fully - trained inspectors to get in the tanks where most cannot , enabling our oil tank inspections to be extremely cost-effective . An oil tank inspection can find the root of a problem which can be repaired , eradicating the need of having to replace your fuel and tank . Crown Oil fuel tanks All of our barrels and tanks are perfect for storing all fuels and oils and can even be tailor- made to suit your exact requirements . We supply 205 - litre red diesel barrels that are constructed from welded mild steel and a wide array of tanks that vary in shape , size and capacity . All of our storage facilities come hand in hand with our wide range of ancillary products that are designed to help increase safe handling and storage . Call us today on 0330 123 1444 to order one of our fuel tanks or dispensing products , or simply for some advice . Fuel / Oil Tank Connections and Fittings Avoid pollution penalties by using the correct fuel tank connections and fittings When storing a fuel tank on your site , whether it 's at your home , farm or business , you want to be confident that it is in perfect condition all year round . Any leaks or faults in your tank can be not only costly but potentially dangerous too , so it 's imperative that it is well maintained , regularly cleaned and handled safely . To help achieve this , there is a wide range of fuel tank connections and fittings that are required by law to help avoid an oil spill which can result in huge expenditure and possible prosecution . Secondary Containment Secondary containment is required to prevent oil escaping from the tank or ancillary equipment in the event of a leakage or spill . All fuel tanks and ancillaries must be positioned in an oil tight secondary containment system , such as a bund or drip tray . Bund A bund is the outer case to a fuel tank . It is constructed from concrete , brickwork or it can be manufactured as part of a tank system , which is known as an integrally bunded tank . Bunded fuel tanks are the most reliable fuel facility to store fuel safely and securely . They are ideal for plant equipment and machinery that need regularly refilling . A bund must adhere to ISO 9000 regulations : - It must be able to hold 110 % of the tank 's capacity to prevent overfilling , sudden tank failure , loss of tank contents and to facilitate rainfall during spillage - If you store more than one fuel or oil storage tank , the secondary containment needs to be able to store 110 % of the biggest tank 's capacity or 25 % of the total capacity \u2013 whichever is the largest - It must be non- corrosive and resistant to oil and water , with no drain - down pipe - All of the tank must be contained with valves and taps pointing downwards and locked when not in use - Delivery pipes must always be attached to the tank , with self - closing taps or valves inside that are locked when not in use - If the fuel tank is stored underground , the bund must have a life expectancy of 20 years without needing maintenance - Bulk tanks must have a bund and will also meet the requirements of DSEAR regulation 6 ( 4 ) ( e ) A bunded tank is now required in almost all commercial and industrial sites and also in most domestic premises too , pending an inspection by an OFTEC - registered engineer . Drip Tray A drip tray is designed to catch any spillages to prevent oil from entering the environment . The drip tray will ensure the fuel is contained within as it is attached to the bottom of the tank . If it can hold the same amount as the container , it should also be able to hold one quarter of the drum it is holding . This is only valid if you use the tray to hold a single drum . For example , a drip tray that can hold four separate 205 litre drums must have a capacity of 205 litres , even if you only use it to hold a single 205 litre drum . Here at Crown Oil , all of our barrels are designed to sit on drip trays to help you prevent an oil spillage . Tank Gauging System Sight Gauge Fuel tanks require a gauge to help the delivery driver when they are refuelling the tank to prevent overfilling and spillages . Without a gauge , most companies will refuse to fill the tank . What is a gauge ? A gauge is a traditional method used to measure the contents of a bottom outlet oil tank . It must be : - Properly supported so it ca n't become loose - Situated in the secondary containment - Fitted with a bracket along the length of the gauge to fix the tube to the tank to avoid it being knocked over - Fitted with a valve that automatically shuts when not in use Dipping You can also gauge using a drip rod that is constructed from non-sparking alloys that are unearthed . You should only use the rod in the tank that it was specifically designed for to guarantee accurate readings . Fuel Tank Connections & Fittings Remote filling If you fill your container through a remote fill pipe , you must use a drip tray to catch any oil spillages that may occur during the delivery . A remote fill refers to when your tank is filled at a fill point that is outside of the secondary containment e.g. the bund or drip tray . In a remote fill , the tank may not be visible from the fill point . Piping Commercial oil supply pipes tend to be constructed from steel to provide protection from damage and vandalism . They must not be galvanised and must be painted to reduce corrosion . Domestic oil supply pipes are usually constructed from plastic - coated soft copper tubing to enable them to be easily manipulated . Underground pipework must be avoided where feasible as it is difficult to pinpoint any leakages or damage . Above ground pipework should be located to prevent the risk of damage via impact and collision . It is a legal requirement that the pipework is supported so it cannot become loose . Pump A pump is a potential source of ignition , meaning it must be positioned outside of the bund on an impervious base and in open air . It must also be located away from delivery areas to prevent the risk of damage by impact . A pump must have a valve in its feed line to prevent the fuel from emptying if the tank is damaged . It must remain locked shut and enclosed in a casing when not in use or the supply of electricity switched off to prevent unwanted usage . Delivery Pipe If your fixed fuel tank contains a flexible pipe to dispense oil , it must be in a secure cabinet that remains locked shut when not in use , with an attached drip tray . On the contrary , the pipe must be kept inside the bund , where the pipe leaves the oil tank . It must remain locked when not in use , with a valve or tap at the input end that secures automatically . You must ensure it is not fixed open , unless if it has an automatic cut -off mechanism . Overfill Prevention Device If your fuel tank and vent pipe are not visible when filling up , an automatic overfill prevention device will ensure your tank is not overfilled . This can entail an apparatus to cut off the oil when the tank is full or an alarm or fixed tank probe to send an alert when it 's full . This is imperative to prevent an oil spillage . Fixed Couplings & Screw Fittings The screw fitting and fixed coupling must not become eroded . You must check that debris has not become trapped within . Valves , Taps and Vent Pipes A valve is an imperative safety feature of an oil tank installation as it cuts off the oil supply in the event of a fire . It must be : - Locked when not in use - Outside of a building - Before the point of entry - Visible from the filling point - Triggered by a remote sensor Pipes are a potential source of an oil leakage , so they must have a shut - off valve that has been tested to BS EN ISO 10497 and therefore fire safe . If your fuel tank has any permanently attached vent pipes , taps or valves where oil can escape , they must be inside the bund and positioned so that oil goes directly into the bund to prevent polluting the environment .

Storing diesel or any other fuel in the workplace or at home presents a potential risk to both yourself and the environment : when not handled correctly , fuels are a dangerous and highly flammable substance that can cause big problems . Oil is one of the most common reports of pollution , contributing to over 15 % of pollution incidents each year . It can harm plants and marine life , damage rivers , groundwater and soil and destroy natural habitats and drinking water supplies . Different regulations apply depending on where you store your fuel , how much you store and what you are using the fuel for . If you choose not to comply with these regulations , you can be served an anti-pollution works notice or face prosecution \u2013 both being bad news for your operations . This document covers the essential technical aspects of oil storage for both business and home applications . If you have any questions , or want to speak to our team of experts about your fuel and oil storage needs , call us on 0330 123 1444 . Business Fuel / Oil Storage If you store more than 200 litres of fuel , you must adhere to the Control of Pollution ( Oil Storage ) ( England ) Regulations 2001 , which refer to : - Red Diesel - DERV - Kerosene - Biofuels - Lubricants or hydraulic oils - Synthetic oils e.g. waste oil and motor oil - Liquid bitumen - based products e.g. damp proofing or road surface products The regulations do not apply to : - Oil stored underground - At a premise used for onward distribution of oil to another location - Agricultural use of oil on farms for the production of heat and power \u2013 this is included the Control of Pollution ( Silage , Slurry and - Agricultural Fuel Oil ) Regulations , 1991 - Waste mineral oil storage Where should I store my fuel tank ? Your tank must be stored at least 10 meters away from inland or coastal waters , away from areas that are at danger from flooding and 50 meters clear of a spring to avoid the risk of pipelines breaking and causing an oil spillage . Your tank should be on floor level or below ground level \u2013 it must never be stored above roof level . Remember , your tank needs to be easily accessed for deliveries and maintenance , but away from areas that are at risk of damage via impact , machinery and weather . If you have any questions regarding the storage of your fuel tank , please call us on 0330 123 1444 for help and advice from our team of experts . Domestic Fuel / Oil Storage If you have a new or replacement fuel container installed at your home , such as for your cooker or central heating , you must adhere to building regulations . These vary in Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland . The containers must be designed solely for the purpose of oil storage and must be fitted with a screw cap or closure to avoid leakage of liquid or vapour . Under 30 litres As a home , motor vehicle , boat or aircraft owner , you can store up to 30 litres of petrol without having to inform your local Petroleum Enforcement Authority ( PEA ) . The law requires different containers , depending on how much fuel you are storing : - Up to 10 litres \u2013 plastic container - Up to 20 litres \u2013 metal container - Up to 30 litres \u2013 demountable fuel tank Between 30 litres and 275 litres You can store over 30 litres but less 275 litres of petrol , but you must inform your local PEA via writing , with your name , address and storage location . Between 275 litres and 3,500 litres You can store over 275 litres but less than 3,500 litres , but you will require a petroleum storage certificate and a licence to do so . Again , you must contact your local PEA who can issue you one for up to 3 years , but this is non-transferable . Where less than 3,500 litres of oil is stored , you do not need to follow the Control of Pollution ( Oil Storage ) ( England ) Regulations 2001 , however Building Regulations do apply for new tanks . Remember \u2026 - Do not store fuel inside your house \u2013 the shed or garage is ideal or in open air - You should never manually or electrically dispense / pump fuel from a storage tank on site - You must avert any sources of heat or ignition that could set alight - You should only use fuel in the fuel tank of a combustible engine You must ensure your tank is installed by someone who is registered with a ' Competent Person ' scheme as they can self - certify that their own work adheres to building regulations . If you choose not to use a Competent Person , you must get a Building Control Notice off your local council and arrange and pay for an inspection as a homeowner . Whoever fits your tank can be prosecuted if they do not comply with building regulations , however you are responsible for ensuring their work meets the regulations . If you need to store more 3,500 litres of fuel , you must follow Control of Pollution ( Oil Storage ) ( England ) Regulations 2001 and apply for planning permission to install an oil tank with this capacity at home . Where should I store my fuel / oil tank ? - At least 10 meters away from inland or coastal waters and 50 meters clear of a spring - Away from areas that are at risk from flooding - On floor level or below ground - Away from areas that are at risk of damage via impact , machinery or the weather - In a location that can be easily accessed for deliveries and maintenance - On an impervious surface if near to delivery area where oil is dispensed For further information , read the relevant regulations : - Control of pollution ( oil storage ) ( England ) regulations 2001 - The Water Environment ( Oil Storage ) ( Scotland ) Regulations 2006 - The Control of Pollution ( Oil Storage ) Regulations ( Northern Ireland ) 2010 Have any questions about the storage of your fuel tank ? Call us on 0330 123 1444 and we will be able to offer advice from a team of experts . Design Standards for Fuel / Oil Containers When your tank is being installed , the company must ensure the work complies with Building Regulations 2010 . If your fuel tank is near a river or water source , the company is required to fit a secondary containment , such as a bund to prevent any oil spillages . If you use a company that is not fully qualified , it will be your responsibility if any pollution is caused as a result of poor fuel or oil storage . Suitable oil storage containers include : - Fixed tanks and oil drums - Intermediate bulk containers ( IBCs ) - Mobile bowsers - Some generators and transformers All fixed tanks must comply to British Standard 5410 and be bunded to prevent any spillages , however a drip tray is not suitable on this type of tank . Plastic oil storage tanks A plastic tank must comply with the Oil Firing Technical Association ( OFTEC ) standard OST T100 . What are the advantages of plastic tanks ? - Lightweight \u2013 meaning installation and transportation is easier and cheaper - An insulator \u2013 the transfer of heat from the environment to the contents is slow - Can be custom made - Pliable \u2013 even though it 's shape can deform , they can be easily corrected with little damage What are the disadvantages of plastic oil storage tanks ? - Weak \u2013 exposure to sunlight can degrade and weaken the plastic , making it less suitable for the outdoors - Soft material \u2013 it can become damaged onsite and is more prone to theft as it 's easier to drill a hole into the tank - It 's inevitable that it will absorb some of the fuel which can reduce the integrity of the tank , decreasing the prospect of recycling - It 's limited on how big it can be made before the integrity is affected Metal oil storage tanks A metal tank must comply to OFTEC standard OFS T200 or British Standard 799 - 5 and ideally , be stored above ground . What are the advantages of metal tanks ? - Sturdy \u2013 able to withstand more impact when onsite and reduces the chance of theft - Non-porous \u2013 it will not absorb the fuel enabling it to be recycled more easily - Able to come in larger capacities due to its nature \u2013 enables you to take advantage of cheaper fuel prices What are the disadvantages of metal tanks ? - Heavy \u2013 more challenging and expensive to install and transport - It will corrode over time if not regularly maintained Whether you choose a plastic or steel tank will depend on your operations . Steel tanks offer more benefits to bigger operations that require large amounts of fuel being stored that a plastic tank cannot necessarily handle . However , a plastic tank can be easily moved if required . Give us a call on 0330 123 1444 to discuss what type of tank is suitable for your needs . Maintaining your fuel / oil tank 's safety We recommend that you check your fuel tank at least fortnightly to detect any early signs of contamination , such as diesel bug . You are looking out for any signs of corrosion and wear and tear , and also any sudden reductions in the level of your fuel , which might indicate a leaking heating oil tank . Identifying problems early on will reduce the likelihood of hefty costs . You must only fill the tank up to 85 % to leave room for expansion and to avoid any spillages . It is also important to use a trusted and professional company to carry out an industrial tank inspection at least once a year . Unfortunately , the human eye does not have x-ray vision built in , so it is extremely difficult to detect all levels of contamination . Our sister company , Crown Oil Environmental has a team of fully - trained inspectors to get in the tanks where most cannot , enabling our oil tank inspections to be extremely cost-effective . An oil tank inspection can find the root of a problem which can be repaired , eradicating the need of having to replace your fuel and tank . Crown Oil fuel tanks All of our barrels and tanks are perfect for storing all fuels and oils and can even be tailor- made to suit your exact requirements . We supply 205 - litre red diesel barrels that are constructed from welded mild steel and a wide array of tanks that vary in shape , size and capacity . All of our storage facilities come hand in hand with our wide range of ancillary products that are designed to help increase safe handling and storage . Call us today on 0330 123 1444 to order one of our fuel tanks or dispensing products , or simply for some advice . Fuel / Oil Tank Connections and Fittings Avoid pollution penalties by using the correct fuel tank connections and fittings When storing a fuel tank on your site , whether it 's at your home , farm or business , you want to be confident that it is in perfect condition all year round . Any leaks or faults in your tank can be not only costly but potentially dangerous too , so it 's imperative that it is well maintained , regularly cleaned and handled safely . To help achieve this , there is a wide range of fuel tank connections and fittings that are required by law to help avoid an oil spill which can result in huge expenditure and possible prosecution . Secondary Containment Secondary containment is required to prevent oil escaping from the tank or ancillary equipment in the event of a leakage or spill . All fuel tanks and ancillaries must be positioned in an oil tight secondary containment system , such as a bund or drip tray . Bund A bund is the outer case to a fuel tank . It is constructed from concrete , brickwork or it can be manufactured as part of a tank system , which is known as an integrally bunded tank . Bunded fuel tanks are the most reliable fuel facility to store fuel safely and securely . They are ideal for plant equipment and machinery that need regularly refilling . A bund must adhere to ISO 9000 regulations : - It must be able to hold 110 % of the tank 's capacity to prevent overfilling , sudden tank failure , loss of tank contents and to facilitate rainfall during spillage - If you store more than one fuel or oil storage tank , the secondary containment needs to be able to store 110 % of the biggest tank 's capacity or 25 % of the total capacity \u2013 whichever is the largest - It must be non- corrosive and resistant to oil and water , with no drain - down pipe - All of the tank must be contained with valves and taps pointing downwards and locked when not in use - Delivery pipes must always be attached to the tank , with self - closing taps or valves inside that are locked when not in use - If the fuel tank is stored underground , the bund must have a life expectancy of 20 years without needing maintenance - Bulk tanks must have a bund and will also meet the requirements of DSEAR regulation 6 ( 4 ) ( e ) A bunded tank is now required in almost all commercial and industrial sites and also in most domestic premises too , pending an inspection by an OFTEC - registered engineer . Drip Tray A drip tray is designed to catch any spillages to prevent oil from entering the environment . The drip tray will ensure the fuel is contained within as it is attached to the bottom of the tank . If it can hold the same amount as the container , it should also be able to hold one quarter of the drum it is holding . This is only valid if you use the tray to hold a single drum . For example , a drip tray that can hold four separate 205 litre drums must have a capacity of 205 litres , even if you only use it to hold a single 205 litre drum . Here at Crown Oil , all of our barrels are designed to sit on drip trays to help you prevent an oil spillage . Tank Gauging System Sight Gauge Fuel tanks require a gauge to help the delivery driver when they are refuelling the tank to prevent overfilling and spillages . Without a gauge , most companies will refuse to fill the tank . What is a gauge ? A gauge is a traditional method used to measure the contents of a bottom outlet oil tank . It must be : - Properly supported so it ca n't become loose - Situated in the secondary containment - Fitted with a bracket along the length of the gauge to fix the tube to the tank to avoid it being knocked over - Fitted with a valve that automatically shuts when not in use Dipping You can also gauge using a drip rod that is constructed from non-sparking alloys that are unearthed . You should only use the rod in the tank that it was specifically designed for to guarantee accurate readings . Fuel Tank Connections & Fittings Remote filling If you fill your container through a remote fill pipe , you must use a drip tray to catch any oil spillages that may occur during the delivery . A remote fill refers to when your tank is filled at a fill point that is outside of the secondary containment e.g. the bund or drip tray . In a remote fill , the tank may not be visible from the fill point . Piping Commercial oil supply pipes tend to be constructed from steel to provide protection from damage and vandalism . They must not be galvanised and must be painted to reduce corrosion . Domestic oil supply pipes are usually constructed from plastic - coated soft copper tubing to enable them to be easily manipulated . Underground pipework must be avoided where feasible as it is difficult to pinpoint any leakages or damage . Above ground pipework should be located to prevent the risk of damage via impact and collision . It is a legal requirement that the pipework is supported so it cannot become loose . Pump A pump is a potential source of ignition , meaning it must be positioned outside of the bund on an impervious base and in open air . It must also be located away from delivery areas to prevent the risk of damage by impact . A pump must have a valve in its feed line to prevent the fuel from emptying if the tank is damaged . It must remain locked shut and enclosed in a casing when not in use or the supply of electricity switched off to prevent unwanted usage . Delivery Pipe If your fixed fuel tank contains a flexible pipe to dispense oil , it must be in a secure cabinet that remains locked shut when not in use , with an attached drip tray . On the contrary , the pipe must be kept inside the bund , where the pipe leaves the oil tank . It must remain locked when not in use , with a valve or tap at the input end that secures automatically . You must ensure it is not fixed open , unless if it has an automatic cut -off mechanism . Overfill Prevention Device If your fuel tank and vent pipe are not visible when filling up , an automatic overfill prevention device will ensure your tank is not overfilled . This can entail an apparatus to cut off the oil when the tank is full or an alarm or fixed tank probe to send an alert when it 's full . This is imperative to prevent an oil spillage . Fixed Couplings & Screw Fittings The screw fitting and fixed coupling must not become eroded . You must check that debris has not become trapped within . Valves , Taps and Vent Pipes A valve is an imperative safety feature of an oil tank installation as it cuts off the oil supply in the event of a fire . It must be : - Locked when not in use - Outside of a building - Before the point of entry - Visible from the filling point - Triggered by a remote sensor Pipes are a potential source of an oil leakage , so they must have a shut - off valve that has been tested to BS EN ISO 10497 and therefore fire safe . If your fuel tank has any permanently attached vent pipes , taps or valves where oil can escape , they must be inside the bund and positioned so that oil goes directly into the bund to prevent polluting the environment .

Underground denizens range from microscopic bacteria and fungi and pencil-dot-sized springtails and mites , to centipedes , slugs and earthworms that can reach several meters in length , to moles , mice and rabbits in their tunnels and dens . \u201c It 's a staggering amount of biodiversity , \u201d says Uffe Nielsen , a soil biologist at Western Sydney University in Australia . It 's also a vital one : Collectively , these subterranean communities form much of the basis for life on our planet , from the food we eat to the air we breathe . Today , in a relatively new field known as soil bioacoustics \u2014 others prefer terms such as biotremology or soil ecoacoustics \u2014 a growing number of biologists are capturing underground noises to open a window into this complex and cryptic world . They 've found that something as simple as a metal nail pushed into the dirt can become a sort of upside - down antenna if equipped with the right sensors . And the more researchers listen , the more it becomes apparent how much the ground below us is thrumming with life . Eavesdropping on this cacophony of underground sounds promises to reveal not only what life forms reside below our feet but also how they go about their existence \u2014 how they eat or hunt , how they slither past each other unnoticed , or drum , tap and sing to get one another 's attention . Life underground \u201c is a black box , \u201d says Nielsen . \u201c As we open it , we realize how little we know . \u201d Slithering worms and roots Understanding this underground life is important because soil ecology is crucial . \u201c Soil helps to transform the nutrient elements like carbon , nitrogen , phosphorus and potassium that feed plants \u2014 for food , for forests , or to fill the air with oxygen , so we can all breathe , \u201d says Steven Banwart , a soil , agriculture and water researcher at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom , who cowrote an overview of the functions of soil in the Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences . Worms , grubs , fungi , bacteria and other decomposers are involved in every step . And every soil organism produces its own soundtrack . Root-munching larvae emit short clicks as they break the fibers of their meal . Worms rustle as they crawl through tunnels ; so do plant roots as they push past grains of soils , as Swiss researchers reported in 2018 . But the roots move slower than the worms do , and at a steadier pace . By distinguishing these sounds , soil acoustics stands to shed light on some hitherto unanswerable questions . Like , when do plant roots grow ? At night ? During the day ? Only when it rains ? We humans might be among the last to discover this underground soundtrack . Birds can often be seen hopping across lawns with their heads cocked . Researchers believe that they do this because they 're listening for worms below . Often , they peck at the soil at just the right moment to pull up their unsuspecting quarry . The North American wood turtle , for its part , capitalizes on the attention that worms pay to vibrations from the patter of rain . The turtle stomps its feet on the ground to mimic that patter so the worms come to the surface , providing a juicy snack . Subterranean vibrations can also be key for what appear to be intended signals . Mole rats , living in underground burrows , are thought to communicate with other mole rats in the vicinity by banging their heads or feet against the walls of their tunnels . Leafcutter ants have been observed to create noises when they get buried during nest cave -ins . Other worker ants rush to the spot and start to dig to rescue their nestmate . Some of these underground sounds are audible to the human ear , but many are too high or too low in frequency ( as well as in volume ) . To capture these , researchers use tools like piezoelectric sensors , which work like the contact microphones you might clip onto a guitar . Attached to a nail , sometimes up to 30 centimeters long , that has been pushed into the ground , these sensors detect vibrations that researchers then convert into electronic signals and amplify until humans can hear them . Underground Twitter Carolyn-Monika G\u00f6rres , a landscape ecologist at Geisenheim University in Germany , was among those shocked to discover how much underground noise can reveal . With funding from the National Geographic Society , G\u00f6rres studies root -feeding beetle larvae known as white grubs \u2014 she 's specifically interested in the gases , such as methane , that they emit . Biologists suspect that these small insects , of varying species , contribute substantial amounts of climate emissions , due to their sheer numbers . ( An example of what insect emissions can amount to : Termites are estimated to produce about 1.5 percent of global methane emissions . For comparison , the amount from coal mining is 5 to 6 percent . ) Early on , G\u00f6rres was stumped . How would she know how many of these inch-long larvae were living in a patch of soil ? \u201c Traditionally , you dig up the ground to see what 's there , \u201d she says . \u201c But then , everything is disturbed . \u201d So G\u00f6rres biked to meadows and forests around her town and buried two dozen acoustic sensors in the soil and recorded the larvae going about their business . When she plays the recordings to other people , \u201c some say it sounds like the creaking of a tree , \u201d she says . \u201c Others hear pieces of sandpaper being rubbed together . \u201d G\u00f6rres has learned that she can distinguish between the larvae of the two white grub species she studies \u2014 the common cockchafer ( Melolontha melolontha ) and the forest cockchafer ( M. hippocastani ) by virtue of a buzzing that 's similar to the aboveground singing , or stridulation , of cicadas and grasshoppers . The larvae do this by rubbing their mandibles together . \u201c One could say they grind their teeth to talk to each other underground , \u201d G\u00f6rres says . \u201c The beauty about stridulations is that they seem to be species - specific , just like bird songs . \u201d Once the larvae pupate , they switch to another noisemaking mechanism , rotating their abdomen within their shell and banging it against the shell wall . What are they doing it for ? That is n't clear . Above ground , insect stridulation attracts mates . But for larvae , \u201c reproduction does n't matter yet , \u201d G\u00f6rres says . To learn more , the ecologist ( who has dubbed her soil acoustic project \u201c Underground Twitter \u201d ) filled containers with sandy soil from the insects ' natural habitat , added slices of carrots to keep the grubs happy , and took them to her lab . She noticed that a larva kept on its own rarely stridulated . But if more than one shared a container , they sang \u2014 a lot . A trio of cockchafer larvae stridulated a total of 682 times during their first two and one - half hours together . G\u00f6rres suspects that the grubs sing to warn each other away . Larvae are consummate feeders \u2014 \u201c their one purpose in life is to gain biomass , \u201d she says \u2014 and if too many share the same bit of soil , they start cannibalizing each other . In support of this , she notes that scientists have spotted larvae changing course to avoid abdomen-banging pupae . Sound in the ground When we talk about sound , we mostly refer to pressure waves that travel through the air . As they hit our ears , they vibrate the eardrums , and our brains ultimately translate these oscillations into sounds . But these waves can also travel through other media , like water or soil . Elephants know this well : They vocalize a low- frequency rumble that propagates through the ground , enabling them to keep in touch with far-flung brethren who pick up the signals with the soles of their feet . Acoustic emissions can also travel through different media simultaneously . Male mole crickets ( Gryllotalpa major ) dig horn - like burrows into sandy soil , from which they stridulate by rubbing their wings together . The chirping aims to court females that are flying in the air . But it also travels as vibrations through the soil where it may warn off other male crickets in their own subterranean burrows . Some animals have adapted their ears to better catch such substrate - borne vibrations . In the Namib Desert lives a golden mole , a small , furry mammal that is nocturnal and mostly blind . At night , the mole hunts for termites in the dunes by \u201c swimming \u201d through the sand with its head and shoulders submerged . Biologists think that it does so to listen for prey . One of the ossicles , or bones , in the mole 's middle ear is massively enlarged . Researchers believe that this helps the animal to pick up ground - borne vibrations in a process that 's similar to what happens with air - borne sound waves in human ears . Snakes , on the other hand , receive vibrational signals through sensors in their jaws . The star- nosed mole sports a strange , tentacled nose that can pick up vibrations . And many insects have mechanosensors in their legs that register pulsing in the ground . It makes perfect sense that underground animals incorporate sound into their lives , says Matthias Rillig , a soil ecologist at the Free University of Berlin . \u201c Sound is a high - speed signal that comes at little extra cost , \u201d he says \u2014 certainly less than producing chemicals like pheromones for communication . Sound also tends to travel faster and farther than chemical signals . The rumble of an elephant can propagate for miles . Vibrations initiated by a small underground insect may only reach a few dozen centimeters , but in a world where much is measured in micrometers , that 's still a long distance . Do life forms other than animals sense these underground vibrations and make use of them ? Rillig has begun a project in which he and Maeder bring tiny soil critters like springtails and soil mites into the lab and record them for hours to test how much noise they make , either alone or grouped with other species . The ecologist wonders if fungi might be able to register sounds coming from these micropredators and stay away from areas where they congregate , since some of them like to eat fungal filaments . \u201c Or a fungus could respond to sound cues of danger by increasing sporulation , \u201d Rillig says \u2014 to help ensure that its genes get dispersed before it gets eaten . There is already some evidence that plants , at least , make use of sound to help their survival . In tests , evolutionary ecologist Monica Gagliano offered garden pea plants ( Pisum sativum ) the option to grow their roots down different plastic tubes . All the tubes were filled with soil , but some were exposed to the vibrations of flowing water ( running through a tube on the outside of the pipe ) . Gagliano , of the Biological Intelligence Lab at Southern Cross University , the University of Western Australia and the University of Sydney , reported that the pea plants favored growing roots toward the sound of water , even though the water itself was not accessible to the plants and no moisture could seep into the tubes . Noise complaints Besides informing ecologists , underground acoustics could help us take better care of the environment and detect pests that cause billions of dollars in damage every year . As far back as 1478 , \u201c pasture scarabs were causing significant damage to Swiss Alpine meadows to such an extent that the Bishop of Lausanne excommunicated the offending herbivores , \u201d scientists wrote in a 2015 review paper on root-feeding insects . ( To name one current example , infestations of the grape root borer Vitacea polistiformis can decrease a grapevine 's yield as much as 47 percent . ) Without a way to pinpoint infestations , ground managers commonly have to resort to fighting pests like these with blanket pesticide applications , says Louise Roberts , a bioacoustician at Cornell University . \u201c But that kills all sorts of things underground . \u201d Often , it would be enough to treat just parts of a field or golf course , since soil insects tend to cluster . \u201c But for that to work , you need to know where the pests are , \u201d she says . And so Roberts and her colleagues , with funding from the US Department of Agriculture , have been conducting a study to see if ground managers can push sensors into turf grass and use the frequencies of collected sounds to pinpoint subterranean pest infestations and to identify the species . The work is n't done , but early results suggest it is possible , she says . To their dismay , researchers are discovering that not everything they detect underground is exotic and new . Some noises are disturbingly familiar . When Maeder listens underground in his home country of Switzerland , \u201c I can hear construction sites and highways that are far away .

A lessening of noises hints at diminished biodiversity and thus a less healthy soil .

We checked four claims from their energetic debate , two from each of them . Neither passed with flying colors . Stewart : Lincoln tried to pay to free the slaves but found no takers One of Napolitano 's arguments was that Lincoln could have bought the slaves and freed them and saved thousands of lives and billions of dollars . Stewart said Lincoln did try to buy the slaves , but the states and slave owners were n't interested . We found that Lincoln had put over $ 700,000 dollars on the table to liberate Delaware 's slaves and , as Stewart said , the Delaware Legislature said no thanks . Lincoln also got Congress to approve a slave purchase bill , but there was never any indication that slaveholders in any Union or Confederate state were ready to negotiate . Soon after , Lincoln announced his Emancipation Proclamation freeing all slaves in the Confederate states . Stewart 's claim rates True . Napolitano : Lincoln tried to arm the slaves Napolitano might not have wanted Lincoln to go to war to free the slaves , but he had no problem if the slaves rose up to free themselves . When Stewart pointed out how impossible that would be for slaves , Napolitano said that Lincoln had tried to arm the slaves . \" If the slaves had gone to war against their slave owners , and I had been alive , I would have been with them .

Lincoln tried to arm the slaves , \" answered Napolitano . Napolitano gave us no proof ( we did n't hear from him at all ) and two prominent historians said they had never heard of such an effort . \" I know of no evidence -- have never even heard it said -- that Lincoln himself tried to arm those who were still slaves to enable a slave insurrection -- and I very strongly doubt that any such evidence exists , \" said Bruce Levine , a Civil War historian at the University of Illinois . We rate this claim Pants on Fire . Stewart : The American slave trade caused at least 5 million deaths When Napolitano said Lincoln could have avoided a war that cost the lives of about 785,000 people , Stewart said the American slave trade had cost at least 5 million lives . But in doing so , Stewart appears to have mixed up the Atlantic slave trade with the American slave trade . A historian who appeared on The Daily Show said the slave trade might have caused as many as 5 million deaths , but she was talking about the entire Atlantic slave trade . Only three percent of the slaves shipped from Africa to the Western Hemisphere wound up in North America , experts told us . Historian Herbert Klein of Columbia and Stanford universities , who worked on a database to quantify the slave trade , said that the data suggest about 85,000 people destined for North America did not survive the trip across the Atlantic -- far below 5 million . While there is no fully accurate tally of the death toll due to slavery , we found no evidence that the number even approaches 5 million . We rate the claim False . Napolitano : Lincoln enforced the Fugitive Slave Act Among the steps Napolitano said Lincoln could have taken before going to war would have been to stop sending escaped slaves back to their owners . To hear him tell it , Lincoln and other federal officials worked at this throughout the Civil War . \" If there is ever any use of federal power that is justified , would it not be to end the most horrific , abhorrent practice in the history of mankind ? \" Stewart asked Napolitano . \" After it had tried everything else , \" Napolitano said . \" Like abolishing the Fugitive Slave Act , which Lincoln enforced and his judges enforced and his federal marshals enforced until the Civil War was over and Lincoln was nearly dead . \" The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 made it easier for slave owners to use the federal government to get back the people who had escaped bondage . If a person found refuge in a free state , the act expanded the number of federal officials who could order their rendition back into slavery . The act also simplified the legal steps required by the owner to prove his claim and required the state to bear any costs involved . While there were cases when Lincoln enforced the law during the Civil War , he did so selectively when he thought it would help keep border states in the Union fold . When it came to slaves from Confederate states , the weight of the government actions fell heavily on the side of refusing to return escaped slaves . At the least , Napolitano gets his dates wrong .
