Other confederates of this association include Marcia Lucas ( Mrs George Lucas ) , Virginia Zanuck ( Mrs Daryl Zanuck ) and Irene Selznick ( Mrs David O'Selznick ) \u2013 women whose partners peaked artistically when wed to them . This phenomenon is n't limited to first wives , or even wives \u2013 there are plenty of unsung collaborators in filmmaking who never get the credit they deserve ( for instance , Sam Wasson 's recent book on the making of Chinatown only recently shone some much - needed light on Edward Taylor 's extensive contributions to Robert Towne 's career ) . But there is something particularly poignant about the notion of someone owing a great deal of their success to their spouse , then betraying that spouse , emotionally , sexually and professionally \u2026 and paying for it , at least on a creative level . Such was the case of J. Lee Thompson and Joan Henry . Most film buffs would know Thompson , the British writer - producer - director whose credits include The Guns of Navarone , the 1962 Cape Fear and some of Charles Bronson 's worst movies . Henry is less well - remembered today , although at one stage her fame ( or , rather notoriety ) outstripped Thompson's . She was born in 1914 in Belgravia , London . Henry had a classy lineage \u2013 she was descended from two British Prime Ministers ( John Russell and Robert Peel ) , and her mother 's cousin was the philosopher Bertrand Russell . It was n't an easy life , though \u2013 her father deserted the family when Joan was young , causing her mother to have a breakdown ; Joan and her twin sister were brought up by her grandparents in Ireland , and that sister died when Joan was 21 , causing much anguish to the surviving sibling . Joan was a debutante , making her \u201c debut \u201d in 1932 , and she married an army officer in 1938 . They had one daughter but World War Two put the marriage under such strain that they eventually broke up . Henry started writing romance novels to bring in some money and developed a gambling habit which resulted in her passing a forged cheque ; she claimed it was n't her fault but the police did n't believe her , nor did the jury assigned to her case : in 1951 , Joan Henry was sentenced to twelve months in prison . She wound up serving eight , most of it at the legendary Holloway Prison , with the rest at Askham Grange Open Prison , a newer , more reformist institution . Former debutantes - cum-romance - novelists - cum - prison - inmates were not common at the time \u2013 it was suggested Henry write a memoir about her experiences , which she did . The result , Who Lie in Gaol , became a bestseller and media sensation on its publication in 1952 , drawing attention to the treatment of female prisoners in Britain . The book was read by director J. Lee Thompson , who wanted to adapt it into a movie . Thompson was born the same year as Henry . He had been something of a child prodigy , claiming to have written forty plays by the time he was 18 , the year he married his first wife . One of those forty plays , Double Error , had a short run on the West End in 1935 , which helped Thompson break into the British film industry as a writer and dialogue director . He rewrote Double Error as Murder Without Crime which had success on the stage in London and Broadway in the 1940s . After war service , Thompson returned to writing but when he sold the film rights to Murder without Crime , he decided to direct it as well . The film was released in 1950 and Thompson established himself as a solid helmer of B pictures such as The Yellow Balloon and For Better or For Worse . He was ambitious to do something more , and was impressed by Who Lie in Gaol . Thompson 's backers at Associated British agreed to finance a film version , which became The Weak and the Wicked ( 1954 ) , starring Glynis Johns as ( basically ) Joan Henry , and co-starring Diana Dors and John Gregson . The movie is a first - rate women - in- prison melodrama : powerful , realistic , and not without humour ; Diana Dors , up until then more famous for being famous than her acting , was a revelation , and it was Thompson 's best directing work to date . The movie was a big hit at the box office and put Thompson in the \u201c A \u201d leagues : the Rank Organisation offered him As Long as They 're Happy , and Associated British gave him a big budget for An Alligator Named Daisy ( Diana Dors was in both , incidentally ) . Thompson wanted to make a story about a man on death row . Henry suggested they do it about a woman , so that she could draw on her personal experience ; she wound up writing a novel called Yield to the Night ( 1954 ) , about a woman who is executed for committing murder . Thompson succeeded in setting up the film version at Associated British ; Henry co-wrote the script , Thompson directed , and Dors starred . The result was a masterpiece , a stunningly good drama , where Dors plays a character who never asks for sympathy but gets it anyway : she 's guilty of the crime , is n't friendly to her family or death penalty protestors , still loves the louse who drove her to murder . The movie is full of little touches that speak volumes for Henry 's personal experience in prison \u2013 the routine of changing guards , the conversations , the way the seconds drag on by , the visiting officials , the small privileges , the overwhelming pressure of the longing for a reprieve \u2013 and the final moments are devastating : it 's one of the best British movies of the decade . Lazy critics claimed the film was inspired by the case of Ruth Ellis , who turned out to be the last woman hung in Britain ( she was played by Miranda Richardson in the 1985 film Dance with a Stranger ) ; the novel was actually published a year before Ellis committed her murder . Overlooking this fact served to downplay the skill of Henry 's contribution to Yield to the Night \u2013 her story did have parallels with Ellis ' case , but that was due more to Henry 's own insight , which predicted the future with such accuracy . Joan Henry had provided the material for Thompson 's two best movies to date \u2013 smart , passionate , tense , beautifully done . The two clearly had rapport on a personal level as well : Thompson left his wife of twenty years and two children to be with Henry , who he married in 1958 . It was not the first time a director had fallen in love with his screenwriter ; it may have been the first time one did so after reading that screenwriter 's memoir about being in prison , which he turned into a movie . The next few years were the golden period of Thompson 's career \u2013 he went on to make The Good Companions ( 1957 ) , a jolly musical ; Woman in a Dressing Gown ( 1957 ) , a tough drama about adultery , from a script by Ted Willis ; Ice Cold in Alex ( 1958 ) , a brilliant war suspense tale ; North West Frontier ( 1959 ) , an exciting Imperial adventure movie starring Kenneth More , shot in India ; Tiger Bay ( 1959 ) , a thriller that introduced Hayley Mills to the screen ; No Trees in the Street ( 1959 ) , a social realist melodrama , again from a script by Willis ; and I Aim at the Stars ( 1960 ) , a biopic of Werner Van Braun . Then he received a call from producer Carl Foreman to replace director Alexander Mackendrick on The Guns of Navarone ( 1961 ) , an expensive all - star action movie based on a novel by Alistair Maclean . Thompson 's work at such short notice impressed star Gregory Peck , who hired the Englishman to direct Cape Fear ( 1962 ) . It was an incredible run : few filmmakers had a hot streak like J. Lee Thompson from 1956 to 1962 . All the movies were well - reviewed ( on the whole ) ; Robert Mitchum gave one of the all - time iconic performances in Cape Fear ; ditto Hayley Mills in Tiger Bay , Yvonne Mitchell in Woman , and John Mills and Sylvia Syms in Alex . Commercially , things were even better : Cape Fear , Tiger Bay , Northwest Frontier , Woman and Alex were all solid hits , and Navarone a box-office phenomenon . J. Lee Thompson had become one of the most in - demand directors in the world . The success seems to have come at a domestic cost . By 1962 , the director was being seen in the company of actor Susan Hampshire , and Thompson was telling the press he was unable to make up his mind between Hampshire and Henry ( seriously , he told the press this ) . Later that year , it was reported that he had broken it off with both women and was dating actor Shirley Ann Field . Thompson would eventually divorce Henry and marry a third time in the late 1960s . Coincidence or not , the overall quality of J. Lee Thompson 's films declined sharply after things ended with Joan Henry . He made two bloated epics with Yul Brynner ( Taras Bulba and Kings of the Sun ) , two bloated comedies with Shirley Maclaine ( What a Way to Go , John Goldfarb Please Come Home ) , two patchy thrillers ( Return from the Ashes , Eye of the Devil ) , two bloated reunions with Gregory Peck ( Mackenna 's Gold , The Chairman ) , two attempts at returning to more intimate dramas ( Before Winter Comes , Country Dance ) , two solid sequels to The Planet of the Apes ( Conquest of the Planet of the Apes , Battle for the Planet of the Apes ) , two TV movies ( A Great American Tragedy , Widow ) , and a musical ( Huckleberry Finn ) . There were some excellent moments in all these movies \u2013 I 'm a particular fan of Eye of the Devil and the Apes films \u2013 but his overall average had dropped . He certainly never reached the heights of Navarone , Yield to the Night , Cape Fear , or Tiger Bay . Thompson at least found his commercial niche again in the mid 1970s as a director of Charles Bronson vehicles , starting with St Ives in 1976 . The two men would make eight more movies together , of decreasing ambition : The White Buffalo , Capo Blanco , 10 to Midnight , The Evil That Men Do , Murphy 's Law , Death Wish 4 , Messenger of Death , and Kinjite : Forbidden Subjects . Amidst this run , Thompson also tried his hand at a Europudding war movie ( The Passage ) , a fake biopic ( The Greek Tycoon ) , a slasher ( Happy Birthday to Me ) , two comedy adventures with stars not used to making them ( King Solomon 's Mines with Richard Chamberlain , Firewalker with Chuck Norris ) , and Rock Hudson 's last theatrical feature ( The Ambassador ) . Most of his later films were financed by Cannon Pictures . Thompson was aware of his artistic decline . In 1992 , he said \u201c I have certain regrets now . I would rather have stuck to making films like Yield to the Night which had some integrity and importance . But the British film industry caved in . I suppose I sort of sold out . \u201d In 2000 , two years before his death , he warned young directors , \u201c Do n't make a film for the sake of making it . Make it only if you really believe in it . Then success will eventually come to you . \u201d He rarely mentioned Joan Henry in interviews . Joan Henry 's subsequent career was n't as well publicised as Thompson 's , but she still kept active . She wrote the screenplay for Passionate Summer ( 1958 ) , a film for the Rank Organisation starring Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers that had little impact . She wrote for the stage with Look on Tempests ( 1960 ) , the first play dealing explicitly with the subject of homosexuality to be passed by the Lord Chamberlain ( possibly because the gay characters are discussed , not seen on stage \u2013 which might be why the play was not a hit ) . She wrote some TV plays , Rough Justice and Person to Person , but neither had had the impact of her first two novels . She died in 2001 , one year before Thompson . How influential was Joan Henry to J. Lee Thompson 's career ? It 's easy to gauge in the case of The Weak and the Wicked and Yield to the Night : neither would have existed without her . It gets harder for the other movies made during their marriage : she 's not credited on any of them . But one can look at patterns . The female roles during his 1956 - 62 period were incredibly strong \u2013 giving career - high roles to actors like Glynis Johns , Diana Dors , Yvonne Mitchell , Hayley Mills , Polly Bergen , Barrie Chase and Sylvia Syms . After Thompson 's marriage to Henry ended , the quality of female parts in his movies dropped away . He continued to be interested in young actresses \u2013 at different times he put Samantha Eggar , Shirley Ann Field and Talitha Pol under personal contract \u2013 but none of them had the opportunities of his ' 56 - 62 posse ( Pol , one of the most stunning actors of the sixties , which is saying something , later married John Paul Getty , quit acting and died of a heroin overdose ) . An interesting contrast is Thompson 's treatment of rape in Cape Fear ( Henry period ) and The Passage ( non - Henry ) . The former is a terrifying examination of that crime , with a particularly memorable subplot involving the impact of assault on a victim played by Barrie Chase ( giving a superb performance ) ; in the latter , the rape of a woman ( Kay Lenz ) at the hands of an SS Officer ( Malcolm McDowell ) is treated in an exploitative , camp way ( McDowell wears underpants with a swastika on them , Lenz is shown topless in a shower ) \u2026 it seems like a movie directed by an entirely different person . Thompson never had the same run of strong scripts that he did from ' 56 - 62 either . \u201c I freely admit I 've done some pretty bad stuff , \u201d he said in 1969 . \u201c It 's entirely my own fault . The trouble was I accepted some dismal scripts . I was n't tough enough \u2026 Writing is the fundamental thing . \u201d He tried to get out of action , making risky films like Before Winter Comes ( a tale of post - war refugees ) , Country Dance ( incest ) , A Great American Tragedy ( middle aged unemployment ) , Widow ( about a widow ) , and The White Buffalo ( Charles Bronson as Captain Ahab out west ) \u2013 but he could n't get there . What happened ? My theory : if you were a director married to a talented writer , it makes sense that you would get her to look at scripts , ask her opinion about things . If you cheated on that wife with starlets , it makes sense that that option may no longer be available . In his memoir One Man Tango , Anthony Quinn says that when Thompson started work on The Guns of Navarone the director refused to read a script and \u201c his direction consisted of one arbitrary decision after another : Gregory Peck would smoke a pipe ; I would grab a knife and look menacing ; David Niven would tinker with dynamite \u2026 Thompson had a tossed - off piece of business for each of us . \u201d Was this tossed off ? Or were they suggestions from Henry to make sure the lead characters in an ensemble piece were all distinct and easily identifiable ? Because there is a notable lack of similar bits of business in something like The Passage , where it is hard to tell the characters apart . Quinn went on to write that on Navarone Thompson \u201c Never read a scene until he had to shoot it and approached each shot on a whim . And yet the cumulative effect was astonishing . Lee Thompson made a marvelous picture but how ? Perhaps his inventiveness lay in defying convention , in rejecting the accepted methods of motion picture making and establishing his own . Perhaps it was in his very formlessness that he found the one form he could sustain , and nurture , the one form that could , in turn , sustain and nurture him . Perhaps he was just a lucky Englishman who pulled a good picture out of his ass . \u201d Or perhaps he had a wife at home giving him script advice which he could pass off on set as his own wisdom . Maybe Henry 's input was limited . But maybe it was n't . My own take is that Henry 's relationship with Thompson was analogous to Harrison Ford 's with the screenwriter Melissa Mathison ( she wrote ET , among others ) . The latter duo were married from 1983 to 2004 , Ford 's peak years of stardom , where he seemed to go from hit to hit ( a few stumbles , absolutely but the average was high ) . You would consistently read interviews with directors from this time who would comment on Ford giving \u201c excellent notes on the script \u201d . From the early 2000s onward , his record becomes a lot more patchy . Now , there could be plenty of reasons for this ( and my definition of \u201c patchy \u201d may be different from yours ) \u2013 but I would argue a contributing factor might just possibly be the fact that Melissa Mathison was n't giving him script advice anymore . And the same could be true for Joan Henry and J. Lee Thompson . The one Latin phrase I remember from my law days is \u201c Res ipsa loquitur \u201d which means \u201c the thing itself speaks \u201d . It 's used in negligence cases and means you can infer negligence from the nature of an accident or injury in the absence of direct evidence on how any defendant behaved . Look at the films J. Lee Thompson made when he was with Joan Henry . Then look at the ones he did without her . I believe , it 's a case of Res ipsa loquitur \u2013 the thing itself speaks . He was never as good without her .","annotations":[{"text":"in prison","span":[5532,5540],"token_span":[1072,1073],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"Where the Event takes place."},{"text":"the seconds","span":[5605,5615],"token_span":[1086,1087],"role":"Event","label":"Event","role_definition":"Name of the Event which is continuing."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"Filmink called it \" a masterpiece , a stunningly good drama , where Dors plays a character who never asks for sympathy but gets it anyway : she 's guilty of the crime , is n't friendly to her family or death penalty protestors , still loves the louse who drove her to murder .

The former is a terrifying examination of that crime , with a particularly memorable subplot involving the impact of assault on a victim played by Barrie Chase ( giving a superb performance ) ; in the latter , the rape of a woman ( Kay Lenz ) at the hands of an SS Officer ( Malcolm McDowell ) is treated in an exploitative , camp way ( McDowell wears underpants with a swastika on them , Lenz is shown topless in a shower ) \u2026 it seems like a movie directed by an entirely different person . Thompson never had the same run of strong scripts that he did from ' 56 - 62 either . \u201c I freely admit I 've done some pretty bad stuff , \u201d he said in 1969 . \u201c It 's entirely my own fault . The trouble was I accepted some dismal scripts . I was n't tough enough \u2026 Writing is the fundamental thing . \u201d He tried to get out of action , making risky films like Before Winter Comes ( a tale of post - war refugees ) , Country Dance ( incest ) , A Great American Tragedy ( middle aged unemployment ) , Widow ( about a widow ) , and The White Buffalo ( Charles Bronson as Captain Ahab out west ) \u2013 but he could n't get there . What happened ? My theory : if you were a director married to a talented writer , it makes sense that you would get her to look at scripts , ask her opinion about things . If you cheated on that wife with starlets , it makes sense that that option may no longer be available . In his memoir One Man Tango , Anthony Quinn says that when Thompson started work on The Guns of Navarone the director refused to read a script and \u201c his direction consisted of one arbitrary decision after another : Gregory Peck would smoke a pipe ; I would grab a knife and look menacing ; David Niven would tinker with dynamite \u2026 Thompson had a tossed - off piece of business for each of us . \u201d Was this tossed off ? Or were they suggestions from Henry to make sure the lead characters in an ensemble piece were all distinct and easily identifiable ? Because there is a notable lack of similar bits of business in something like The Passage , where it is hard to tell the characters apart . Quinn went on to write that on Navarone Thompson \u201c Never read a scene until he had to shoot it and approached each shot on a whim . And yet the cumulative effect was astonishing . Lee Thompson made a marvelous picture but how ? Perhaps his inventiveness lay in defying convention , in rejecting the accepted methods of motion picture making and establishing his own . Perhaps it was in his very formlessness that he found the one form he could sustain , and nurture , the one form that could , in turn , sustain and nurture him . Perhaps he was just a lucky Englishman who pulled a good picture out of his ass . \u201d Or perhaps he had a wife at home giving him script advice which he could pass off on set as his own wisdom . Maybe Henry 's input was limited . But maybe it was n't . My own take is that Henry 's relationship with Thompson was analogous to Harrison Ford 's with the screenwriter Melissa Mathison ( she wrote ET , among others ) . The latter duo were married from 1983 to 2004 , Ford 's peak years of stardom , where he seemed to go from hit to hit ( a few stumbles , absolutely but the average was high ) . You would consistently read interviews with directors from this time who would comment on Ford giving \u201c excellent notes on the script \u201d . From the early 2000s onward , his record becomes a lot more patchy . Now , there could be plenty of reasons for this ( and my definition of \u201c patchy \u201d may be different from yours ) \u2013 but I would argue a contributing factor might just possibly be the fact that Melissa Mathison was n't giving him script advice anymore . And the same could be true for Joan Henry and J. Lee Thompson . The one Latin phrase I remember from my law days is \u201c Res ipsa loquitur \u201d which means \u201c the thing itself speaks \u201d . It 's used in negligence cases and means you can infer negligence from the nature of an accident or injury in the absence of direct evidence on how any defendant behaved . Look at the films J. Lee Thompson made when he was with Joan Henry . Then look at the ones he did without her . I believe , it 's a case of Res ipsa loquitur \u2013 the thing itself speaks . He was never as good without her .","annotations":[{"text":"the seconds","span":[5605,5615],"token_span":[1086,1087],"role":"Event","label":"Event","role_definition":"Name of the Event which is continuing."},{"text":"prison","span":[5535,5540],"token_span":[1073,1073],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"Where the Event takes place."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"test"},{"instance_id":"EN-0054-499-frame-Process_end","frame":"Process_end","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Process comes to an end.","frame_ancestors":["Event"],"frame_descendants":["Activity_finish","Finish_game","Finish_competition"],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"The ruthless Bennett era was finally over .

Georgian , Russian and South Ossetian forces were all involved . There were also clashes in Abkhazia , and Russian attacks on other parts of Georgia . The separatist administrations in South Ossetia and Abkhazia have been trying to gain formal independence since breaking away in the early 1990s . Russia has now recognised them as independent - a move condemned by Western nations . Tensions in both regions began to escalate after Mikheil Saakashvili was elected Georgian president in 2004 , on a promise to re-unite the country . The conflicts had remained largely frozen , despite occasional flare - ups , before August 2008 . What triggered the crisis ? A series of clashes between Georgian and South Ossetian forces in the summer of 2008 prompted Georgia to launch an aerial bombardment and ground attack on South Ossetia on 7 August . Georgian forces controlled the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali , for part of the following day . Russia , meanwhile , poured thousands of troops into South Ossetia , and launched bombing raids both over the province and on targets in the rest of Georgia . There have been unverified reports of war crimes on both sides . Did the Russian forces enter South Ossetia before or after the Georgian attack ? This is unclear . Georgia says it began its assault after learning that a large convoy of Russian armour was coming through the Roki tunnel , from North Ossetia into South Ossetia . Russia says it acted to defend Russian citizens in South Ossetia , and its own peacekeepers stationed in the breakaway region . How did the conflict develop ? Russian forces occupied parts of Georgia adjoining South Ossetia , including the town of Gori , a strategic town on the main road linking eastern and western Georgia . They also moved from bases in Abkhazia into parts of western Georgia , and the Russian fleet went into action against the Georgian navy . Abkhaz forces recaptured the Kodori Gorge - a region of Abkhazia taken by Georgian troops in 2006 . Who are the main casualties ? Large numbers of civilians were driven out of their homes in South Ossetia . Many South Ossetians crossed over to the Russian republic of North Ossetia . Residents of Georgian villages in South Ossetia , and the town of Gori , also fled . The heavy fighting left the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali , largely in ruins . Why is Russia involved ? More than half of South Ossetia 's 70,000 citizens are said to have taken up Moscow 's offer of Russian citizenship . Russia says its actions were designed to protect those citizens . Russia also had peacekeepers based in South Ossetia . Some of these were killed in the Georgian attack on 7 August . Until recently , Russia said it respected Georgia 's territorial integrity , and only wanted to look out for Russian citizens . But , following Georgia 's military action , Russia recognised the independence of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia on 26 August . The US and France were swift to condemn Russia 's move , calling it \" regrettable , \" while the the UK categorically rejected it . Nato said the declaration violated numerous UN Security Council resolutions that Russia itself had endorsed . Russia has also signed friendship treaties with the breakaway regions , formalising diplomatic ties and pledging military assistance . Does Georgia have links to Nato ? President Saakashvili has made membership of Nato one of his main goals - and Nato agreed in April 2008 that Georgia would become a member of the alliance at some unspecified date in the future . The country has had a close relationship with the United States - sending troops to join the US - led coalition in Iraq . The US has helped to train and arm the Georgian military . It also helped Georgian troops return from Iraq after the Russian incursion into South Ossetia . What is the status of South Ossetia ? South Ossetia has run its own affairs since fighting for independence from Georgia in 1991 - 92 , in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union . Like the other breakaway region , Abkhazia , it declared its independence - but so far only Russia and Nicaragua have recognised them . Why do Ossetians want to break away ? The Ossetians are a distinct ethnic group originally from the Russian plains just south of the Don river . In the 13th Century , they were pushed southwards by Mongol invasions into the Caucasus mountains , settling along the border with Georgia . South Ossetians want to join up with their ethnic brethren in North Ossetia , which is an autonomous republic within the Russian Federation . Ethnic Georgians are a minority in South Ossetia , accounting for less than one - third of the population . But Georgia rejects even the name South Ossetia , preferring to call it by the ancient name of Samachablo , or Tskhinvali , after its main city . Are tensions over energy supplies a factor in the conflict ? A Western-sponsored pipeline has been pumping Caspian oil from Azerbaijan through Georgia to Turkey 's Mediterranean coast . The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan ( BTC ) pipeline can deliver up to 1.2 million barrels per day ( b/d ) of oil to Western markets . But the flow has been suspended since an explosion on part of the line in eastern Turkey in August . The Georgia conflict has delayed a resumption of deliveries . A smaller oil export pipeline runs from Azerbaijan to Georgia 's Black Sea port of Supsa . There are plans for another pipeline to take natural gas from Azerbaijan and Central Asia , via Turkey to Austria . The EU and US are anxious to diversify their energy sources , to avoid being too dependent on supplies transiting through Russia . Moscow already controls an oil export pipeline running from the Caspian to the Black Sea via the North Caucasus . Russian troops did not try to seize the BTC pipeline - and Moscow did not highlight energy as an issue in the conflict . But fears of instability in the Caucasus have made Western leaders and investors reassess their reliance on the region 's energy sources . How has the international community responded to the conflict ? The US has expressed solidarity and backing for Georgia , calling Russia 's actions \" an illegitimate , unilateral attempt to change the country 's borders by force \" . On a trip to Georgia , US Vice - President Dick Cheney said Russia 's actions had cast \" grave doubt \" on the country 's reliability as a partner within the international system . Georgia 's European neighbours have been somewhat more divided over how to react to the crisis at their heart . At an emergency summit in Brussels , some member states pushed for sanctions against Russia , seeking to isolate the country . In the end , the EU condemned Russia 's actions , called for it to meet the terms of the French -brokered ceasefire and suspended talks on a new partnership agreement with the bloc . The US has pledged to provide a $ 1 bn ( \u00a3 564 m ) aid package for reconstruction , resettlement and humanitarian needs . The IMF too has agreed in principle to give Georgia a $ 750 m ( \u00a3 422 m ) loan to help repair the conflict 's damage . What are EU observers doing in Georgia ? The European Union has sent more than 200 observers to Georgia , in line with a 12 August ceasefire deal brokered by French President Nicolas Sarkozy . Their operation began on 1 October and their mission 's initial duration is one year . The unarmed observers , from 22 EU countries , are working in close co-ordination with the United Nations and the European security body , the OSCE . One of their key tasks was to monitor the Russian troop withdrawal from \" security zones \" established by Russia around South Ossetia and Abkhazia . Russia completed its troop pull - out as promised by 10 October , but it plans to keep nearly 8,000 troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia . Russia has refused to let the monitors enter the two breakaway regions . The EU observers have the task of ensuring that the situation stabilises in the conflict zone , that human rights are not violated there and that internally displaced people can return home . Their liaison work is aimed at confidence - building and an easing of tensions . How does the conflict mark a change in Russia 's relations with the world ? Russian intervention in Georgia has been followed by an explicit shift in the country 's foreign policy , laid out by the president . Mr Medvedev has pledged to continue to defend the lives and dignity of its citizens , wherever they are located . He said that while Russia does not seek isolation , and desires friendly relations with Europe and the US , it cannot accept a world order that places a single state - even the US - as sole global decision - maker . Russia , he said , seeks to maintain privileged interests in its spheres of influence - including those bordering the country .","annotations":[{"text":"Fighting","span":[4,11],"token_span":[2,2],"role":"Event","label":"Event","role_definition":"Name of the Event which occurs."},{"text":"in Georgia 's breakaway region of South Ossetia","span":[13,59],"token_span":[3,10],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"Where the Event takes place."},{"text":"in August","span":[61,69],"token_span":[11,12],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the Event occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"v1_1":{"report":{"text":"In January 2008 , the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation launched a \" counter- terrorism \" operation in Ingushetia after receiving information that insurgents had been preparing a series of attacks .

The US has pledged to provide a $ 1 bn ( \u00a3 564 m ) aid package for reconstruction , resettlement and humanitarian needs . The IMF too has agreed in principle to give Georgia a $ 750 m ( \u00a3 422 m ) loan to help repair the conflict 's damage . What are EU observers doing in Georgia ? The European Union has sent more than 200 observers to Georgia , in line with a 12 August ceasefire deal brokered by French President Nicolas Sarkozy . Their operation began on 1 October and their mission 's initial duration is one year . The unarmed observers , from 22 EU countries , are working in close co-ordination with the United Nations and the European security body , the OSCE . One of their key tasks was to monitor the Russian troop withdrawal from \" security zones \" established by Russia around South Ossetia and Abkhazia . Russia completed its troop pull - out as promised by 10 October , but it plans to keep nearly 8,000 troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia . Russia has refused to let the monitors enter the two breakaway regions . The EU observers have the task of ensuring that the situation stabilises in the conflict zone , that human rights are not violated there and that internally displaced people can return home . Their liaison work is aimed at confidence - building and an easing of tensions . How does the conflict mark a change in Russia 's relations with the world ? Russian intervention in Georgia has been followed by an explicit shift in the country 's foreign policy , laid out by the president . Mr Medvedev has pledged to continue to defend the lives and dignity of its citizens , wherever they are located . He said that while Russia does not seek isolation , and desires friendly relations with Europe and the US , it cannot accept a world order that places a single state - even the US - as sole global decision - maker . Russia , he said , seeks to maintain privileged interests in its spheres of influence - including those bordering the country .","annotations":[{"text":"Fighting","span":[4,11],"token_span":[2,2],"role":"Event","label":"Event","role_definition":"Name of the Event which occurs."},{"text":"August 2008","span":[763,773],"token_span":[129,130],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"When the Event occurs."},{"text":"South Ossetia","span":[47,59],"token_span":[9,10],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"Where the Event takes place."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"test"},{"instance_id":"EN-5048-444-frame-Process_stop","frame":"Process_stop","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Process stops at a certain Time and Place.","frame_ancestors":["Event"],"frame_descendants":["Activity_stop","Halt"],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"Los Angeles Times , 5 Dec. 1958 : A9 .

The pathologist sends your doctor a report that gives a diagnosis for each sample taken . Information in this report will be used to help manage your care . The questions and answers that follow are meant to help you understand medical language you might find in the pathology report from a breast biopsy , such as a needle biopsy or an excision biopsy . In a needle biopsy , a needle is used to remove a sample of an abnormal area . An excision biopsy removes the entire abnormal area , often with some of the surrounding normal tissue . An excision biopsy is much like a type of breast - conserving surgery called a lumpectomy . What is carcinoma ? This is a term used to describe a cancer that begins in the lining layer ( epithelial cells ) of organs like the breast . Nearly all breast cancers are carcinomas . What is in - situ carcinoma ( or carcinoma in situ ) of the breast ? This term is used for the earliest stage of breast cancer , when it is confined to the layer of cells where it began . The normal breast is made of tiny tubes ( ducts ) that end in a group of sacs ( lobules ) . Cancer starts in the cells lining the ducts or lobules , when a normal cell becomes a carcinoma cell . As long as the carcinoma cells are still confined to the breast ducts or lobules , and do not break out and grow into surrounding tissue , it is considered in - situ carcinoma ( also known as carcinoma in situ , or CIS ) . Once the carcinoma cells have grown and broken out of the ducts or lobules , it is called invasive or infiltrating carcinoma . In an invasive carcinoma , the tumor cells can spread ( metastasize ) to other parts of your body . What does it mean if my in - situ carcinoma is called ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) , intraductal carcinoma , or in - situ carcinoma with duct and lobular features ? There are 2 main types of in - situ carcinoma of the breast : ductal carcinoma in - situ ( DCIS ) and lobular carcinoma in situ ( LCIS ) . Intraductal carcinoma is another name for ductal carcinoma in - situ . LCIS is discussed on a different page . Sometimes DCIS and LCIS are both found in the same biopsy . In - situ carcinoma with duct and lobular features means that the in - situ carcinoma looks like DCIS in some ways and LCIS in some ways ( when looked at under the microscope ) , and so the pathologist ca n't call it one or the other . If DCIS is left untreated , it can go on to become an invasive cancer , so it is often called a pre-cancer . Still , we do n't really understand it well . We do n't think that all DCIS would go on to become invasive cancer , but we ca n't tell which DCIS would be safe to leave untreated . Treatment is aimed at getting rid of all the DCIS , usually by surgery . In some cases , radiation ( radiotherapy ) or hormone therapy ( like tamoxifen ) is given after surgery to lower the chance that it will come back later ( recur ) or that invasive carcinoma will occur . What does it mean if my report mentions E-cadherin ? E-cadherin is a test that the pathologist might use to help determine if the carcinoma in situ is ductal or lobular . If your report does not mention E-cadherin , it means that this test was not needed to make the distinction . What does it mean if my report describes my ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) as being cribriform , micropapillary , apocrine , comedo , with comedonecrosis , papillary , or solid ? These terms are used to describe certain ways that the DCIS looks under the microscope . Some of these are linked to a higher chance that the DCIS may come back after treatment , so finding them may change your treatment . Your doctor should discuss this with you . What does it mean if my ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) is described as being low grade , intermediate grade , or high grade ; or nuclear grade 1 , nuclear grade 2 , or nuclear grade 3 ; or low mitotic rate , intermediate mitotic rate , or high mitotic rate ? These are all different ways of describing how the DCIS looks under the microscope : - DCIS that is high grade , is nuclear grade 3 , or has a high mitotic rate is more likely to come back ( recur ) after it is removed with surgery . - DCIS that is low grade , is nuclear grade 1 , or has a low mitotic rate is less likely to come back after surgery . - DCIS that is intermediate grade , is nuclear grade 2 , or has an intermediate mitotic rate falls in between these two . Patients with higher grade DCIS may need additional treatment . What is the significance of the reported size of the ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) ? If the entire tumor or area of DCIS is removed ( such as in an excisional biopsy or breast - conserving surgery ) , the pathologist will say how big the DCIS is by measuring how long it is across ( in greatest dimension ) , either by looking at it under the microscope or by gross examination ( just looking at it with the naked eye ) of the tissue taken out at surgery . Another way to measure DCIS is to note the number of microscopic slides that contain DCIS . For example , the report may say that DCIS was found in 3 slides . On needle biopsy , measurements of the area of DCIS are not often reported because this type of biopsy only samples a part of the tumor . Later , when the entire area of DCIS is removed ( with surgery ) , an accurate measurement can be done . The larger the area of DCIS , the more likely it is to come back ( recur ) after surgery . Doctors use information about the size of the DCIS when recommending further treatments . What does it mean if my report mentions Paget disease ? Paget disease ( also called Paget 's disease , Paget disease of the nipple , or Paget disease of the breast ) is when cells resembling the cells of ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) are found in the skin of the nipple and the nearby skin ( the areola ) . Paget disease of the nipple is usually associated with DCIS or invasive carcinoma ( cancer ) in the underlying breast tissue . If Paget disease is found on needle or punch biopsy , more tissue in that area usually needs to be removed with the goal of entirely removing the area of Paget disease . Talk to your doctor about the best treatment for you . What does it mean if my report mentions special tests such as high molecular weight cytokeratin ( HMWCK ) , CK903 , CK5 / 6 , p63 , muscle specific actin , smooth muscle myosin heavy chain , calponin , or keratin ? These are special tests that the pathologist sometimes uses to help make the diagnosis of DCIS . Not all cases need these tests . Whether your report does or does not mention these tests has no bearing on the accuracy of your diagnosis . What does it mean if my report on ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) mentions estrogen receptor ( ER ) or progesterone receptor ( PR ) ? ER and PR are special tests that the pathologist does that are important in predicting response of the DCIS to hormone therapy ( like tamoxifen ) . Testing for ER is done for most cases of DCIS , but testing for PR is not typically needed . Results for ER and PR are reported separately and can be reported in different ways : - Negative , weakly positive , positive - Percent positive - Percent positive with something saying whether the staining is weak , moderate , or strong Ask your doctor how these results will affect your treatment . What if my report on ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) mentions margins or ink ? When the entire area of DCIS is removed , the outside surface ( edges or margins ) of the specimen is coated with ink , sometimes even with different colors of ink on different sides of the specimen . The pathologist looks at slides of the DCIS under the microscope to see how close the DCIS cells get to the ink ( the edges or margins of the specimen ) . If DCIS is touching the ink ( called positive margins ) , it can mean that some DCIS cells were left behind , and more surgery or other treatments may be needed . Sometimes , though , the surgeon has already removed more tissue ( at surgery ) to help make sure that this is n't needed . If your pathology report shows DCIS with positive margins , your doctor will talk to you about what treatment is best . What does it mean if my report also mentions atypical ductal hyperplasia ( ADH ) or atypical lobular hyperplasia ( ALH ) ? These findings are less serious than DCIS , and you should talk with your doctor about what these findings may mean to your care . What does it mean if my report also uses any of the following terms : usual ductal hyperplasia , adenosis , sclerosing adenosis , radial scar , complex sclerosing lesion , papillomatosis , papilloma , apocrine metaplasia , cysts , columnar cell change , collagenous spherulosis , duct ectasia , fibrocystic changes , flat epithelial atypia , or columnar alteration with prominent apical snouts and secretions ( CAPSS ) ? All of these are terms for benign ( non - cancerous changes ) that the pathologist might see under the microscope . They are not important when seen on a biopsy where there is DCIS . What does it mean if my report mentions microcalcifications or calcifications ? Microcalcifications or calcifications are calcium deposits that can be found in both non- cancerous and cancerous breast lesions . They can be seen both on mammograms and under the microscope . Because certain calcifications are found in areas containing cancer , their presence on a mammogram may lead to a biopsy of the area . Then , when the biopsy is done , the pathologist looks at the tissue removed to be sure that it contains calcifications . If the calcifications are there , the treating physician knows that the biopsy sampled the correct area ( the abnormal area with calcifications that was seen on the mammogram ) . What does it mean if my doctor asks for a special molecular ( genomic ) test , such as Oncotype DX\u00ae , to be done on my specimen ? Molecular tests may help predict the chances of DCIS coming back ( recurring ) in the breast , but not all cases need these tests . The results should be discussed with your doctor . The results do not affect your diagnosis , although they might affect your treatment .

Then , when the biopsy is done , the pathologist looks at the tissue removed to be sure that it contains calcifications . If the calcifications are there , the treating physician knows that the biopsy sampled the correct area ( the abnormal area with calcifications that was seen on the mammogram ) . What does it mean if my doctor asks for a special molecular ( genomic ) test , such as Oncotype DX\u00ae , to be done on my specimen ? Molecular tests may help predict the chances of DCIS coming back ( recurring ) in the breast , but not all cases need these tests . The results should be discussed with your doctor . The results do not affect your diagnosis , although they might affect your treatment .

Their tunnel boring machine ( TBM # 1 ) will dig its way from the University District Station to University of Washington Station during the summer , completing the twin bore tunnel segment along the corridor . That means that TBM # 1 will have dug four of the six tunnel segments from the Maple Leaf Portal to University of Washington Station , which roughly equates to 4.5 miles of tunneling ( the corridor itself is 3.5 miles ) . TBM # 1 is the same tunnel boring machine that made the first lap from University District Station to University of Washington , reaching the station on March 30th . Its companion tunnel boring machine was unfortunately damaged in December while digging from Roosevelt Station to University District Station , leading to the TBM to shut down completely for more than a month for in - tunnel repairs . The shutdown left TBM # 2 an agonizing 650 feet from the University District station box . But by late March , TBM # 2 made it to the University District itself . Sound Transit 's contractor then assessed whether to relaunch the TBM or swap it out . JCM determined that the best solution was to remove TBM # 2 and instead transport TBM # 1 to University District Station , and then reassemble and refurbish it for relaunch .

Their tunnel boring machine ( TBM # 1 ) will dig its way from the University District Station to University of Washington Station during the summer , completing the twin bore tunnel segment along the corridor . That means that TBM # 1 will have dug four of the six tunnel segments from the Maple Leaf Portal to University of Washington Station , which roughly equates to 4.5 miles of tunneling ( the corridor itself is 3.5 miles ) . TBM # 1 is the same tunnel boring machine that made the first lap from University District Station to University of Washington , reaching the station on March 30th . Its companion tunnel boring machine was unfortunately damaged in December while digging from Roosevelt Station to University District Station , leading to the TBM to shut down completely for more than a month for in - tunnel repairs . The shutdown left TBM # 2 an agonizing 650 feet from the University District station box . But by late March , TBM # 2 made it to the University District itself . Sound Transit 's contractor then assessed whether to relaunch the TBM or swap it out . JCM determined that the best solution was to remove TBM # 2 and instead transport TBM # 1 to University District Station , and then reassemble and refurbish it for relaunch . If TBM # 1 's last lap is anything to go by , transit enthusiasts can expect approximately 84 days of digging before the TBM reaches University of Washington Station .

Both players need matches before they will be seriously considered for League One action and Turner has said he is hoping to arrange another reserve match quickly so they can get more game time . But the growing injury list at Edgar Street means the pair will come into Turner 's thinking for the trip to Southend . \" With the problems that we have got they will be considered but at this stage it 's unlikely that they will be in the starting line - up , \" he said . There will be full commentary on Hereford 's game at Southend United on 94.7 FM as part of Sport on Saturday on BBC Hereford & Worcester .","annotations":[{"text":"Bulls","span":[209,213],"token_span":[36,36],"role":"Lessee","label":"Lessee","role_definition":"The individual that gains temporary use of the Goods by paying the Lessor"},{"text":"Robbie Threlfall","span":[92,107],"token_span":[16,17],"role":"Goods","label":"Goods","role_definition":"The role Goods is an item which is temporarily exchanged for Money in a transaction."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"test"},{"instance_id":"EN-8245-519-frame-Renting_out","frame":"Renting_out","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Lessor who owns some Goods allows a Lessee to use the Goods temporarily in exchange for Money.","frame_ancestors":["Commerce_sell","Giving","Intentionally_act","Event","Lose_possession","Eventive_affecting"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"He attracted press criticism for claiming \u00a3 17,000 in expenses to rent a London flat , despite owning another within walking distance of the House of Commons .

The \u201c Stella \u201d was bound for the Channel Islands on a holiday trip , And a number of passengers were resolved not to let the chance slip ; And the hearts of the passengers felt light and gay , As the \u201c Stella \u201d steamed out of the London Docks without delay . The vessel left London at a quarter - past eleven , With a full passenger list and a favourable wind from heaven ; And all went well until late in the afternoon , When all at once a mist arose , alas ! too soon . And as the Channel Islands were approached a fog set in , Then the passengers began to be afraid and made a chattering din ; And about half - past three o'clock the fog settled down , Which caused Captain Reeks and the passengers with fear to frown . And brave Captain Reeks felt rather nervous and discontent , Because to him it soon became quite evident ; And from his long experience he plainly did see That the fog was increasing in great density . Still the \u201c Stella \u201d sailed on at a very rapid rate , And , oh , heaven ! rushed headlong on to her fate , And passed o'er the jagged rocks without delay , And her side was ripped open : Oh ! horror and dismay ! Then all the passengers felt the terrible shock , As the \u201c Stella \u201d stuck fast upon the first ledge of rock ; And they rushed to the deck in wild alarm , While some of them cried : \u201c Oh ! God protect us from harm . \u201d Then men clasped wives and daughters , and friends shook hands , And unmoved Captain Reeks upon the bridge stands ; And he shouted , \u201c Get out the boats without delay ! \u201d Then the sailors and officers began to work without dismay . Again Captain Reeks cried in a manly clear voice , \u201c Let the women and children be our first choice ! \u201d Then the boats were loaded in a speedy way , And with brave seamen to navigate them that felt no dismay . Then the \u201c Stella \u201d began rapidly for to settle down , And Captain Reeks gave his last order without a frown , Shouting , \u201c Men , for yourselves , you 'll better look out ! \u201d Which they did , needing no second bidding , without fear or doubt . Then the male passengers rushed to the boats in wild despair , While the cries of the women and children rent the air ; Oh , heaven ! such a scene ! ' twas enough to make one weep , To see mothers trying to save their children that were fast asleep . Brave Captain Reeks stood on the bridge till the ship went down , With his eyes uplifted towards heaven , and on his face no frown ; And some of the passengers jumped from the ship into the sea , And tried hard to save their lives right manfully . But the sufferings of the survivors are pitiful to hear , And I think all Christian people for them will drop a tear , Because the rowers of the boata were exhausted with damp and cold ; And the heroine of the wreck was Miss Greta Williams , be it told . She remained in as open boat with her fellow - passengers and crew , And sang \u201c O rest in the Lord , and He will come to our rescue \u201d ; And for fourteen hours they were rowing on the mighty deep , And when each man was done with his turn he fell asleep . And about six o'clock in the morning a man shrieked out , \u201c There 's a sailing boat coming towards us without any doubt \u201d ; And before the sailing boat could get near , a steamer hove in sight , Which proved to be the steamer \u201c Lynx , \u201d to their delight . And they were conveyed to Guernsey without delay , Poor souls , with their hearts in a state of joy and dismay ; But alas ! more than eighty persons have been lost in the briny deep , But I hope their souls are now in heaven in safe keep . Disaster in the Channel Passenger Steamer Wrecked Great Loss of Life It is with the deepest regret that we announce that a terrible disaster has overtaken the London and South -Western Railway Company 's passenger steamer Stella , engaged in the Southampton and Channel Islands service . During a dense fog on Thursday afternoon she ran on the Casquets , and foundered in 12 or 15 minutes . The exact loss of life is not yet known , but it is feared that the list of victims of this calamity may reach a hundred . The Stella was one of three steel twin-screw steamers built for the London and South - Western Company by Messrs . J. and G. Thomson ( Limited ) , of Glasgow , and delivered in 1890 , the companion ships being the Lydia and the Frederica . The design of all three was substantially the same , the gross register of each being 1,059 tons , and the principal dimensions as follows :- Length , 250.0 ft . ; breadth , 35.1 ft . ; depth , 14.8 ft . All were lighted throughout by electricity , and complied with the Board of Trade requirements as to life - saving appliances . In each case triple expansion engines were fitted , the average speed attained in service being 18 knots , and the three steamers have been extremely popular , the masters and officers being men who have had long acquaintance with the navigation of the English Channel . Although the precise number cannot at present be stated \u2014 owing to the fact that it is not the practice to book the names of passengers on such short services \u2014 it is believed that the Stella was carrying about 140 persons to the Channel Islands , the journey being the first daylight trip of the season . Captain Reeks , a skilled and trusted seaman , was in charge , and the crew numbered 40 all told . The steamer left Southampton at 11:45 on Thursday morning , no fewer than 110 of the passengers having travelled from Waterloo the same morning by special train . Fog was encountered in the Channel , and it increased to such an extent that , although the fog-horn attached to the lighthouse on the Casquets could be heard , the rocks were invisible . Speed was not , however reduced . The Casquets , well known to all travellers to the Channel Islands , form an isolated group of rocks which rise abruptly from the water , and constitute the mariner 's last warning mark on the journey from Guernsey to England , being situate about eight miles W. of Alderney and 23 miles N.E. of Guernsey . The highest point of the group is surmounted by a powerful flashing light visible in favourable weather 15 miles . At four o'clock in the afternoon , when it was supposed by the navigating officer that the Casquets were about eight miles to the east , the Casquets suddenly loomed out of the darkness , and immediately afterwards the Stella struck the rock amidships . No panic ensued , but the master saw that the steamer had run upon one of the sharp ridges of the shoal , and was fast sinking . He ordered the five lifeboats which hung suspended from the davits and the two Berthon collapsible boats secured on the shade deck to be got ready and launched with all possible speed . The instruction was promptly obeyed by the crew , but the Berthon boats took a little longer to get out than the others . Women and children were first put into the boats , Mr. Wade , the chief officer , seeing that the captain 's orders were carried out , the male passengers and crew following , Captain Reeks remaining all the time at his post on the bridge . The sea was calm , but there was , as usual , a big swirl on the rocks . It was impossible for all on board to leave the vessel before she slipped off the rock , and sank stern foremost in deep water , her boilers at the same moment exploding with terrific force . One of the survivors , who got away in the dinghy , states that from the moment of striking to the disappearance of the Stella barely ten minutes had elapsed , and none of the survivors puts the time at more than 15 minutes . The suction produced by the sinking ship was very great , and the crew of the dinghy momentarily feared that their craft would be engulfed . Five of the boats were soon lost to sight in the fog , but the sixth , filled with ladies , was taken in tow by the dinghy , the occupants of which used the oars in turn . They rowed on all night until most of them dropped asleep from exhaustion . A second boat , which was in charge of the chief officer , capsized , and almost all its occupants were drowned . A few , however , were picked up by the other boats , which were then laden to the water 's edge . Between five and six o'clock yesterday morning the Great Western Railway Company 's steamer , Lynx , on her journey from Weymouth to Guernsey , came upon the scene , and rendered assistance . She stopped and picked up two boat-loads of passengers , 35 in all , and conveyed them to Guernsey . Owing to the fog the incoming Great Western boat from Weymouth , due at St. Heliers , Jersey , at 8 o'clock on Thursday evening , did not arrive at that port until 1 o'clock yesterday morning . She , however , had heard nothing of the , disaster . The Dora , another South - Western packet , arrived at Jersey direct from Southampton about noon yesterday and reported having passed two other boats which had contained 35 passengers and nine of the crew . In addition to the South - Western Company 's steamer Honfleur , various Alderney boats received orders to proceed to the neighbourhood of the wreck . The South - Western Railway Company 's new steamer Vera , which left Southampton on Thursday at midnight , arrived at Guernsey at 9 o'clock yesterday morning with 40 more survivors , including 20 ladies , whom she had picked up near the scene of the wreck . In addition to those landed at Guernsey , some of the rescued were taken on to Jersey by other vessels , but it is calculated that not many more than 100 have been saved out of double that number on board . The disaster created the greatest excitement and consternation in the Channel Islands and in Southampton . Many Guernsey families have lost one or more of their members , and the South - Western Railway offices were yesterday besieged by anxious relatives and friends of those aboard the illfated steamer . Flags were at half - mast in St. Peter Port . The Honfleur last night returned to Guernsey from a search at the scene of the -wreck . The captain stated that the Stella must have sunk in 13 fathoms . He says he signalled the Casquets lighthouse \u2014 \u201d Have you seen or heard of a vessel wrecked ? \u201d and the reply came \u201c Yesterday afternoon heard steamer . \u201d The captain replied : \u2014 \u201c I shall stay about and see if I can pick up anything from wreck . \u201d The captain then made a complete circle of the Casquets , picking up several life belts , and two boats containing ladies ' wearing apparel , handbags , money , jewelry , opera glasses and case , the latter having been used for baling purposes . Mr. Spencer , the Guernsey manager of the South -Western Company , telegraphed early yesterday morning to Alderney requesting a boat to be sent to search for any survivors . This boat afterwards returned with nothing to report . Some very pathetic incidents are reported in connexion with the wreck . A lady . who had ; come over from Southampton with her husband and child to visit her father states that she and the child were pressed into a boat by the husband , who refused her entreaty to be allowed to stay with him , begging her to go for the sake of the children . He remained behind and . perished . The bereaved woman expresses her surprise and admiration at the calmness an courage displayed by every one on board . She noticed a lady friend of hers gathering up luggage and a little boy arranging his toys . These both perished immediately afterwards . Another lady has lost her husband and her only child , the husband having pressed her into a full boat , just missing it himself . Among the missing is a sister of one of the most popular clergymen on the island . One lady who lost her husband and child is reported to have since lost her reason and is driving about the island looking for the missing ones . Apparently every effort was made to save life , belts being distributed broadcast . The Times , 1st April 1899 Further Reading - S.S.

The \u201c Stella \u201d was bound for the Channel Islands on a holiday trip , And a number of passengers were resolved not to let the chance slip ; And the hearts of the passengers felt light and gay , As the \u201c Stella \u201d steamed out of the London Docks without delay . The vessel left London at a quarter - past eleven , With a full passenger list and a favourable wind from heaven ; And all went well until late in the afternoon , When all at once a mist arose , alas ! too soon . And as the Channel Islands were approached a fog set in , Then the passengers began to be afraid and made a chattering din ; And about half - past three o'clock the fog settled down , Which caused Captain Reeks and the passengers with fear to frown . And brave Captain Reeks felt rather nervous and discontent , Because to him it soon became quite evident ; And from his long experience he plainly did see That the fog was increasing in great density . Still the \u201c Stella \u201d sailed on at a very rapid rate , And , oh , heaven ! rushed headlong on to her fate , And passed o'er the jagged rocks without delay , And her side was ripped open : Oh ! horror and dismay ! Then all the passengers felt the terrible shock , As the \u201c Stella \u201d stuck fast upon the first ledge of rock ; And they rushed to the deck in wild alarm , While some of them cried : \u201c Oh ! God protect us from harm . \u201d Then men clasped wives and daughters , and friends shook hands , And unmoved Captain Reeks upon the bridge stands ; And he shouted , \u201c Get out the boats without delay ! \u201d Then the sailors and officers began to work without dismay . Again Captain Reeks cried in a manly clear voice , \u201c Let the women and children be our first choice ! \u201d Then the boats were loaded in a speedy way , And with brave seamen to navigate them that felt no dismay . Then the \u201c Stella \u201d began rapidly for to settle down , And Captain Reeks gave his last order without a frown , Shouting , \u201c Men , for yourselves , you 'll better look out ! \u201d Which they did , needing no second bidding , without fear or doubt . Then the male passengers rushed to the boats in wild despair , While the cries of the women and children rent the air ; Oh , heaven ! such a scene ! ' twas enough to make one weep , To see mothers trying to save their children that were fast asleep . Brave Captain Reeks stood on the bridge till the ship went down , With his eyes uplifted towards heaven , and on his face no frown ; And some of the passengers jumped from the ship into the sea , And tried hard to save their lives right manfully . But the sufferings of the survivors are pitiful to hear , And I think all Christian people for them will drop a tear , Because the rowers of the boata were exhausted with damp and cold ; And the heroine of the wreck was Miss Greta Williams , be it told . She remained in as open boat with her fellow - passengers and crew , And sang \u201c O rest in the Lord , and He will come to our rescue \u201d ; And for fourteen hours they were rowing on the mighty deep , And when each man was done with his turn he fell asleep . And about six o'clock in the morning a man shrieked out , \u201c There 's a sailing boat coming towards us without any doubt \u201d ; And before the sailing boat could get near , a steamer hove in sight , Which proved to be the steamer \u201c Lynx , \u201d to their delight . And they were conveyed to Guernsey without delay , Poor souls , with their hearts in a state of joy and dismay ; But alas ! more than eighty persons have been lost in the briny deep , But I hope their souls are now in heaven in safe keep . Disaster in the Channel Passenger Steamer Wrecked Great Loss of Life It is with the deepest regret that we announce that a terrible disaster has overtaken the London and South -Western Railway Company 's passenger steamer Stella , engaged in the Southampton and Channel Islands service . During a dense fog on Thursday afternoon she ran on the Casquets , and foundered in 12 or 15 minutes . The exact loss of life is not yet known , but it is feared that the list of victims of this calamity may reach a hundred . The Stella was one of three steel twin-screw steamers built for the London and South - Western Company by Messrs . J. and G. Thomson ( Limited ) , of Glasgow , and delivered in 1890 , the companion ships being the Lydia and the Frederica . The design of all three was substantially the same , the gross register of each being 1,059 tons , and the principal dimensions as follows :- Length , 250.0 ft . ; breadth , 35.1 ft . ; depth , 14.8 ft . All were lighted throughout by electricity , and complied with the Board of Trade requirements as to life - saving appliances . In each case triple expansion engines were fitted , the average speed attained in service being 18 knots , and the three steamers have been extremely popular , the masters and officers being men who have had long acquaintance with the navigation of the English Channel . Although the precise number cannot at present be stated \u2014 owing to the fact that it is not the practice to book the names of passengers on such short services \u2014 it is believed that the Stella was carrying about 140 persons to the Channel Islands , the journey being the first daylight trip of the season . Captain Reeks , a skilled and trusted seaman , was in charge , and the crew numbered 40 all told . The steamer left Southampton at 11:45 on Thursday morning , no fewer than 110 of the passengers having travelled from Waterloo the same morning by special train . Fog was encountered in the Channel , and it increased to such an extent that , although the fog-horn attached to the lighthouse on the Casquets could be heard , the rocks were invisible . Speed was not , however reduced . The Casquets , well known to all travellers to the Channel Islands , form an isolated group of rocks which rise abruptly from the water , and constitute the mariner 's last warning mark on the journey from Guernsey to England , being situate about eight miles W. of Alderney and 23 miles N.E. of Guernsey . The highest point of the group is surmounted by a powerful flashing light visible in favourable weather 15 miles . At four o'clock in the afternoon , when it was supposed by the navigating officer that the Casquets were about eight miles to the east , the Casquets suddenly loomed out of the darkness , and immediately afterwards the Stella struck the rock amidships . No panic ensued , but the master saw that the steamer had run upon one of the sharp ridges of the shoal , and was fast sinking . He ordered the five lifeboats which hung suspended from the davits and the two Berthon collapsible boats secured on the shade deck to be got ready and launched with all possible speed . The instruction was promptly obeyed by the crew , but the Berthon boats took a little longer to get out than the others . Women and children were first put into the boats , Mr. Wade , the chief officer , seeing that the captain 's orders were carried out , the male passengers and crew following , Captain Reeks remaining all the time at his post on the bridge . The sea was calm , but there was , as usual , a big swirl on the rocks . It was impossible for all on board to leave the vessel before she slipped off the rock , and sank stern foremost in deep water , her boilers at the same moment exploding with terrific force . One of the survivors , who got away in the dinghy , states that from the moment of striking to the disappearance of the Stella barely ten minutes had elapsed , and none of the survivors puts the time at more than 15 minutes . The suction produced by the sinking ship was very great , and the crew of the dinghy momentarily feared that their craft would be engulfed . Five of the boats were soon lost to sight in the fog , but the sixth , filled with ladies , was taken in tow by the dinghy , the occupants of which used the oars in turn . They rowed on all night until most of them dropped asleep from exhaustion . A second boat , which was in charge of the chief officer , capsized , and almost all its occupants were drowned . A few , however , were picked up by the other boats , which were then laden to the water 's edge . Between five and six o'clock yesterday morning the Great Western Railway Company 's steamer , Lynx , on her journey from Weymouth to Guernsey , came upon the scene , and rendered assistance . She stopped and picked up two boat-loads of passengers , 35 in all , and conveyed them to Guernsey .

The problem , heretofore , with sunflower seeds was the difficulty of dehulling them at home , and the lack of a device for expressing oil from the seeds . About six months ago , we decided to change all that . The job was to find out who makes a sunflower seed dehuller or to devise one if none were manufactured . And to either locate a home - scale oilseed press or devise one . No mean task . Our researches took us from North Dakota -- hub of commercial sunflower activity in the nation -- to a search of the files in the U.S. Patent Office , with stops in between . We turned up a lot of big machinery , discovered how difficult it is to buy really pure , unrefined vegetable oils , but found no small - scale equipment to dehull sunflowers or press out their oil . The key to success , however , was on our desk the whole time . In spring 1977 , August Kormier had submitted a free - lance article describing how he used a Corona grain mill to dehull his sunflower seeds , and his vacuum cleaner exhaust hose to blow the hulls off the kernels . A second separation floated off the remaining hulls , leaving a clean product . We 'd tried it , but because some kernels were cracked and the process involved drying , we had n't been satisfied . Now we felt the best approach was to begin again with what we learned from Mr. Kormier and refine it . The key to success , however , was on our desk the whole time .

A second separation floated off the remaining hulls , leaving a clean product . We 'd tried it , but because some kernels were cracked and the process involved drying , we had n't been satisfied . Now we felt the best approach was to begin again with what we learned from Mr. Kormier and refine it . A pound of oilseed produced just under three ounces of oil . Staff Editor Diana Branch and Home Workplace Editor Jim Eldon worked with a number of hand - and electric- powered grain mills . While the Corona did a passable job , they got the best results with the C.S. Bell # 60 hand mill and the Marathon Uni Mill , which is motor-driven . \" I could n't believe my eyes the first time I tried the Marathon , \" Diana says . \" I opened the stones to 1/8th inch , and out came a bin full of whole kernels and hulls split right at the seams . What a thrill that was ! \" She found that by starting at the widest setting , and gradually narrowing the opening , almost every seed was dehulled . The stones crack the hulls open , then rub them to encourage the seed away from the fibrous lining . The Bell hand mill worked almost as well . \" As long as the stones open at least as wide as the widest unhulled seed , any mill will work , \" she says . Because the seed slips through the mill on its flat side , grading is an important step to take before dehulling . We made three sizing boxes . The first is 1/4-inch hardware cloth [ wire screen ] . The second is two layers of 1/4-inch cloth , moved slightly apart to narrow the opening in one direction , and the third is two layers of screen adjusted to make a still- smaller opening . Since the smallest unhulled seeds are about the size of the largest hulled kernels , the grading step prevents these undersized seeds from passing through unhulled . Processed together at a closer setting , the smallest seeds hulled out . A hardware cloth grader sizes the kernels for better hulling . Two layers of cloth , spaced slightly apart , narrow the hole for a second grading . The more grading , the better the hulling . Jim Eldon 's workshop is littered with strange - looking pieces of apparatus . They represent initial attempts to build a workable winnowing box , using Kormier 's vacuum exhaust idea for a source of air . Jim , Fred Matlack and Diana finally made a box with a Plexiglas front , through which they could observe what was happening . They cut a hole in the back of the box with a sliding cover to regulate the air pressure , and fiddled with various arrangements of baffles . The result was a stream of hulls exiting through one hole while the kernels fell to the bottom of the box . Now they were ready to try a five - pound sample of unhulled sunflower seeds to see how much they could recover . The five pounds were graded and dehulled , then winnowed . We got about one hull for every ten kernels in the final , winnowed product . These are easily picked out . They usually contain kernels still held behind the fibrous strings of the hull . Their weight prevents them from blowing out with the empty hulls . We found that bug -eaten seeds do blow away with the chaff , which was a bonus for cleanliness of the final product . Toss the hulls to the birds , who will find broken seeds among them . Starting with 80 ounces of unhulled seed , we ended up with 41 - 1/4 ounces of edible whole seeds , 1.8 ounces of damaged seeds suitable for animal feed , and 36.6 ounces of hulls . It took us about an hour . Not bad . Sunflower seeds store perfectly in the hulls , but they deteriorate more rapidly when shelled out . The grain mill dehuller and winnowing box give the gardener a way to have the freshest possible seeds for eating at all times of the year . With the construction of one more piece of equipment -- the oil press -- he can have absolutely fresh , unrefined , polyunsaturated sunflower oil for salads , mayonnaise and cooking . Most light , refined vegetable oils have been extracted using hexane , a form of naphtha . The oil is then heated to boil off the hexane . Lye is dumped into it . It 's washed with steam , then heated to remove odors and taste before being laced with preservatives and stabilizers . It may feel oily in the mouth , but you might as well taste air . No so with fresh - made sunflower oil -- it 's deliciously yet subtly nutty in flavor , adding unsurpassed flavor to salads .

No so with fresh - made sunflower oil -- it 's deliciously yet subtly nutty in flavor , adding unsurpassed flavor to salads . A little heat and the oil pours out of the pistonlike cylinder , then to be strained with a paint filter . There 's good reason to believe that sunflower oil may become the # 1 vegetable oil in the U.S. in a few years . It 's already # 1 in health - conscious Europe . Corn oil has already caught on here for health reasons , and sunflower oil is so much better . Sunflower oil 's 70 percent polyunsaturate is just under safflower , with corn oil bringing up the rear with 55 percent . And sunflowers yield 40 percent oil , soybeans only 20 percent . Our oil press is relatively simple , but it must be welded together . Check the construction directions for details . The press consists of a welded tubular frame which accepts a three - ton hydraulic jack . You may already have one . If not , it can be purchased at most auto and hardware stores for about $ 16 . A metal canister with holes drilled in its sides and one end welded shut holds the mashed sunflower seeds . A piston is inserted in the canister and then inverted and slipped over a pedestal on the frame . The jack is set in place , and the pressure gradually increased over half an hour . The oil drips from the sides of the canister into a tray -- the bottom of a plastic jug slipped over the pedestal works fine -- which empties the oil into a cup . You can filter the oil with a coffee filter to remove pieces of seed and other fine particles that would burn if the oil were used for cooking . If it 's for salads or mayonnaise , there 's no need to filter it . We first tried using \" confectionary \" sunflower seeds for oil . These are the regular eating kernels we 're used to seeing . They give less than half as much oil as the oilseed types of sunflower . Although you can use confectionary types such as MAMMOTH RUS - SIAN for oil , do n't expect to get more than an ounce and a half from a pound of seed . Oilseed produces three or more ounces of oil from a pound of seed and is well worth planting along with confectionary - type seeds . Oilseed has another big advantage -- to prepare it , you can put the whole , unhulled seed into a blender and whiz it until it forms a fine meal , while confectionary seeds must be dehulled first . The entire sequence of grading , dehulling and winnowing is avoided with oilseed . We first tried using \" confectionary \" sunflower seeds for oil .

The entire sequence of grading , dehulling and winnowing is avoided with oilseed . Two kinds of sunflower seeds -- oilseeds on the left , confectionary on the right . Oil types produce about a tenth of a pound of seed per head in commercial production . Gardeners , with their better soil and care , invariably do better than that . Our conservative estimate is that 1,280 plants will be enough for three gallons of oil . Spaced one foot apart in rows two feet apart , 1,280 oilseed plants will take a space 40 - by - 56 feet , or 80 - by - 28 if you want a more rectangular patch to face south . We worked in pound batches , since the canister just holds one pound of mash . After blending , we heated it to 170 degrees F. ( 77 deg C ) by placing it in a 300 - degree F. ( 149 deg C ) oven and stirring it every five minutes for 20 minutes . Heating gets the oil flowing and doubles the yield of oil . In case you 're wondering , \" cold - pressed \" oils sold commercially are also heated , and some are subjected to the entire chemical process . The term has no firm meaning within the industry , according to the literature we 've surveyed . Heating does not change the structure of fats . It will not turn polyunsaturated fats into saturated fats . In fact , Dr. Donald R. Germann in his book , \" The Anti-Cancer Diet \" , says that \" ... an unsaturated fat must be heated to high temperatures -- above 425 degrees F. or 200 degrees C. -- at least 8 or 10 times before any shift toward saturation occurs ... \" Dean C. Fletcher , Ph.D. , of the American Medical Association Department of Foods and Nutrition in Chicago , says , \" It 's true that either high temperature or repeated heating does change the nature of some of the unsaturated oil molecules . ( But ) the flavor of the oil changes as these chemical changes occur , spoiling its taste . This effect is probably more profound than any of the physiological changes the altered oil might produce within the body . \" From 500 gm. of heated mash , we pressed 89 gm . of oil , 89 percent of the entire amount available and twice as much as we could press from unheated oil ! The decision is up to you whether or not to heat the mash , but that extra 50 percent seems like an awful lot , especially when the whole technique is so labor intensive . The oil should be stored in the refrigerator , and it 's probably best to use it within a month , since it has no preservatives . Mayonnaise made with such fresh oils should be kept refrigerated and used within two weeks . The leftover cake , still containing 50 percent of its oil , is a nutritious addition to your dishes , and makes excellent feed for animals or winter birds . Store the pressed cake in the freezer . We 're talking then about a sunflower patch with two kinds of plants -- confectionary such as MAMMOTH RUSSIAN and oilseed such as PEREDOVIK . The oilseed plants should be grown 12 inches apart in rows two feet apart . Four average confectionary heads yield about a pound of unhulled seed . You 'll need about 35 pounds of unhulled seed , or 140 plants - worth , to yield 20 pounds of hulled kernels , about what a family of four will use in a year . That many plants can be grown in an area 26 - by - 10 feet . That 's 260 square feet . Put that together with the 2,240 square feet for the oilseed sunflowers , and you need a patch about 2,500 square feet -- 25 100 - foot rows -- to keep yourself supplied year - round with super nutrition and unsurpassable taste . The winnowing machine operates on the age - old principle of blowing the chaff away from the heavy grain with a controlled current of air . The unit uses a household or shop- type vacuum cleaner for its air supply . A vacuum cleaner was used as a power source because it can supply a large volume of air over an extended period of time , and most homes and farms have a vacuum cleaner . A cloth bag has been attached to the chaff chute to catch the chaff as it is separated from the seed . The bag allows the hulls to be collected and greatly reduces the amount of waste material normally blown into the air by conventional systems . The unit has been constructed in such a way that the cloth bag and cleaner box can be placed inside the seed box , making a compact package for storage . Tools Required 1 . Table Saw 2 .

The press was designed so that homesteaders can produce sunflower oil from their own seeds . The oil can be pressed as is or heated to 170 degrees F. , which doubles oil yield . Both methods require the seed to be ground to fine powder . If you are pressing the oil seed variety , a meat grinder or electric blender will do an excellent job of grinding the seed . The confectionary type of seed will require the seed to be hulled and winnowed before it is ground . A food mill with the stones set at the coarse setting can be used to accomplish this step . The ground kernels are placed in the cylinder with the piston closing the bottom portion of the cylinder . The cylinder is mounted in the press frame and a three - ton hydraulic jack is used to supply the pressure . Because of the great pressures created by the hydraulic jack , it is important that the frame be properly constructed and firmly mounted to the work surface before the pressing operation begins .

The problem , heretofore , with sunflower seeds was the difficulty of dehulling them at home , and the lack of a device for expressing oil from the seeds . About six months ago , we decided to change all that . The job was to find out who makes a sunflower seed dehuller or to devise one if none were manufactured . And to either locate a home - scale oilseed press or devise one . No mean task . Our researches took us from North Dakota -- hub of commercial sunflower activity in the nation -- to a search of the files in the U.S. Patent Office , with stops in between . We turned up a lot of big machinery , discovered how difficult it is to buy really pure , unrefined vegetable oils , but found no small - scale equipment to dehull sunflowers or press out their oil . The key to success , however , was on our desk the whole time . In spring 1977 , August Kormier had submitted a free - lance article describing how he used a Corona grain mill to dehull his sunflower seeds , and his vacuum cleaner exhaust hose to blow the hulls off the kernels . A second separation floated off the remaining hulls , leaving a clean product . We 'd tried it , but because some kernels were cracked and the process involved drying , we had n't been satisfied . Now we felt the best approach was to begin again with what we learned from Mr. Kormier and refine it . The key to success , however , was on our desk the whole time .

A second separation floated off the remaining hulls , leaving a clean product . We 'd tried it , but because some kernels were cracked and the process involved drying , we had n't been satisfied . Now we felt the best approach was to begin again with what we learned from Mr. Kormier and refine it . A pound of oilseed produced just under three ounces of oil . Staff Editor Diana Branch and Home Workplace Editor Jim Eldon worked with a number of hand - and electric- powered grain mills . While the Corona did a passable job , they got the best results with the C.S. Bell # 60 hand mill and the Marathon Uni Mill , which is motor-driven . \" I could n't believe my eyes the first time I tried the Marathon , \" Diana says . \" I opened the stones to 1/8th inch , and out came a bin full of whole kernels and hulls split right at the seams . What a thrill that was ! \" She found that by starting at the widest setting , and gradually narrowing the opening , almost every seed was dehulled . The stones crack the hulls open , then rub them to encourage the seed away from the fibrous lining . The Bell hand mill worked almost as well . \" As long as the stones open at least as wide as the widest unhulled seed , any mill will work , \" she says . Because the seed slips through the mill on its flat side , grading is an important step to take before dehulling . We made three sizing boxes . The first is 1/4-inch hardware cloth [ wire screen ] . The second is two layers of 1/4-inch cloth , moved slightly apart to narrow the opening in one direction , and the third is two layers of screen adjusted to make a still- smaller opening . Since the smallest unhulled seeds are about the size of the largest hulled kernels , the grading step prevents these undersized seeds from passing through unhulled . Processed together at a closer setting , the smallest seeds hulled out . A hardware cloth grader sizes the kernels for better hulling . Two layers of cloth , spaced slightly apart , narrow the hole for a second grading . The more grading , the better the hulling . Jim Eldon 's workshop is littered with strange - looking pieces of apparatus . They represent initial attempts to build a workable winnowing box , using Kormier 's vacuum exhaust idea for a source of air . Jim , Fred Matlack and Diana finally made a box with a Plexiglas front , through which they could observe what was happening . They cut a hole in the back of the box with a sliding cover to regulate the air pressure , and fiddled with various arrangements of baffles . The result was a stream of hulls exiting through one hole while the kernels fell to the bottom of the box . Now they were ready to try a five - pound sample of unhulled sunflower seeds to see how much they could recover . The five pounds were graded and dehulled , then winnowed . We got about one hull for every ten kernels in the final , winnowed product . These are easily picked out . They usually contain kernels still held behind the fibrous strings of the hull . Their weight prevents them from blowing out with the empty hulls . We found that bug -eaten seeds do blow away with the chaff , which was a bonus for cleanliness of the final product . Toss the hulls to the birds , who will find broken seeds among them . Starting with 80 ounces of unhulled seed , we ended up with 41 - 1/4 ounces of edible whole seeds , 1.8 ounces of damaged seeds suitable for animal feed , and 36.6 ounces of hulls . It took us about an hour . Not bad . Sunflower seeds store perfectly in the hulls , but they deteriorate more rapidly when shelled out . The grain mill dehuller and winnowing box give the gardener a way to have the freshest possible seeds for eating at all times of the year . With the construction of one more piece of equipment -- the oil press -- he can have absolutely fresh , unrefined , polyunsaturated sunflower oil for salads , mayonnaise and cooking . Most light , refined vegetable oils have been extracted using hexane , a form of naphtha . The oil is then heated to boil off the hexane . Lye is dumped into it . It 's washed with steam , then heated to remove odors and taste before being laced with preservatives and stabilizers . It may feel oily in the mouth , but you might as well taste air . No so with fresh - made sunflower oil -- it 's deliciously yet subtly nutty in flavor , adding unsurpassed flavor to salads .

No so with fresh - made sunflower oil -- it 's deliciously yet subtly nutty in flavor , adding unsurpassed flavor to salads . A little heat and the oil pours out of the pistonlike cylinder , then to be strained with a paint filter . There 's good reason to believe that sunflower oil may become the # 1 vegetable oil in the U.S. in a few years . It 's already # 1 in health - conscious Europe . Corn oil has already caught on here for health reasons , and sunflower oil is so much better . Sunflower oil 's 70 percent polyunsaturate is just under safflower , with corn oil bringing up the rear with 55 percent . And sunflowers yield 40 percent oil , soybeans only 20 percent . Our oil press is relatively simple , but it must be welded together . Check the construction directions for details . The press consists of a welded tubular frame which accepts a three - ton hydraulic jack . You may already have one . If not , it can be purchased at most auto and hardware stores for about $ 16 . A metal canister with holes drilled in its sides and one end welded shut holds the mashed sunflower seeds . A piston is inserted in the canister and then inverted and slipped over a pedestal on the frame . The jack is set in place , and the pressure gradually increased over half an hour . The oil drips from the sides of the canister into a tray -- the bottom of a plastic jug slipped over the pedestal works fine -- which empties the oil into a cup . You can filter the oil with a coffee filter to remove pieces of seed and other fine particles that would burn if the oil were used for cooking . If it 's for salads or mayonnaise , there 's no need to filter it . We first tried using \" confectionary \" sunflower seeds for oil . These are the regular eating kernels we 're used to seeing . They give less than half as much oil as the oilseed types of sunflower . Although you can use confectionary types such as MAMMOTH RUS - SIAN for oil , do n't expect to get more than an ounce and a half from a pound of seed . Oilseed produces three or more ounces of oil from a pound of seed and is well worth planting along with confectionary - type seeds . Oilseed has another big advantage -- to prepare it , you can put the whole , unhulled seed into a blender and whiz it until it forms a fine meal , while confectionary seeds must be dehulled first . The entire sequence of grading , dehulling and winnowing is avoided with oilseed . We first tried using \" confectionary \" sunflower seeds for oil .

The entire sequence of grading , dehulling and winnowing is avoided with oilseed . Two kinds of sunflower seeds -- oilseeds on the left , confectionary on the right . Oil types produce about a tenth of a pound of seed per head in commercial production . Gardeners , with their better soil and care , invariably do better than that . Our conservative estimate is that 1,280 plants will be enough for three gallons of oil . Spaced one foot apart in rows two feet apart , 1,280 oilseed plants will take a space 40 - by - 56 feet , or 80 - by - 28 if you want a more rectangular patch to face south . We worked in pound batches , since the canister just holds one pound of mash . After blending , we heated it to 170 degrees F. ( 77 deg C ) by placing it in a 300 - degree F. ( 149 deg C ) oven and stirring it every five minutes for 20 minutes . Heating gets the oil flowing and doubles the yield of oil . In case you 're wondering , \" cold - pressed \" oils sold commercially are also heated , and some are subjected to the entire chemical process . The term has no firm meaning within the industry , according to the literature we 've surveyed . Heating does not change the structure of fats . It will not turn polyunsaturated fats into saturated fats . In fact , Dr. Donald R. Germann in his book , \" The Anti-Cancer Diet \" , says that \" ... an unsaturated fat must be heated to high temperatures -- above 425 degrees F. or 200 degrees C. -- at least 8 or 10 times before any shift toward saturation occurs ... \" Dean C. Fletcher , Ph.D. , of the American Medical Association Department of Foods and Nutrition in Chicago , says , \" It 's true that either high temperature or repeated heating does change the nature of some of the unsaturated oil molecules . ( But ) the flavor of the oil changes as these chemical changes occur , spoiling its taste . This effect is probably more profound than any of the physiological changes the altered oil might produce within the body . \" From 500 gm. of heated mash , we pressed 89 gm . of oil , 89 percent of the entire amount available and twice as much as we could press from unheated oil ! The decision is up to you whether or not to heat the mash , but that extra 50 percent seems like an awful lot , especially when the whole technique is so labor intensive . The oil should be stored in the refrigerator , and it 's probably best to use it within a month , since it has no preservatives . Mayonnaise made with such fresh oils should be kept refrigerated and used within two weeks . The leftover cake , still containing 50 percent of its oil , is a nutritious addition to your dishes , and makes excellent feed for animals or winter birds . Store the pressed cake in the freezer . We 're talking then about a sunflower patch with two kinds of plants -- confectionary such as MAMMOTH RUSSIAN and oilseed such as PEREDOVIK . The oilseed plants should be grown 12 inches apart in rows two feet apart . Four average confectionary heads yield about a pound of unhulled seed . You 'll need about 35 pounds of unhulled seed , or 140 plants - worth , to yield 20 pounds of hulled kernels , about what a family of four will use in a year . That many plants can be grown in an area 26 - by - 10 feet . That 's 260 square feet . Put that together with the 2,240 square feet for the oilseed sunflowers , and you need a patch about 2,500 square feet -- 25 100 - foot rows -- to keep yourself supplied year - round with super nutrition and unsurpassable taste .

The press was designed so that homesteaders can produce sunflower oil from their own seeds . The oil can be pressed as is or heated to 170 degrees F. , which doubles oil yield . Both methods require the seed to be ground to fine powder . If you are pressing the oil seed variety , a meat grinder or electric blender will do an excellent job of grinding the seed . The confectionary type of seed will require the seed to be hulled and winnowed before it is ground . A food mill with the stones set at the coarse setting can be used to accomplish this step . The ground kernels are placed in the cylinder with the piston closing the bottom portion of the cylinder . The cylinder is mounted in the press frame and a three - ton hydraulic jack is used to supply the pressure . Because of the great pressures created by the hydraulic jack , it is important that the frame be properly constructed and firmly mounted to the work surface before the pressing operation begins . The following instructions can be given to a welder . Tools Required 1 . Power Hacksaw 2 . Metal Band Saw 3 . Metal Lathe 4 . Drill Press 5 . Belt or Disk Grinder 6 . Arc Welder 7 . Hand Clamps Procedure ( Frame ) Procedure ( Frame ) Secure welds on all parts are needed because of the high pressures exerted to squeeze the oil from the seeds . 1 .

Cut one piece of 1 - 3/4 \" O.D. x 1 - 3/8 \" I.D. x 6 - 1/2 inch long tubing for the center tube . 3 . Cut one 3 /4 \" x 2 - 3/4 x 5 - 1/2 inch steel bar for the top cross member . 4 . Cut two pieces of 1 - 3/4 x 1 - 3/4 x 8 inch angle iron for the base members . 5 . Drill two 9/32 -inch holes in each base member 1/2 inch from the outer edges . 6 . Weld the base members , tubes and cross member together as per the drawing . 7 . Grind all edges to remove any burrs . 8 . Paint the frame . 9 . If a mounting board is desired , cut a piece of pine 1 - 1/4 x 6 - 1/2 x 12 inches long . 10 . Center the frame on the board and mark the location of the four mounting holes . 11 . Drill four 7/8-inch holes 1/4-inch deep to accept the T-nuts . 12 . Drill four 5/16 - inch holes through the mounting board using the same centers created by the 7/8-inch holes . 13 . Round the edges of the base and sand all surfaces . 14 . Install four 1/4-20 T-nuts . 15 . Finish the base with clear lacquer finish . 16 . Assemble the base to the frame using four 1/4 - 20 x 1- 1/4-inch round head bolts . Procedure ( Cylinder ) 1 . Cut a piece of 3 - 1/2 \" O.D. x 3 - 1/4 \" I.D. tubing 5 - 3/8 inches long . 2 .

The solution , whose simplicity has stunned mathematicians , is already leading to advances in other combinatorics problems . Invented in 1974 , Set has a simple goal : to find special triples called \u201c sets \u201d within a deck of 81 cards . Each card displays a different design with four attributes \u2014 color ( which can be red , purple or green ) , shape ( oval , diamond or squiggle ) , shading ( solid , striped or outlined ) and number ( one , two or three copies of the shape ) . In typical play , 12 cards are placed face - up and the players search for a set : three cards whose designs , for each attribute , are either all the same or all different . Occasionally , there 's no set to be found among the 12 cards , so the players add three more cards . Even less frequently , there 's still no set to be found among the 15 cards . How big , one might wonder , is the largest collection of cards that contains no set ? The answer is 20 \u2014 proved in 1971 by the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Pellegrino . But for mathematicians , this answer was just the beginning . After all , there 's nothing special about having designs with only four attributes \u2014 that choice simply creates a manageable deck size . It 's easy to imagine cards with more attributes ( for instance , they could have additional images , or even play different sounds or have scratch - and - sniff smells ) . For every whole number n , there 's a version of Set with n attributes and 3n different cards . For each such version , we can consider collections of cards that contain no set \u2014 what mathematicians confusingly call \u201c cap sets \u201d \u2014 and ask how large they can be . Mathematicians have calculated the maximal size of cap sets for games with up to six attributes , but we 'll probably never know the exact size of the largest cap set for a game with 100 or 200 attributes , said Jordan Ellenberg , a mathematician at the University of Wisconsin , Madison \u2014 there are so many different collections of cards to consider that the computations are too mammoth ever to be carried out . Yet mathematicians can still try to figure out an upper bound on how big a cap set can be \u2014 a number of cards guaranteed to hold at least one set . This question is one of the simplest problems in the mathematical field called Ramsey theory , which studies how large a collection of objects can grow before patterns emerge . \u201c The cap set problem we think of as a model problem for all these other questions in Ramsey theory , \u201d said Terence Tao , a mathematician at the University of California , Los Angeles , and a winner of the Fields Medal , one of mathematics ' highest honors . \u201c It was always believed that progress would come there first , and then once we 'd sorted that out we would be able to make progress elsewhere . \u201d Yet until now , this progress has been slow . Mathematicians established in papers published in 1995 and 2012 that cap sets must be smaller than about 1/n the size of the full deck . Many mathematicians wondered , however , whether the true bound on cap set size might be much smaller than that . They were right to wonder . The new papers posted online this month showed that relative to the size of the deck , cap set size shrinks exponentially as n gets larger . In a game with 200 attributes , for instance , the previous best result limited cap set size to at most about 0.5 percent of the deck ; the new bound shows that cap sets are smaller than 0.0000043 percent of the deck . The previous results were \u201c already considered to be quite a big breakthrough , but this completely smashes the bounds that they achieved , \u201d said Timothy Gowers , a mathematician and Fields medalist at the University of Cambridge . There 's still room to improve the bound on cap sets , but in the near term , at least , any further progress is likely to be incremental , Gowers said . \u201c In a certain sense this completely finishes the problem . \u201d Game , Set , Match To find an upper bound on the size of cap sets , mathematicians translate the game into geometry . For the traditional Set game , each card can be encoded as a point with four coordinates , where each coordinate can take one of three values ( traditionally written as 0 , 1 and 2 ) . For instance , the card with two striped red ovals might correspond to the point ( 0 , 2 , 1 , 0 ) , where the 0 in the first spot tells us that the design is red , the 2 in the second spot tells us that the shape is oval , and so on . There are similar encodings for versions of Set with n attributes , in which the points have n coordinates instead of four . The rules of the Set game translate neatly into the geometry of the resulting n-dimensional space : Every line in the space contains exactly three points , and three points form a set precisely when they lie on the same line . A cap set , therefore , is a collection of points that contains no complete lines . Previous approaches to getting an upper bound on cap set size used a technique called Fourier analysis , which views the collection of points in a cap set as a combination of waves and looks for the directions in which the collection oscillates . \u201c The conventional wisdom was that this was the way to go , \u201d Tao said . Now , however , mathematicians have solved the cap set problem using an entirely different method \u2014 and in only a few pages of fairly elementary mathematics . \u201c One of the delightful aspects of the whole story to me is that I could just sit down , and in half an hour I had understood the proof , \u201d Gowers said . The proof uses the \u201c polynomial method , \u201d an innovation that , despite its simplicity , only rose to prominence on the mathematical scene about a decade ago . The approach produces \u201c beautiful short proofs , \u201d Tao said . It 's \u201c sort of magical . \u201d A polynomial is a mathematical expression built out of numbers and variables raised to powers \u2014 for instance , x2 + y2 or 3xy z3 + 2 . Given any collection of numbers , it 's possible to create a polynomial that evaluates to zero at all those numbers \u2014 for example , if you pick the numbers 2 and 3 , you can build the expression ( x \u2013 2 ) ( x \u2013 3 ) ; this multiplies out to the polynomial x2 \u2013 5 x + 6 , which equals zero if x = 2 or x = 3 . Something similar can be done to create polynomials that evaluate to zero at a collection of points \u2014 for instance , the points corresponding to Set cards . At first glance , this does n't seem like a very deep fact . Yet somehow , these polynomials often seem to contain information that is n't readily visible from the set of points . Mathematicians do n't fully understand , Ellenberg said , just why this approach works so well , and which types of problems it can be useful for . Until a few weeks ago , he added , he considered cap set \u201c an example of a problem where the polynomial method really has no purchase . \u201d That changed on May 5 , when three mathematicians \u2014 Ernie Croot of the Georgia Institute of Technology , Vsevolod Lev of the University of Haifa , Oranim , in Israel , and P\u00e9ter P\u00e1l Pach of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in Hungary \u2014 posted a paper online showing how to use the polynomial method to solve a closely related problem , in which each Set attribute can have four different options instead of three . For technical reasons , this problem is more tractable than the original Set problem . In this game variant , for any collection of cards with no set , Croot , Lev and Pach considered which additional cards could be laid down on the table to complete a set . They then built a polynomial that evaluates to zero on these completion cards , and figured out an ingeniously simple way to split the polynomial into pieces with smaller exponents , which led to a bound on the size of collections with no sets . It was a \u201c very inventive move , \u201d Ellenberg said . \u201c It 's always incredibly cool when there 's something truly new and it 's easy . \u201d The paper soon set off a cascade of what Ellenberg called \u201c math at Internet speed . \u201d Within 10 days , Ellenberg and Dion Gijswijt , a mathematician at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands , had each independently posted papers showing how to modify the argument to polish off the original cap set problem in just three pages . Yesterday , they posted a joint paper combining their results . The trick , Ellenberg said , is to realize that there are many different polynomials that evaluate to zero on a given set of points , and that choosing just the right one gets \u201c a little bit more juice out of the method . \u201d A cap set , the new proofs establish , can be at most ( 2.756/3 ) n as large as the whole deck . Mathematicians are now scrambling to figure out the implications of the new proof . Already , a paper has been posted online showing that the proof rules out one of the approaches mathematicians were using to try to create more efficient matrix multiplication algorithms . And on May 17 , Gil Kalai , of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , wrote an \u201c emergency \u201d blog post pointing out that the cap set result can be used to prove the \u201c Erd\u0151s - Szemer\u00e9di sunflower conjecture , \u201d which concerns sets that overlap in a sunflower pattern . \u201c I think a lot of people will be thinking , ' What can I do with this ?

Friend aware that I recently visited this prison and met many of the staff who are doing a very difficult job in very depressing surround ings ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames I am indeed aware that my hon . Friend visited the prison and I am most grateful to him for the report that he wrote upon his visit . I am glad to hear his confirmation of how he thinks the prison is run . \u00a7 Mr. Simmons Would the Minister assert that the staff of this prison are not strong - arm men , because the photographs in the Press of some of them were not exactly reassuring ? Has the right hon . Gentleman said in his reply that the usual visits which are made to civilian prisons by the prison visitors are also made to Shepton Mallet ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames The staff of the prison are certainly not strong - arm men in the sense in which the hon . Member refers , but they are also not weak - arm men . \u00a7 Mr. Strachey Would not the Minister agree that there is a great deal of evidence \u2014 probably through no fault of the staff there \u2014 that the conditions in the prison are an anachronism , to say the least of it ? Is the right hon . Gentleman not going to tell us what his longer - term policy is , whether it is to abolish this prison physically altogether , and , if so , whether we are to have another military prison or are to rely entirely on civilian prisons ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames There are a number of Questions on the Order Paper , and that is one of them . \u00a7 10 . Mr. Nabarro asked the Secretary of State for War whether he will make a statement upon the prison break by thirteen soldiers at Shepton Mallet , Samerset ; what modernisation has been carried out to this prison since it was built in Napoleonic times ; whether he is aware that the prison buildings were condemned for use as a civil prison nearly forty years ago ; what steps he has taken to establish the causes of the prison break referred to and the legitimacy of grievances expressed by the prisoners and others ; and what further steps he now proposes to take in the matter . \u00a7 Mr. Soames The prison at Shepton Mallet was leased to the Army by the 370 Home Office in 1939 . Since it came into our hands we have improved the heating , lighting , water and drainage systems . Various other works services have also been carried out . The causes of the recent outbreak were at once investigated and a board of inquiry was set up . I can make no statement about the results of our inquiries or about the court - martial for mutiny until the findings have been confirmed and the time allowed for appeal has expired . \u00a7 Mr. Nabarro Without condoning in any way the mutinous conduct of this soldiery at Shepton Mallet , may I ask my right hon . Friend if he would not agree that it is quite reprehensible that these buildings , which were condemned forty years ago for use as a civil prison , should now be kept in use as a military prison ? Will he take early steps to endeavour to destroy this glasshouse and remove the prisoners to more amenable and humane surroundings ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames This is a very old prison . We took it over on lease from the Home Office in 1939 . We have made certain improvements to bring it into line with modern standards . There is nothing that could be done short of razing it to the ground and building it again as a modern prison , but a lot of prisons , unfortunately , are very old . The lease runs out in 1960 and we shall have to find other accommodation when we hand Shepton Mallet back to the Home Office . Shortly after that , we shall have to find other accommodation for the prisoners . \u00a7 Mr. Emrys Hughes Is it not true that , in addition to improvements , the place has recently been white - washed ? Is the Minister going to do it again ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames It is kept as clean as possible . \u00a7 Mr. Strachey Would not the Secretary of State agree that there are two questions here ? One is on the subject of the sentences , and surely we may hope that before confirmation there will be some reduction in the sentences . Secondly , there are the conditions in the prison . There has been a great deal of evidence furnished in the public Press that they are profoundly unsatisfactory . Cannot the Minister give some assurance that in one way or another , either by the use of 371 civil prisons or by building another military prison , the use of this prison will be discontinued ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames The right hon . Member has raised two points . One is that of using civil prisons . At the moment we send all prisoners with terms of more than two years imprisonment to Home Office civil prisons , but , owing to the overcrowding of those prisons , the Home Office cannot take prisoners who are going to be discharged from the Army and are serving less than two years . Shepton Mallet is the only place available to us . The lease is running out and the premises will be handed back to the Home Office . In the meantime , we shall have to find other accommodation . \u00a7 Lieut . - Commander Maydon Is my right hon . Friend aware that those who live in the district and know about the running of these detention barracks recognise that the present commandant and his staff have done a great deal to improve the conditions and discipline in this prison in the face of most difficult material conditions in an old building ? Is it common practice in detention barracks to allow the prisoners to watch television provided out of staff amenity funds ? \u00a7 Mr. G. Brown That is too severe a punishment . \u00a7 Mr. Soames I am grateful to my hon . and gallant Friend for the first part of his supplementary question , with which I entirely agree . I am afraid I should need notice before answering the second part . \u00a7 Mrs. Braddock When the Minister is inquiring into the whole of this matter , will he make inquiries as to whether any complaints were made by the men before and whether there was any question that letters of complaint were stopped from being sent out by the men concerned ? If that had been attended to , this difficulty might not have arisen , as people would have had an opportunity of knowing what happened inside . \u00a7 Mr. Soames There has been a full board of inquiry , but I shall , of course , take note of what the hon . Lady has said . \u00a7 12 and 13 . Mr. Simmons asked the Secretary of State for War ( 1 ) what changes have been made in the structure , amenities , discipline , and routine at the Shepton Mallet prison since it was taken over as a military prison ; 372 ( 2 ) in what way the amenities , discipline and routine applying to Shepton Mallet military prison differ from those applying at other military detention centres . \u00a7 18 . Mr. Emrys Hughes asked the Secretary of State for War if he is aware that the military prison at Shepton Mallet is run purely as a punishment establishment for soldiers , that many of the soldiers sent there have ceased to be of use to Her Majesty 's Forces , and that the routine of the prison is not up to the standard demanded by civil prisons ; and if he will order an inquiry . \u00a7 19 . Mr. Chetwynd asked the Secretary of State for War why soldiers who are dismissed from the Army and sentenced to imprisonment serve their sentences in a military rather than a civil prison . \u00a7 Mr. Soames In the United Kingdom there is one military prison , at Shepton Mallet , and one Corrective Training Centre at Colchester . Convicted soldiers who are to stay in the Army undergo detention at Colchester where the routine and training are designed to prepare them for return to their units . Soldiers who are to be discharged , including all those sentenced to terms of up to two years ' imprisonment , go to Shepton Mallet where they learn civilian trades and live in conditions very similar to those of a civil prison . Terms of imprisonment over two years are served in civil prisons , but by keeping Shepton Mallet in being we avoid adding the whole burden of military offenders to the responsibilities of the Prison Commission . During recent years , increasing emphasis has been placed on the process of rehabilitation for a return to civil life . A scheme was introduced in 1955 whereby prisoners earn small sums of money for the work they do . Professional instructors are employed for trade training , and welfare officers co-operate with the labour exchanges in finding work for the men discharged . I dealt with the subject of improvements to accommodation in reply to an earlier Question . \u00a7 Mr. Simmons Is it not true that until recently the prison was used by the United States Army ? Are any of the American practices still carried out at present , or has it reverted to the British Army because , as I understand , some of the practices are un - British in their application ? 373 Does not the Minister think that the demeanour of the staff and the conditions of the prison itself were contributory factors to the trouble there , and should not something be done before these men are severely punished by taking into consideration the horrible , intolerable and rotten conditions under which they were housed in the Shepton Mallet hellhole ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames I certainly could not comment now on what the hon . Gentleman thinks may or may not have been contributory factors in a matter which is still sub judice . \u00a7 Mr. Hughes Can the Minister say if he has ever seen this place himself ? Is he aware that the Church of Scotland chaplain , who acted as chaplain for three years , has recently said that this place was a blot on the Army and a blot on the conscience of this country , that the conditions are so bad that prisoners are prepared to commit other crimes and get additional sentences in order to be sent to another prison , that the food is abominable , and that all human dignity is destroyed in this prison within a very short time ? Is the right hon . Gentleman prepared to say that this chaplain , who is a very respected member of the Church of Scotland , is not telling the truth ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames It is not a question of telling the truth . He was giving his own impression . I am not denying that this is a very old prison , which , from the point of view of the buildings , leaves a great deal to he desired . Where rations are concerned , the men draw prison rations , the same as those drawn in civil prisons . \u00a7 Mr. Chetwynd Can the Minister say at which stage a man becomes a civilian \u2014 at the beginning of his sentence or at the end ? Can he also say if there have been any requests from any of the prisoners to be transferred to local prisons so that they may have visits from their relatives ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames The discharge happens at some time during the course of their imprisonment , but military law provides that , even after a man has been discharged , he still remains under military law during the period of his sentence . As to applications for transfers to other prisons , I could not answer that without notice . \u00a7 Mr. Strachey Since it is not denied that this prison is quite unsuitable and out - of - date , what is the objection to announcing that a new prison will be built or acquired , which is surely what we want ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames I have told the right hon . Gentleman that by the early 1960s we shall have to leave this prison . We have given an assurance to the Home Office , but there is a shortage of prison accommodation throughout the whole country . \u00a7 Mr. G. Brown Is there no \" stately home \" that might be acquired in the meantime ? \u00a7 20 . Mrs. Cullen asked the Secretary of State for War the total weekly cost of running the military detention prison at Shepton Mallet ; and the cost per head , per week , of keeping a prisoner there . \u00a7 Mr. Soames The approximate figures are \u00a3 2,300 and \u00a3 11 respectively . \u00a7 Mrs. Cullen Does not the Secretary of State agree that this money could have been better spent in many ways ? If we take various reports , including the report of the minister from Argyll , do they not indicate that it is time that this place was closed down and demolished ? \u00a7 Mr. Soames The hon . Lady says that the money could have been spent in better ways , but we must have a prison .","annotations":[{"text":"sentenced to be dishonourably discharged in future","span":[593,642],"token_span":[117,123],"role":"Reason","label":"Reason","role_definition":"Typically, there is a constituent expressing the Reason for the Agent's judgment.

So trowels flew after the British government \u2014 heeding environmental concerns \u2014 announced plans to gradually eliminate peat from all gardening products , setting off an intense battle over how to prioritize two of this country 's defining passions : indulging the yard and protecting the planet . A blog about energy and the environment . Andrew Testa for The New York Times While many gardeners regard the partially decomposed plant matter known as peat as an almost magical elixir , environmentalists say using it is problematic because it is scraped off the tops of centuries - old bogs , which are vital ecosystems that also serve as natural stores of carbon , just like rain forests . The celebrity gardener Bob Flowerdew was shocked by the violent reaction when he said he would defy the government and continue to use peat to nurture finicky plants like azaleas . \u201c The hate mail was quite frightening \u2014 in some circles I 've become an outcast , \u201d said Mr. Flowerdew , a longtime panelist on the BBC 's \u201c Gardeners ' Question Time \u201d radio program , and a favorite speaker at women 's clubs . The debate between the gardening industry and environmentalists grew so acerbic that the government appointed an emergency peat task force after the phaseout plan was announced last year , which delivered a first report this summer . \u201c What I 've done is to try to unblock an impasse \u2014 to find a sensible midpoint where everyone agrees , \u201d said Alan Knight , the task force chairman and an expert in sustainability . \u201c We needed a road map of how to get to zero peat . \u201d But some gardeners and gardening companies say they simply cannot do without peat , a spongy natural concoction of water , air and acidity , for nurturing certain seeds and plants . \u201c If you love your garden , you really ca n't just abstain , \u201d said Mr. Flowerdew , surrounded in his greenhouse by bags of peat-free alternatives he has tried . Behind this uniquely British drama is a serious global environmental issue , one largely ignored in the United States and most of Europe , where bagged soils with a high percentage of peat are widely used in potting and sprinkled willy - nilly on gardens and parks as compost or to condition soil . Peat use is already beginning to decrease in Britain , where horticulture is a billion - dollar business and companies are creating reduced - peat soils in response to the government 's call . But greater awareness is needed , experts say . \u201c People walk over peat lands , but they 're not aware of how important they are from a climate - change point of view , \u201d said Ian Crosher , a scientist with Natural England , which advises the government on the environment , and supports a ban . \u201c Peat bogs have far greater capacity to store CO2 than rain forests .

So trowels flew after the British government \u2014 heeding environmental concerns \u2014 announced plans to gradually eliminate peat from all gardening products , setting off an intense battle over how to prioritize two of this country 's defining passions : indulging the yard and protecting the planet . A blog about energy and the environment . Andrew Testa for The New York Times While many gardeners regard the partially decomposed plant matter known as peat as an almost magical elixir , environmentalists say using it is problematic because it is scraped off the tops of centuries - old bogs , which are vital ecosystems that also serve as natural stores of carbon , just like rain forests . The celebrity gardener Bob Flowerdew was shocked by the violent reaction when he said he would defy the government and continue to use peat to nurture finicky plants like azaleas . \u201c The hate mail was quite frightening \u2014 in some circles I 've become an outcast , \u201d said Mr. Flowerdew , a longtime panelist on the BBC 's \u201c Gardeners ' Question Time \u201d radio program , and a favorite speaker at women 's clubs . The debate between the gardening industry and environmentalists grew so acerbic that the government appointed an emergency peat task force after the phaseout plan was announced last year , which delivered a first report this summer . \u201c What I 've done is to try to unblock an impasse \u2014 to find a sensible midpoint where everyone agrees , \u201d said Alan Knight , the task force chairman and an expert in sustainability . \u201c We needed a road map of how to get to zero peat . \u201d But some gardeners and gardening companies say they simply cannot do without peat , a spongy natural concoction of water , air and acidity , for nurturing certain seeds and plants . \u201c If you love your garden , you really ca n't just abstain , \u201d said Mr. Flowerdew , surrounded in his greenhouse by bags of peat-free alternatives he has tried . Behind this uniquely British drama is a serious global environmental issue , one largely ignored in the United States and most of Europe , where bagged soils with a high percentage of peat are widely used in potting and sprinkled willy - nilly on gardens and parks as compost or to condition soil . Peat use is already beginning to decrease in Britain , where horticulture is a billion - dollar business and companies are creating reduced - peat soils in response to the government 's call . But greater awareness is needed , experts say . \u201c People walk over peat lands , but they 're not aware of how important they are from a climate - change point of view , \u201d said Ian Crosher , a scientist with Natural England , which advises the government on the environment , and supports a ban . \u201c Peat bogs have far greater capacity to store CO2 than rain forests .

Sensitive intelligence information shows that the Chinese Embassy on Connecticut Avenue NW here was used for planning contributions to the DNC , the sources said . Some information was obtained through electronic eavesdropping conducted by federal agencies . The information gives the Justice Department inquiry what is known as a foreign counterintelligence component , elevating the seriousness of the fund - raising controversy , according to some officials . The sources declined to provide details about the scope of the evidence relating to the alleged efforts by the Chinese representatives . They also declined to specify what foreign contributions might have been involved , but they said the new evidence now being scrutinized in the inquiry is serious . A Chinese Embassy spokesman denied yesterday that his government had anything to do with improper efforts to influence the administration . \" We have done nothing of that sort , \" the spokesman said . White House press secretary Michael McCurry said yesterday that \" to the best of my knowledge , no one here had any knowledge of \" the allegations concerning the Chinese . He said the White House would have no further comment . The evidence relating to the Chinese government led Justice Department lawyers and FBI executives to increase the number of FBI special agents working on a special investigative task force from a handful to 25 , including several specialists in foreign counterintelligence investigations , sources said . Laura Ingersoll , a Justice Department attorney assigned a leading role on the fund - raising task force , has security clearances to investigate a variety of sensitive intelligence matters , officials said . The new dimension to the fund - raising investigation could result in Attorney General Janet Reno eventually recommending that the matter be turned over to an independent counsel , according to one well - placed source . Reno so far has declined requests for an independent counsel , saying that the Justice Department task force can conduct a full and independent inquiry and that there is no specific and credible allegation of wrongdoing against any of the senior executive branch officials covered by the Independent Counsel Act . Such a finding would have to be made by the Justice Department task force before Reno could recommend appointment of an independent counsel . Washington and Beijing have been at odds over human rights and trade issues , but the Clinton White House has been seeking recently to improve relations . Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright is traveling to Beijing later this month , and President Clinton announced in his State of the Union message that he also would visit . He has extended an invitation to Chinese President Jiang Zemin to come to Washington . The Chinese effort to win influence with the Clinton administration can be traced to 1993 , one source said . During the Reagan and Bush administrations , the Chinese government felt comfortable dealing with Washington . During the 1992 presidential campaign , authorities in Beijing spoke openly about wanting Bush to win reelection because he was an \" old friend \" of China . Clinton had criticized the Bush administration during the campaign for \" coddling \" Beijing and giving China most-favored - nation trade status after the 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square . After Clinton defeated Bush , Chinese officials were uncertain about how to deal with the new administration , officials said , even though as president , Clinton essentially adopted the Bush policy toward Beijing . The Chinese Foreign Ministry has long urged the leadership in Beijing to increase its lobbying efforts in Washington , arguing that China has lagged behind Taiwan and Israel in trying to influence U.S. policy . Some investigators suspected a Chinese connection to the current fund - raising scandal because several DNC contributors and major fund - raisers had ties to Beijing . Last February , Charles Yah Lin Trie , a fund - raiser for the Democratic National Committee , used his influence with party officials to bring Wang Jun , head of a weapons trading company owned by the Chinese military , to a White House coffee with Clinton . Wang also heads a prominent , state - owned investment conglomerate . Clinton has since said he should not have met with Wang , and $ 640,000 in checks that Trie delivered to president 's legal defense fund has been returned because of questions about the source of the funds . Another reason investigators suspected a Chinese connection was the role of John Huang , a former Commerce Department official and DNC fund - raiser now at the center of the campaign controversy . An American citizen born in China and raised in Taiwan , Huang has said he now has no friends or relatives in China . But Huang is a former executive of the Lippo Group , a highly profitable Indonesian conglomerate owned by the Riady family , who are ethnic Chinese . Lippo has extensive interests in China , including approval to build a power plant in Fujian Province , Huang 's place of birth . In 1993 , Lippo sold 50 percent of its holdings in one of its banks , Hong Kong Chinese Bank where Huang was a vice president in the mid-1980s to a corporation run by the Chinese government . Huang was not the only Lippo executive to get a job with the Clinton administration . In December 1994 , U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor named Lippo 's president of securities , Charles De Queljoe , to the Investment and Services Advisory Committee . Huang had sought jobs at the State Department and the National Security Council staff for De Queljoe , a big Democratic giver , in an early 1993 letter to the White House . Last month , Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon ( R-N.Y. ) , chairman of the House Rules Committee , asked FBI Director Louis J. Freeh to investigate Huang and the Lippo Group , with an eye to \" potential economic espionage against the United States by a foreign corporation having direct ties to the People 's Republic of China . \" Solomon said then that he was concerned about Huang 's access to intelligence information and dozens of calls Huang made from Commerce to the Lippo Group . He also asked Freeh to investigate apparent discrepancies in the birth date listed on Huang 's visa application forms and his government employment forms . Huang was employed at Lippo for nine years before he joined the Commerce Department as deputy assistant secretary for international economic policy . His severance package from Lippo totaled $ 788,750 . Huang was given a top-secret clearance at Commerce after what Republicans have called a lax background investigation . Despite Huang 's extensive ties to Lippo , the background investigation was limited to his activities in the United States because he had lived here for more than five years . Commerce officials now say they wish a foreign background check had been done , even though it was not required . In preparation for his job at Commerce , Huang received an interim security clearance while he was still working at Lippo . But Commerce Department officials said that did not entitle him to see any classified information , and they maintain he saw none . Because of a bureaucratic error , the officials said , Huang retained his top-secret clearance after he left the Commerce Department to become a DNC vice chairman in December 1995 . During his 18 months at Commerce , Huang was scheduled to attend 37 intelligence briefings , including briefings on China , and saw more than two dozen intelligence reports . From his Commerce Department office , Huang made more than 70 phone calls to a Lippo-controlled bank in Los Angeles . The calls are now being scrutinized by the Justice Department task force .

Sensitive intelligence information shows that the Chinese Embassy on Connecticut Avenue NW here was used for planning contributions to the DNC , the sources said . Some information was obtained through electronic eavesdropping conducted by federal agencies . The information gives the Justice Department inquiry what is known as a foreign counterintelligence component , elevating the seriousness of the fund - raising controversy , according to some officials . The sources declined to provide details about the scope of the evidence relating to the alleged efforts by the Chinese representatives . They also declined to specify what foreign contributions might have been involved , but they said the new evidence now being scrutinized in the inquiry is serious . A Chinese Embassy spokesman denied yesterday that his government had anything to do with improper efforts to influence the administration . \" We have done nothing of that sort , \" the spokesman said . White House press secretary Michael McCurry said yesterday that \" to the best of my knowledge , no one here had any knowledge of \" the allegations concerning the Chinese . He said the White House would have no further comment . The evidence relating to the Chinese government led Justice Department lawyers and FBI executives to increase the number of FBI special agents working on a special investigative task force from a handful to 25 , including several specialists in foreign counterintelligence investigations , sources said . Laura Ingersoll , a Justice Department attorney assigned a leading role on the fund - raising task force , has security clearances to investigate a variety of sensitive intelligence matters , officials said . The new dimension to the fund - raising investigation could result in Attorney General Janet Reno eventually recommending that the matter be turned over to an independent counsel , according to one well - placed source . Reno so far has declined requests for an independent counsel , saying that the Justice Department task force can conduct a full and independent inquiry and that there is no specific and credible allegation of wrongdoing against any of the senior executive branch officials covered by the Independent Counsel Act . Such a finding would have to be made by the Justice Department task force before Reno could recommend appointment of an independent counsel . Washington and Beijing have been at odds over human rights and trade issues , but the Clinton White House has been seeking recently to improve relations . Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright is traveling to Beijing later this month , and President Clinton announced in his State of the Union message that he also would visit . He has extended an invitation to Chinese President Jiang Zemin to come to Washington . The Chinese effort to win influence with the Clinton administration can be traced to 1993 , one source said . During the Reagan and Bush administrations , the Chinese government felt comfortable dealing with Washington . During the 1992 presidential campaign , authorities in Beijing spoke openly about wanting Bush to win reelection because he was an \" old friend \" of China . Clinton had criticized the Bush administration during the campaign for \" coddling \" Beijing and giving China most-favored - nation trade status after the 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square . After Clinton defeated Bush , Chinese officials were uncertain about how to deal with the new administration , officials said , even though as president , Clinton essentially adopted the Bush policy toward Beijing . The Chinese Foreign Ministry has long urged the leadership in Beijing to increase its lobbying efforts in Washington , arguing that China has lagged behind Taiwan and Israel in trying to influence U.S. policy . Some investigators suspected a Chinese connection to the current fund - raising scandal because several DNC contributors and major fund - raisers had ties to Beijing . Last February , Charles Yah Lin Trie , a fund - raiser for the Democratic National Committee , used his influence with party officials to bring Wang Jun , head of a weapons trading company owned by the Chinese military , to a White House coffee with Clinton . Wang also heads a prominent , state - owned investment conglomerate . Clinton has since said he should not have met with Wang , and $ 640,000 in checks that Trie delivered to president 's legal defense fund has been returned because of questions about the source of the funds . Another reason investigators suspected a Chinese connection was the role of John Huang , a former Commerce Department official and DNC fund - raiser now at the center of the campaign controversy . An American citizen born in China and raised in Taiwan , Huang has said he now has no friends or relatives in China . But Huang is a former executive of the Lippo Group , a highly profitable Indonesian conglomerate owned by the Riady family , who are ethnic Chinese . Lippo has extensive interests in China , including approval to build a power plant in Fujian Province , Huang 's place of birth . In 1993 , Lippo sold 50 percent of its holdings in one of its banks , Hong Kong Chinese Bank where Huang was a vice president in the mid-1980s to a corporation run by the Chinese government . Huang was not the only Lippo executive to get a job with the Clinton administration . In December 1994 , U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor named Lippo 's president of securities , Charles De Queljoe , to the Investment and Services Advisory Committee . Huang had sought jobs at the State Department and the National Security Council staff for De Queljoe , a big Democratic giver , in an early 1993 letter to the White House . Last month , Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon ( R-N.Y. ) , chairman of the House Rules Committee , asked FBI Director Louis J. Freeh to investigate Huang and the Lippo Group , with an eye to \" potential economic espionage against the United States by a foreign corporation having direct ties to the People 's Republic of China . \" Solomon said then that he was concerned about Huang 's access to intelligence information and dozens of calls Huang made from Commerce to the Lippo Group . He also asked Freeh to investigate apparent discrepancies in the birth date listed on Huang 's visa application forms and his government employment forms . Huang was employed at Lippo for nine years before he joined the Commerce Department as deputy assistant secretary for international economic policy . His severance package from Lippo totaled $ 788,750 . Huang was given a top-secret clearance at Commerce after what Republicans have called a lax background investigation . Despite Huang 's extensive ties to Lippo , the background investigation was limited to his activities in the United States because he had lived here for more than five years . Commerce officials now say they wish a foreign background check had been done , even though it was not required . In preparation for his job at Commerce , Huang received an interim security clearance while he was still working at Lippo . But Commerce Department officials said that did not entitle him to see any classified information , and they maintain he saw none . Because of a bureaucratic error , the officials said , Huang retained his top-secret clearance after he left the Commerce Department to become a DNC vice chairman in December 1995 . During his 18 months at Commerce , Huang was scheduled to attend 37 intelligence briefings , including briefings on China , and saw more than two dozen intelligence reports . From his Commerce Department office , Huang made more than 70 phone calls to a Lippo-controlled bank in Los Angeles . The calls are now being scrutinized by the Justice Department task force . Huang 's message slips from the Commerce Department also show a call from one Chinese Embassy official in February 1995 and three calls from the embassy 's commercial minister in June and August of that year . According to Huang 's Commerce Department desk calendar entries , obtained by The Washington Post , he had three meetings scheduled with Chinese government officials . He was slated to go on a U.S. government - sponsored trip to China in June 1995 that was canceled .

But when questioned about the difference in opinion between CDU and CSU , Stoiber replied , matter of factly : \" In the end we 'll find an agreement . That 's the way it 's always been . \" German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der has a party discipline problem . A handful of left-wing Social Democrats could scuttle key welfare and economic reforms , upon which he has staked his political future ( Sept. 29 , 2003 ) .","annotations":[{"text":"health and nursing care premiums","span":[1548,1579],"token_span":[268,272],"role":"Part_1","label":"Part_1","role_definition":"Part-1 is the first of two Parts mentioned.

Centred around the usual Woolworths and Big W stores , Brickworks Marketplace will not shock first time visitors with too many unexpected revelations . If you 're already familiar with shopping malls such as Castle Plaza then you will quickly grasp the concept of Brickworks Marketplace . However there are still some pleasant surprises . The Entrance to Brickworks Marketplace This huge new redevelopment of the former Brickworks Markets had a turbulent and tumultuous conception . The mum and dad traders who had occupied the Brickworks Markets for decades were unsurprisingly unhappy when the West Torrens Council gave them the boot . As they were all small traders , most had pinned their hopes for a sound financial future on their shops . Sadly the former traders at the Brickworks were misguided in their hopes , and they are probably all collecting our tax dollars for their troubles . Woolworths wanted their land . The West Torrens Council wanted more money . And even many customers of the old Brickworks Markets thought that it was time - worn and lacking in interesting product , so the quirky markets were despatched to the dustbin of history . The Original Brickworks Markets before Demolition The new Brickworks Marketplace opened on June 25 2015 , to some fanfare . All the usual politicans were there including Treasurer \" Turbo \" Tom Koutsantonis who suddenly developed a startled rabbit - in- the - headlight look when asked about the future of the former traders . He was happier to spruik the 600 new jobs , 45 new shops , and 700 car parks . If figures are your forte you might want to know that this new shopping mall has a catchment area with an average age of 38 years , average household size 2.2 people , around $ 35 k pa income , and 37 % are couples with no kids . ( Source : Brickworks Marketplace advertisement ) . Pedestrian Walkways Through the Car park So what can you expect at the Brickworks Marketplace ? If the first couple of days are any guide then be prepared to wait for a park . Of course it 's probably opening fever , and the locals will no doubt be happy when that 's subsided . A pleasant surprise were the dedicated walkways and pedestrian crossings in the car park , making it easier to push your trolley of takings back home . Brick Lane Playground for Kids Work was still in progress at Brick Lane , the northern end of Brickworks Marketplace adjacent to the heritage listed brickworks when I visited . It seems that there will be something to connect the two , but it was n't clear what . At the western end of Brick Lane a soft floored playground was popular with a tribe of toddlers while their parents played with mobile phones . Zambrero Mexican Food on Brick Lane Nearby the latest addition to Zambrero 's Mexican franchise ( with a humanitarian face ) was doing a roaring trade with plenty of punters enjoying the opportunity for alfresco dining . Zambrero offers tacos , burritos and nachos , but I have n't tried their food yet . Food Choices at the North End of the Shopping Mall Heading south into the Brickworks Marketplace shopping mall uncovered a few surprises - if you come hungry you will have plenty of food choices . Reade Book is a combination bookstore and cafe that was already busy . The Cicheti Italian food bar was not yet open , but Joy of India , Dumpling Dumpling were already open and Iiced had gelati with all the colours of the rainbow . There were plenty of the usual suspects you 'll find in most modern shopping malls . A Smokemart , the ubiquitous Specsavers , engravers and keycutters , Flight Centre , Zamels and EB Games jostled for your attention with Vodafone and Optus . Rockmans Clothing and Moda Alterations were new to me though . Take Away Food Choices Include Tokyo Sushi and Yiros Central At the north end of Brickworks Marketplace is where the crowds were at lunchtime . More food choices abounded and most tables were taken with what looked like locals in work clothes . If you could n't find something to your taste here , then you are fussy . Tokyo Sushi , Yiros Central , and Zeea 's Eatery for Italian food were all doing a roaring trade . Another shop , probably Three Little Cafe was still being fitted out . Yiros Central in the Shopping Mall The new Brickworks Marketplace at Torrensville will fill the bill for an area lacking in shopping facilities close by . I thought the food choices were somewhat more inspired than average , but others may disagree . At the end of a day it will be successful , and does n't the end justifies the means ?

Centred around the usual Woolworths and Big W stores , Brickworks Marketplace will not shock first time visitors with too many unexpected revelations . If you 're already familiar with shopping malls such as Castle Plaza then you will quickly grasp the concept of Brickworks Marketplace . However there are still some pleasant surprises . The Entrance to Brickworks Marketplace This huge new redevelopment of the former Brickworks Markets had a turbulent and tumultuous conception . The mum and dad traders who had occupied the Brickworks Markets for decades were unsurprisingly unhappy when the West Torrens Council gave them the boot . As they were all small traders , most had pinned their hopes for a sound financial future on their shops . Sadly the former traders at the Brickworks were misguided in their hopes , and they are probably all collecting our tax dollars for their troubles . Woolworths wanted their land . The West Torrens Council wanted more money . And even many customers of the old Brickworks Markets thought that it was time - worn and lacking in interesting product , so the quirky markets were despatched to the dustbin of history . The Original Brickworks Markets before Demolition The new Brickworks Marketplace opened on June 25 2015 , to some fanfare . All the usual politicans were there including Treasurer \" Turbo \" Tom Koutsantonis who suddenly developed a startled rabbit - in- the - headlight look when asked about the future of the former traders . He was happier to spruik the 600 new jobs , 45 new shops , and 700 car parks . If figures are your forte you might want to know that this new shopping mall has a catchment area with an average age of 38 years , average household size 2.2 people , around $ 35 k pa income , and 37 % are couples with no kids . ( Source : Brickworks Marketplace advertisement ) . Pedestrian Walkways Through the Car park So what can you expect at the Brickworks Marketplace ? If the first couple of days are any guide then be prepared to wait for a park . Of course it 's probably opening fever , and the locals will no doubt be happy when that 's subsided . A pleasant surprise were the dedicated walkways and pedestrian crossings in the car park , making it easier to push your trolley of takings back home . Brick Lane Playground for Kids Work was still in progress at Brick Lane , the northern end of Brickworks Marketplace adjacent to the heritage listed brickworks when I visited . It seems that there will be something to connect the two , but it was n't clear what . At the western end of Brick Lane a soft floored playground was popular with a tribe of toddlers while their parents played with mobile phones . Zambrero Mexican Food on Brick Lane Nearby the latest addition to Zambrero 's Mexican franchise ( with a humanitarian face ) was doing a roaring trade with plenty of punters enjoying the opportunity for alfresco dining . Zambrero offers tacos , burritos and nachos , but I have n't tried their food yet . Food Choices at the North End of the Shopping Mall Heading south into the Brickworks Marketplace shopping mall uncovered a few surprises - if you come hungry you will have plenty of food choices . Reade Book is a combination bookstore and cafe that was already busy . The Cicheti Italian food bar was not yet open , but Joy of India , Dumpling Dumpling were already open and Iiced had gelati with all the colours of the rainbow . There were plenty of the usual suspects you 'll find in most modern shopping malls . A Smokemart , the ubiquitous Specsavers , engravers and keycutters , Flight Centre , Zamels and EB Games jostled for your attention with Vodafone and Optus . Rockmans Clothing and Moda Alterations were new to me though . Take Away Food Choices Include Tokyo Sushi and Yiros Central At the north end of Brickworks Marketplace is where the crowds were at lunchtime . More food choices abounded and most tables were taken with what looked like locals in work clothes . If you could n't find something to your taste here , then you are fussy . Tokyo Sushi , Yiros Central , and Zeea 's Eatery for Italian food were all doing a roaring trade . Another shop , probably Three Little Cafe was still being fitted out . Yiros Central in the Shopping Mall The new Brickworks Marketplace at Torrensville will fill the bill for an area lacking in shopping facilities close by . I thought the food choices were somewhat more inspired than average , but others may disagree . At the end of a day it will be successful , and does n't the end justifies the means ? See the Brickworks Marketplace website for a complete list of shops , although descriptions are sparse as yet . Of course there 's a Facebook page too . If you feel a bit parched after traversing the Brickworks Marketplace car park you will be pleased to know that a Dan Murphy 's liquor store awaits you in Torrensville too .","annotations":[{"text":"June 25 2015","span":[1372,1383],"token_span":[227,229],"role":"Time","label":"Time","role_definition":"This role identifies the time when the shopping occurs."},{"text":"Brickworks Marketplace","span":[177,198],"token_span":[29,30],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"A spatial setting larger than the Ground in which the Shopping event occurs."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"test"},{"instance_id":"EN-2823-115-frame-Sign_agreement","frame":"Sign_agreement","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Signatory signs an Agreement document, thereby taking on a commitment encoded in the Agreement.","frame_ancestors":["Text_creation","Intentionally_create","Creating","Transitive_action","Objective_influence","Event","Intentionally_act"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"McDonald failed to make the final roster as a rookie , and was waived on September 5 , 2009 , before re-signing to the practice squad the following day where he remained all season .

Review by Paul D While America had the likes of The Wild One and Easy Rider and Electraglide in Blue and Australia had Stone and Mad Max , over here in Britain we had The Black Rider .

OK , so it 's does n't have the scenes of bikes tearing off down highways the disappear off into the horizon , but this is Britain .

Essentially its the kind of hoary old yarn that would keep readers of 50s and 60s comic strips and Boys Own annuals enthralled . In fact , as a child stalking jumble sales in the 80s for back issues I was just as enthralled myself ! Oh and Leslie Dwyer is shown to have just as much contempt for snotty nosed kids here as he had twenty - six years later in Hi-de - Hi Review by Paul D I 'll freely admit that my passion for this movie is beyond all reason , much like Jimmy Hanley 's oddly posh accent seen here and only here , there 's no accounting for it . Previous review : boxd.it/8PqPX Review by loureviews In the USA , Marlon Brando was asking ' whaddya got ' in biker leathers - while in the UK the rather staid looking Jimmy Hanley was our kind of rebel . The ' evil mission ' of the tagline is a misnomer as this film has little tension and certainly none of the Brando sex appeal which made the motorcycle lifestyle attractive . Review by Melody You know it 's a very British biker movie when they do n't even dismount for the egg-and - spoon race . Review by Paul D While America had the likes of The Wild One and Easy Rider and Electraglide in Blue and Australia had Stone and Mad Max , over here in Britain we had The Black Rider . Yes indeed , the story of a ' young ' newspaper reporter who saves up his money to buy a motorbike so he can fulfil his lifelong ambition to , err , do reliability trials . OK , so it 's does n't have the scenes of bikes tearing off down highways the disappear off into the horizon , but this is Britain . Instead we have to make do with trundling slowly around over bits of heathland , skilfully negotiating gorse bushes . It might not have the romanticism of those offerings from our colonial cousins , but , by George , it \u2026","annotations":[{"text":"crooks","span":[129,134],"token_span":[20,20],"role":"Perpetrator","label":"Perpetrator","role_definition":"This is the person (or other agent) that illegally takes the goods into or out of a country."},{"text":"atomic weaponry","span":[1127,1141],"token_span":[195,196],"role":"Goods","label":"Goods","role_definition":"The role Goods is anything (including labor, time, or legal rights) that can be illegally taken into our out of a country."},{"text":"sleepy coastal village","span":[1163,1184],"token_span":[200,202],"role":"Goal","label":"Goal","role_definition":"Goal is the location the Goods end up in."},{"text":"a ruined castle","span":[375,389],"token_span":[62,64],"role":"Place","label":"Place","role_definition":"Where the event takes place."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"test"},{"instance_id":"EN-2713-632-frame-Soaking","frame":"Soaking","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"In this frame, an Agent places the Theme in the Medium for an extended period of time, with the intent that the Theme will be affected by and absorb some of the Medium.

For a wealthy country like Saudi Arabia , there 's no excuse for holding migrants in such deplorable conditions , \" Mr Coogle added . Oil-rich Saudi Arabia has long exploited migrant labour from Africa and Asia . In June 2019 , an estimated 6.6 m foreign workers made up about 20 per cent of the Gulf nation 's population , most occupying low paid and often physically arduous jobs . The migrants work mainly in construction and manual domestic roles that Saudi nationals prefer not to do themselves . Many are from South Asia , but a large contingent come from the Horn of Africa , which lies across the Red Sea . The detention centres identified by The Sunday Telegraph house mainly Ethiopian men and there are said to be others packed with women . Over the last decade , tens of thousands of young Ethiopians have made their way to the Gulf state , often aided by Saudi recruitment agents and people traffickers , in a bid to escape poverty back home . They have been trapped partly as a result of the pandemic but also by the ' Saudization ' of the kingdom 's workforce , a policy introduced by Muhamad Bin Salman , the Crown Prince who took power three years ago . The testimonies gathered by The Sunday Telegraph directly from migrants on encrypted channels about the conditions they now find themselves in are harrowing . \u201c Plenty of inmates are suicidal or suffering from mental illnesses as a result of living this for five months , \u201d said one . \u201c The guards mock us , they say ' your government does n't care , what are we supposed to do with you ? \u201d \u201c A young boy , about sixteen , managed to hang himself last month . The guards just throw the bodies out back as if it was trash , \u201d said another . When the pandemic struck in March , the Saudi government in the capital Riyadh feared the migrants , who are often housed in overcrowded conditions , would act as vectors for the virus . Almost 3,000 Ethiopians were deported by the Saudi security services back to Ethiopia in the first ten days of April and a leaked UN memo said a further 200,000 were to follow . A moratorium was then placed on the deportations after international pressure was brought to bear on Riyadh . The Sunday Telegraph has found many of the migrants who were slated for deportation five months ago have been left to rot in disease- ridden detention centres . \u201c We have been left to die here , \u201d said one , who said he has been locked in a room the size of a school classroom and not been outside since March . \u201c Covid19 ? Who knows ? , he added , \u201c There are a lot of diseases here . Everyone is sick here ; everyone has something . \u201d The images smuggled out show many of those held are plagued by disfiguring skin infections . They claim they have received no medical treatment . \u201c We eat a tiny piece of bread in the day and rice in the evening . There 's almost no water , and the toilets are overflowing . It spills over to where we eat . The smell , we grow accustomed to . But there 's over a hundred of us in a room , and the heat is killing us , \u201d said another young Ethiopian man . A short video clip smuggled out shows several rooms covered with filth from an overflowing squat toilet . One Ethiopian man can be heard shouting out : \u201c The toilets are clogged . We tried unblocking them , but we 're unable to . So we live in this filth , we sleep in it too . \u201d \u201c To [ the Saudis ] or even to Abiy , it 's like we 're ants . When we die , it 's as if an ant died , no one cares or pays attention , \u201d the man added , referring to Ethiopia 's Nobel Peace Prize - winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed . Saudi Arabia is deeply stratified by race and cast . African migrants enjoy few legal rights and many complain of exploitation , sexual and racial abuse from employers . New laws further limiting the rights and employment prospects of foreign labourers were introduced in 2013 and crackdowns have continued under the rule of the young Crown Prince Muhamad Bin Salman , who took power in 2017 . The Sunday Telegraph was able to geolocate two of the centres . One is in Al Shumaisi , near the holy city of Mecca and one is in Jazan , a port town near Yemen . There are believed to be others housing thousands of Ethiopians . Migrants in each of the centres said there were hundreds of them in each room . Satellite imagery shows there are several buildings at both centres , meaning there may be far more migrants in each centre who are uncontactable . Several of the migrants said they had been rounded up from their homes in various Saudi Arabian cities before being placed in the camps . Others are African refugees from war-torn Yemen . Earlier this month , Human Rights Watch reported that Houthi forces used Covid - 19 as a pretext to expel thousands of Ethiopian migrants into neighbouring Saudi Arabia . Testimonies gathered by the NGO say that the Houthis killed dozens of Ethiopians and forced others at gunpoint over the Saudi border . Saudi border guards then fired on the fleeing migrants , killing dozens more . \u201c Saudi Arabia , a wealthy country , has long held undocumented migrants including many from the Horn of Africa in conditions that are so crowded , unsanitary , and appalling that migrants often emerge traumatised or sick , \u201d said Mr Coogle . \u201c It 's fair to question whether Saudi authorities are purposefully allowing these detention conditions to exist in order to punish migrants , \u201d he added . The Sunday Telegraph approached the Saudi Arabian embassy in London for comment but had not received any at the time of going to press .

It spills over to where we eat . The smell , we grow accustomed to . But there 's over a hundred of us in a room , and the heat is killing us , \u201d said another young Ethiopian man . A short video clip smuggled out shows several rooms covered with filth from an overflowing squat toilet . One Ethiopian man can be heard shouting out : \u201c The toilets are clogged . We tried unblocking them , but we 're unable to . So we live in this filth , we sleep in it too . \u201d \u201c To [ the Saudis ] or even to Abiy , it 's like we 're ants . When we die , it 's as if an ant died , no one cares or pays attention , \u201d the man added , referring to Ethiopia 's Nobel Peace Prize - winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed . Saudi Arabia is deeply stratified by race and cast . African migrants enjoy few legal rights and many complain of exploitation , sexual and racial abuse from employers . New laws further limiting the rights and employment prospects of foreign labourers were introduced in 2013 and crackdowns have continued under the rule of the young Crown Prince Muhamad Bin Salman , who took power in 2017 . The Sunday Telegraph was able to geolocate two of the centres . One is in Al Shumaisi , near the holy city of Mecca and one is in Jazan , a port town near Yemen . There are believed to be others housing thousands of Ethiopians . Migrants in each of the centres said there were hundreds of them in each room . Satellite imagery shows there are several buildings at both centres , meaning there may be far more migrants in each centre who are uncontactable . Several of the migrants said they had been rounded up from their homes in various Saudi Arabian cities before being placed in the camps . Others are African refugees from war-torn Yemen . Earlier this month , Human Rights Watch reported that Houthi forces used Covid - 19 as a pretext to expel thousands of Ethiopian migrants into neighbouring Saudi Arabia . Testimonies gathered by the NGO say that the Houthis killed dozens of Ethiopians and forced others at gunpoint over the Saudi border . Saudi border guards then fired on the fleeing migrants , killing dozens more . \u201c Saudi Arabia , a wealthy country , has long held undocumented migrants including many from the Horn of Africa in conditions that are so crowded , unsanitary , and appalling that migrants often emerge traumatised or sick , \u201d said Mr Coogle . \u201c It 's fair to question whether Saudi authorities are purposefully allowing these detention conditions to exist in order to punish migrants , \u201d he added . The Sunday Telegraph approached the Saudi Arabian embassy in London for comment but had not received any at the time of going to press . A representative of the Ethiopian government in the Middle East was also unsuccessfully approached for comment . * Migrants ' names have been changed to protect their identity Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security","annotations":[{"text":"hundreds if not thousands of African migrants","span":[69,113],"token_span":[13,19],"role":"Entity","label":"Entity","role_definition":"The entity whose State is specified and/or evaluated."},{"text":"heinous","span":[125,131],"token_span":[22,22],"role":"State","label":"State","role_definition":"A relation in which the Entity participates or a property that the Entity possesses."}],"trigger":null}},"split":"test"},{"instance_id":"EN-3132-631-frame-Suasion","frame":"Suasion","frame_gloss":"","frame_definition":"A Speaker succeeds in getting an Addressee to believe or plan to execute the Content the Speaker has in mind.","frame_ancestors":["Eventive_cognizer_affecting","Eventive_affecting","Event","Telling","Statement"],"frame_descendants":[],"has_differences":true,"v1_0":{"report":{"text":"See also H.AMDT.652 , THOMAS .

That night , in Salt Lake City , curlers Rhona Martin , Debbie Knox , Janice Rankin and Fiona MacDonald became Britain 's first gold medal winners at a Winter Olympics for 18 years . The unlikely triumph of four ordinary Scottish women in a sport most English people had never heard of was a sensation . They were feted as \" housewife superstars \" . Flag - waving crowds gathered at Heathrow to welcome them home , they were awarded MBEs and summoned on to Richard and Judy 's sofa . \" You have captured the imagination of the whole of the UK , \" wrote Tony Blair in a congratulatory fax . There was talk of a Hollywood movie . But when the celebrations died down and the invitations dried up , these four athletes , the first Scots to win gold at a winter games since 1936 , attracted less welcome attention . The fifth member of their team , the substitute Margaret Morton , told the Scottish Sun she felt excluded and said : \" I do n't particularly respect them for their personalities , but of course I respect them for what they achieved . \" There were news reports of Rhona Martin , the team 's \" skip \" , splitting from her husband and being forced to sell her family home . By then , Martin \u2013 despite all those predictions of sponsorship deals \u2013 was a single mother living on benefits . The breakdown of MacDonald 's marriage to a fellow curling star was reported too ; it was \" the curse of the curlers \" . So , eight years on , have those gold medals turned out to be a curse or a blessing ? Martin is now 43 and the coach of Scotland 's junior curling team as well as being part of UK Sport 's elite coaching programme . With her mop of blond hair , she still looks as fit as ever . The only member of the gold - medal - winning team to play on in the 2006 Winter Olympics , she will be commentating on curling for the BBC at the Vancouver Games this year ; her protege , Eve Muirhead , is the 19- year - old skip of the women 's team . Known for her passion and enthusiastic communication \u2013 curlers emit what sound like high - pitched yelps to instruct their teammates how vigorously to scrub the ice with their brushes \u2013 Martin says she will struggle to sit calmly during the curling . \" It 'll be good fun but I 'm bad enough when I 'm coaching so I do n't know , \" she says . Listening to the former skip on TV \" will be so funny , \" says Rankin , who lives in Elgin and is the full - time mother of four young children . Martin \" gets very excited when she 's watching curling \" , says Knox , who lives with her family near Edinburgh and , just as she did eight years ago , works for Standard Life . \" She knows what she 's talking about . She 'll be fab , \" says MacDonald , who is now a business manager for Macrae & Dick car dealers in Inverness . Despite living hundreds of miles apart in Scotland , the four curlers are still in touch . Knox coaches with Martin in her spare time , and the pair were planning to meet Rankin for dinner shortly before this year 's games . \" Unfortunately I have n't seen Fiona in ages , \" says Rankin . \" We do send Christmas cards and put a bit of chat in but we 're just all so busy . \" The team were orginally assembled by Martin , and played together for years before entering the 2002 Winter Olympics as underdogs . Canada , for whom curling is a national sport backed by serious funds , was expected to win . To make matters worse , Martin was seriously ill , and Britain struggled at first . They scraped through two playoffs to reach the semi-finals . Then they found their momentum , dispatching Canada and finally Switzerland , winning the tightest of games with Martin 's last shot . They were overwhelmed when they found themselves surrounded by 30,000 people at the medal plaza in Salt Lake City . \" We thought , what have we done ? \" says Martin . \" We stood on the podium and we were used to being Scotland 's team with our own national anthem . All of a sudden God Save the Queen came on and we were thinking , ' Uh - oh ' . That 's when it hit me . \" The quartet were oblivious to the frenzy back home . \" After we won the final I phoned one of my friends and said , ' We won ! Did you watch it ? ' \" says Rankin . \" And she said , ' Did we watch it ? The whole flipping country watched it ! ' \" But it was still a surprise when they entered Heathrow to find crash barriers keeping back flag - waving fans . \" We were thinking , ' Blimey , there are a lot of people here . Who are they here to see ? ' \" says Rankin . They were , says Knox , naive , and that made the next phase of their lives all the more bizarre and thrilling . \" We went on Lorraine Kelly 's show and we got taken out with a personal shopper who picked us clothes to wear \u2013 it was ' from curlers to dressed - up ladies ' . \" The highlight for Rankin , a keen tennis player , was being invited into the royal box at Wimbledon , where the crowd gave them a round of applause . Martin still sounds astonished by the memory . \" It was just surreal . \" When they collected their MBEs from the Queen , the women and their families were put up at Claridge 's . \" Three years later one of my daughters said , ' When are we going to stay in that hotel with that man in a lift again ? ' \" recalls Knox . In a sense , they became the Susan Boyles of their day : celebrated but also slightly belittled by some of the media coverage . They were athletes who had mastered a fiendishly challenging sport while holding down ordinary jobs , yet the talk was of housewives with brooms ; did they feel patronised ? \" No , because we 'd had it for years , \" says Martin . Locally , there was a lot of recognition and affection . \" I still have customers who recognise me . That 's quite nice after eight years , \" says MacDonald . Of course , talk of life - changing amounts of money and a Hollywood film came to nothing . \" We were getting excited about who could play us , reeling off names like Julia Roberts , \" says Knox . \" That was silly . We thought then , how on earth are they going to make a film out of curling ? \" Martin did some promotional work with B&Q and was given a car for a year and that was it . \" We played Canada in the semis and they were so gutted we beat them , \" says Martin . \" They said afterwards we 'd cost them millions . To them , money was a huge part of winning but to us it was never , ever a thought . \" In Canada , teams play for thousands of dollars , says Martin . \" We play and win a lasagne dish . \" Knox would rather have her gold medal than lots of money though . \" There are still people who say we should 've made fortunes out of it but it just never came about , \" she says . \" We knew the hype about it would n't last that long . \" Their lingering fame was enough , however , for journalists to sniff out negative stories . Nowadays , none of the four are in contact with Morton . \" It is hard when the media goes through your personal life because you 're not used to that at all , \" says Martin , who is still single but has her own home again with her 17- year - old daughter and 14- year - old son . The team 's youngest member , MacDonald , who is now 35 , was the first to retire from curling , just three months after their triumph . While Martin and Knox coach , and Rankin is enjoying playing local games after four years away from the sport , MacDonald has not curled again , apart from a couple of charity games .

That night , in Salt Lake City , curlers Rhona Martin , Debbie Knox , Janice Rankin and Fiona MacDonald became Britain 's first gold medal winners at a Winter Olympics for 18 years . The unlikely triumph of four ordinary Scottish women in a sport most English people had never heard of was a sensation . They were feted as \" housewife superstars \" . Flag - waving crowds gathered at Heathrow to welcome them home , they were awarded MBEs and summoned on to Richard and Judy 's sofa . \" You have captured the imagination of the whole of the UK , \" wrote Tony Blair in a congratulatory fax . There was talk of a Hollywood movie . But when the celebrations died down and the invitations dried up , these four athletes , the first Scots to win gold at a winter games since 1936 , attracted less welcome attention . The fifth member of their team , the substitute Margaret Morton , told the Scottish Sun she felt excluded and said : \" I do n't particularly respect them for their personalities , but of course I respect them for what they achieved . \" There were news reports of Rhona Martin , the team 's \" skip \" , splitting from her husband and being forced to sell her family home . By then , Martin \u2013 despite all those predictions of sponsorship deals \u2013 was a single mother living on benefits . The breakdown of MacDonald 's marriage to a fellow curling star was reported too ; it was \" the curse of the curlers \" . So , eight years on , have those gold medals turned out to be a curse or a blessing ? Martin is now 43 and the coach of Scotland 's junior curling team as well as being part of UK Sport 's elite coaching programme . With her mop of blond hair , she still looks as fit as ever . The only member of the gold - medal - winning team to play on in the 2006 Winter Olympics , she will be commentating on curling for the BBC at the Vancouver Games this year ; her protege , Eve Muirhead , is the 19- year - old skip of the women 's team . Known for her passion and enthusiastic communication \u2013 curlers emit what sound like high - pitched yelps to instruct their teammates how vigorously to scrub the ice with their brushes \u2013 Martin says she will struggle to sit calmly during the curling . \" It 'll be good fun but I 'm bad enough when I 'm coaching so I do n't know , \" she says . Listening to the former skip on TV \" will be so funny , \" says Rankin , who lives in Elgin and is the full - time mother of four young children . Martin \" gets very excited when she 's watching curling \" , says Knox , who lives with her family near Edinburgh and , just as she did eight years ago , works for Standard Life . \" She knows what she 's talking about . She 'll be fab , \" says MacDonald , who is now a business manager for Macrae & Dick car dealers in Inverness . Despite living hundreds of miles apart in Scotland , the four curlers are still in touch . Knox coaches with Martin in her spare time , and the pair were planning to meet Rankin for dinner shortly before this year 's games . \" Unfortunately I have n't seen Fiona in ages , \" says Rankin . \" We do send Christmas cards and put a bit of chat in but we 're just all so busy . \" The team were orginally assembled by Martin , and played together for years before entering the 2002 Winter Olympics as underdogs . Canada , for whom curling is a national sport backed by serious funds , was expected to win . To make matters worse , Martin was seriously ill , and Britain struggled at first . They scraped through two playoffs to reach the semi-finals . Then they found their momentum , dispatching Canada and finally Switzerland , winning the tightest of games with Martin 's last shot . They were overwhelmed when they found themselves surrounded by 30,000 people at the medal plaza in Salt Lake City . \" We thought , what have we done ? \" says Martin . \" We stood on the podium and we were used to being Scotland 's team with our own national anthem . All of a sudden God Save the Queen came on and we were thinking , ' Uh - oh ' . That 's when it hit me . \" The quartet were oblivious to the frenzy back home . \" After we won the final I phoned one of my friends and said , ' We won ! Did you watch it ? ' \" says Rankin . \" And she said , ' Did we watch it ? The whole flipping country watched it ! ' \" But it was still a surprise when they entered Heathrow to find crash barriers keeping back flag - waving fans . \" We were thinking , ' Blimey , there are a lot of people here . Who are they here to see ? ' \" says Rankin . They were , says Knox , naive , and that made the next phase of their lives all the more bizarre and thrilling . \" We went on Lorraine Kelly 's show and we got taken out with a personal shopper who picked us clothes to wear \u2013 it was ' from curlers to dressed - up ladies ' . \" The highlight for Rankin , a keen tennis player , was being invited into the royal box at Wimbledon , where the crowd gave them a round of applause . Martin still sounds astonished by the memory . \" It was just surreal . \" When they collected their MBEs from the Queen , the women and their families were put up at Claridge 's . \" Three years later one of my daughters said , ' When are we going to stay in that hotel with that man in a lift again ? ' \" recalls Knox . In a sense , they became the Susan Boyles of their day : celebrated but also slightly belittled by some of the media coverage . They were athletes who had mastered a fiendishly challenging sport while holding down ordinary jobs , yet the talk was of housewives with brooms ; did they feel patronised ? \" No , because we 'd had it for years , \" says Martin . Locally , there was a lot of recognition and affection . \" I still have customers who recognise me . That 's quite nice after eight years , \" says MacDonald . Of course , talk of life - changing amounts of money and a Hollywood film came to nothing . \" We were getting excited about who could play us , reeling off names like Julia Roberts , \" says Knox . \" That was silly . We thought then , how on earth are they going to make a film out of curling ? \" Martin did some promotional work with B&Q and was given a car for a year and that was it . \" We played Canada in the semis and they were so gutted we beat them , \" says Martin . \" They said afterwards we 'd cost them millions . To them , money was a huge part of winning but to us it was never , ever a thought . \" In Canada , teams play for thousands of dollars , says Martin . \" We play and win a lasagne dish . \" Knox would rather have her gold medal than lots of money though . \" There are still people who say we should 've made fortunes out of it but it just never came about , \" she says . \" We knew the hype about it would n't last that long . \" Their lingering fame was enough , however , for journalists to sniff out negative stories . Nowadays , none of the four are in contact with Morton . \" It is hard when the media goes through your personal life because you 're not used to that at all , \" says Martin , who is still single but has her own home again with her 17- year - old daughter and 14- year - old son . The team 's youngest member , MacDonald , who is now 35 , was the first to retire from curling , just three months after their triumph . While Martin and Knox coach , and Rankin is enjoying playing local games after four years away from the sport , MacDonald has not curled again , apart from a couple of charity games . Did she quit because she was uncomfortable with being a celebrity ? \" It was n't about that at all . I 'm a 100 % or nothing person .

Elizabeth Truss , the early years minister , has proposed that childminders , currently restricted to looking after three children per staff member from the ages of one to five inclusive , should in future be permitted to look after four children . They would also be allowed to look after two children under one year of age , instead of the current one . Truss will seek to allay parents ' fears of their children being neglected by overpressed staff , pointing out that the relaxation she proposes still leaves more restrictive ratios than Denmark , France and Germany \u2013 three countries often cited as providing high - quality care for pre-school children . The minister will quote experts claiming that in Britain more qualifications are needed to look after animals than toddlers . She is also proposing that nurseries be allowed to relax their ratios when qualified staff are present , increasing from four to six two -year - old children per staff member . In the case of one-year -olds , the permitted staff - to - child ratios would rise from the current one - to - three to one - to - four . The ratios would rise further if a fully - qualified teacher is present . She will also relax how these rules are interpreted . \" One of the problems that parents have is not just the exorbitant cost , it is the availability [ of childcare ] . I personally have struggled to find a nursery place for love or money , and many parents say that , \" Truss said on Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday morning . By raising care ratios , Truss said , popular operations would be able to expand by economies of scale , which would make childcare more widely available . Reforms , she said , would also mean better paid and better qualified staff . \" The pay level of staff at the moment \u2013 nursery workers are getting \u00a3 6.60 an hour \u2013 it 's barely more than the minimum wage . I do not think that is an acceptable wage rate for what should be a professional job . \" What I want to see [ in nursery care ] is something that is much more a continuum of the education system . \" The Department for Education ( DfE ) said the proposals were dependent on staff possessing higher qualifications , including C-grade GCSE maths and English . The DfE said : \" England 's relatively tight ratios have two main effects : higher costs for parents and lower pay for staff . In turn , low pay drags down the quality of the workforce . In other countries providers can use the extra income they get from taking on more children to reduce fees for parents and pay staff more , but this is not possible in England . \" The proposed flexibility has been labelled \" unacceptable and a recipe for disaster \" by the Pre-School Learning Alliance , the largest representative organisation of early years providers . Labour has also attacked the proposals . The shadow education secretary , Stephen Twigg , said : \" Experts are warning this could threaten child safety and wo n't reduce costs . Parents will be worried . \" Truss is also to propose that \" one - stop shop \" child agencies be given more freedom to help home - based childminders . Truss will tell the Policy Exchange thinktank : \" We have seen a decrease in the number of childminders over recent years . This is , in part , because childminders have to be business owners . Some people want a simpler way to enter the profession and parents want to be assured of quality .

Elizabeth Truss , the early years minister , has proposed that childminders , currently restricted to looking after three children per staff member from the ages of one to five inclusive , should in future be permitted to look after four children . They would also be allowed to look after two children under one year of age , instead of the current one . Truss will seek to allay parents ' fears of their children being neglected by overpressed staff , pointing out that the relaxation she proposes still leaves more restrictive ratios than Denmark , France and Germany \u2013 three countries often cited as providing high - quality care for pre-school children . The minister will quote experts claiming that in Britain more qualifications are needed to look after animals than toddlers . She is also proposing that nurseries be allowed to relax their ratios when qualified staff are present , increasing from four to six two -year - old children per staff member . In the case of one-year -olds , the permitted staff - to - child ratios would rise from the current one - to - three to one - to - four . The ratios would rise further if a fully - qualified teacher is present . She will also relax how these rules are interpreted . \" One of the problems that parents have is not just the exorbitant cost , it is the availability [ of childcare ] . I personally have struggled to find a nursery place for love or money , and many parents say that , \" Truss said on Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday morning . By raising care ratios , Truss said , popular operations would be able to expand by economies of scale , which would make childcare more widely available . Reforms , she said , would also mean better paid and better qualified staff . \" The pay level of staff at the moment \u2013 nursery workers are getting \u00a3 6.60 an hour \u2013 it 's barely more than the minimum wage . I do not think that is an acceptable wage rate for what should be a professional job . \" What I want to see [ in nursery care ] is something that is much more a continuum of the education system . \" The Department for Education ( DfE ) said the proposals were dependent on staff possessing higher qualifications , including C-grade GCSE maths and English . The DfE said : \" England 's relatively tight ratios have two main effects : higher costs for parents and lower pay for staff . In turn , low pay drags down the quality of the workforce . In other countries providers can use the extra income they get from taking on more children to reduce fees for parents and pay staff more , but this is not possible in England . \" The proposed flexibility has been labelled \" unacceptable and a recipe for disaster \" by the Pre-School Learning Alliance , the largest representative organisation of early years providers . Labour has also attacked the proposals . The shadow education secretary , Stephen Twigg , said : \" Experts are warning this could threaten child safety and wo n't reduce costs . Parents will be worried . \" Truss is also to propose that \" one - stop shop \" child agencies be given more freedom to help home - based childminders . Truss will tell the Policy Exchange thinktank : \" We have seen a decrease in the number of childminders over recent years . This is , in part , because childminders have to be business owners . Some people want a simpler way to enter the profession and parents want to be assured of quality . So we are setting up ' one - stop shops ' called childminder agencies to do the practicalities and to give parents some reassurance over quality . \" She added she would introduce graduate - level early years teachers trained specifically to teach young children . Only 23 % of nursery staff , and 10 % of home - based childminders , are qualified to A-level standard or equivalent .

Plans are taking shape for lavish celebrations \u2013 including a host of TV and radio documentaries and books , and even a float at the Notting Hill carnival \u2013 of an anniversary that many hope will bring belated recognition to one of England 's greatest but most overlooked creations . Eight hundred years ago next year , on 15 June 1215 , on the banks of the Thames in Runnymede , an embattled King John met the English barons , who had backed his failed war against the French and were seeking to limit his powers . The weakened monarch had little choice but to witness the sealing of what some say is the world 's most important document , one that , symbolically at least , established a new relationship between the king and his subjects . Thus the original Magna Carta , 3,500 words in Latin on a calfskin parchment , came into being , its enduring relevance confirmed in the many legal cases in which it is cited today . But while lawyers worship Magna Carta for laying the foundations for modern democracy , the defence of personal liberty and the protection of freedoms around the world , Britain largely ignores it . The 750th anniversary passed in 1965 with little fanfare . Plans for the 700th anniversary were abandoned due to the first world war . An appeal to the government for a national holiday next year , backed by many MPs , was rejected . History as an academic discipline has also often been reluctant to pay homage . The 1214 battle of Bouvines , the decisive battle after which England was forced to concede it had lost most of its lands in France , a pivotal moment in the weakening of John 's position , has been described as \u201c the most important battle in history that nobody has ever heard of \u201d . And until recently Magna Carta was only on the periphery of the history syllabus . Even David Cameron , when asked on a US chat show , was unable to say what Magna Carta means in English ( answer : \u201c Great Charter \u201d ) . Runnymede also appears underwhelmed by its place in history . The only memorial to Magna Carta within the National Trust park that incorporates the meadow , bisected by a busy road , is a small , domed shelter built in 1957 by the American Bar Association . Two signs explain how the Pilgrim Fathers took a copy of Magna Carta with them , which helped Americans to frame their constitution , and how the document was used by Nancy Astor to promote universal suffrage , and by William Wilberforce and Abraham Lincoln to press for the abolition of slavery . The absence of a more fitting British memorial is surprising . Apparently the National Trust feared that putting Runnymede on the cultural map would cause traffic problems . \u201c I've been wondering why that is [ the absence of a visitor centre ] for 20 years , \u201d said Sir Robert Worcester , chairman of the Magna Carta 800th Committee who can trace his family back to the Pilgrim Fathers . He describes Magna Carta as \u201c England 's greatest export \u201d , and reels off the key tenets it has bequeathed to the world \u2013 \u201c due process of law ; no one is above the law ; justice delayed is justice denied ; no taxation without representation ; the English Church shall be free \u201d . Worcester and his fellow enthusiasts hope 2015 will be the year Magna Carta gets the anniversary it deserves . Tens of millions of national lottery pounds are being poured into key Magna Carta sites across England . Websites have been constructed ; commemorative gold coins and stamps are to be issued ; a peal of bells will ring from churches ; a series of lectures around the world , starting with one by Neil MacGregor , director of the British Museum , will emphasise the document 's enduring importance ; the British Library will host the largest exhibition in its history ; special songs and poems will be performed ; Magna Carta will even get its own display at the Notting Hill carnival . The creation of a visitor centre near Runnymede could also become a reality . Worcester talks optimistically of signing a deal with Royal Holloway University , which is a couple of miles away . However , capturing public interest remains a challenge . \u201c Unlike other artefacts which may be a bit more sexy , it 's a piece of parchment with some rather unintelligible words written on it in Latin , \u201d acknowledged Sandra Matthews - Marsh , chief executive of Visit Kent , the body that promotes tourism in the county keen to put itself on the newly launched Magna Carta tourist map . \u201c But the exhibition designers and curators we 've appointed are really excited about the job . Their task is to bring the thing to life , not only to tell the story of why it was so important but what its relevance is today . \u201d It is a task in need of fulfilment . Last Thursday a British Asian family , father , mother , grandmother and three daughters , walked across the meadow at Runnymede and stood in front of the American Bar Association 's memorial . \u201c What do you mean , ' Is that all there is ? ' , \u201d the mother hissed in response to a mumbled observation from one of her daughters . For several minutes the family examined the signs and took selfies . Then they made their way back to the nearby car park and its National Trust tearoom . The US - built memorial stood unobserved in the autumn sunshine . Across the meadow came the roar of traffic , its drivers oblivious to the fact they were speeding past history . Magna Carta ? So what was that all about ? I 've heard of it . Some Latin document written long ago . Did n't David Cameron talk about it on a chat show once ? Yes . He was forced to admit he did not know what Magna Carta was in English . Idiot . So what does it mean ? Great Charter . Sounds impressive . Indeed .

It was n't the only odd question he has heard over the years about his brothers , who are joined at the torso . There are others : \" Y' all born that way ? Y'all brothers ? \" \" It 's fascinating , \" he said with a laugh . Ronnie and Donnie Galyon have been turning heads and surprising people since they were born Oct. 28 , 1951 , in Beavercreek , Ohio , with Donnie emerging headfirst and Ronnie coming out feet-first . They were healthy babies , weighing 11 pounds , 11.5 ounces , but the doctors kept them in the hospital for two years , in part to figure out if there was a safe way to separate them . When they told their parents they could not guarantee that both boys would survive the operation , the parents refused to allow it . That was the right decision , say Ronnie and Donnie , as they sat facing each other in the bed / chair they share . Donnie held up a gold crucifix he wears on a chain around his neck . \" The good Lord made us . Let our savior do it , \" Ronnie said . \" No surgeon 's knives , \" Donnie said . Related : Ronnie and Donnie say a custom-designed bed from Mary Free Bed is one reason they are doing so well At 62 , the Galyon twins are the oldest living conjoined twins in the U.S. They soon expect to surpass a record set by Chang and Eng Bunker , conjoined twins born in 1811 in Thailand and who settled in North Carolina , as the longest living conjoined twins . Their brother Jim opened up scrapbooks assembled over the years by their mother , showing the nine children of Eileen and Wesley Galyon growing up in the farming community of Beavercreek , Ohio , near Dayton . Their dad , handy with tools , crafted chairs and other devices to accommodate the twins ' unusual needs . They are joined at the waist , sharing one set of lower digestive organs and rectum , but they have separate hearts , stomachs and two sets of arms and legs . Ronnie and Donnie were 11 when Jim , the youngest , was born , and they shared a special bond with their baby brother . CONJOINED TWINS \u2022 Conjoined twins occur once in every 200,000 live births . \u2022 The survival rate is between 5 and 25 percent . \u2022 70 percent of all conjoined twins born alive are girls \u2022 They are genetically identical . The developing embryo starts to split into identical twins during the first few weeks after conception , but stops before the process is complete . SOURCE \u2013 University of Maryland Medical Center \" When he was a little boy he sat there where we 're joined at , \" Ronnie said , patting the band of cartilage that links him and Donnie mid-torso . When the twins were 4 , their dad took them on the road to perform in carnivals throughout the U.S. Visitors paid to look in the windows of an RV bearing the sign \" Alive in person \u2013 Galyon Siamese twins . \" Spectators watched the boys going about their daily life . They traveled most of the year , and the money they earned supported the family . \" That was the only income . They were the breadwinners , \" said Jim . He and his wife , Mary , have looked after Ronnie and Donnie since they retired in 1991 . Four years ago , the twins moved into Jim and Mary 's home . \" That 's kind of giving it back right now . I do n't do it because of that , but I feel that way , \" Jim said . \" They paid for us all growing up . \" \" It was fun , \" Ronnie said . \" You do what you got to do . \" The closeness the three brothers share is lightened with bantering and teasing . Jim quoted their family doctor calling Ronnie and Donnie \" a national treasure . \" But then he added , \" He does n't have to live with them , \" and his brothers laughed . When Donnie and Ronnie reached school age , their parents sent them to school , but they were n't allowed to attend . Officials said they were too distracting to the other students . \" It was a different era , \" Jim said . Performing in carnivals , Ronnie and Donnie found another community in the workers who ran food booths and the sideshow performers . Their friends included Johan the Viking giant ; Little Pete , who was 16 inches tall and billed as the smallest man in the world ; and Margaret Pellegrini , an actress who performed as a munchkin in \" The Wizard of Oz . \" In free time between fairs , their dad organized baseball games . \" When we were on the road , it was all like one big family , \" Ronnie said . In the early 1970s , sideshow acts became taboo in the U.S. The Galyon twins started traveling in Central and South America and performed as circus headliners . They did magic tricks , such as making a tiger disappear . \" They were treated totally different down there , \" Jim said . \" They were treated like rock stars . \" SEND A CARD Ronnie and Donnie Galyon would love to receive cards congratulating them on reaching the American record for longest living conjoined twins .

The twins have endured taunts , mocking laughter from adults , teenagers peeking in their windows or spitting on the glass . But at times , strangers have offered to pay their bill at a restaurant or take time to get to know them . \" You see the warmest of hearts , and you see the coldest of hearts , and a little bit in between , \" Jim said . The curiosity of children never bothered them , Ronnie added . When a child asks , \" How did you get like this ? \" he reassures the mother that he does n't mind the question . \" I say , ' Sweetheart , I was born this way , \" he said . \" Kids are innocent . \" The twins have learned the art of compromise over the years , but it has n't always been easy . In the past , they have taken swings at each other , drawing blood . But when they started taking blood thinners a few years ago , they realized that a fight could be fatal . \" They get into it verbally , of course , \" Jim said . \" But that 's understandable when you got somebody right there 24 - 7 , seven days a week , year after year after year . \" Still , Donnie and Ronnie say they are best friends .

It was n't the only odd question he has heard over the years about his brothers , who are joined at the torso . There are others : \" Y' all born that way ? Y'all brothers ? \" \" It 's fascinating , \" he said with a laugh . Ronnie and Donnie Galyon have been turning heads and surprising people since they were born Oct. 28 , 1951 , in Beavercreek , Ohio , with Donnie emerging headfirst and Ronnie coming out feet-first . They were healthy babies , weighing 11 pounds , 11.5 ounces , but the doctors kept them in the hospital for two years , in part to figure out if there was a safe way to separate them . When they told their parents they could not guarantee that both boys would survive the operation , the parents refused to allow it . That was the right decision , say Ronnie and Donnie , as they sat facing each other in the bed / chair they share . Donnie held up a gold crucifix he wears on a chain around his neck . \" The good Lord made us . Let our savior do it , \" Ronnie said . \" No surgeon 's knives , \" Donnie said . Related : Ronnie and Donnie say a custom-designed bed from Mary Free Bed is one reason they are doing so well At 62 , the Galyon twins are the oldest living conjoined twins in the U.S. They soon expect to surpass a record set by Chang and Eng Bunker , conjoined twins born in 1811 in Thailand and who settled in North Carolina , as the longest living conjoined twins . Their brother Jim opened up scrapbooks assembled over the years by their mother , showing the nine children of Eileen and Wesley Galyon growing up in the farming community of Beavercreek , Ohio , near Dayton . Their dad , handy with tools , crafted chairs and other devices to accommodate the twins ' unusual needs . They are joined at the waist , sharing one set of lower digestive organs and rectum , but they have separate hearts , stomachs and two sets of arms and legs . Ronnie and Donnie were 11 when Jim , the youngest , was born , and they shared a special bond with their baby brother . CONJOINED TWINS \u2022 Conjoined twins occur once in every 200,000 live births . \u2022 The survival rate is between 5 and 25 percent . \u2022 70 percent of all conjoined twins born alive are girls \u2022 They are genetically identical . The developing embryo starts to split into identical twins during the first few weeks after conception , but stops before the process is complete . SOURCE \u2013 University of Maryland Medical Center \" When he was a little boy he sat there where we 're joined at , \" Ronnie said , patting the band of cartilage that links him and Donnie mid-torso . When the twins were 4 , their dad took them on the road to perform in carnivals throughout the U.S. Visitors paid to look in the windows of an RV bearing the sign \" Alive in person \u2013 Galyon Siamese twins . \" Spectators watched the boys going about their daily life . They traveled most of the year , and the money they earned supported the family . \" That was the only income . They were the breadwinners , \" said Jim . He and his wife , Mary , have looked after Ronnie and Donnie since they retired in 1991 . Four years ago , the twins moved into Jim and Mary 's home . \" That 's kind of giving it back right now . I do n't do it because of that , but I feel that way , \" Jim said . \" They paid for us all growing up . \" \" It was fun , \" Ronnie said . \" You do what you got to do . \" The closeness the three brothers share is lightened with bantering and teasing . Jim quoted their family doctor calling Ronnie and Donnie \" a national treasure . \" But then he added , \" He does n't have to live with them , \" and his brothers laughed . When Donnie and Ronnie reached school age , their parents sent them to school , but they were n't allowed to attend . Officials said they were too distracting to the other students . \" It was a different era , \" Jim said . Performing in carnivals , Ronnie and Donnie found another community in the workers who ran food booths and the sideshow performers . Their friends included Johan the Viking giant ; Little Pete , who was 16 inches tall and billed as the smallest man in the world ; and Margaret Pellegrini , an actress who performed as a munchkin in \" The Wizard of Oz . \" In free time between fairs , their dad organized baseball games . \" When we were on the road , it was all like one big family , \" Ronnie said . In the early 1970s , sideshow acts became taboo in the U.S. The Galyon twins started traveling in Central and South America and performed as circus headliners . They did magic tricks , such as making a tiger disappear . \" They were treated totally different down there , \" Jim said . \" They were treated like rock stars . \" SEND A CARD Ronnie and Donnie Galyon would love to receive cards congratulating them on reaching the American record for longest living conjoined twins .

But at times , strangers have offered to pay their bill at a restaurant or take time to get to know them . \" You see the warmest of hearts , and you see the coldest of hearts , and a little bit in between , \" Jim said . The curiosity of children never bothered them , Ronnie added . When a child asks , \" How did you get like this ? \" he reassures the mother that he does n't mind the question . \" I say , ' Sweetheart , I was born this way , \" he said . \" Kids are innocent . \" The twins have learned the art of compromise over the years , but it has n't always been easy . In the past , they have taken swings at each other , drawing blood . But when they started taking blood thinners a few years ago , they realized that a fight could be fatal . \" They get into it verbally , of course , \" Jim said . \" But that 's understandable when you got somebody right there 24 - 7 , seven days a week , year after year after year . \" Still , Donnie and Ronnie say they are best friends .

The first Vicky Bliss novel , Borrower of the Night , was written in 1973 . Vicky was working at a small Midwestern College where she was an overworked and underpaid History teacher trying to fend off marriage proposals from Tony whose major redeeming quality was that he was taller than her . Tony arrogantly challenges Vicky to find a mysterious wooden sculpture that disappeared during the wars in the 1500s claiming he will prove that he is better than her at sleuthing and then she will certainly want to marry him . They head off to Rothenburg , Germany where the Schloss Drachenstein has been turned into a hotel . They are joined by very rich antiques collector George Nolan not a man known for his honesty . The three enter into competition to find the legendary wood carving by Riemenschneider . The castle is run by the cute little Irma Drachenstein . Every creepy old castle must have an odd relative and this one has not only Irma 's Aunt but also a rich old lady who is interested in the spirit world . The book introduces one of my favorite characters of all time , Dr. Anton Schmidt , who runs a museum in Munich . The book proceeds to throw everything you could ever want with a spooky castle as a setting . There is a heroine who is scared of something , s\u00e9ances , secret rooms , attacking suits of armor , and enough crosses and double crosses to keep you guessing as to who is on which side . It is a great start to the series . Street of Five Moons finds Vicky working for the delightful Dr. Schmidt in Munich . The roly - poly Herr Doktor Schmidt fashions himself as a great detective with Vicky as his Watson . When a dead man is found with no identification , a cryptic note with an address of 37 Street of Five Moons in Rome , and a forgery of a necklace with the original dating to Charlemagne 's time that is good enough to fool experts Schmidt decides that they need to solve the mystery . Actually Vicky needs to solve the mystery for Schmidt and away she goes to visit Rome . Vicky believes that the whole thing is a wild goose chase but decides to break into the antique store at 37 Street of Five Moons . There she runs into Caesar a Doberman watchdog that falls in love with her . She also finds evidence that there is a major swindle going on in the antiques world where brilliantly made fakes are taking the place of antique jewelry . Vicky meets the enigmatic Englishman Sir John Smythe the next day at the antique store and her life will never be the same . This book also has a great castle belonging to an Italian Count that is supposed to be haunted . It turns out that Sir John is the private secretary to the Count . Of course Vicky ends up at the castle and the book has all the proper elements to make it a perfect mystery . There are ghosts , a formidable grandmother , a mistress , a disturbed son , servants who are not what they seem , dungeons , and we ca n't forget an Italian Princess . It is good fun . In Silhouette in Scarlet Vicky is lured to Sweden by John Smythe . Vicky is irritated that Symthe has left her in the lurch before to pay hotel bills while he has snuck out to avoid being arrested . Vicky blows Smyth 's cover at the airport and proceeds to go off on her own . She meets Leif who tries to woo her at the same time getting information on Smythe while claiming to work for a Special Police Branch dealing with antiquities . She also meets the very creepy Max whose hobby is making silhouettes of people out of black paper . Vicky believes that John is up to something that deals with a fifth century chalice that was found in a farmer 's field in the late 1800s . The chalice was believed to come from the loot of Viking raiders . Vicky is contacted by rich elderly farmer named Gustav Jonsson who claims to be a distant relative of hers . It is no coincidence that he owns the farm where the chalice was found . Vicky suspects that the man is being hoodwinked and decides to go visit and talk to him in person . Naturally she meets John up there and they are surprised by a criminal gang the next day who want to dig up the farmer 's land in search of more treasure . The mystery makes good use of an island that is cut off and some very nasty villains . In Trojan Gold Vicky receives a mysterious package that contains a photograph of a woman wearing jewelry that was stolen by the Nazis and disappeared during the fall of Berlin . Other experts who are friends of Vicky 's have also received a picture but not exactly the same one . When Vicky starts investigating she discovers that the same friends who attended an archeological conference in a small town the previous year are back . Vicky 's photograph has come from the innkeeper of the inn where they stayed . The inn is now run by the man 's young widow . He had been struck down by a hit and run driver . Where there is illegal treasure of course there is John Smyth . Dr. Schmidt has decided to take a personal interest in the case and help solve the mystery . It is a rich mixture of people who are all hoping to find the treasure for their own museums , a young widow who is obviously frightened , a hot headed cousin of the widow , and a mastermind who could be just about anybody . Instead of a castle this time we get an abandoned church and a lonely graveyard . Being winter in the Alps around Christmas we also get avalanches . This mystery has a lot of red herrings and is a bit confusing at times but still is enjoyable in the end . Night Train to Memphis is the best book in the series . Vicky is asked by Interpol to infiltrate a luxury cruise in Egypt and look over the passengers and see if she can identify a criminal that they believe is about to pull off a big heist at the Egyptian Museum . Vicky is promised protection and that there will be no danger to her . She is shocked when she realizes that John is aboard the ship but not nearly as shocked as when she finds out that he has a brand new and very young bride . Of course the only crook Vicky recognizes is her former lover . Vicky 's fellow travelers include a very flaky mystery writer , Sweet and Bright and odd couple team where only Sweet talks , a charming multi-millionaire who is about to make a very large donation to Egyptian archeology , a very boring professor whose lectures are a cure for insomnia , her former flame and his wife and his mother , a ditzy widow looking for a new rich husband , and sweet little lady who has more in common with Vicky then she realizes . Of course Vicky 's boss Dr. Schmidt shows up to make life difficult as Vicky tries to keep him safe and he tries to insinuate himself in the case . Dr. Schmidt 's new passion is for Country and Western music . This book is treasure for people who love Country and Western music with its references and clues based on the music . Vicky finds new enemies as well as some old ones who are not in jail as she had thought . There are again crosses and double - crosses and people who are not what they seem . Schmidt has a rather large role in this book which is a delight as he is one of my favorite characters of all time . Elizabeth Peters did a final book to close the Vicky Bliss series called The Laughter of Dead Kings . It is probably my least favor of the books . I got the sense that she knew she had to wrap up some things . In her introduction she did mention that in this story she was kind of stuck because of the length of time between books . After talking things over with fellow writers she decided to put the story in the \u201c current now . \u201d In other words she got to play God with her universe and creations and Vicky is still in her early thirties and using modern technology . The story takes place again in Egypt about 6 months or so from the events of Night Train to Memphis . In the story someone has stolen the mummy of King Tutankhamun .

The first Vicky Bliss novel , Borrower of the Night , was written in 1973 . Vicky was working at a small Midwestern College where she was an overworked and underpaid History teacher trying to fend off marriage proposals from Tony whose major redeeming quality was that he was taller than her . Tony arrogantly challenges Vicky to find a mysterious wooden sculpture that disappeared during the wars in the 1500s claiming he will prove that he is better than her at sleuthing and then she will certainly want to marry him . They head off to Rothenburg , Germany where the Schloss Drachenstein has been turned into a hotel . They are joined by very rich antiques collector George Nolan not a man known for his honesty . The three enter into competition to find the legendary wood carving by Riemenschneider . The castle is run by the cute little Irma Drachenstein . Every creepy old castle must have an odd relative and this one has not only Irma 's Aunt but also a rich old lady who is interested in the spirit world . The book introduces one of my favorite characters of all time , Dr. Anton Schmidt , who runs a museum in Munich . The book proceeds to throw everything you could ever want with a spooky castle as a setting . There is a heroine who is scared of something , s\u00e9ances , secret rooms , attacking suits of armor , and enough crosses and double crosses to keep you guessing as to who is on which side . It is a great start to the series . Street of Five Moons finds Vicky working for the delightful Dr. Schmidt in Munich . The roly - poly Herr Doktor Schmidt fashions himself as a great detective with Vicky as his Watson . When a dead man is found with no identification , a cryptic note with an address of 37 Street of Five Moons in Rome , and a forgery of a necklace with the original dating to Charlemagne 's time that is good enough to fool experts Schmidt decides that they need to solve the mystery . Actually Vicky needs to solve the mystery for Schmidt and away she goes to visit Rome . Vicky believes that the whole thing is a wild goose chase but decides to break into the antique store at 37 Street of Five Moons . There she runs into Caesar a Doberman watchdog that falls in love with her . She also finds evidence that there is a major swindle going on in the antiques world where brilliantly made fakes are taking the place of antique jewelry . Vicky meets the enigmatic Englishman Sir John Smythe the next day at the antique store and her life will never be the same . This book also has a great castle belonging to an Italian Count that is supposed to be haunted . It turns out that Sir John is the private secretary to the Count . Of course Vicky ends up at the castle and the book has all the proper elements to make it a perfect mystery . There are ghosts , a formidable grandmother , a mistress , a disturbed son , servants who are not what they seem , dungeons , and we ca n't forget an Italian Princess . It is good fun . In Silhouette in Scarlet Vicky is lured to Sweden by John Smythe . Vicky is irritated that Symthe has left her in the lurch before to pay hotel bills while he has snuck out to avoid being arrested . Vicky blows Smyth 's cover at the airport and proceeds to go off on her own . She meets Leif who tries to woo her at the same time getting information on Smythe while claiming to work for a Special Police Branch dealing with antiquities . She also meets the very creepy Max whose hobby is making silhouettes of people out of black paper . Vicky believes that John is up to something that deals with a fifth century chalice that was found in a farmer 's field in the late 1800s . The chalice was believed to come from the loot of Viking raiders . Vicky is contacted by rich elderly farmer named Gustav Jonsson who claims to be a distant relative of hers . It is no coincidence that he owns the farm where the chalice was found . Vicky suspects that the man is being hoodwinked and decides to go visit and talk to him in person . Naturally she meets John up there and they are surprised by a criminal gang the next day who want to dig up the farmer 's land in search of more treasure . The mystery makes good use of an island that is cut off and some very nasty villains . In Trojan Gold Vicky receives a mysterious package that contains a photograph of a woman wearing jewelry that was stolen by the Nazis and disappeared during the fall of Berlin . Other experts who are friends of Vicky 's have also received a picture but not exactly the same one . When Vicky starts investigating she discovers that the same friends who attended an archeological conference in a small town the previous year are back . Vicky 's photograph has come from the innkeeper of the inn where they stayed . The inn is now run by the man 's young widow . He had been struck down by a hit and run driver . Where there is illegal treasure of course there is John Smyth . Dr. Schmidt has decided to take a personal interest in the case and help solve the mystery . It is a rich mixture of people who are all hoping to find the treasure for their own museums , a young widow who is obviously frightened , a hot headed cousin of the widow , and a mastermind who could be just about anybody . Instead of a castle this time we get an abandoned church and a lonely graveyard . Being winter in the Alps around Christmas we also get avalanches . This mystery has a lot of red herrings and is a bit confusing at times but still is enjoyable in the end . Night Train to Memphis is the best book in the series . Vicky is asked by Interpol to infiltrate a luxury cruise in Egypt and look over the passengers and see if she can identify a criminal that they believe is about to pull off a big heist at the Egyptian Museum . Vicky is promised protection and that there will be no danger to her . She is shocked when she realizes that John is aboard the ship but not nearly as shocked as when she finds out that he has a brand new and very young bride . Of course the only crook Vicky recognizes is her former lover . Vicky 's fellow travelers include a very flaky mystery writer , Sweet and Bright and odd couple team where only Sweet talks , a charming multi-millionaire who is about to make a very large donation to Egyptian archeology , a very boring professor whose lectures are a cure for insomnia , her former flame and his wife and his mother , a ditzy widow looking for a new rich husband , and sweet little lady who has more in common with Vicky then she realizes . Of course Vicky 's boss Dr. Schmidt shows up to make life difficult as Vicky tries to keep him safe and he tries to insinuate himself in the case . Dr. Schmidt 's new passion is for Country and Western music . This book is treasure for people who love Country and Western music with its references and clues based on the music . Vicky finds new enemies as well as some old ones who are not in jail as she had thought . There are again crosses and double - crosses and people who are not what they seem . Schmidt has a rather large role in this book which is a delight as he is one of my favorite characters of all time . Elizabeth Peters did a final book to close the Vicky Bliss series called The Laughter of Dead Kings . It is probably my least favor of the books . I got the sense that she knew she had to wrap up some things . In her introduction she did mention that in this story she was kind of stuck because of the length of time between books . After talking things over with fellow writers she decided to put the story in the \u201c current now . \u201d In other words she got to play God with her universe and creations and Vicky is still in her early thirties and using modern technology . The story takes place again in Egypt about 6 months or so from the events of Night Train to Memphis . In the story someone has stolen the mummy of King Tutankhamun . All clues lead to Vicky 's lover John Smythe who now goes by his real name of Tregarth . John swears his innocence and he and Vicky proceed to try and find the real thief . They are joined along the way by people from others books . Schmidt again has a large and funny part . We also meet Suzy and Feisal who were in Night Train to Memphis and Jan Perlmutter from Trojan Gold . The story drags a bit but I urge you to make it through to the end . There is a bit there that had me laughing so hard the first time I read it . I do n't care if the story was a set up for Elizabeth Peter 's ending it is worth the ride .

No one has lived here for nearly 60 years , and the public is banned from its 628 acres . Now , after spending $ 100,000 on a 15 - year plan for Nomans Land , federal officials want it to stay that way . The Fish & Wildlife Service has recommended that Nomans Land be protected as federal wilderness , meaning that if the public wants a glimpse of this National Wildlife Refuge , options could be limited to a virtual tour on the Web or a magnifying scope on the Vineyard . The island , used as an aerial bombing range from 1943 to 1996 , is pocked with unexploded munitions that make one of Southern New England 's last wild places a potentially deadly hazard . \u201c I think it 's important to have a few places that are completely prohibited from the public , '' said Stephanie Koch , a US Fish & Wildlife Service biologist , who walked the beach at Nomans Land recently in search of a piping plover nest . \u201c I know that 's a hard sell for a lot of people . '' It 's also a reality that four Navy sweeps of the island since 1997 have not altered . Although munitions have been found , defused , and removed from the surface , an undetermined amount of bombs lie underground and undetected . \u201c The result could be catastrophic , '' Koch said of public access to Nomans Land . But this nightmare for human visitors is a blessing for its avian guests . Due to its undisturbed nature and shortage of predators , Nomans Land is an important stop on the Atlantic Flyway for songbirds migrating south as far as South America . Northern harriers , oystercatchers , roseate terns , catbirds , double - crested cormorants , and even piping plovers are a few of the many species that the Fish & Wildlife Service monitors in roughly six visits to the island each year . A few stone walls remain from homes and farms that once dotted the island , and a small family cemetery lies perilously close to an eroding 20 - foot cliff on the northern shore . Otherwise , Nomans Land is a deserted place . \u201c When I 'm out here , this feels as much like wilderness as any other place I 've been in New England , '' said Koch , as she savored a 360 - degree ocean view from the island 's 110 - foot summit . To that end , the Fish & Wildlife Service has recommended that Nomans Land be protected , which would preserve its natural , minimally managed solitude . Another option , which the service has offered but not recommended , would maintain the current oversight , which provides slightly more on - site management than for wilderness . A third possible option , among other changes , would expand federal management of Nomans , possibly clear additional trails , and develop a partnership with the Wampanoag tribe on Martha 's Vineyard that would allow limited access for cultural and ceremonial uses . Bettina Washington , historic preservation officer for the Aquinnah - based tribe , said an expanded Wampanoag connection with the island would be welcome . \u201c Our wish is , once again , at least to go over and pay our respects , '' said Washington , who has never visited Nomans Land . Wampanoag remains are believed to be buried on the island , which the tribe 's oral history says was created when Moshup , an ancestral giant , tossed a crab into the ocean . The origin of the island 's name is shrouded in mystery , but some evidence points to a reference to Tequenomans , an ancient Wampanoag sachem . Bartholomew Gosnold , an English explorer , sighted the island in 1602 , and more than three centuries of habitation followed until the Crane family sold Nomans Land to the Navy in 1952 . The island , nominally part of the Town of Chilmark , was transferred to the Department of the Interior in 1998 . The danger of buried munitions has led to fishing restrictions , as well as the ban on public access . Still , two unauthorized visitors walked the island after they anchored offshore . Roger Hoffman praised the beauty of the place . \u201c It 's a privilege to see it , '' Hoffman told Koch as they passed on an inland trail . That privilege , however , led to a $ 100 fine levied by a Fish & Wildlife Service officer . The 15 - year proposal for Nomans Land is among the plans required for National Wildlife Refuges across the country , Koch said , and will be finalized this fall before being submitted to the Northeast regional director of the Fish & Wildlife Service . After approval , Nomans Land almost certainly will remain an enigma to the public . \u201c It really does feel like you 're on your own island , '' said Jason St. Sauver , a biologist who visited recently . \u201c It feels like no one 's been out there for hundreds of years .

Bettina Washington , historic preservation officer for the Aquinnah - based tribe , said an expanded Wampanoag connection with the island would be welcome . \u201c Our wish is , once again , at least to go over and pay our respects , '' said Washington , who has never visited Nomans Land . Wampanoag remains are believed to be buried on the island , which the tribe 's oral history says was created when Moshup , an ancestral giant , tossed a crab into the ocean . The origin of the island 's name is shrouded in mystery , but some evidence points to a reference to Tequenomans , an ancient Wampanoag sachem . Bartholomew Gosnold , an English explorer , sighted the island in 1602 , and more than three centuries of habitation followed until the Crane family sold Nomans Land to the Navy in 1952 . The island , nominally part of the Town of Chilmark , was transferred to the Department of the Interior in 1998 . The danger of buried munitions has led to fishing restrictions , as well as the ban on public access . Still , two unauthorized visitors walked the island after they anchored offshore . Roger Hoffman praised the beauty of the place . \u201c It 's a privilege to see it , '' Hoffman told Koch as they passed on an inland trail . That privilege , however , led to a $ 100 fine levied by a Fish & Wildlife Service officer . The 15 - year proposal for Nomans Land is among the plans required for National Wildlife Refuges across the country , Koch said , and will be finalized this fall before being submitted to the Northeast regional director of the Fish & Wildlife Service . After approval , Nomans Land almost certainly will remain an enigma to the public . \u201c It really does feel like you 're on your own island , '' said Jason St. Sauver , a biologist who visited recently . \u201c It feels like no one 's been out there for hundreds of years .

Along the way , the Frenchies cross paths with an uptight Brit ( Guillaume Gallienne ) , his undersexed wife ( Charlotte Le Bon ) and their over - anal servant ( Val\u00e9rie Lemercier ) , resulting in lots of cultural clashes and commentaries on the age - old cross - Channel rivalry . Indeed , many \u2014 way too many \u2014 of the jokes here involve the various French cast members speaking their native language with ridiculous British accents ( an effect that will be lost on non- French speaking viewers ) , and while some such gags work initially , the film overstretches them across 110 minutes of action that , like the Romans surrounding Cordelia 's fort , winds up turning in circles . The bits involving a squad of invading Vikings ( the \u201c Normans \u201d ) are especially tedious and over - the -top , even if there are a few brief instances of cleverness , such as a scene where a Norman fighter ( Dany Boon ) is subjected to a Clockwork Orange - style lesson in English manners .

On Monday , an AN - 26 of the private Galaxie company struck a tree as it was landing at Isiro , in the northeast of the vast country . All 11 people aboard , including three crew members , were killed . The following day , a Beechcraft Baron 58 of the Flying Air Service company crashed on landing at Goma airport in eastern DRC after a test flight . The French pilot later died of injuries . On Thursday , three people were slightly injured in the forced landing of an aircraft belonging to Transport de Message du Kivu at Murandi airport , also in eastern DRC . After a series of fatal accidents , the DRC government decided on Friday to reinforce flight regulations and banned flights of 33 of the country 's 51 private aviation companies before they can meet the safety standards . The government also announced measures for more frequent aircraft inspections and the grounding of all aircraft more than 20 years old . But many doubt whether tighter regulations would be implemented smoothly , as more than half of the aircraft in the war-torn country are over 20 years old .

These BIOS services are still used ( especially during bootup ) , and are often named \" BIOS functions \" . In Real Mode , they can be easily accessed through software interrupts , using Assembly language .

Human Rights Watch called on Congress to amend federal law that permits children under age 18 to work for hire in agriculture at far younger ages , for far longer hours , and in far more hazardous conditions than in any other industry . In its 99 - page report , \" Fields of Peril : Child Labor in US Agriculture , \" Human Rights Watch found that child farmworkers risked their safety , health , and education on commercial farms across the United States . For the report , Human Rights Watch interviewed 59 children under age 18 who had worked as farmworkers in 14 states in various regions of the United States . \" The United States is a developing country when it comes to child farmworkers , \" said Zama Coursen - Neff , author of the report and deputy director of the Children 's Rights Division at Human Rights Watch . \" Children who pick America 's food should at least have the same protections as those who serve it . \" Child farmworkers as young as 12 years old often work for hire for 10 or more hours a day , five to seven days a week , Human Rights Watch found . Some start working part-time at age 6 or 7 . Children , like many adult farmworkers , typically earn far less than minimum wage , and their pay is often further cut because employers underreport hours and force them to spend their own money on tools , gloves , and drinking water that their employers should provide by law . Agriculture is the most dangerous work open to children in the United States , according to the Centers for Disease Control 's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) . Children risk pesticide poisoning , serious injury , and heat illness . They suffer fatalities at more than four times the rate of children working in other jobs . Some work without even the most basic protective gear , including shoes or gloves . Many told Human Rights Watch that their employers did not provide drinking water , hand - washing facilities , or toilets . Girls and women in these jobs are exceptionally vulnerable to sexual abuse . As a result of their long working hours , children who do agricultural work drop out of school at four times the national rate . Human Rights Watch interviewed many children who had been held back in school one or more times and who said that no one in their families had graduated from high school . Human Rights Watch called on the US Congress to amend the law governing child labor - the Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) - to end discrimination against child farmworkers . In other occupations , the law prohibits the employment of children under age 14 , and limits children under 16 to three hours of work a day when school is in session . In agriculture , however , children can work on any farm at age 12 , and at any age on a small farm . Unlike for other jobs , the law sets no limit on how early in the morning , how late at night , or how many hours children can work in agriculture , as long as they do not work during school hours . In addition , the law allows 16 and 17- year - olds to work under hazardous conditions in agriculture ; in all other occupations the minimum age for hazardous work is 18 . \" The current child labor law was drafted in the 1930 's when many more children worked on family farms , but that era is long gone , \" Coursen - Neff said . \" It 's time the US updated its antiquated child labor laws to give children who work for hire in agriculture the same protections as all other working children . \" In September 2009 , Congresswoman Lucille Roybal - Allard of California introduced the Children 's Act for Responsible Employment ( HR 3564 ) in the House of Representatives . It has over 80 co-sponsors , and has been endorsed by over 80 organizations , including the AFL - CIO , American Federation of Teachers , NAACP , and United Farm Workers of America . No action has been taken on the bill , however . Even the currently weak laws are poorly enforced . Enforcement of child labor laws overall by the US Department of Labor declined dramatically between 2001 and 2009 . The US Department of Labor found only 36 cases of child labor violations in agriculture in 2009 , constituting only 4 percent of all child labor violations . Pesticide safety regulations of the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) make no special provisions for children . Lax enforcement is exacerbated by workers ' fears of reporting violations to authorities . Some 85 percent of crop workers in the United States are Hispanic . While many child farmworkers are US citizens , their parents may be undocumented or hold short - term agricultural visas , leaving the entire family in fear of deportation . Labor standards and their enforcement apply to all workers , irrespective of their immigration status . Human Rights Watch called on the US Department of Labor to substantially increase its efforts to identify and punish the illegal use of child labor . All states should set or raise the minimum age for agricultural work to at least 14 , Human Rights Watch said . Child labor on US farms also violates the United States 's international legal obligations under the Worst Forms of Child Labor Convention of the International Labor Organization ( ILO ) . In March the ILO Committee of Experts expressed serious concerns regarding the significant number of injuries and fatalities suffered by children in US agriculture , and the exemptions in US law that allow young children to work . The committee called on the United States to take immediate action to comply with its treaty obligations . On May 10 , 2010 , the United States will join over 80 other countries at a global child labor conference hosted by the Dutch government in The Hague . A goal of the conference is better enforcement of the Worst Forms of Child Labor Convention , with a focus on agriculture . \" The United States spends over $ 25 million a year - more than all other countries combined - to eliminate child labor abroad , yet is tolerating exploitative child labor in its own backyard , \" Coursen - Neff said .

The work of James Cook University Marine Biologist , Dr Mark Norman , is proof of that . In over 10 years of researching octopuses , Dr Mark Norman and his team have found more than 150 species of octopuses around the world that no - one knew were there . In fact , he 's doubled the number of known octopuses . Forty - five of them were in Australian waters and what he 's found is startling . MARK NORMAN : It 's not like they 'd be easily missed . Some of them are 3 metre arm spans and 10 kilograms with , you know , suckers the size of golf balls and all that sort of stuff and it was just a case of not looking in the right places at the right time , I suppose . JOHN TAYLOR : He 's found most of these weird critters , as he calls them , in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans , and off Southern Australia . MARK NORMAN : They come in all sorts of shapes and sizes . We 've got pygmies that sit on your finger nail and are fully mature at under one gram . We 've got things with really long , spaghetti-like arms with 2 metre arm spans , like daddy long leg spiders that run around on sand and mud surfaces , and we 've got other ones that drop their arms like drop-tailed lizards , and some are hairy and look like little bushes walking around . I suppose the most amazing thing about octopuses is their capacity to change colour and to change shape , so we 've got ones that can go from dark chocolate brown and dead smooth to be a spiky , cream coloured seaweed to move on and then be a mottled coloured piece of coral . And probably the most exciting animal we 've seen in recent times is one we 've nicknamed the \" mimic octopus \" which is actually mimicking other poisonous animals so it 's impersonating sea snakes and some poisonous flounders and line fish . That 's where we 've been getting some of the interest from film crews . JOHN TAYLOR : Interest indeed . Dr Norman and his work have been the subject now of four international nature films , two of which are due to be released soon . But it is any wonder there 's such interest when the biggest octopus he 's found weighs up to 200 kilograms with an 8 metre arm span . MARK NORMAN : The octopus is probably the sneaky predators and that 's why not many people have had much experience with them . They tend to be either super camouflaged if they 're out during the day or the ones that come out at night just do it all under the cover of darkness . So , we 've been to lots of places where people say oh , I 've lived here 20 years and I 've never seen an octopus and we 'll do a drive under their local pier and see 20 in a dive . So , I think it 's ... their main issue is they have no armour , they have no spikes , they have no skeleton , so they 're basically a meal walking around , sort of a whole pile of meat walking around , so to stop them being eaten by any passing shark or fish they have to be really clever and sneaky and do complex behaviours or mimic things or camouflage or squirt ink or do all sorts of things . So , most people 's experience with octopus is a chewy bit on a pizza or something like that . When you watch these things wandering around in their natural environments , they 're kind of like watching martians wandering around . It 's just a spectacular behaviour . JOHN TAYLOR : Dr Norman says he 's learnt through his long experience there is no such thing as a stereo typical octopus , but one thing that he is increasingly finding puzzling is why the Australian fishing industry has n't cottoned on to the octopuses ' money making potential . MARK NORMAN : Small countries off West Africa export up to 50,000 tonnes of octopus a year , reaping them hundreds of millions of dollars worth of income each year .

Background One Canadian volunteer 's story of training in minor landing craft operations during WW2 . Thousands of landing craft of many different types , broadly categorised as minor and major according to size , were deployed on D Day . To operate these flat bottomed craft , with their challenging sailing characteristics , required a well trained force of Navy personnel . Their primary task was to safely deliver hundreds of thousands of troops and their equipment onto unimproved landing beaches against entrenched enemy positions - a crucial prerequisite to the opening of the long awaited second front in the west . [ Photo ; Kendal Kidder 's war medals and the now inscribed stone he gathered from a Normandy beach nearly 40 years after his first visit . The medals are ( bottom left to right ) : The France and Germany Star ; The Africa Star ; The Italy Star ; The 1939 - 1945 Star ; The Victory Medal ; Canadian Volunteer Service Medal with clasp for Overseas Service and The Defence Medal . ] Kendal Kidder 's light hearted and often humerous account belies the reality of his experiences in North Africa , Sicily , Italy and Normandy . The stone he recovered from a Normandy beach is inscribed Arromanches , NORMANDY , 6 June 1944 , K Kidder , 8 10 1983 ( ? ) . His son , John Kidder recalled , \" Dad picked up the pebble from the beach at Arromanches when we travelled en famille to France in 1983 for my sister 's wedding . It was one of the very few times , perhaps the only time , that I ever saw him cry . \" Over 4,000 landing craft of many types and sizes were required for the invasion of Europe , which became known as D-Day . Every one had a unique role to play . Their design and operating techniques were constantly under review , as feedback from training exercises and operational experience was assimilated . A large training base for minor landing craft training was set up at Inveraray in the west of Scotland . It was named ' The No 1 Combined Training Centre ' , of which HMS Quebec was the naval component . The task was to train the expanding army invasion force with training in the latest amphibious landing techniques , including embarkation and disembarkation onto the landing beaches . The Navy and Royal Marine crews for the landing craft also needed training in seamanship and the operation of the various minor landing craft . There was an acute shortage of Royal Navy manpower for the latter , so Canada provided 60 officers and 300 men for training under the Combined Operations Command , a significant part of which was at Inveraray . The Canadian Navy insisted that the men be kept together as a Canadian unit ' attached Royal Navy ' and not posted individually among Royal Navy Combined Ops personnel . These men worked together throughout the war , forming strong bonds of friendship and loyalty , which continued in the post war years . This is the story of Kendall ' Happy ' Kidder 's training for war , taken from the testimony of his friends and shipmates , his letters to family members and the recollections of his wife Jill . Officer Training It was April 21 , 1941 , when Kendall became Probationary Sub Lieutenant Kidder in the Royal Canadian Navy Volunteer Reserve . His application had , however , not been plain sailing . A rather fussy Navy Recruitment Officer , on learning that Kendall was born in Mogollen , New Mexico , a small mining town where his father had been working at the time , gave him the address of the Air Force recruiting station with the encouraging information that \" they will take anybody . \" However , with a bit of perseverance , he was later assured that his name would be added to the Navy list of those with officer potential on completion of the appropriate form .

The authorities apparently regarded him as a mere landsman , without any seafaring background or experience . So , with a little bit of imagination , some vacation experience in surveying and prospecting up north was transformed into ' extensive experience with small craft in inland waters . ' It worked ! By the fall , Kendall attended the officer training establishment at Royal Roads on Vancouver Island . Recruitment had been stepped up a few gears to meet the demands of both the Canadian and British Navies . There were 125 officers in each intake with an average age of 22 . The training period of about 4 months included navigation , small boat handling , gunnery , seamanship etc . War seemed a long way off until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour on December 7th , 1941 . For a while , rumours abounded that the Japanese were invading the west coast of Canada , resulting in the issue of some .45 rifles ' to repel boarders . ' Hazardous Mission Around this time , Commander Grant called twenty of us into his office . We were all single ; the oldest was thirty . He told us that officers and men were needed for service overseas in what he described as a ' hazardous mission . ' Fourteen volunteers were required from among the officer cadets at Royal Roads . Anyone not interested , for whatever reason , would be excused without any blemish on his record . Two dropped out for family reasons . Slips containing the names of the remainder were placed in a hat and fourteen volunteers were chosen at random . As I understand it , a similar process was carried out at King 's College in Halifax , where another group of sub-lieutenants were taking their training . A total of twenty - eight officers were thus selected , including Kendall . [ Bill Sinclair ] By February 1942 , Kendall was in Halifax , Nova Scotia , awaiting passage to Scotland and an uncertain future .... We arrived here last Saturday night and reported on Sunday morning . I did quite a bit of shopping , bought a new pair of boots and had my old ones fixed , got a new strap for my watch , besides a hundred and one other things . Your Christmas parcel was here when I arrived and it was grand to have a second Christmas . The train ride from Montreal to here is anything but a pleasure and this miserable town is anything but an enticing goal . I have never seen filth to equal it . We have n't as yet been able to find a room or even get a chance to live in barracks , so we are living in a much too expensive hotel . We have n't any idea when we will be leaving but it ca n't come any too quickly to suit me . For the last three days we have been doing PT ( physical training ) for three hours every afternoon , at this point every muscle in my body is very sore and very stiff . My address here is : Nelson Barracks , Fleet Mail Office . [ Kendall Kidder in letter to parents . ] At Halifax , the officers and men from Royal Roads met their counterparts from ' Kings ' and were briefed on what lay ahead . The ' hazardous duty ' , for which the men had volunteered , was Combined Operations , whose primary mission was to plan and train for the invasion of Europe by amphibious landings . This scenario proved accurate when the nature of Kendall 's training became known . Churchill was the prime mover in setting up the Combined Operations Command to ensure the three services worked closely together as a unified force , where inter-service communication and cooperation would be strengthened and inter-service rivalry avoided , thus producing a much more effective invading force . Combined Operations The name could not be better , for although clad in blue and paid by the Senior Service , nearly all the work is with the Army . It is very difficult to tell where the Navy leaves off and the Army takes on . On approaching an opposed beach , the Navy and Army officers together have to decide whether it is advisable to land or not and each thinks of the other 's problems before coming to a decision . Our work entails not only landing Commando and Assault troops but also tanks , guns , heavy lorries , jeeps , ammunition , gas , water , and many supplies . So we deal with every branch of the Army . [ Ian Barclay . ] Training bases for ' minor ' landing craft were set up at Hayling Island on the south coast of England and at Inveraray in Scotland . The first Canadian flotillas joined the RN in January of 1942 . Kendall was posted to HMCS Niobe in Scotland on March 1 , 1942 . It was the main manning and pay depot for the Canadian Navy in the UK .... a gloomy brick building , which had been a mental hospital called the ' Smithston Poorhouse and Asylum ' , known locally as the ' loony bin ! ' [ Map ; The remote location of the No1 Combined Training Centre on Loch Fyne with the many landing beaches identified . ] Landing Craft Training There were many types of landing craft in use but Kendall would be involved with three . Landing Craft Infantry Large ( LCI L ) . Thirty of these boats were entrusted to 850 officers and crew of the RCN . They were 260 feet long with a 24 foot beam . They carried two officers , with a third during the Normandy landings , and a crew of 20 to 25 men . These ships could carry 250 fully armed soldiers , who , if necessary , could be bunked down in two shifts . [ Luke Williams . ] - Landing Craft Assault ( LCA ) . This craft was without a doubt the outstanding one of all assault craft . Extreme length about 41 feet , beam 10 feet 2 inches , draft of 1 foot aft and 9 inches forward . Its maximum carrying capacity was 35 fully equipped men , discharging them by means of a lowered ramp . The LCA at slow speeds was a most silent craft and capable of beaching without giving its position away due to noise . - Landing Craft Mechanised ( LCM ) . These craft were designed to be carried on larger ships and lowered into the sea near the destination . They were used to rush ashore equipment required by the initial assault troops . The carrying capacity 35 tons . - [ Photo ; troops going ashore in an early morning landing exercise on the shores of Loch Fyne . These landing craft was crewed by RNVR personnel attached to Combined Operations . ] The initial drafts from Canada arrived in Scotland and soon were shipped to Hayling Island east of Portsmouth for initial training in the smaller ' landing craft assault ' LCA 's , for about three weeks . Hayling Island had somewhat the same shape as Portsmouth , so , on occasions , lights in the fields were dimly lit to appear much like Portsmouth to the German bomber pilots . This ruse gave Portsmouth some relief from the daily bombing the civilians suffered . Did n't please the farmers of Hayling Island much to become the target . [ Bob Crothers . ] After this initial training , the Canadians were drafted to HMS Quebec near Inveraray on Loch Fyne in Scotland , the main Combined training establishment , where literally hundreds of thousands of Allied troops were trained . The Canadian sailors familiarised themselves with the various landing craft , while training the Army in safely embarking and disembarking onto ' hostile ' shores . This was undertaken mainly on the shores of Loch Fyne under realistic conditions , including simulated air attack by 516 Squadron . [ Photo opposite ; Hurricanes ' attacking ' a landing beach off Furnace on Loch Fyne . ] After HMS Northney on Hayling Island , we entrained for Scotland and took the MacBrayne 's paddle steamer for the tourist trip to HMS Quebec at Inveraray . There were time intervals between basic training and the more serious exercises leading up to major raids and invasions . Before these exercises , there was a pleasantly relaxed time at Quebec with light duties due to recurrent breakdowns and shortage of boats . The elastic discipline of Combined Ops kept the men together at Inveraray . We waited to learn rope tricks and cliff climbing , the threatened characteristics of Commando activity , but found they were not in our job description after all . So Quebec turned out to be a lot less demanding than we had expected . In fact quite the contrary . Time was on our hands . Some of us had tea with the Duke of Argyle , while others used ' Mill 's ' bombs to fish his salmon streams , climb his mountains and explore his deer park land . The light ' casualties ' among his sheep were suspect . Some of us had leave with all the pleasant , exciting , educating experiences of days in the British Isles . But then we were called together . For a while we had our own ships to carry our landing craft about . They were strange creations indeed . HMS Iris and HMS Daffodil were called Landing ships ( stern chutes ) . They could carry thirteen LCA ' s mounted on trolleys . The LCAs were picked up in the stern chute and hauled up onto the main deck and then , by a complicated switching system , made snug on three tracks on the covered deck . The main excitement was launching the craft by pushing them to the chute one by one and watching them race down the track and plunge into the sea , splashing up a great wall of water . Very spectacular but we could n't quite crowd out of our minds the possibility that the LCA 's would just keep on going down to Davy Jone 's locker , though it never happened to us . I dread to think what would have happened if we had to launch in rough weather .. . I believe this method of launching was later abandoned . Our LCA 's were then moored on the Ayrshire coast . We were housed in Jimmy the One huts and tents at HMS Dundonald . The pubs of the harbour were well used . Our camp was surrounded by a barbed wire fence ; some enterprising matelots found them penetrable ... Len Birkenes and others went back and forth through the fence to enjoy Scottish hospitality . The largest exercises were Schuyt 1 and Schuyt 2 manned by Combined Operations . The name picked was that of a class of agreeable small Dutch vessels carrying cargo about the peacetime European coast and waterways . A number had escaped the Nazis and now worked on the British coastline . In conception and organization , these exercises were planting the seed that matured on D-Day . The exercise troops were loaded from the mainland and great excitement was present , since the beaches would be attended by dignitaries including King George VI , Winston Churchill and our new chief , Lord Louis Mountbatten . They had assembled to witness the ' shape of things to come . ' [ A fellow officer . ] The training was perhaps less physically demanding than some officers were led to believe but there were still challenging moments when unfamiliar situations arose . The strange new world of landing craft , tides , currents , cold wind , rain and darkness beckoned those of us who were raw recruits , still getting used to the grub , currency and customs of a new land . In Scotland the heather looked lovely through the early morning mist and sun . We acquainted ourselves with further landing craft and their side effects - wetness , oil , hunger and tiredness . A strong bond was forged among this Combined Operations group of officers and ratings , which still exists today . Officers cried orders in the pitch dark as we trained . ' Keep closed up ! ' or ' Out kedge ! ' and just before hitting the beach , ' Down door ! ' and ' Up door !'. Seamen strained at the cranks on the windlass as the coxswains worked the helm and motors against unfamiliar tides and currents . We were green but learning fast . The seamen , good naturedly , accused the stokers of being seamen with their brains bashed in but those same stokers never let us down and it was sure good to have someone you could count on . No one wanted to be left stranded on the beach , nor were they . This was an unwritten law . [ Seaman Doug Harrison . ] The Canadian stokers are mentioned many times in the annals of Canadian Combined Ops , always with praise . Our craft were the various types of assault boats driven by Diesel and gasoline engines . The Canadian stokers ( mechanics ) were very adapted to this sort of work and received much praise from all those who came in contact with them . Our greatest difficulty was trying to keep them with us as , several senior officers of the Royal Navy thought they should have some of them . [ Ian Barclay . ] There were lighter moments too , as exampled by Kidder 's natural talent for being in the centre of any slightly ' dubious ' activity that was going on . One story , which spawned a number of variants , concerned a docking operation in front of Admiralty House in Inveraray . Kidder 's craft went aground and , without giving it a moment 's thought , he stripped off his clothes ( except cap ) and went overboard to lay a kedge anchor to winch the craft off the obstruction ... as Commodore Coltart and guests , newly returned from a church service , watched in amazement ! Ken was on the carpet next morning but beat the rap when a kindly Aussie pointed out that the buoy marking the shoal was of the wrong type . It was a middle ground buoy , indicating safe passage on either side . Later the story was embellished in the telling . This time the docking manoeuvre took place in front of the WRNS ( women 's navy service ) training establishment . Kidder ordered his men to strip off , jump into the waters below and free the craft ... all in full view of any WRNS ' lucky ' enough to have been watching . However a WRNS officer was not amused and she lodged a complaint about the exposure of her charges to what we would call today the ' full Monty ! ' End of Training May 1942 . I was so glad to get your letter dated April 9 saying that you had received my first letter . It is a relief to know that they actually do get across . I was beginning to think they were on a one way street , because I had received all of yours . I had n't numbered them but , starting with this one as one , I 'll keep track of all I write . We are through with our training now and are working with the army . Our job does n't require much brain work and I feel I could be learning a lot more if I was back in general service at sea but , if we are wanted here , I guess we must make the most of it . In all the time we have been here , over a month and a half , I have n't even had a chance to go to town and I am afraid we are all getting slightly bushed . For the last week or so , we have had a lot of fun exploring an old silver mine that is about a mile from camp . The mine is owned by the Duke of Argyll , who seems to own everything in these parts , the roads are even privately owned . Several went down to see him last Sunday . He is very interested in Canada , because his uncle , Lord Tweedsmuir was Governor - General . When he came back to the estate , Lord Tweedsmuir built a log cabin and planted a large number of silver maples . They are big trees now and the only ones I have seen since I have been over . I am so glad you are sending a parcel . The one thing we miss more than anything else is good Canadian chocolate but there is no need to try to send too much . English cigarettes are horrible and it is virtually impossible to get woollen clothing . We would all enjoy the occasional magazine , just to look at the food ads . [ Kendall Kidder . ] During wartime , the information servicemen could give in their letters home was very restricted . Kendall 's letters do not , for example , describe the nature of the training , precise locations or times . It was only in the post war period that his wartime experiences and his letters could be put into context . Kendall 's Crew They are just about as good a bunch of lads as you could ever hope for . Here are their names and jobs . - \" I'll kill de guy \" Kirkpatrick my stoker . He is an excellent cook and has made some wonderful stews ( from sheep rustled back in the hills ) . Besides being a good cook he is the best barber in the camp . - Tombstone Leavy . He is second cox 'n and one of the best workers in the crew . He catches sheep for the mess . His pet hobby is raising birds , crows , seagulls and pheasant . - Parrot Mitchell my first cox'n . He is from Calais Maine and knows the Rideouts ( Kidder family friends ) . - Lads from the west coast , Francis and Coverdale . They move and think at an amazing pace , like molasses in January . - \" H'ok \" Gallant a French Canadian from Prince Edward Island . One of the best workers and he has the ability to think for himself in a pinch , which is a big help . - The officer in charge . ( Kidder Himself ) . Landing Craft Types Landing Craft . By the time of the Normandy landings , the range of specialised landing craft had increased enormously , in keeping with technological advances and the changing conduct of warfare . The craft were ; LCA - Landing Craft Assault , LCF - Landing Craft Flak ( anti-aircraft use ) , LCG - Landing Craft Gun , LCGm Landing Craft Gun ( medium ) , LCI - Landing Craft Infantry , LCM - Landing Craft Mechanised , LCOCU - Landing Craft Obstacle Clearance Unit , LCP - Landing Craft Personnel , LCRU - Landing Craft Recovery Unit , LCV ( P ) - Landing Craft Vehicle & Personnel ( American equivalent of LCA ) , LCS - Landing Craft Support , LCT - Landing Craft Tank , LCT ( R ) - Landing Craft Tank ( Rocket ) , LSD - Landing Ship Dock , LSG - Landing Ship Gantry , LSI - Landing Ship Infantry , LSP - Landing Ship Personnel , LST - Landing Ship Tank and LVT - Landing Vehicle Tracked ( also known as amphibian ) . [ Photo ; Harry Trenholme and Kendall Kidder inspecting their troop on the deck of the MV Otranto ( ? ) . ] Kendall went on to be involved in the North Africa landings in Nov 1942 , Sicily in July 1943 , Italy in September 1943 and Normandy in June 1944 . In common with many service personnel , Kendall \" Happy \" Kidder 's war was a surreal mixture of periods of inactivity leading to boredom on occasions and with periods of intense activity and danger , where death and destruction were but a heartbeat away . By the end of June 1944 , the Canadian Combined Operations unit was disbanded although the ferrying service across the channel continued into July and August . On Sept 9 , 1944 , Kendall was granted leave and passage to Canada but returned to the UK in December on an entirely new assignment .

Background One Canadian volunteer 's story of training in minor landing craft operations during WW2 . Thousands of landing craft of many different types , broadly categorised as minor and major according to size , were deployed on D Day . To operate these flat bottomed craft , with their challenging sailing characteristics , required a well trained force of Navy personnel . Their primary task was to safely deliver hundreds of thousands of troops and their equipment onto unimproved landing beaches against entrenched enemy positions - a crucial prerequisite to the opening of the long awaited second front in the west . [ Photo ; Kendal Kidder 's war medals and the now inscribed stone he gathered from a Normandy beach nearly 40 years after his first visit . The medals are ( bottom left to right ) : The France and Germany Star ; The Africa Star ; The Italy Star ; The 1939 - 1945 Star ; The Victory Medal ; Canadian Volunteer Service Medal with clasp for Overseas Service and The Defence Medal . ] Kendal Kidder 's light hearted and often humerous account belies the reality of his experiences in North Africa , Sicily , Italy and Normandy . The stone he recovered from a Normandy beach is inscribed Arromanches , NORMANDY , 6 June 1944 , K Kidder , 8 10 1983 ( ? ) . His son , John Kidder recalled , \" Dad picked up the pebble from the beach at Arromanches when we travelled en famille to France in 1983 for my sister 's wedding . It was one of the very few times , perhaps the only time , that I ever saw him cry . \" Over 4,000 landing craft of many types and sizes were required for the invasion of Europe , which became known as D-Day . Every one had a unique role to play . Their design and operating techniques were constantly under review , as feedback from training exercises and operational experience was assimilated . A large training base for minor landing craft training was set up at Inveraray in the west of Scotland . It was named ' The No 1 Combined Training Centre ' , of which HMS Quebec was the naval component . The task was to train the expanding army invasion force with training in the latest amphibious landing techniques , including embarkation and disembarkation onto the landing beaches . The Navy and Royal Marine crews for the landing craft also needed training in seamanship and the operation of the various minor landing craft .

The light ' casualties ' among his sheep were suspect . Some of us had leave with all the pleasant , exciting , educating experiences of days in the British Isles . But then we were called together . For a while we had our own ships to carry our landing craft about . They were strange creations indeed . HMS Iris and HMS Daffodil were called Landing ships ( stern chutes ) . They could carry thirteen LCA ' s mounted on trolleys . The LCAs were picked up in the stern chute and hauled up onto the main deck and then , by a complicated switching system , made snug on three tracks on the covered deck . The main excitement was launching the craft by pushing them to the chute one by one and watching them race down the track and plunge into the sea , splashing up a great wall of water . Very spectacular but we could n't quite crowd out of our minds the possibility that the LCA 's would just keep on going down to Davy Jone 's locker , though it never happened to us . I dread to think what would have happened if we had to launch in rough weather .. . I believe this method of launching was later abandoned . Our LCA 's were then moored on the Ayrshire coast . We were housed in Jimmy the One huts and tents at HMS Dundonald . The pubs of the harbour were well used . Our camp was surrounded by a barbed wire fence ; some enterprising matelots found them penetrable ... Len Birkenes and others went back and forth through the fence to enjoy Scottish hospitality . The largest exercises were Schuyt 1 and Schuyt 2 manned by Combined Operations . The name picked was that of a class of agreeable small Dutch vessels carrying cargo about the peacetime European coast and waterways . A number had escaped the Nazis and now worked on the British coastline . In conception and organization , these exercises were planting the seed that matured on D-Day . The exercise troops were loaded from the mainland and great excitement was present , since the beaches would be attended by dignitaries including King George VI , Winston Churchill and our new chief , Lord Louis Mountbatten . They had assembled to witness the ' shape of things to come . ' [ A fellow officer . ] The training was perhaps less physically demanding than some officers were led to believe but there were still challenging moments when unfamiliar situations arose . The strange new world of landing craft , tides , currents , cold wind , rain and darkness beckoned those of us who were raw recruits , still getting used to the grub , currency and customs of a new land . In Scotland the heather looked lovely through the early morning mist and sun . We acquainted ourselves with further landing craft and their side effects - wetness , oil , hunger and tiredness . A strong bond was forged among this Combined Operations group of officers and ratings , which still exists today . Officers cried orders in the pitch dark as we trained . ' Keep closed up ! ' or ' Out kedge ! ' and just before hitting the beach , ' Down door ! ' and ' Up door !'. Seamen strained at the cranks on the windlass as the coxswains worked the helm and motors against unfamiliar tides and currents . We were green but learning fast . The seamen , good naturedly , accused the stokers of being seamen with their brains bashed in but those same stokers never let us down and it was sure good to have someone you could count on . No one wanted to be left stranded on the beach , nor were they . This was an unwritten law . [ Seaman Doug Harrison . ] The Canadian stokers are mentioned many times in the annals of Canadian Combined Ops , always with praise . Our craft were the various types of assault boats driven by Diesel and gasoline engines . The Canadian stokers ( mechanics ) were very adapted to this sort of work and received much praise from all those who came in contact with them . Our greatest difficulty was trying to keep them with us as , several senior officers of the Royal Navy thought they should have some of them . [ Ian Barclay . ] There were lighter moments too , as exampled by Kidder 's natural talent for being in the centre of any slightly ' dubious ' activity that was going on . One story , which spawned a number of variants , concerned a docking operation in front of Admiralty House in Inveraray . Kidder 's craft went aground and , without giving it a moment 's thought , he stripped off his clothes ( except cap ) and went overboard to lay a kedge anchor to winch the craft off the obstruction ... as Commodore Coltart and guests , newly returned from a church service , watched in amazement ! Ken was on the carpet next morning but beat the rap when a kindly Aussie pointed out that the buoy marking the shoal was of the wrong type . It was a middle ground buoy , indicating safe passage on either side . Later the story was embellished in the telling . This time the docking manoeuvre took place in front of the WRNS ( women 's navy service ) training establishment . Kidder ordered his men to strip off , jump into the waters below and free the craft ... all in full view of any WRNS ' lucky ' enough to have been watching . However a WRNS officer was not amused and she lodged a complaint about the exposure of her charges to what we would call today the ' full Monty ! ' End of Training May 1942 . I was so glad to get your letter dated April 9 saying that you had received my first letter . It is a relief to know that they actually do get across . I was beginning to think they were on a one way street , because I had received all of yours . I had n't numbered them but , starting with this one as one , I 'll keep track of all I write . We are through with our training now and are working with the army . Our job does n't require much brain work and I feel I could be learning a lot more if I was back in general service at sea but , if we are wanted here , I guess we must make the most of it . In all the time we have been here , over a month and a half , I have n't even had a chance to go to town and I am afraid we are all getting slightly bushed . For the last week or so , we have had a lot of fun exploring an old silver mine that is about a mile from camp . The mine is owned by the Duke of Argyll , who seems to own everything in these parts , the roads are even privately owned . Several went down to see him last Sunday . He is very interested in Canada , because his uncle , Lord Tweedsmuir was Governor - General . When he came back to the estate , Lord Tweedsmuir built a log cabin and planted a large number of silver maples . They are big trees now and the only ones I have seen since I have been over . I am so glad you are sending a parcel . The one thing we miss more than anything else is good Canadian chocolate but there is no need to try to send too much . English cigarettes are horrible and it is virtually impossible to get woollen clothing . We would all enjoy the occasional magazine , just to look at the food ads . [ Kendall Kidder . ] During wartime , the information servicemen could give in their letters home was very restricted . Kendall 's letters do not , for example , describe the nature of the training , precise locations or times . It was only in the post war period that his wartime experiences and his letters could be put into context . Kendall 's Crew They are just about as good a bunch of lads as you could ever hope for . Here are their names and jobs . - \" I'll kill de guy \" Kirkpatrick my stoker . He is an excellent cook and has made some wonderful stews ( from sheep rustled back in the hills ) . Besides being a good cook he is the best barber in the camp . - Tombstone Leavy . He is second cox 'n and one of the best workers in the crew . He catches sheep for the mess . His pet hobby is raising birds , crows , seagulls and pheasant . - Parrot Mitchell my first cox'n . He is from Calais Maine and knows the Rideouts ( Kidder family friends ) . - Lads from the west coast , Francis and Coverdale . They move and think at an amazing pace , like molasses in January . - \" H'ok \" Gallant a French Canadian from Prince Edward Island . One of the best workers and he has the ability to think for himself in a pinch , which is a big help . - The officer in charge . ( Kidder Himself ) . Landing Craft Types Landing Craft . By the time of the Normandy landings , the range of specialised landing craft had increased enormously , in keeping with technological advances and the changing conduct of warfare . The craft were ; LCA - Landing Craft Assault , LCF - Landing Craft Flak ( anti-aircraft use ) , LCG - Landing Craft Gun , LCGm Landing Craft Gun ( medium ) , LCI - Landing Craft Infantry , LCM - Landing Craft Mechanised , LCOCU - Landing Craft Obstacle Clearance Unit , LCP - Landing Craft Personnel , LCRU - Landing Craft Recovery Unit , LCV ( P ) - Landing Craft Vehicle & Personnel ( American equivalent of LCA ) , LCS - Landing Craft Support , LCT - Landing Craft Tank , LCT ( R ) - Landing Craft Tank ( Rocket ) , LSD - Landing Ship Dock , LSG - Landing Ship Gantry , LSI - Landing Ship Infantry , LSP - Landing Ship Personnel , LST - Landing Ship Tank and LVT - Landing Vehicle Tracked ( also known as amphibian ) . [ Photo ; Harry Trenholme and Kendall Kidder inspecting their troop on the deck of the MV Otranto ( ? ) . ] Kendall went on to be involved in the North Africa landings in Nov 1942 , Sicily in July 1943 , Italy in September 1943 and Normandy in June 1944 . In common with many service personnel , Kendall \" Happy \" Kidder 's war was a surreal mixture of periods of inactivity leading to boredom on occasions and with periods of intense activity and danger , where death and destruction were but a heartbeat away . By the end of June 1944 , the Canadian Combined Operations unit was disbanded although the ferrying service across the channel continued into July and August . On Sept 9 , 1944 , Kendall was granted leave and passage to Canada but returned to the UK in December on an entirely new assignment . A plaque is fixed to the door of a WW2 building at HMS Quebec ( opposite ) , which now serves as the caravan site reception office .
